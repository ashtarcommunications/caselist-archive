Contention One---Mission Accomplished <br />
<br />
Despite the so-called “official” conclusion to the U.S. combat mission in Iraq, the consequences of our invasion are still acutely felt by millions of Iraqis displaced by the war---the official position says “our war, their problem.”<br />
Walshe 10 – Sadhbh Walshe, columnist for The Guardian and The Irish Times, June 28, 2010, “The US is failing Iraqi refugees,” The Guardian, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jun/28/us-iraqi-refugees" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jun/28/us-iraqi-refugees</a><br />
It's old news now that the US… we cut and run in September.<br />
<br />
Current debates on Iraq foreclose recognition of the consequences of our invasion---we must reframe the discussion towards our obligation to increase admissions <br />
Michael Otterman, 2010 [lead author of “Erasing Iraq: The Human Costs of Carnage.”, America must not neglect Iraq's refugees as US troops withdraw, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/content/view/print/319641" rel="nofollow">http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/print/content/view/print/319641</a>]<br />
Bombs still detonate and… should support Iraqis in need.<br />
<br />
The current pathetically limited quota for Iraqi admissions reflects a colonial ideology whereby we only account for the consequences of our actions on us---as political subjects we should explicitly question the colonial narcissism of refusing contact with the Iraqis affected by our war <br />
Falk 7 – Richard A. Falk, the Albert G. Milbank Professor Emeritus of International Law at Princeton University and Visiting Distinguished Professor in Global and International Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, October 2007, “Would Iraqi Refugees Please Disappear,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/roundtable/2007/panel-c/10-2007/falk-2007b.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/roundtable/2007/panel-c/10-2007/falk-2007b.html</a><br />
I am grateful to Joseph… immense aside from the refugees.<br />
<br />
This narcissistic disregard for the consequences imposed on Iraq creates a collective political delusion that renders the Iraqi people into disposable byproducts of the war <br />
Peteet 7 - Julie Peteet, Professor of Anthropology and Chair of the Anthropology Department at the University of Louisville, Board of Directors of Kentucky Refugee Ministries, Fall 2007, “Unsettling the Categories of Displacement,” Middle East Report #244, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.merip.org/mer/mer244/peteet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.merip.org/mer/mer244/peteet.html</a><br />
An unsettling, if not incredible… considered extremely vulnerable.<br />
<br />
The refusal to think and understand the consequences of the war in Iraq creates an exceptionalist belief in American manifest destiny to control the globe---the impact is limitless, recurring and escalating wars<br />
Burke 5 - Anthony Burke, Professor in the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, July 2005, “Freedom’s Freedom: American Enlightenment and Permanent War,” Social Identities, Vol. 11, No. 4, p. 334-335<br />
In this light, we can see… Muslims in Iraq? (Miller, 1998b)<br />
<br />
Violence and exclusion are often caused by the actions of institutions---which are made up of collections of individuals. We are all socially situated as participants in governing of America and are responsible collectively for the policies enacted in our names. Only an explicitly political stance that begins from our position as institutionally situated actors can address the banality of evil that condemns millions to suffering and death <br />

The United States Federal Government should remove numerical limitations on subgroups seven and eight of fourth preference employment-based visas for Iraqis and remove eligibility requirements associated with employment by the United States government.<br />
<br />
Contention Two---Solvency <br />
<br />
The plan expands the current Special Immigrant Visa program to include all Iraqis---eliminating the current program’s exclusive focus on admitting those who worked for the U.S. broadens our view of the Iraq war to include its consequences for all Iraqis <br />
