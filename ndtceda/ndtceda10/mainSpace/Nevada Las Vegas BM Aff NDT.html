1AC – The Video Game<br />
Observation One is Insert Coin<br />
<br />
Despite the huge popularity of video games, little work has been done on their appeal and effect. Many academics still tend to view video games as toys for kids, rather than as sophisticated vehicles inhabiting and disseminating racial, gender or national meaning. Moreover, a socially conservative agenda that focuses on the psychological links between games and violence further limits academic inquiries into video games to categories of violence and gore.<br />

<br />
Now just over thirty years oldAND situating them in rich social contexts.<br />
But The Notion of the Video Game is not restricted to the Xbox 360. This Proliferation of the Video Game Culture Has Coincided With the Disbursement of Smart Phones like the iPhone, where our primary means of communication also serves an equal role as mode of entertainment. Gaming Today is a Mobile Enterprise Where Users Can Experience the Simulated Experience of Others in Short Spurts and at their Leisure. The Mobile Video Game Has Occupied Our Free Time With the Opportunity to Constantly Experience a Simulated World Outside of Ourselves.<br />
<br />
These Tools Offer a Powerful, Yet Relatively Uninterrogated, Site of Representation That Bombards the Public With Images and Simulated Experiences. This is particularly true in the context of Illegal Immigration.<br />
Slated for release at the end of March, Owlchemy Labs created a game called “Smuggle Truck.” As the name suggests, the goal of the game is to transport persons over the US-Mexico border. Immigrant Rights Groups Protested the Game, Arguing That The Game Undermined Actual Efforts to Cross the Border and Needed to Change Its Focus on the Legal Process of Entering the Country<br />

Responding to critics, Smuggle TruckAND option gave me a good laugh.<br />
Unfortunately, Other iPhone Games Have Ignored Similar Pleas From Activists Despite the Fact That Their Approaches to Illegal Immigration Are Far More Controversial<br />

In fact, game reviewers have adopted this same neutral approach. Prior to Owlchemy’s Alteration to Smuggle Truck the Game was Showcased at an Independent Gaming Festival in Boston. One Reviewer recommends that gamers ignore the controversy because it is conservative propaganda, functionally erasing immigrant rights groups from the conversation. Cortney Zamm writes,<br />

The unique thing about PAX and AND additions to the indie gaming scene.<br />
This prioritization of entertainment places these racist characterizations of nonwhites on the backburner. These companies abdicate themselves of any responsibility by stating that it is their job to entertain and not educate. Unfortunately, These Representations Are Not Neutral depictions of Others but Instead Function as Tools That Construct How People Understand Reality<br />

Put your Boggs card away the political has been taken over by the right, But The Anti-Immigration Movement Has Already Begun to Understand and Shape This Relationship Between Videogames and Reality. Posted on the Homepage of the game titled “Illegal Immigration: A Game,” the creators proclaim Their Contribution to the Virtual Medium the “The best weapon yet devised for the crusade against illegal immigration and amnesty.” They Write,<br />

Game Reviewers Have Responded With Bad Reviews, but much of their criticism derides its poor formatting or general lack of entertainment value. This Type of Analysis of Fails to Interrogate the Way Identity Functions in the Games – The Racial Coding Engenders Stereotypes, Allowing the Player to Passively Reenact Colonial Relationships of the Other<br />
David Leonard assistant professor in the Department of Comparative Ethnic Studies at Washington State University 2003“Live in Your World, Play in Ours”: Race, Video Games, and Consuming the Other Studies in Media &amp; Information Literacy Education, Volume 3, Issue 4 (November 2003), 1–9<br />
<br />
If the 20 th century is AND all present in many video games.<br />
Observation Two is Before Jeff Jarman Comes and Ruins the Fun…<br />
Much Like How a Video Game Offers the Opportunity of Constant Simulation of Different Roles, Narratives and Ideologies, Debate Serves an Almost Identical Function Within Argumentation. These Debates Occur as an enactment of political strategy that Tests the Efficacy of Particularities Within the Resolution. Each round we are given endless lives- sometimes losing and forced to face extinction only to receive a “game over” and start with a new life the next round. Saving the world, overthrowing tyranny and ridding the world of evil are all the objectives of the debater. Just like gamers, we are immersed in a simulated world.<br />
Given the resolution’s failed attempt to deal with the timeliness of immigration, We Think the Ballot Serves as a Critical Space to Examine This Fundamental Lack of Critical Interrogation into this Form of Social Media. Kelly Young’s Pronouncement on CEDA Forums That Treaties Had Won Out as the Official Resolution on the Immigration Topic is Emblematic of Our Criticism.<br />
Although the Statement Was Probably Not Meant Out of Ill Will, it is representative of how a large part of the debate community responded to the selection of the immigration topic. You Would Have to be Utterly Removed From the Debate Community to Not Hear Constant Complaints About the Resolution From Both Debaters and Coaches Alike. Almost Every Judge on the Topic Has Probably Heard some type of justification for a counterplan, criticism, or politics DA that justifies its overall shadyness by saying “there is no uniqueness for any DA on the topic because Immigration is happening now.”<br />
This Disdain to Debate Something so Timely Should Be Alarming. SB 1070 was signed into law April 23. On May 13, Immigration Reform Was Selected as the 2010-2011 Controversy for Collegiate Debate. Immediately Following the Announcement, Scott Phillips Jokingly Requested a Recount. In the discussion that followed, illegal immigration seemed to lose its timeliness, ultimately favoring debates over reforming visa allocation programs.<br />
While this shift was justified both in the original controversy paper and on CEDA Forums as a way to ensure a broad topic that is uninterrupted by the possibility of real world, Federal Government action, it downplays an important distinction. The timeliness of the controversy paper emerged largely from debates about Comprehensive Immigration Reform, which deals with illegal immigration. On the other hand, visa reform deals with legal immigration into the country.<br />
The Idea That the Resolution Includes Illegal Immigration is a Misnomer. In Fact, The Wording of the Resolution and Subsequent Focus on Visa Policy Functionally Excludes Them From the Conversation Because They Go Through a Different Process<br />
Ruth Ellen Wasem, Specialist in Immigration Policy for the Congressional Research Service 2010, Visa Security Policy: Roles of the Departments of State and Homeland Security, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA516405&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA516405&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Aliens who wish to come to AND is entitled to the immigrant status.<br />
As a Result, The Debate Community Has Cast Aside Discussions of Illegal Immigration to the Periphery. Throughout the Season, there are close to three baseline moments when illegal immigration is discussed in debate rounds. First, there are rarely run disads that say that the aff increases illegal immigration or trades off with comprehensive reform. These faded out at the beginning of the year.<br />
Second, there are few instances where critical teams attempt to address illegal immigration, where they are met with a topicality or framework argument where the metatheoretical implications of the aff ultimately overshadow the content of their politics.<br />
Third, and most common, most teams that run politics read evidence that the plan would be percieved in Congress as amnesty or “take our jobs”. This 2NC link magnifier is not nuetral. Not only does it demonstrate the educational value and necessity of debunking these types of discussions, but it also demonstrates how the community has demonstrably justified this sidestepping of one of the most pressing concerns in immigration debates today.<br />
People oppose illegal immigration because they fear it. And they fear it because they do not understand it. This leads to a Process of Collective Forgetting.<br />
You Should Use Your Ballot as a Rejection of This Political Indifference in Both the Video Game Industry and the Debate Community<br />
Video Games Offer a Critical Site of Resistance – Recognizing Their Persuasive Potential as a Means to Dictate Terms of Reality, Our Criticism Allows Us to Reorient Their Evaluation From Entertainment Value to Cultural Implications<br />
