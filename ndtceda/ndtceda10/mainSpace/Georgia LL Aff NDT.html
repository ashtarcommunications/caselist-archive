<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The intrinsic nature of science and technology (S&amp;T) is global and increasingly collaborative with international partners. As a global enterprise, S&amp;T have not only added the commercial value of their innovations to economic growth and development of both the United States and other countries but have also addressed critical research areas in biodiversity and the environment, global climate change and alternative energy sources, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases, international oceans and fisheries, safety in chemical and biological terrorism, nanotechnology, nuclear energy, and medical applications, all of which are inherently transnational. </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">In these areas of advanced research and commercialization, the United States provides the needed global S&amp;T leadership that is driven largely by global market forces and domestic political and economic realities</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. For the United States, the Department of State negotiates and administers government-to-government routine international S&amp;T frameworks or umbrella agreements with other countries. Seven U.S. government departments and technical agencies directly administer over five hundred ongoing S&amp;T agreements. They also manage their own implementing agreements with over fifty countries and more than twenty international organizations and groups of organizations. 1. Who owns the science-related IPRs resulting from publicly funded government owned and operated facilities or from research laboratories operated by public universities such as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory? 2. Should the technology-related IPRs be owned by the private sector even though they are initially developed by government funded joint venture projects? 3. Can we separate science (largely funded by the public sector) from technology (mainly funded by private investment) when mutually inclusive projects yield more innovations? These and other important issues are cited in the National Research Council's book, A Question of Balance. B. Model IPR Annex for International Science and Technology Agreements Since 1990 U.S. government agencies have incorporated the Model IPR Annexes in many international S&amp;T agreements. Some agencies in consultation with the USTR and the Patent and Trade Office, have developed their own flexible approaches to IPR issues. For example, the National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) have their own &quot;preferred texts&quot; to the 1990 IPR Annex. To strengthen S&amp;T capacity, American embassies and other executive departments and technical agencies must continue to monitor partner countries' international S&amp;T activities and programs under the U.S. cooperative agreements and implementing arrangements. The 1987 Executive Order also stipulates the results of overseas S&amp;T research and development activities must be reported to federal agencies, academic institutions, and the private sector through the Science and Technology Reporting Information Dissemination Enhancement (STRIDE) Program. Moreover, U.S. government agencies must engage in more cooperative activities in other developed and developing countries where science and technological talents, facilities, and commitments reside to resolve these global issues. The American involvement in S&amp;T collaborative activities in less developed countries must be pursued through humanitarian, defense, and development assistance programs to address global issues that have a direct link to American national security and international terrorism. A recent bilateral S&amp;T agreement with Bangladesh illustrates an example of evolving asymmetrical strategies to assist friendly countries in capacity building and economic development. 4. By implementing the Agenda 21 of the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 in Brazil and subsequently the World Summit on Sustainable Development of 2002 in Johannesburg in South Africa, the United States helped efforts to create a series of MEAs that will demand transnational solutions in science and technology fields.

Is it wiser to live with the pain and catastrophe, or to change the arbitrary collection of words whose direction produced that pain and catastrophe? Which do you want to live with? What proven reason is there to assume that when doubtfulness that can be constructed in verbal equations conflicts with human physical experience, human physical experience should be considered doubtful? It becomes a matter of choice and pride in intellectual argument. My personal advice is that when verbal contortions lead to chronic confusion and difficulty, better you should stop the verbal contortions rather than continuing to expect the difficulty to change.

3.3. A rights-based approach to migration<br />
3.3.1 Key arguments <br />
The rights-based approach is based on human rights standards and is directed at promoting and protecting human rights. Such an approach integrates the norms, standards and principles of human rights into policies and initiatives. It also values social dialogue as a key instrument in pursuing these objectives, placing importance on both consultation with civil society and the participation of stakeholders. Mainstreaming equality and non-discrimination across all EU policy areas, including immigration is therefore essential. ENAR states: “Policy and decision makers must adopt a holistic and coherent approach to integration and migration and recognise that anti-discrimination and social inclusion are prerequisites for successful integration strategies. “ A rights-based approach to migration that includes anti-discrimination and social inclusion as successful integration strategies at its core is a key mechanism in achieving policy coherence between the migration and integration policy agendas. Applying a rights-based approach to EU migration and integration policy implies explicitly linking these policy areas and setting the achievement of human rights as an objective across the board. In other words, it is essential that EU migration policy move beyond considerations of demographics and economics alone, towards developing a dynamic perspective on migration that allows for mutual benefits of migrant and host communities and views migrants as individuals with rights that are to be valued and protected. The EU has to comply with international standards, including respect for the fundamental rights of third country nationals (regardless of legal status), including equal access to employment, housing, education and health.<br />

In order <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">to unpack cosmopolitanism, we need to make a</span></span>nother <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">important distinction</span></span>, namely that <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">between normative-philosophical and empirical-analytical cosmopolitanism; or</span></span>, to put it differently, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">between the cosmopolitan <em>condition</em> and the cosmopolitan <em>moment</em></span></span>. Up to now, much of the social scientific discourse has assumed the notion of cosmopolitanism as a moral and political standpoint, a shared normative–philosophical commitment to the primacy of world citizenship over all national, religious, cultural, ethnic and other parochial affiliations; added to this is the notion of cosmopolitanism as an attitude or biographical situation in which the cultural contradictions of the world are unequally distributed, not just out there but also at the centre of one's own life. A world of yesterday turned into an utopian future and reclaimed by social thinkers is elevating ‘homelessness’, ‘fluidity’, ‘liquidity’, ‘mobility’ to new heights. ‘Cosmopolitanism’ has a noble ring in a plebeian age, the nobility of a Kant in a postmodern age. This is the kind of cosmopolitanism familiar to philosophers since ancient times, but alien to social scientists. Here, cosmopolitanism is equated with <em>reflexive</em> cosmopolitanism. This idea of cosmopolitanism includes the idea that the self-reflexive global age offers space in which old cosmopolitan ideals could and should be translated and re-configured into concrete social realities and philosophy turned into sociology. Nevertheless, the question has to be asked and answered: <em>Why</em> is there a cosmopolitan moment now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century?<br />
On the other hand the discourse on cosmopolitanism so far has not really paid attention to the fact that, besides the intended, there is an <em>unintended and lived</em> cosmopolitanism and this is of growing importance: the increase in interdependence among social actors across national borders (which can only be observed from the cosmopolitan outlook), whereby the peculiarity exists in the fact that this ‘cosmopolitanization’ occurs as unintended and unseen <em>side-effects</em> of actions which are not intended as ‘cosmopolitan’ in the normative sense. Only under certain circumstances does this latent cosmopolitanization lead to the emergence of global public spheres, global discussion forums, and global regimes concerned with transnational conflicts (‘institutionalized cosmopolitanism’). Summarizing these aspects, we speak of the <em>Cosmopolitan Condition</em> as opposed to the <em>Post-modern Condition</em>.<br />
<em>The cosmopolitan condition</em><br />
<span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">If we make a clear distinction between the actor perspective and the observer perspective</span></span>, both in relation to the national outlook and the cosmopolitan outlook, we end up with four fields in a table representing the possible changes in perspectives and reality. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">It is </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">at least <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conceivable </span>(<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and this needs a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">lot of optimism!</span>) that the shift in outlook from </span>methodological <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nationalism to methodological cosmo</span>politanism <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will gain acceptance</span>. But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this need not have <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">any implications</span> for </span>the prospect for realizing cosmopolitan ideals in</span></span> society and <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">politics</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">. So, if one is an optimist regarding a cosmopolitan turn in the social sciences, one can certainly also be a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">pessimist regarding a cosmopolitan turn in the real world</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It would be <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">ridiculously naïve</span> to think that a change in scientific paradigm might lead to a situation where people, organizations and governments are becoming more open to the ideals of cosmo</span>politanism.</span></span> But again: if this is so why do we need a cosmopolitan outlook for the social sciences? Our answer is: in order to understand the really-existing process of cosmopolitanization of the world.<br />

Is there any good reason from within moral cosmopolitanism to limit immigration into political societies? A morally cosmopolitan view asserts that the fundamental norms of justice that ground the legitimacy and justice of the political communities of modern states are ones that hold for the whole world community. And whether one holds to liberal egalitarian or classical liberal cosmopolitan principles, the initial impulse of cosmopolitans is to assert that political societies do not have a right to limit immigration into political communities. Each person is entitled on these views to equality of opportunity or freedom of movement respectively and thereby is entitled to move into, or avail themselves of the opportunities in, any political society. Hence <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">cosmo</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">politanism <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would</span> appear</span></span>, on its face, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">imply</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">open borders</span> are required by justice</span></span>. [*934] And yet, though we do not know what the consequences of such policies would be, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">many</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">find</span> the prospect of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">such policies to be </span>unsettling or even <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">frightening</span></span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Many</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> citizens of liberal democracies <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are unsettled by</span> even the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">modest immigration flows</span> they see into their societies</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">The reasons </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">for this anxiety <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are</span> presumably <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">many</span></span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">One is fear of loss of control </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">over the community</span></span>, of <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">living in a society of mutually uncomprehending strangers</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Some are concerned that open immigration would leave unfinished the project of bringing social justice to their own society</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Another</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may be</span> simple <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">xenophobia</span></span></span>. The first two of these considerations are legitimate ones, though they may not be decisive; others are illegitimate. What place do these kinds of considerations have within a moral cosmopolitan view?<br />
In this paper, I want to suggest one important way to take the above issues seriously that is consistent with a thoroughgoing cosmopolitanism. The idea develops a consideration that has been discussed, but not sufficiently explored, by some cosmopolitans. n1 It starts from the observation that <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">one can be a moral cosmo</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">politan <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">without being a political </span>cosmopolitan in the sense of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">advocating for a global political community in the </span>near-term <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">future</span></span></span>. To be sure, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">given the role of the political community in establishing justice among persons</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">it seems clear that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in the long term</span></span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">moral cosmopolitans must hope for a global political community</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">In the near-to-medium term</span></span>, however, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">efforts</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to establish a global</span> political <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">community would be <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">quite premature</span> and would</span> probably <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">lead to the</span> kinds of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">oppression</span> and anomie that Kant <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">worried about</span></span></span>. n2 Still, the aspiration to a global political community in the long run and the steps necessary to achieve this aim may give us some guidance as to how to think about the migration of peoples from the point of view of moral cosmopolitanism.<br />
The basic idea of this paper starts from the observation that the modern liberal democratic state represents an essential achievement in the attempts of human beings to realize justice and the common good among themselves. Its achievements are not all we want them to be, and they are limited to the scope of people brought into its jurisdiction. But considering the long and wretched history of human oppression, they are achievements that must attract our respect. Furthermore, the modern democratic state embodies the best hope we have of ultimately bringing justice to the whole of humanity. It is an essential example for global [*935] institutions and the basic building block on which such global institutions can be created. Liberal democratic states are responsible for the modern development of international institutions that protect and regulate international trade, provide for collective security, and aspire to realize some collective goods such as the protection of the environment and the relief of poverty and disease. And international institutions are maintained by such democratic states through their example and practices. My surmise is that these institutions would not last long without the sponsorship of liberal democratic states. This leads me to argue that, insofar as <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the development of global political institutions and ultimately the development of a global political community are essential to the realization of the aims of the moral cosmopolitan</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the modern liberal democratic state must play a central role</span></span>. And to the extent that it is necessary to this development, we must protect such states from forces that would undermine their democratic character and the normal functioning of their political systems. Immigration policy should therefore be in part evaluated in terms of whether it undermines the existence and normal practices of liberal democratic states. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">To the extent that</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">open</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">borders</span> would undermine the existence or normal functioning of liberal democratic states</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">such a policy <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">should be rejected from a cosmopolitan standpoint because</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">it derails the very institutions that give us </span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">some <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hope for </span>realizing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">cosmopolitan justice</span> in the future</span></span></span>.<br />

As Isin and Turner (2007) have recently written:<br />
<span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">A citizen exists originally within the political confines of a state</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">and until a</span></span> genuinely <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">global state exists that has sovereign powers to impose its will</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">it is misleading to talk about the “global citizen</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">.”</span></span>…<span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Citizenship</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">does extend beyond the state but through institutions that cannot be captured by the </span>concept “<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">global citizen</span></span></span>.” (p. 14)<br />
<span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Possibilities for citizenship “beyond the state”</span></span> here do not <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">refer to </span></span>citizenship “above the state” but rather to <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">conceptualizations removed from such “scalar thought</span></span>” (Isin, 2007, p. 211). We shall return to this idea in the conclusion. Here, it is important to note that there are hard political realities to face (Halliday, 2000): even international law and the United Nations are designed, operated, and funded by nation-states. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Global political organizations</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> with any sovereignty or powers of enforcement <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">do not and cannot fully transcend that political order </span>of the nation-state <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nor divorce themselves from it</span></span></span>; <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">if they do</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">they</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; padding: 0in;"> cease to function</span></span>. No state elects to put itself out of business. States only yield to an international body when they are compelled to do so – in which case, they still act in their best interests. The gains in international acceptance and support outweigh the domestic gains in resisting and ignoring international judgment. <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Acting in its own best political interests</span></span>, to secure its greatest chance to survive and thrive<span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, is what the state always seeks to do</span></span> (Krasner, 1999, makes a similar, but more Machiavellian, argument about individual rulers rather than states). To place our faith in such institutions as the UN or the World Court suggests these political institutions could negotiate successfully with the global economic organizations that have successfully territorialized much of the world. While international civil society has successfully assisted in the redistribution of wealth and struggles for justice, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">there is no basis for believing that a global government would defend the marginalized and dispossessed more effectively than existing states</span></span>— especially those elected by their citizens—<span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">presently do</span></span>. Moreover, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the argument implicitly states that the problem</span></span> (the ills wrought by neoliberal globalization) <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">is principally one of scale</span></span>, and that it can successfully be attacked by matching that scale; as Muetzelfeldt and Smith (2002) have noted, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">however</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char1"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">institutions of global governance may frustrate or facilitate civil society action, just like states</span></span>.<br />

Yet, looking at some of the few studies that have grappled with the local politics of immigration, we find that this pattern may not easily carry across jurisdictions. Ellermann, in her comparative work on the politics of deportation (2005, 2006, 2009), argues that the dynamics of immigration control systematically vary over the course of the policy cycle. Whereas, at the national level, the legislation of immigration controls is driven by a “demonizing” and generalizing public discourse that focuses on the control of unwanted migrants and associated behaviors, <u>the politics of street</u><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";">‐</span></u><u>level implementation is often characterized by spontaneous public mobilization based on a “humanizing” discourse which seeks to prevent the implementation of controls</u>. Ellermann argues <u>that once the public comes face to face with the realities of policy enforcement, it is confronted with two realizations. First<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, many migrants do not fit the criminalizing images conjured up by national debates surrounding policy reform</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span><u>Second, the consequences of policy enforcement are harsh.</u> In the words of Matthew Gibney, whose deportation research attests to a similar pattern: “Deportation is a ‘cruel power,’ one that sometimes seems incompatible with the modern liberal state based on respect for human rights. Deportation tears individuals from families and cruelly uproots people from communities where they may have lived for many years, sometimes banishing them to places where they have few ties or connections. It requires the coercive hand of the state on what are often extremely vulnerable men, women and, perhaps most controversially of all, children. The coercion required for deportation may be contested in the courts or on the street. <u>… Grassroots campaigns can turn local schools, neighborhoods and churches into formidable if unlikely sites of resistance to expulsion</u>.” (2008, p. 147) What is important to note here is that these instances of grassroots “case mobilization” (Ellermann, 2005, 2006, 2009) frequently occur in the absence of interest group lobbying. Rather, these <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">pro</span></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";">‐</span></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">immigrant campaigns emanate</span></u> spontaneously <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">from the general public who, </span></u><u>according to national</u><u><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";">‐</span></u><u>level studies<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, should be consistently in favor of stricter immigration controls</span></u>. These findings are supported by Miriam Wells’ work on the grassroots immigration politics in San Francisco. Juxtaposing national and local understandings of civic membership, she writes, “<strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Immigrants’ day</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";">‐</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";">‐</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">day involvement in economic life</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, </span>in religious, educational, and political institutions, and in neighborhood activities […] <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">can generate felt solidarity, responsibilities, and mutual dependencies that themselves become a basis for asserting and securing immigrants’ rights.</span></u> In such contexts, a range of community members, interest groups, and authorities – from employers, unions, and civil rights organizations, to politicians, religious leaders, school administrators, and co<span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif";">‐</span>ethnic legal residents – can come to perceive illegal immigrants as part of the public that the locality is pledged to protect.” (2004, pp. 1314–5) <br />

4.4 Lines of Flight in the Visa Regime<br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">In the aforementioned Ting’s case, the confirmation letter from Ting’s company, which claimed that Ting was going back to China to continue her job after visiting Canada, helped to convince the visa officers that Ting would be a genuine temporary visitor to Canada. In addition to the discursive power of the confirmation letter, which has been discussed in the previous section, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Ting’s story</span></span> also <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">reveals a possibility for the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">visa applicants</span> to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">manipulate their </span>visa application <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">materials</span></span></span>. What actually makes Ting’s confirmation letter acceptable to the visa officers? If we consider what Ting did as <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">an <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">effective way for resistance</span> in the</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> visa application <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">process</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, is there any other leeway for resistance available to the visa applicants? Also, more significantly, does the existence of the possibilities of resistance indicate that </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the visa mechanism is by itself <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">porous</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">? These are the questions I am going to explore in this section. As has been analyzed in section 4.2, the visa examination process is largely based on the Chinese applicants’ identity documents submitted. These documents, derived from institutions such as the Chinese hukou system and various educational and financial institutions in China, represents an “institution-deterministic belief” in the visa examination process. Yet, these institutions issuing the applicants identity documents are external to the visa mechanism, as the Canadian </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">visa offices are not</span></span> themselves <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">capable of</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> recording and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">notarizing</span> the</span></span> visa <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">applicants’ past</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Thus</span></span>, even though the visa officers are the authoritative body to evaluate the applicants’ admissibility, the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">officers have to resort to</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 9pt;">documents</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> issued by other institutions which are beyond their control. The visa application procedure is, other than a unified and centralized system, backed by an institution assemblage – a term coming from Haggerty and Ericson’s (2000) term of surveillance assemblage, which indicates both the function of being surveillant and the structure as an assemblage. The visa mechanism is also surveillant in the sense that it surveys the applicants’ life history and controls their mobility. The term “assemblage” here implicates the way the visa mechanism operates, which is based on the combination of the information from various sources. Haggerty and Ericson (ibid:606) argue that the surveillance assemblage “operates by abstracting human bodies from their territorial settings and separating them into a series of discrete flows. These flows are then reassembled into distinct ‘data doubles’ which can be scrutinized and targeted for intervention”. This description gives a pertinent sketch of the visa mechanism. Originally, the institutions from which the visa applicants’ identity documents are issued, the Chinese hukou system and educational institutions for instance, function not only to generate identities for people, but also to mark the administrative settings within which these identities can be interpreted. </span>However, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in the process of visa application, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the “field effects”</span> of</span></span> these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">institutional identities <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are</span></span></span> somewhat <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">dissolved</span></span>, or borrowing Bogard’s (2006) term, these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">documents are “deterritorialized”</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> from their original</span></span> “territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">settings</span></span>”. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Only</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">literal meanings</span></span> of the institutional identity <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">are captured</span></span> and maintained <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in the paperwork</span></span>, which is in circuit <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">of the visa</span></span> application <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">system</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Subsequently, these</span></span> de-contextualized identity <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">documents</span></span> (the “data doubles” of the original institutional identities) <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">are re-interpreted by</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">visa officers</span></span> in the grammar of “futur anterieur”. This later step is termed by Bogard as the process of “reterritorialization” of the personal data, through which the original identity documents, dislocated from their initial structure, are put in new “territorial” settings for reinterpretation. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">There are <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">possibilities of resistance</span> immanent in this process</span></span> of deterritorialization and reterritorialization in the surveillance assemblage. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">First</span></span>, the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity documents</span></span> of the visa applicants <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">are informationalized</span></span> – that is, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">disrupted from their original contexts</span></span>. The identity documents are <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">converted into information flows</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Different from the constitution of digital databases, which encrypts original materials into digital entries by computer codes, the informationalization of the identity documents in the visa mechanism, however, follows a grammar of encoding which is non-technical but no less powerful. Though this grammar of encoding is not caught in black and white, it is manifested in the visa application practice. As is shown in the previous sections, certificates of kinship, bank statements and certificates of household possession, for example, serve as sources of information for the visa officers to evaluate the visa applicants’ tendency of immigrating to Canada or their likelihood of leaving the country within the authorized time. Official confirmation letters and other records from the schools or workplaces are used as proofs of the visa applicants’ institutional attachment and bonds. However, these identity documents are actually simplified in the visa application procedure, as their institutional background and contexts are not manifested in the paperwork. Thus the original significance and indication of these identity documents is largely shrunk due to the process of informationalization, as these identity documents now become configured information models and indicators to the visa officers. The process of </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">informationalization disrupts</span></span> these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity documents</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> from their territorial settings</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, as well as their originality and uniqueness, substantial forms and contextual contents. As Bogard (2006:108) argues, “[s]urveillance is not just about collecting information, but decoding and recoding it, sorting it, altering it, circulating it, re-playing it”. One good comparison to the informationalization here, which helps explain how </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">it makes lines of flight possible</span></span>, is that <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">when a unique sound is recorded</span></span> in a certain form, on cassette or in digital files for instance, the process of which is comparable to the informationalization of the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity</span></span> documents, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">that sound <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is disrupted</span></span></span> from its originality and context <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">and</span></span> is thus <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">open to reformatting</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, altering and repeating</span></span>, which can hardly be done to the original sound. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Here emerges a line of flight in the surveillance assemblage</span></span>. As the original identity documents are deterritorialized in the process of informationalization, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">there is possibility that</span></span> these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">documents are </span></span>reproduced, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">altered <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and reinterpreted</span></span></span>, which could happen <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in the visa</span></span> application <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">procedure</span></span>. Apart from informationalization, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the “rhizomatic” structure of</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">surveillance</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> assemblage</span></span> also contributes to <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">build in lines of flights in the visa system</span></span>. “Rhizomatic” here refers to the feature of a “rhizome”, in which, borrowing Bogard’s (2006:97) description, every node must connect to every other node in an open structure. The visa mechanism is comparable to the model of “rhizomatic” surveillance assemblage, not only in the sense that it runs on the interactions of a vast network of information institutions, but more essentially, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the visa mechanism bears</span></span> some of the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">significant features of the rhizomatic surveillance assemblage</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">The process</span></span> of deterritorializing and reterritorializing <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">has constituted in the visa system a decentralized and non-hierarchical “information circulation network”</span></span>.

<span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">That's conditional hospitality</span></span>, in a colonial structure <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in which there is a master, there is someone who is the host</span></span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">. As you will recall, the word host means hospes, means the master, sometimes the husband, the male master of the house, and in that case we have conditional hospitality. To which I -- I won't say 'oppose' -- but in contrast to which I try to think pure and unconditional hospitality, the idea of a pure welcoming of the unexpected guest, the unexpected arriving one. From that point of view I would distinguish between the hospitality of the invitation and the hospitality of the visitation. In the invitation, the master remains master at home, chez soi, and the host remains the host and the guest remains the guest, the invited guest -- 'Please, come in, you're invited' -- but of course as invited guest you won't disturb too seriously the order of the house, you're going to speak our language, eat the way we eat ... et cetera et cetera. To this invitation, to this hospitality of invitation, I would oppose -- or not oppose but rather distinguish from it -- the hospitality of visitation. The visitor is not an invited guest, the visitor is the unexpected one who arrives and to whom a pure host should open his house without asking questions such as: who are you? what are you coming for? will you work with us? do you have a passport? do you have a visa? and so on and so forth -- that's unconditional hospitality.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">We have here the same structure as we saw previously between the law and justice. They are absolutely heterogenous but indissociable. I cannot think of a conditional hospitality without having in mind a pure hospitality. I've been giving a seminar for several years on hospitality and we have studied a number of such historical examples of the manner in which a culture of hospitality organises itself. For instance, in pre-Islamic Arabic cultures the idea of hospitality had to do with nomadism, with people being in a tent in the desert, and there were rules: if some traveller lost his way and arrived at the tent, they should receive him for three days, offering him food and bed and so on and so forth, but after three days, that was the end. That was conditional hospitality and there is a language adjusted to these situations.</span><br />
<span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">But to think of this conditional hospitality one has to have in mind what would be a pure hospitality to the messianic Other</span></span>, the unexpected one who just lands in my country and to whom I simply say: come and eat and sleep and I won't ask even your name -- which is another sort of violence, one of the many contradictions -- because in principle if I want to pay attention to the Other and to respect the Other, I should speak to the Other, I should address the Other. Asking 'what is your name?' is not necessarily an investigation, an interrogation: &quot;Tell me your name&quot;. There are many ways of asking the name of the Other. One is the manner of the police and immigration when they ask 'show me your passport', 'what are you doing?' 'what will you be doing in this country?' and so on. The Other is simply 'who are you?'. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">You see here the two poles of the conditional and unconditional hospitality, the just and the legal hospitality</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">And I would say once more that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">unconditional hospitality is impossible</span></span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">because it is impossible to decide and to make a rule out of it</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">to decide that as a rule I'm going to open</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> my house or open my nation</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">my country</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to anyone </span>coming for I don't know what reason</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">It's impossible to make that decision and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">people who say 'we'll do that' are certainly lying</span></span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">It's impossible</span></span>, but that's what hospitality should <span style="font-size: 5pt;">be, in principle.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Now, to come back to one of your most difficult questions: what room is left for a politics of hospitality in that case, for perfectibility? If I want to improve the laws -- and this is a very concrete problem for everyone in the world today, and especially in Europe and in France -- how can we improve the situation? For instance, France has been recently, and for decades, betraying laws on political asylum, practicing a politics of immigration which is untrue to its own principle and so on and so forth. So we have to change the law, improve the law, and there is an infinite progress to be performed, to be achieved in that respect. I love the process of perfectibility, because it is marked by the context of the eighteenth century, the Aufklärung. It is often the case that people would like to oppose this period of deconstruction to the Enlightenment. No, I am for the Enlightenment, I'm for progress, I'm a 'progressist'. I think the law is perfectible and we can improve the law. We have to improve the conditions of conditional hospitality, we can change, we should change the laws on immigration, as far as possible, given a certain number of constraints.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 5pt;">For instance, in France -- let me take this example to be less speculative and theoretical -- some people, including me, have signed a petition saying that, in certain conditions, we were ready to shelter in our houses people who were considered illegal immigrants in France. We say, well, we are going to violate the law, to practice civil disobedience because we find the way that the government today applies the law is outrageous, but we are not simply doing this irresponsibly. The Minister of the Interior at the time said: these intellectuals are irresponsible, they are irresponsible because they want simply to open the gates and let everyone into the country, and then you will see what happens. No, we didn't say that. We were not advocating an unconditional hospitality. We said that there is today a law, for instance embodied in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, there is a law which is higher than the French legal system, than the way it is currently applied. And it's in the name of this law, of this legality, that we oppose the current interpretation of the law by the French government. So it was not in the name of pure hospitality that we did so, but in the name of a perfectible law. We wanted the law to be changed and in fact, to some extent, it has been changed. It has been changed, but not enough. Of course we were not charged. I myself, for instance, could hide some such immigrants, and they couldn't sue me. The government had to change, to some extent -- not enough, but to some extent -- its policy, its practice. So in that case we considered that the law was perfectible, that we had to improve the law, without claiming that the unconditional hospitality should become the official policy of the government.</span><br />
<span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">We are not dreamers</span></span>, from that point of view, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">we know that today <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">no government, no nation state</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will simply open the borders</span>, and in good faith we know that we don't do that ourselves</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">We would not simply leave the house with no doors, no keys and so on and so forth. We protect ourselves, OK?</span></span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Who could deny this in good faith? But we have the desire for this perfectibility, and this desire is regulated by the infinite pole of pure hospitality. If we have a concept of conditional hospitality, it's because we have also the idea of a pure hospitality, of unconditional hospitality. The same goes for forgiveness. This resembles but is not identical with Kant's notion of a regulative idea: that is, there is an endless inadequation between the conditional and the unconditional, and there is this regulative idea ... an inaccessible law. In fact, it's here and now that we have to try to think and to embody what unconditional hospitality should be. There is this intention and if we cannot conform to this injunction, and we cannot, obviously we cannot, its impossible, it's impossible as a rule....</span><br />
Let me try and make this more specific. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">It's impossible as a rule, I cannot regularly organise unconditional hospitality, and that's why, as a rule</span></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">, I have a bad conscience, I cannot have a good conscience because I know that I lock my door, and that a number of people who would like to share my house, my apartment, my nation, my money, my land and so on and so forth. I say not as a rule, but sometimes, exceptionally, it may happen. I cannot regulate, control or determine these moments, but it may happen, just as an act of forgiveness, some forgiveness may happen, pure forgiveness may happen. I cannot make a determinate, a determining judgement and say: 'this is pure forgiveness', or 'this is pure hospitality', as an act of knowledge, there is no adequate act of determining judgement. That's why the realm of action, of practical reason, is absolutely heterogenous to theory and theoretical judgements here, but it may happen without even my knowing it, my being conscious of it, or my having rules for its establishment. Unconditional hospitality can't be an establishment, but it may happen as a miracle ... in an instant, not lasting more than an instant, it may happen. This is the ... possible happening of something impossible which makes us think what hospitality, or forgiveness, or gift might be.</span><br />

<span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Unconditional hospitality is a risk</span></span>, but hospitality without risk usually hides more serious violence. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">A perfectly gracious and generous host may be capitalizing on dark shadows</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">on ghosts that haunt his land</span></span>, his house, his social position: <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">closing the door </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">on supposedly undesirable strangers <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is</span> clearly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">inhospitable</span></span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">but an open-door policy may be the different side of the same coin</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">if the host forgets about the condition that constructed </span>him or her as <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a</span> potential <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">host</span></span></span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">The repressed may be that the land was here before the host, that recent wars and spoliation may have legitimized current forms of ownership. It is not that a colonizer cannot be a host, and a generous host at such, au contraire. The colonizer will practically be structured as the obvious host: if recent settlers are empowered (by the granting of land, a cultivated sense of being the first to till the soil despite obvious signs to the contrary), they may have a strong desire to welcome other even more recent settlers, people of their own class, origin, nationality. But increased hospitality to &quot;their own&quot; kind is based on the fundamental exclusion of how the land came to be owned. We could say that the powerful and secure host tends to forget that what he gives was taken from somebody else. Less dramatically, when political borders have been stable for so long that no living expropriated subject can resent the host's occupation of the land, we could describe the host's graciousness and generosity as part of a cultural legacy that includes a whole series of practices taught by well-bred mothers, well educated fathers, hospitable relatives, and extended families or neighbors.</span><br />
Naturally, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">if perfectly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">peaceful moments of </span>shared <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hospitality</span> sometimes <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hide ugly structures of larger inhospitality</span></span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">they also coexist with other forms of dissident hospitality</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Hospitality then goes underground</span></span>, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">becomes a form of resistance </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">where a subject deliberately chooses to occupy the position of host that the system denies him or her</span></span>. From the point of the view of the authorities, that type of host is often dismissed and accused of being a parasite, like the Town Rat who chooses to invite his cousin even though the meal he has to offer consists of leftovers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Each context requires a careful rethinking of who is free to give, to receive, and of who has enough power to define freedom. At times, different subjects will have different expectations about what is more or less accept¬able. Marius Alliod notes that in the eighteenth century, enlightened think¬ers were outraged by the fact that, when they were destitute, ill, or old, the poor were often forced to choose between survival and liberty, and that in having to &quot;ask the rector of the Hotel-Dieu to grant them unconditional hospitality,&quot; they were obliged to &quot;trade their freedom for a few crumbs.&quot; Becoming a guest of the Hotel-Dieu amounted to accepting a life sentence, because &quot;unconditional' meant that those whose request had been granted would never be expelled from the Hotel-Dieu. The regulations required that they stay there until their deaths, and they took a written oath to do so upon their admission&quot; (Alliod 1999, 56).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">No wonder eighteenth-century philosophers found the principle ques-tionable: it is easy to interpret this type of contract as a betrayal of the law of hospitality. Pretending that the poor were guests was a cruel irony. Alliod, however, feels the need to point out that it may be hasty to conclude that the guests themselves viewed this scenario as a form of abusive hospitality, &quot;For we know nothing of their experience, and we don't know whether they thought of themselves as prisoners when they were in the rector's care, after signing their wills&quot; (ibid., 57). If historians admit that they will never know, it might be up to writers of fiction to stage this dilemma and to try to bring home to the modern reader the type of hesitation that such issues generate. Fiction can also introduce the possibility of dissident narratives and invite us to conceptualize oppositional practices of hospitality.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">When the host reigns supreme over the land, illegal and rival hosts may surface, and they double the risk involved in hospitality. Like any host, they have to accept that the guest may be dangerous to them, but they are also challenging the powerful supra host that keeps them in the shadow. The supra host can be the nation or a representative of the nation's authority, a father, or the prince's palace, where servants and masters cohabit, harmo¬niously, the master would say, tragically, from the servants' point of view. In Moufida Tlatli's 1994 film Samt al-qusur (The Silences of the Palace), the fe¬male domestics are quasi-owned by the residents of the palace. Occasionally treated as if they were guests when they are too young to be perceived as sexual temptations, the women live in a space that they occupy without hav¬ing any rights to it. They are toys rather than guests. But this does not stop them from allowing a stranger to stay with them in their quarters. The guest they (reluctantly) invite will put them in terrible danger if discovered: he is involved in the struggle against colonialism, against the French presence in Tunisia, and also against the duplicitous attitude of the Tunisian authorities. His secret presence within the palace symbolizes what had to be excluded from this self-contained universe in which one grand reception follows an¬other. The servants manage, in spite of everything, to institute some disrup¬tion of the host-guest encoding, to introduce some exteriority into the system, the possibility of future exchanges. Here, the refugee is the materialization of the ghost that haunts any place where the roles of hosts and guests are rigidly assigned by power differentials.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">Of course, the assignment of rigid roles to social actors is not the only way of introducing violence into the equation of hospitality. We have seen that even if the guest and the host can exchange places</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">their mutual encounter </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">must <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">always situate itself on the course of a pendulum that swings </span>wildly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">between generosity and cannibalism</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the continuum</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> between generosity and cannibalism always <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">threatens to turn hospitable practices into potentially harmful encounters</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Two dark scenarios always lurk between the provisional definition of two subjects as guest and host: </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the host can always devour the guest</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the guest can always devour the host</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">As we have seen, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">devouring can be a metaphor for assimilation</span>, for exploitation, or for sexual abuse</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Hospitality is always precariously poised between those two evils</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">At the same time, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">if the guest and the host are not willing to take that risk and do not welcome the possibility of being challenged</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, shaken, changed by the encounter, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">then there is no hospitality either</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">The very precondition of hospitality may require that, in some ways, both the host and the guest accept</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in different ways, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the uncomfortable and sometimes painful possibility of being changed by the other</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Some degree of mutual metamorphosis, brought about by the presence of the other, of his or her different values or points of view, will undoubtedly constitute the by-product and the visible evidence of hospitable gestures. Perhaps, then, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">it is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the paradoxical nature of conditional and unconditional hospitality </span>alike to be a practice that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">cannot tolerate perfection</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">that is inherently perverse, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">always and eminently corruptible</span></span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">.</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">It constantly tests the host's and the guest's thresholds of fear</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, and their willingness to live with that fear, and with their malaise</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

This is the paradoxical dimension of the gift. The sender of the gift, instead of giving, receives; and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the receiver of the gift</span></span></span>, instead of receiving something, <span class="Style1Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">is in debt</span></span> (Caputo, 1997). <span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">To avoid mobilizing the circular economy of the gift</span></span> (the circle of exchange, of reciprocation, and of reappropriation), <span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the gift must not appear as such</span></span>. Thus, the giver must not be aware that he or she is giving, and the receiver must not be aware that he or she is receiving. Only under those circumstances would the giver not fuel the fire of narcissistic generosity, and the receiver not assume a debt. As Caputo (1997) notes, the pure gift “could take place only if everything happened below the level of conscious intentionality, where no one intends to give anything to anyone and no one is intentionally conscious of receiving anything” (p. 147).</span><br />

This brings us to the most important question that follows from the recent resurgence of utopian visions: what is wrong with hope? Why should we deny dreamers the consolation of their fantasies? Is not the capacity to imagine a different and better world the most important component of our ability to change the world for the better? And does it not follow that denying the possibility of imagining a radically different future might result in a crippling of the capacities to criticize present institutional injustices and dysfunctions and to create better institutions and forms of governance? There is a relatively simple answer to this: <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">hope for the future goes astray when</span></span>ever it is <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">built upon a mistaken understanding of present conditions</span></span>; and there is no definitive way to correct its errors. The utopian imagination is by its very nature free to elaborate radically different-from-the-present visions of a yet-to-be-realized society, founded on misleading, irrational understandings of the present circumstances or propensities of human social life. There is a sense in which <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">utopianism</span></span>, when tolerated as a form of intellectual discourse, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">can</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; padding: 0in;">wreak havoc</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> on </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">recognized forms of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">critical etiquette</span></span></span>.

Recognising these negative forces in politics gives us a reason to tolerate them - they are as important to the human experience as commitments to equality, liberty and justice - and this makes recog­nition and engagement unavoidable. Understanding, interaction, dialogue and a recognition of human weakness, as well as heroism, are essential to a worldliness recognising the space in-between human beings, their communities and institutions as the site of politics. Territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders</span></span> potentially <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">play a role in establishing</span></span> these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in-betweens</span></span>, not because they divide sovereignties, with the state being the place where equality, liberty and justice can flourish, but <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">because they are a part of the pluralism of human communities</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">There is a <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">need for division and distinction between communities</span>, and this can take</span></span>, and frequently has taken, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">a territorial form</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">This</span></span> territorial form <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">does not have to be via exclusive sovereignty</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, but this has proven to be a durable and attractive mechanism, and, despite the</span></span> undoubted <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">costs that cosmopolitan critics</span></span> are quick to <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">highlight, such</span></span> durability and attractiveness <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">ought not to be dismissed out of hand</span></span>. Additionally, territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders play a role in limiting politics</span></span>, too, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">and this is</span></span> an important part of any political theory and <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">a vital question of</span></span> political <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">ethics</span></span>. Given Arendt's central concern with totalitari­anism it is no surprise that she was deeply concerned with limits in politics, stemming in part from her claim that civilisation is neither inevitable, or even terribly secure in the face of human hubris and the tendency of human introduced trends to run out of control.' Territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders</span></span> as elements of community and <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">as ways of dividing and dissipating institutional power,</span></span> whilst accepting the difficulty of maintaining clear, definitional lines in an unpredictable and dynamic human political environment, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">respond to the challenge of political geography</span></span>. It also, though, responds to the challenge of international political theory's concern with the ethical and the normative. We can retain a recognition of the pluralist argument that territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">divide political and military might</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">helping</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">resist totalising imperial projects</span> that threaten the order of interna­tional society</span></span>, but go further than this, too. In particular, Arendt saw territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders</span></span> as helping to <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">establish limits that can <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">rob totalitar­ianism of its dynamism</span> and undermine its political tactic of 'permanent revolution' through which it is able to galvanise support</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">sweeping away prior</span></span></span> political <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">forms</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, engendering the 'loneliness' that, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">before</span></span></span> physical <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; padding: 0in;">extermination</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">robs individuals of</span></span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">political location</span></span> that makes them properly human.' However, territorial borders must be a part of the unpredictable, evolutionary political dynamic that can only come about through real communities, changing to reflect the developments of these communities. To the extent that territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders have provided an institutional focus for the accretion of rules on violence in interna­tional politics</span></span> they ought also to receive ethical endorsement. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">The wielding of violent military might</span></span> is the single greatest threat to Arendt's conception of politics, hence, perhaps, her disregard of an international relations that, in her lifetime, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">had been dominated by the</span></span> military might of the Third Reich and of the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">nuclear stand-off</span></span> of the Cold War. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Violence</span></span>, Arendt argued, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">is <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">politically null</span></span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, even anti-political, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">crushing the</span></span></span> properly <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; padding: 0in;">political space</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> of the in-between and <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">rendering meaningless</span></span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; padding: 0in;">virtues</span></span> of promising and forgiveness.' Territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders can therefore help to hold open discursive space by providing a location around which controls can grow, giving them a spatial focus and location that also appeals to the historically well-entrenched practice of communities identifying themselves in territorial ways</span></span> to at least some extent. It may possibly be the case that the development of globalisation will eventually result in a transformation so extensive that this historical pattern of territorialising community is broken. However, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the prospect of a wholly </span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">supraterritorial <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">global society seems remote and the role of</span></span></span> territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">borders</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> as constitutive of important human communities <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">rooted in</span></span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">plurality</span></span> of individuals, their social <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">need for belonging and</span></span> their <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">political</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">need for recognition </span>and status <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">looks likely to continue</span></span></span>. This does not preclude 'post-Westphalian', or neo-medieval political orders, or require a hard-line attachment to the notion of sovereignty that resulted from de-colonisation. Partially detaching territorial borders from sovereignty recreates the possibility of thinking about them as important social institutions in their own right and thus enabling an exploration of the ethics that are entangled in the choices that we can make about the role and status of territorial borders, and not just the question of where they should be drawn or what security functions they should fulfil.' <br />

If this is the case, then the deconstructive move that gains some of its weight by contrasting itself to a non- or apolitical objectivism must engage with the more complex contrast to a sceptical Realist tradition that is itself a constructed, ethical practice. This issue becomes even more acute if one considers Iver Neumann’s incisive questions concerning postmodern constructions of identity. action, and responsibility. As Neumann points out, the insight that identities are inescapably contingent and relationally constructed, and even the claim that identities are inescapably indebted to otherness, do not in themselves provide a foundation for practice, particularly <span class="Style11ptUnderline">in situations where identities are ‘sedimented’</span><span class="Style11pt"> and conflictually defined. In these cases, </span><span class="Style11ptUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">deconstruction</span> alone <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will not suffice unless it can </span>demonstrate a capacity to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">counter</span> in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">practice</span></span><span class="Style11pt"> (and not just in philosophic practice) </span><span class="Style11ptUnderline">the essentialist dynamics it confronts. Here, a responsibility to act must go beyond deconstruction</span> to consider viable alternatives and counter-practices. To take this critique seriously is not necessarily to be subject yet again to the straightforward ‘blackmail of the Enlightenment’ and a narrow ‘modernist’ vision of responsibility.85 While an unwillingness to move beyond a deconstructive ethic of responsibility to otherness for <span class="Style11ptUnderline">fear that an essentialist stance is the</span><span class="Style11pt"> only (or most </span><span class="Style11ptUnderline">likely) alternative</span><span class="Style11pt"> expresses a legitimate concern, it </span><span class="Style11ptUnderline">should not license a retreat from such questions</span><span class="Style11pt"> or their practical demands. Rather, </span><span class="Style11ptUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">such situations demand</span></span><span class="Style11pt"> also </span><span class="Style11ptUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">an evaluation of the</span></span> structures<span class="Style11pt"> (of </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity</span></span><span class="Style11pt"> and institutions) </span><span class="Style11ptUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that might viably be mobilised in order to <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">offset the worst implications of violently exclusionary identities</span></span></span><span class="Style11pt">. </span>It requires, as Neumann nicely puts it, the generation of compelling ‘as if’ stories around which counter-subjectivities and political practices can coalesce. Wilful Realism, I submit, arises out of an appreciation of these issues, and comprises an attempt to craft precisely such ‘stories’ within a broader intellectual and sociological analysis of their conditions of production, possibilities of success, and likely consequences. The question is, to what extent are these limits capable of success, and to what extent might they be limits upon their own aspirations toward responsibility? These are crucial questions, but they will not be addressed by retreating yet again into further reversals of the same old dichotomies.<br />

4.4 Lines of Flight in the Visa Regime<br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">In the aforementioned Ting’s case, the confirmation letter from Ting’s company, which claimed that Ting was going back to China to continue her job after visiting Canada, helped to convince the visa officers that Ting would be a genuine temporary visitor to Canada. In addition to the discursive power of the confirmation letter, which has been discussed in the previous section, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Ting’s story</span></span> also <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">reveals a possibility for the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">visa applicants</span> to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">manipulate their </span>visa application <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">materials</span></span></span>. What actually makes Ting’s confirmation letter acceptable to the visa officers? If we consider what Ting did as <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">an <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">effective way for resistance</span> in the</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> visa application <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">process</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, is there any other leeway for resistance available to the visa applicants? Also, more significantly, does the existence of the possibilities of resistance indicate that </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the visa mechanism is by itself <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">porous</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">? These are the questions I am going to explore in this section. As has been analyzed in section 4.2, the visa examination process is largely based on the Chinese applicants’ identity documents submitted. These documents, derived from institutions such as the Chinese hukou system and various educational and financial institutions in China, represents an “institution-deterministic belief” in the visa examination process. Yet, these institutions issuing the applicants identity documents are external to the visa mechanism, as the Canadian </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">visa offices are not</span></span> themselves <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">capable of</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> recording and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">notarizing</span> the</span></span> visa <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">applicants’ past</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Thus</span></span>, even though the visa officers are the authoritative body to evaluate the applicants’ admissibility, the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">officers have to resort to</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 9pt;">documents</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> issued by other institutions which are beyond their control. The visa application procedure is, other than a unified and centralized system, backed by an institution assemblage – a term coming from Haggerty and Ericson’s (2000) term of surveillance assemblage, which indicates both the function of being surveillant and the structure as an assemblage. The visa mechanism is also surveillant in the sense that it surveys the applicants’ life history and controls their mobility. The term “assemblage” here implicates the way the visa mechanism operates, which is based on the combination of the information from various sources. Haggerty and Ericson (ibid:606) argue that the surveillance assemblage “operates by abstracting human bodies from their territorial settings and separating them into a series of discrete flows. These flows are then reassembled into distinct ‘data doubles’ which can be scrutinized and targeted for intervention”. This description gives a pertinent sketch of the visa mechanism. Originally, the institutions from which the visa applicants’ identity documents are issued, the Chinese hukou system and educational institutions for instance, function not only to generate identities for people, but also to mark the administrative settings within which these identities can be interpreted. </span>However, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in the process of visa application, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the “field effects”</span> of</span></span> these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">institutional identities <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are</span></span></span> somewhat <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">dissolved</span></span>, or borrowing Bogard’s (2006) term, these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">documents are “deterritorialized”</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> from their original</span></span> “territorial <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">settings</span></span>”. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Only</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">literal meanings</span></span> of the institutional identity <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">are captured</span></span> and maintained <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in the paperwork</span></span>, which is in circuit <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">of the visa</span></span> application <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">system</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Subsequently, these</span></span> de-contextualized identity <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">documents</span></span> (the “data doubles” of the original institutional identities) <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">are re-interpreted by</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">visa officers</span></span> in the grammar of “futur anterieur”. This later step is termed by Bogard as the process of “reterritorialization” of the personal data, through which the original identity documents, dislocated from their initial structure, are put in new “territorial” settings for reinterpretation. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">There are <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">possibilities of resistance</span> immanent in this process</span></span> of deterritorialization and reterritorialization in the surveillance assemblage. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">First</span></span>, the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity documents</span></span> of the visa applicants <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">are informationalized</span></span> – that is, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">disrupted from their original contexts</span></span>. The identity documents are <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">converted into information flows</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Different from the constitution of digital databases, which encrypts original materials into digital entries by computer codes, the informationalization of the identity documents in the visa mechanism, however, follows a grammar of encoding which is non-technical but no less powerful. Though this grammar of encoding is not caught in black and white, it is manifested in the visa application practice. As is shown in the previous sections, certificates of kinship, bank statements and certificates of household possession, for example, serve as sources of information for the visa officers to evaluate the visa applicants’ tendency of immigrating to Canada or their likelihood of leaving the country within the authorized time. Official confirmation letters and other records from the schools or workplaces are used as proofs of the visa applicants’ institutional attachment and bonds. However, these identity documents are actually simplified in the visa application procedure, as their institutional background and contexts are not manifested in the paperwork. Thus the original significance and indication of these identity documents is largely shrunk due to the process of informationalization, as these identity documents now become configured information models and indicators to the visa officers. The process of </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">informationalization disrupts</span></span> these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity documents</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> from their territorial settings</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, as well as their originality and uniqueness, substantial forms and contextual contents. As Bogard (2006:108) argues, “[s]urveillance is not just about collecting information, but decoding and recoding it, sorting it, altering it, circulating it, re-playing it”. One good comparison to the informationalization here, which helps explain how </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">it makes lines of flight possible</span></span>, is that <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">when a unique sound is recorded</span></span> in a certain form, on cassette or in digital files for instance, the process of which is comparable to the informationalization of the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">identity</span></span> documents, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">that sound <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is disrupted</span></span></span> from its originality and context <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">and</span></span> is thus <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">open to reformatting</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">, altering and repeating</span></span>, which can hardly be done to the original sound. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Here emerges a line of flight in the surveillance assemblage</span></span>. As the original identity documents are deterritorialized in the process of informationalization, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">there is possibility that</span></span> these <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">documents are </span></span>reproduced, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">altered <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and reinterpreted</span></span></span>, which could happen <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">in the visa</span></span> application <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">procedure</span></span>. Apart from informationalization, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the “rhizomatic” structure of</span></span> the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">surveillance assemblage</span></span> also contributes to <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">build in lines of flights in the visa system</span></span>. “Rhizomatic” here refers to the feature of a “rhizome”, in which, borrowing Bogard’s (2006:97) description, every node must connect to every other node in an open structure. The visa mechanism is comparable to the model of “rhizomatic” surveillance assemblage, not only in the sense that it runs on the interactions of a vast network of information institutions, but more essentially, <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">the visa mechanism bears</span></span> some of the <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">significant features of the rhizomatic surveillance assemblage</span></span>. <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">The process</span></span> of deterritorializing and reterritorializing <span class="Heading3Char"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">has constituted in the visa system a decentralized and non-hierarchical “information circulation network”</span></span>.

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system.

For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not only on the goodwill of peoples but also on American power. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War II would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Europe ’s stability depends on the</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; padding: 0in;">U</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">nited </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; padding: 0in;">S</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">tates could step in </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">to check any dangerous development</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> on the continent.

People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that ’s not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world ’s great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. </span><span class="Heading3Char"><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">War could erupt between</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> <strong>China</strong> <strong>and Taiwan</strong></span></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">and draw in both the United States and Japan.

This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China ’s neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">American withdrawal could unleash a</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">n ambitious, independent, </span><span class="Heading3Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">nationalist Japan</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">.

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-weight: normal;">Foucault is </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">certainly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">right to say </span>that the conventional <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">truths </span>of morality, law, medicine, and psychiatry <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are implicated in </span>the exercise of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">power</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">; that is a fact too easily forgotten by conventionally detached scientists, social scientists, and even philosophers. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-weight: normal;">But those </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">same <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">truths also regulate </span>the exercise of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">power. They set limits on what can </span>rightly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">be done, and</span> they <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">give shape </span>and conviction <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to </span>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">arguments </span>the prisoners make. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The limits are important, even if </span>they are in some sense <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">arbitrary</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. They aren’t entirely arbitrary, however, insofar as they are intrinsic to the particular disciplines (in both senses of the word). It is the truths of jurisprudence and penology, for example, that distinguish punishment from preventive detention. It is the truths of psychiatry that distinguish the internment of madmen from the internment of political dissidents. And it is the commitment to truth itself, even if it is only local truth, that distinguishes the education of citizens from ideological drill. A liberal or social democratic state is one that maintains the limits of its constituent disciplines and disciplinary institutions and that enforces their intrinsic principles. Authoritarian and totalitarian states, by contrast, override those limits, turning education into indoctrination, punishment into repression, asylums into prisons, and prisons into concentration camps. These are crude definitions, but they can easily be elaborated or amended. They indicate, in any case, the enormous importance of the political regime, the sovereign state. For the state is the agency through which society acts upon itself, It is the state that establishes the general framework within which all other disciplinary institutions operate. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">It is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the state </span>that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">holds open or radically shuts down </span>the possibility of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">local resistance</span>.* The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">agents </span>of every Disciplinary institution <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">strive</span>, of course, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to extend their </span>reach and and augment their <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">discretionary power</span>. </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In the long run, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">only political action</span> and state power can stop them</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Every act of local resistance is an appeal for political or legal intervention from the center. Consider, for example, the factory revolts of the 1930s that led (in the United States) to the establishment of collective bargaining and grievance procedures, critical restraints on scientific management, which is one of Foucault’s disciplines, though one that he alludes to only occasionally. Success required not only the solidarity of the workers but also the support of the liberal and democratic state. And success was functional not to any state but to a state of that sort; we can easily imagine other “social wholes” that would require other kinds of factory discipline. A genealogical account of this discipline would be fascinating and valuable, and it would undoubtedly overlap with Foucault’s accounts of prisons and hospitals. But if it were complete, it would have to include a genealogy of grievance procedures too, and this would overlap with an account that Foucault doesn’t provide, of the liberal state and the rule of law. Here is a kind of knowledge—let’s call it political theory or philosophical jurisprudence— that regulates disciplinary arrangements across our society. It arises within one set of power relations and extends toward the others; it offers a critical perspective on all the networks of constraint. The possibility of knowledge of this sort, specific to institutions and political cultures rather than to “points” in the power network, suggests that we still require (I don’t mean that society requires, or capitalism or even socialism requires, but you and I require) Foucault’s general intellectuals. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-weight: normal;">We need men and women who tell us when state power is corrupted </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">or systematically misused, who cry out that something is rotten, and who reiterate the regulative principles with which we might set things right. </span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">General intellectuals don’t inhabit a realm of pure value, such as Bends described; Foucault is right to insist that there is no such place, no value untouched by power. They stand among us, in this place, here and now, and they find in our laws and norms reasons for argument. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">But </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Foucault stands nowhere and finds no reasons</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. Angrily, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">he rattles the bars </span>of the iron cage. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">But </span>he <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has </span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">no plans</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">or projects for <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">turning the cage into </span>something more like <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a </span>human <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">home</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. But I don’t want to end on this note<strong>.</strong> </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I don’t want to ask Foucault to be uplifting. That is not the task he has set himself. The point is rather that one can’t even be downcast, angry, grim, indignant, sullen, or embittered with reason, one can’t be critical, unless one inhabits some social setting and adopts, however tentatively, its codes and categories. Or unless</span>,</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> and this is much harder, one constructs (along with other men and women) </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">a new setting and works out new codes and categories. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Foucault refuses </span>to do either of these things, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and that </span>refusal, which makes his genealogies so relentless, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is </span>also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the </span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">catastrophe</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-weight: normal;"> of his political theory and</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> his social <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">criticism</span>.</span></span><br />

There have been no</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> systematic </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">considerations of how critical</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> international </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">theory can help generate</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, support, or sustain </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">emancipatory politics beyond the</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> seminar room or </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">conference hotel</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Robert Cox, for example, has described the task of critical theorists as providing “a guide to strategic action for bringing about an alternative order” (R. Cox 1981: 130). Although he has also gone on to identify possible agents for change and has outlined the nature and structure of some feasible alternative orders, he has not explicitly indicated whom he regards as the addressee of critical theory (i.e., who is being guided) and thus how the theory can hope to become a part of the political process (see R. Cox 1981, 1983, 1996). Similarly, Andrew Linklater has argued that “a critical theory of international relations must regard the practical project of extending community beyond the nation–state as its most important problem” (Linklater 1990b: 171). However, he has little to say about the role of theory in the realization of this “practical project.” Indeed, his main point is to suggest that the role of critical theory “is not to offer instructions on how to act but to reveal the existence of unrealised possibilities” (Linklater 1990b: 172). But the question still remains, reveal to whom? Is the audience enlightened politicians? Particular social classes? Particular social movements? Or particular (and presumably particularized) communities? In light of Linklater’s primary concern with emancipation, one might expect more guidance as to whom he believes might do the emancipating and how critical theory can impinge upon the emancipatory process. There is, likewise, little enlightenment to be gleaned from Mark Hoffman’s otherwise important contribution. He argues that critical international theory seeks not simply to reproduce society via description, but to understand society and change it. It is both descriptive and constructive in its theoretical intent: it is both an intellectual and a social act. It is not merely an expression of the concrete realities of the historical situation, but also a force for change within those conditions. (M. Hoffman 1987: 233) Despite this very ambitious declaration, once again, Hoffman gives no suggestion as to how this “force for change” should be operationalized and what concrete role critical theorizing might play in changing society. Thus, </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">although</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">critical</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> international theorists’ </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">critique</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> of the role that more conventional approaches to the study of world politics play in reproducing the contemporary world order </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">may be persuasive</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">their account of the relationship between their</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> own </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">work and</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> emancipatory </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">political practice is unconvincing</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">Given the centrality of practice</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to the claims of critical theory, </span><span class="Style1Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">this is a very significant weakness.
