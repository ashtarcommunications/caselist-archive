Negative Strategies <br />
We say H1B's suck and that visas as a general concept suck. If you plan is so damn good, why not just let everyone into the country, why waste time with a stupid stamp program? Then we run a really bad courts or XO counter-plans and a bad poltics disad with with horrible internal links. If they go critical, we will run framework or a K. Then, in a pinch, we read Wake Forest, Northwestern, Cal-Berkeley or Harvard blocks. I think that pretty much covers our negative strategy on this topic as well as 80% of the teams in the nation's negative strategies.
