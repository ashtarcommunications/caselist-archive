T – Substantial<br />
<u>_ Interpretation – A Substantial increase in the number of visas is 50,000<br />
Krikorian, Center for Immigration Studies Executive Director, ‘98<br />
[Mark, National Review, Sept, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cis.org/GuestWorkerSlaveTrade" rel="nofollow">http://www.cis.org/GuestWorkerSlaveTrade</a>]<br />
A bill to substantially increase the number of foreign high-tech workers admitted under temporary visas has stumbled in Congress, mainly because of divisions among Republicans and a strong veto threat from the White House. The House leadership postponed until after the August recess a vote on the bill to increase the number of &quot;H-1B&quot; visas for computer programmers and other skilled workers by almost 200,000 over five years, from the current 65,000 a year to 115,000 by 2002. And the bill may simply fade away because, in the words of one House Republican staffer, &quot;How many people want to vote for 190,000 new foreign workers two months before an election?&quot;<br />
</u>_ Violation – The affirmative doesn’t specify their increase and is vague. <br />
A) Ground – Jacks all predictive negative link ground because we don’t know how many people substantial entails – This also allows them shift out of cp/link ground gutting all negative predictability and fairness.<br />
B). Education – Real world legislation requires specific numbers and it’s also what your solvency advocates assume. Real world modeling is good because it teaches us how to translate our debate skills out of round also means you can’t solve the case because you don’t define how many visas you a lot <br />

We assist in preparation of all temporary visa petitions and applications for permanent residence. Our clients include Fortune 500 high tech and biotech companies as well as small entities and individuals. In 1994 our immigration litigation department successfully presented the first ever deportation case raising the issue of female genital mutilation as a defense to deportation. Since then we have developed a reputation for outstanding achievement in litigating complex deportation and removal cases. We work with companies in all areas of immigration planning and document compliance, including I-9 and H-1B Labor Condition Applications.. We keep pace with constantly changing immigration laws and ever increasing client demand by conducting ongoing review of pending immigration legislation, analyzing new rules and regulations, and by integrating cutting-edge technology in our daily operations.

If there is a unifying thesis that runs through the bric-a-brac of reflections on violence that follow, it is that a similar paradox holds true for violence. At the forefront of our minds, the obvious signals of violence are acts of crime and terror, civil unrest, international conflict. But we should learn to step back, to disentangle ourselves from the fascinating lure of this directly visible “subjective” violence, violence performed by a clearly identifiable agent. We need to perceive the contours of the background which generates such outbursts. A step back enables us to identify a violence that sustains our very efforts to fight violence and promote tolerance.<br />

The teachings of economics encounter opposition not only from the supporters of altruism, but also from the practitioners of an irrational, short-sighted, self-defeating form of self-interest, as well. These are, above all, the businessmen and wage earners whose short-run interests would be harmed by the free competition of capitalism and are protected or positively promoted by policies of government intervention, and who do not scruple to seek government intervention. For example, the businessmen and wage earners who seek government subsidies, price supports, tariffs, licensing laws, exclusive government franchises, labor-union privileges, immigration quotas, and the like.<br />

_ Resisting this reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale<br />
<br />
Zizek and Daly, 04<br />
<br />
[Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16]<br />
<br />
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.<br />
<br />

<br />
<a name="Cap_1NC-Extensions"></a>Extensions<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact to the criticism is ethics and this consideration comes first– extend the Zizek and Daly in 2k4 evidence– 3 arguments:<br />
<br />
<br />
A) The ultimate ethico-political responsibility is to challenge the subordination of Capital. You don’t have to be a philosopher to draw the line between economic disparity and the ability of the market to dominate social relations – in the face of the affirmative you should struggle not against the particulars of immigration but instead against the organizing principles which produced the foundation for the status quos strategies of domination<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Forget the Big Other – the ethic of the 1AC will never be political because it will always rely on a higher external authority to outline and implement our ethical strategies – this depoliticized ethics is never progressive for the oppressed<br />
<br />
<br />
C) Risk the Impossible – the system of capital creates an ethical dilemma because it seems that all action outside of its confines will necessarily fail – ethics will never be political if we don’t insist on risking the impossible of a successful revolution against capitalism – we radically restructure the ethico-political imagination to include the possibility of successful actions against domination<br />
<br />
Zizek and Daly, 04<br />
<br />
[Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 18-19]<br />
<br />
For Zizek, a confrontation with the obscenities<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
thought, exhorts us to risk the impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
_ Capitalism precludes ethics because it preferences economic valuation to any other method of judging the world<br />

To show why this is the case,<br />

_ The Alternative is to withdrawal from capitalism as per Zizek 10, this is important because the Capitalist Ontology fosters unethical actions for 3 reasons<br />
<br />
1. Withdrawal crushes capitalism because it only exists as long as we believe in it and don’t buy aff claims that the alt isn’t detailed enough<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Severing all ties with the realities of capitalism allowing us to struggle more effectively against global capital.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Even if the alternative results in extinction, rebellion itself is the only ethical choice because it is the only unconditional affirmation of the value of all people.<br />
<br />

Alt: Withdraw<br />

_ Our alternative is to completely withdraw from the ideology of capital – this is essential to destroy the fetish that allows capital to survive<br />

Zizek 10 provides _ arguments against the Perm,<br />
<br />
<br />
A. Turn – Impact Turns link HARDER to a world that only half-heartedly fights capitalism.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. No Solvency – the perm just tinkers with the system, only full, continuous, and unfaltering struggle against capitalism can defeat it<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Severance – Permutation severs out of the logic of the 1AC and other answers to capitalism. This is a voting issue because its a moving target which is the strongest Internal to education and fairness<br />
<br />
<br />
D. The permutation doesn’t remedy any of our link arguments – our fundamental claim is that political strategies based on incentives placate struggles against capitalism – the permutation includes economic incentives which means it cannot avoid the link<br />
<br />
<br />
E. NEGATIVITY IS A PREREQUISITE – the alternative is a completely negative gesture which is essential to any progressive politics<br />
