The visa regime exists to arbitrarily include and exclude persons from being able to exist in the state. In so doing it marks them as other and places them in a state where all threats are existential and they lack recourse.<br />
Slater 2006<br />
((Mark B, School of Poli Sci @ U of Ottawa, The Global Visa Regime and the Political Technologies of the International Self: Borders, Bodies, Biopolitics; Alternatives 31)<br />
The visa and passport systems … bodies or control of international bodies.<br />
<br />
Focusing on terrorism makes conflict more likely as the state itself becomes terroristic to defend itself.<br />

Agamben 2001<br />
(Giorgio, professor at the University of Verona, On Security and Terror, 9/20 /2001)<br />
<br />
Today we face extreme and … legitimate each others’ actions.<br />
The visa regime uses profiles of persons to determine their inclusion or exclusion. While they include a particular group of people they stereotype them, forcing them to act out the stereotypes of them, maintaining the process of otherization.<br />

This constant attempt to control and manage the population posits security as the primary goal of the state, making conflicts inevitable as the state strives to secure itself.<br />

<br />
Neither Turgot and Quesnay nor … run, they are irreconcilable with democracy.<br />
<br />
Sovereignty gains its power by reducing life to a no value state to justify it's manipulation for the sovereign political ends. In this state life has no value or meaning because it can be killed at any point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agamben, 98<br />
(Giorgio, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life)<br />
<br />
It is not our intention here to … biological body of every living being.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative is rejecting the legal/illegal distinction created by visas, instead embracing the whatever being.<br />
<br />
In order to resist sovereignty we need to first reframe how we think about being. By changing the way we think about the role of the sovereign and its relation to life we can move beyond the sovereign decision about what does and does not constitute qualified life.<br />
