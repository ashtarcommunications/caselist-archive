<strong><u>Contention One</u>: Inherency</strong><br />
<strong>The US is losing its competitive edge – baby boom retirement and a failing education system will put the US behind many global competitors</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Kirkegaard, 2008</u></strong> (Jacob, Peterson Institute for International Economics, “US High-Skilled Immigration Policy: A Self-Inflicted Wound”, PIIE, July 1st, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=972" rel="nofollow">http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=972</a>)<br />
America rose to global… economy over the next decade.<br />
<strong>And, Home countries as well as other rising powers are challenging the US – Current restrictions on H-1B visas are preventing highly skilled workers and graduates from coming to the US</strong><br />

Adjunct Instructor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, “As Dumb As We Wanna Be: U.S. H1-B Visa Policy and the &quot;Brain Blocking&quot; of Asian High-Tech Professionals”, Selected Works of Jeffrey L Gower, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://works.bepress.com/jeffrey_gower/1/" rel="nofollow">http://works.bepress.com/jeffrey_gower/1/</a>)<br />

In addition, while U.S…. of visa delay or denial.<br />
<strong><u>Contention Two:</u> Competitiveness</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>The H-1B visa cap kills competitiveness – it makes it impossible for graduates to get a job and remain in the US and disincentivizes further enrollment in US universities – we lose highly skilled workers and future innovation which is key</strong><br />

<strong>Attracting the best students globally is critical to maintain competitiveness – we must reform restrictive visa policies</strong><br />

<strong>Competitiveness is key to leadership</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Much of the foreign policy discussion… economic competitiveness and energy dependence.</span><br />
<strong>And, Competitiveness is key to benign leadership – Solves your impact turns</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The world is dissatisfied… because of this integrated approach.</span><br />

A remarkable fact about international politics today-… humanity's only practical hope of solving the world's ills<br />
<strong>Labor force will collapse inevitably – we don’t have to win there will be a workforce shortage just a skill shortage – the skill shortage makes it impossible to compete globally, widens the income gap and collapses leadership – only reforming Skilled Visa policy solves</strong><br />

<br />
Science by its nature facilitates… partnerships, and create sustainability.<br />
<strong>Plan: The United States Federal Government should remove the cap on H-1B visas.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Contention Four:</u> Solvency</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Market forces provide the best check on H-1B visas – it would allow companies to fill uniquely skilled positions while maintaining a competitive US job market</strong><br />
<strong><u>Masters and Ruthizer, 2000</u></strong> (Suzette, attorney and former project fellow at the Open Society Institute in New York, Ted, partner and the head of the Immigration Law Group at the New York law firm of Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn &amp; Berman, LLP, “The H-1B Straitjacket: Why Congress Should Repeal the Cap on Foreign-Born Highly Skilled Workers”, CATO Institute, Trade Briefing Paper No. 7, March 3rd, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbp/tbp-007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbp/tbp-007.pdf</a>)<br />
<strong>Let the Market Decide H-1B Supply…</strong> <strong>determine the need for H-1B professionals.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The plan solves best – removing the cap allows graduates and foreign workers to remain in the US on a path to permanent residency while not displacing American jobs – the alternatives to the cap work better – empirically proven</strong><br />

Since the H-1B program was… companies from moving offshore.<br />
<strong>Now is the key time – H-1B restrictions need to end so the US can maintain a base of highly skilled workers and the ability to compete globally</strong><br />
