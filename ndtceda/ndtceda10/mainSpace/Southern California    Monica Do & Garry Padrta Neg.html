We need to do more work as debaters to talk about ways of seeing the world that can be effective. For example, the notion of open border is seen as so abstract to the American working class that it’s absurd. This demand becomes an obstacle to including people who matter in the dialogue over immigration politics<br />

Through several modes of proceeding, the topic of controversy between interlocutors is established and an implicit contract—that here is the shared point of disagreement—is created.</u> <strong>Without stasis, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">opponents may argue back and forth without really disagreeing with each other because they are not truly speaking about the same subject</span></strong><u>. For example, when one debater argues that the United States should refuse to negotiate with North Korea to avoid legitimating its harmful human rights policies and the opponent responds that President Clinton’s accommodation of North Korea in the 1990s was the source of its current human rights dilemma, there is no true disagreement</u> <strong>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Each position can be entirely true without discounting the other. In this instance, the truth-generating function of deliberation is short-circuited</span></strong><u>. To eliminate errors, fallacies must gradually be replaced by truths, correct positions must win out over incorrect ones, and strong arguments must gain more acceptance than weak ideas</u> <strong>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">This process requires conflict; it necessitates rejection. To determine that something is “true” requires that its converse is “false.”</span></strong> <u>The statement that “snow is cold” requires the dismissal of its contrary.</u> <strong>Such choices can only be made when there is a point of disagreement for debate to revolve around. Without stasis, the productive potential of deliberation is profoundly undermined</strong><u>. To avoid this scenario of “two ships passing in the night,”</u> <strong>argumentation scholars have recognized the importance of a mutual agreement to disagree and have attempted to create guidelines to facilitate productive discussion. “<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Some agreed upon end or goal must be present to define and delimit the evaluative ground within which the interchange is to proceed</span></strong><u>,” writes Douglas Ehninger, “</u><strong><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">When such ground is lacking, argument</span> itself … <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">becomes impossible</span>”</span></strong> <u>(1958).

In the academic context,</u> <strong><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">policy debates create stasis by utilizing a y</span>ear-long r<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">esolution that sets the topic for discussion. Affirmative teams must present a topical advocacy</span></span></strong> <u>(one that fits within the bounds of the resolution) or they are procedurally disqualified.</u> <strong>In public forums, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the task falls upon moderators</span> and discussion facilitators <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to set clear lines of relevance. Advocates</span>, who frequently <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have strategic political incentives to avoid direct disagreement, need to be institutionally constrained by the framework for discussion</span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u> <strong>A position that favors a limited form of argumentative pluralism undermines the claims made by those who oppose SSD and wish to render certain controversial issues “off limits” from debate. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Limits should be placed on the content of debate</span> only <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">because such choices as to what is debatable are inevitable</span>, and, given that, it is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">preferable to choose the path that best protects the forum for deliberation by minimizing exclusion</span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> The arbitrary choice about what content should and should not be “up for debate” threatens to render deliberation impossible–either all issues are up for debate, or none can be.</u><br />

 <span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The </span><strong><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ambiguists m</span>ust</span></strong> <u>say &quot;no&quot; to—they</u> <strong>must reject and limit—some ideas</strong> <u>and actions. In what follows, we will also find that they must say &quot;yes&quot; to some things. In particular, they must say &quot;yes&quot; to the idea of rational per­suasion. This means, first, that they must recognize the role of agreement in political contest, or the basic accord that is necessary to discord. The mistake that the ambiguists make here is a common one. The mistake is in thinking that agreement marks the end of contest—that consen­sus kills debate. But this is true only if the agreement is perfect—if there is nothing at all left to question or contest. In most cases, however, our agreements are highly imperfect. We agree on some matters but not on others, on gene<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">r</span>alities but not on specifics, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And this kind</u> <strong>of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">limited agreement is the starting condition of contest and debate</span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> As John Courtney Murray writes: We hold certain truths; therefore we can argue about them. It seems to have been one of the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true. There can be no argument except on the premise, and within a context, of agreement. (Murray 1960, 10) In other words,</u> <strong>w<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">e cannot argue about something</span></strong> <u>if we are not com­municating:</u> <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">if we cannot agree on the topic and terms of argument</span></strong> <u>or if we have utterly different ideas about what counts as evidence or good argument. At the very least, we must agree about what it is that is being debated before we can debate it. For instance,</u> <strong><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">one cannot have an argument about euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical group.</span> O</span></strong><u>ne cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one's target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the sitting have no complaints. Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words,</u> <strong>contest is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about what is being contested</strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> Resisters, demonstrators, and</u> <strong>debaters must have some shared ideas about the subject and/or the terms of their disagree­ments</strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an under­standing of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator's audience must know what is being resisted. In short, the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about intelligibly contesting it. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.</u><br />

<u><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The arguments advanced by vocal critics of switch side debating are susceptible to several other responses. First, as have been previously argued by Stannard (2006), </span></u><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"><strong>many of the processes that have contributed to American exceptionalism</strong></span><strong>—globalization, infiltration of academic institutions by agents of imperialism, etc.—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">are on-going, inevitable, and independent of the institution of competitive debate</span></strong></span><u>. As Alan Coverstone has noted, the disengagement of the public from political participation and adoption of a pure “spectator mentality” has now become the “predominant mode” of politics (2005). Any citizen who been attentive to political developments over the past eight years can tell that American politics has become susceptible to being overtaken by administrations bent on pursuing illiberal policies while wrapping themselves in the clothing of liberalism.</u> <strong>Given the now almost all-consuming exceptionalist mantra, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">debate is one of the last arenas that reward anti-institutional thinking and oppositional rhetoric</span></strong> <u>(Stannard, 2006).</u> <strong>It is a tremendous “stretch” to attribute the causal source of exceptionalism to debate</strong> <u>(Lacy, 2006).</u> <strong>Debate isn’t compulsory. Nothing in the activity makes students participate.</strong> <u>Once involved, there are no thought-police who control the content of students’ speeches. Those who argue otherwise show a profound lack of respect for the magnitude of violence that their comparisons draw likeness to.</u> <strong>Instead, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the exact opposite seems defensible: a major and endemic problem that contributes to American exceptionalism is the lack of debate at all levels of society</span>.</strong> <u>Stannard agrees, warning: Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Instead, seek to expand this method of deliberation to those who will use it to liberate themselves… If capitalism corrupts debate, well, then I say we save debate. (2006)</u> <strong>The proper task of critics is not to retreat into speaking only from conviction. It is to strive to expand SSD to new avenues and to make ideas that were once considered dogma contestable. The very nature of the approach acts as a counter-weight to imperialism and “foster[s] resistance to domination</strong><u>” (Stannard, 2006).</u><br />

Thus,for example. any proposal for a new global institutional arrangement superseding the state system will itself have to be justified, and that justification will have to include within it reference to a new and good form of individual citizenship, reference to a new legislative machinery equipped with satisfactory checks and balances, reference to satisfactory law enforcement procedures, reference to a satisfactory arrangement for distributing the goods produced in the world, and so on. All of these notions are notions which have been developed and finely honed within the theory of the modern state. It is not possible to imagine a justification of a new world order succeeding which used, for example, feudal, or traditional/tribal, discourse. More generally there is no worldwide language of political morality which is not completely shot through with state-related notions such as citizenship, rights under law, representative government and so on.</u><br />

<u><span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Left uncorrected</span></u><strong>, the trends in American civil-military relations could breed certain pathologies. The most serious possibility is that of a dramatic civil-military split during a crisis involving the use of force</strong><u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;">In the recent past, such tensions did not result in open division; for example, Franklin Roosevelt insisted that the United States invade North Africa in 1942, though the chiefs of both the army and the navy vigorously opposed such a course, favoring instead a buildup in England and an invasion of the continent in 1943. Back then it was inconceivable that a senior military officer would leak word of such a split to the media, where it would have reverberated loudly and destructively. To be sure, from time to time individual officers broke the vow of professional silence to protest a course of action, but in these isolated cases the officers paid the accepted price of termination of their careers. In the modern environment, such cases might no longer be isolated. Thus, presidents might try to shape U.S. strategy so that it complies with military opinion, and rarely in the annals of statecraft has military opinion alone been an adequate guide to sound foreign policy choices. Had Lincoln followed the advice of his senior military advisors there is a good chance that the Union would have fallen. Had Roosevelt deferred to General George C. Marshall and Admiral Ernest J. King there might well have been a gory debacle on the shores of France in 1943. Had Harry S Truman heeded the advice of his theater commander in the Far East (and it should be remembered that the Joint Chiefs generally counseled support of the man on the spot) there might have been a third world war. Throughout much of its history, the U.S. military was remarkably politicized by contemporary standards. One commander of the army, Winfield Scott, even ran for president while in uniform, and others (Leonard Wood, for example) have made no secret of their political views and aspirations. But until 1940, and with the exception of periods of outright warfare, the military was a negligible force in American life, and America was not a central force in international politics. That has changed. Despite the near halving of the defense budget from its high in the 1980s, it remains a significant portion of the federal budget, and the military continues to employ millions of Americans. More important</span>,</u> <strong>civil-military relations in the United States now no longer affect merely the closet-room politics of Washington, but the relations of countries around the world. American choices about the use of force, the shrewdness of American strategy, the soundness of American tactics, and the will of American leaders have global consequences. What might have been petty squabbles in bygone years are now magnified into quarrels of a far larger scale, and conceivably with far more grievous consequences. To ignore the problem would neglect one of the cardinal purposes of the federal government: &quot;to provide for the common defense&quot; in a world in which security cannot be taken for granted.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Fear can be an energizing emotion. It can move us to fight or flight. But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">fear, when it becomes overwhelming, is more likely to paralyze</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> -- think of the proverbial deer in the headlights. Long ago, in Hiroshima, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton discovered that </span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">when there's too much fear, it curdles into despair</span><u>. If threat seems to be everywhere, with no escape in sight,</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">people stop trying to imagine how things could get better. In fact, it seems that they stop imagining anything at all, except more peril</span>. <u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Lifton called this condition &quot;psychic numbing.&quot; His great insight was that the bomb didn't have to fall for this tragedy to befall us. In a sense, Hiroshima had already come to America. During all those Cold War years, when Americans lived under the shadow of superpower &quot;mutual assured destruction&quot; or MAD (as the madly accurate acronym of that moment had it), seeing no way out, psychic numbing took its toll.</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">What historians often call the &quot;national security state&quot; has actually been a national insecurity state, based on the sort of numbing fear that was <strong>bound to make Americans more conservative, more fearful of change.</strong></span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">The idea of a whole society working together to imagine a better world, and then turning imagination into reality, has been off the American radar screen for some six decades now</span><u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> (except for a brief ray of light in the 1960s). </span></u>When it seems safer to allow no significant change at all, politics naturally becomes an exercise in circling the wagons and hunkering down for an endless siege<u>. The 9/11 attack and the Bush-orchestrated response insured that the United States would continue to be a hunkered-down national insecurity state (and now a homeland insecurity state) well into the 21st century. All of us, supporters and critics alike, have absorbed this lesson.</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">When we criticize Bush because he has failed to keep us safe, we score valuable political points. But we <strong>pay a price for those points, because we reinforce the basic premises of the national insecurity state</strong> -- that danger is everywhere</span> and can never be eliminated; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that all systemic change is dangerous;</span> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">and that our best hope lies in a government strong enough and pugnacious enough to prevent significant change and so protect us from fear's worst effects. </span> The urge to be safe, to keep fear at bay, is certainly natural and understandable. But after more than half a century in a state of heightened national insecurity,<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Americans have largely forgotten the other side of the human coin: the urge to be daring, to take chances that can lead to positive change.</span> Insecurity is now in the national bloodstream.</span> <u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">That's why anti-Bush campaigns that evoke fear can be so successful. To be successful in the longer term, though, we have to constrict that sense of insecurity, to return it to the more modest place where it belongs, until actual security comes into sight. Otherwise, no matter how much</span></u> anti-Bush campaigns <u>weaken the President, they</u> <strong>end up reinforcing the pervasive insecurity</strong> that has been the key to his political success<strong>. They make it more likely that the public will want future leaders in the Bush mold, who demand &quot;peace through strength</strong>.&quot;<br />

<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In this struggle with the lessons of Vietnam</span>, revolutionary resistance, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and rapid geopolitical transformation, we are witness to an enduring political and cultural theme: of <strong>a craving for order, control and certainty in the face of continual uncertainty</strong></span><u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. </span></u>Closely related to this anxiety was the way that Kissinger's thinking <u>-- and that of McNamara and earlier imperialists like the British Governor of Egypt Cromer --</u> was embedded in instrumental images of technology and the machine: the machine as both a tool of power and an image of social and political order. <u>In his essay 'The Government of Subject Races' Cromer envisaged effective imperial rule -- over numerous societies and billions of human beings -- as best achieved by a central authority working 'to ensure the harmonious working of the different parts of the machine'.60 Kissinger analogously invoked the virtues of 'equilibrium', 'manageability' and 'stability' yet, writing some six decades later, was anxious that technological progress no longer brought untroubled control: the Westernising 'spread of technology and its associated rationality...does not inevitably produce a similar concept of reality'.61</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We sense the rational policymaker's frustrated desire: the world is supposed to work like a machine</span>, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">ordered by a form of power and governmental reason which deploys machines and whose desires and processes are meant to run along ordered, rational lines like a machine.</span><u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Kissinger's desire was little different from that of Cromer who, wrote Edward Said: ...envisions a seat of power in the West and radiating out from it towards the East a great embracing machine, sustaining the central authority yet commanded by it. What the machine's branches feed into it from the East -- human material, material wealth, knowledge, what have you -- is processed by the machine, then converted into more power...the immediate translation of mere Oriental matter into useful substance.62</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">This desire for order in the shadow of chaos and uncertainty</span> <u>-- the constant war with an intractable and volatile matter --</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has deep roots in modern thought</span>, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">and was a major impetus to the development of technological reason and its supporting theories of knowledge</span><u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. As Kissinger's claims about the West's Newtonian desire for</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the 'accurate' gathering and classification of 'data' suggest, modern strategy, foreign policy and Realpolitik have been thrust deep into the apparently stable soil of natural scienc</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">e</span>, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">in the hope of finding immovable and unchallengeable roots there. While this process has origins in ancient Judaic and Greek thought, it crystallised in philosophical terms most powerfully during and after the Renaissance. The key figures in this process were Francis Bacon, Galileo, Isaac Newton, and René Descartes, who all combined a hunger for political and ontological certainty, a positivist epistemology and a naïve faith in the goodness of invention. Bacon sought to create certainty and order, and with it a new human power over the world, through a new empirical methodology based on a harmonious combination of experiment, the senses and the understanding. With this method, he argued, we can 'derive hope from a purer alliance of the faculties (the experimental and rational) than has yet been attempted'.63 In a similar move, Descartes sought to conjure certainty from uncertainty through the application of a new method that moved progressively out from a few basic certainties (the existence of God, the certitude of individual consciousness and a divinely granted faculty of judgement) in a search for pure fixed truths. Mathematics formed the ideal image of this method, with its strict logical reasoning, its quantifiable results and its uncanny insights into the hidden structure of the cosmos.64 Earlier, Galileo had argued that scientists should privilege 'objective', quantifiable qualities over 'merely perceptible' ones; that 'only by means of an exclusively quantitative analysis could science attain certain knowledge of the world'.65</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Such doctrines of mathematically verifiable truth</span> were to have <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">powerful echoes in the 20th Centur</span>y, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">in the ascendancy of systems analysis, game theory, cybernetics and computing in defense policy and strategic decisions,</span> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and in the awesome scientific breakthroughs of nuclear physics, which unlocked the innermost secrets of matter and energy and applied the most advanced applications of mathematics and computing to create the atomic bomb</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u><br />

Securing a Politics of Hope</span></u> The human resource -- potentially so readily available -- that can help us break out of this cycle of fear and numbing is imagination. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Imagine American political language and life no longer based simply on the question, &quot;How can we be safe?&quot;,</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> but on the question, &quot;How can we make life better for all of us?&quot; Imagine it for a little while, and you begin to realize that such a profound shift would give us the best chance -- maybe the only chance -- to be really secure</span>. <u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Consider, for example, Class 5 hurricanes. It's a good idea to build stout levees, if they are just a first step. For real security, though, we have to move beyond fear to hope. We have to focus on the positive changes that will help everyone, even if there is never another great storm. We should reclaim wetlands -- nature's own buffer against flooding -- to create a stable environment where a myriad of species, including humans, can flourish creatively. We should support the decades-old local organizations in poor, stricken areas, the folks who know how to build vibrant communities in their own neighborhoods. We should take steps to cool down the Earth to make wetlands more stable, growing seasons more predictable, and harvests more bountiful.</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The prospect of really making things better gives people a reason to think and act together. It makes them feel empowered</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span></u>Once set loose, hopeful attitudes and actions build on each other. That's when genuine change begins -- whether in relation to wetlands, poverty, global warming or any other issue, including the &quot;war on terrorism.&quot; <u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">You hardly have to be as well educated as the average Al Qaeda activist (who, it turns out, is pretty well educated) to see that present American efforts to &quot;make the world better&quot; are mainly efforts to protect U.S. power and interests. The President and the power brokers can hide that truth behind a verbal smokescreen, using phrases like &quot;protect America,&quot; &quot;keep our nation safe,&quot; and &quot;defend our homeland against foreign enemies.&quot; It's an easy rhetorical trick. Once you start talking the language of &quot;protecting and defending,&quot; though, you're on your way into the land of self-fulfilling prophecies. To make the smokescreen work, the administration then has to turn everyone who disagrees into &quot;the enemy.&quot; It's a natural next step to set out to destroy them, which, of course, turns them into genuine enemies. But suppose the U.S. had spent the last six decades letting other people decide what &quot;a better world&quot; means to them and then helping them achieve their own goals. That's so far from the pattern of our foreign policy that it takes a wrenching effort just to imagine. Try to make that effort; then ask what kind of &quot;terrorist threat&quot; we would have. There's no way to know for sure. But it seems a reasonable bet that we'd be a lot safer than we are today. It makes sense to join the liberal chorus of &quot;end the war in Iraq so we can protect ourselves against terrorists&quot; as long as it's just a first step, as long as we go on to say things like: &quot;Instead of draining our national treasury for endless war, we demand that our tax dollars be used to repair the damage done to Iraq and to fund services in our communities.&quot; Those words, from the United for Peace and Justice website, echo the sentiment of hundreds of groups that are imagining a better future. Many demand that our tax dollars be used to fund services and repair damage all over the world. After all, that's actually the best way to begin to protect ourselves from danger. But even that won't work if we do it simply because we are scared.</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We'll never be safe if we make safety our ultimate goal. We'll be safe only if we let <strong>safety be a by-product of a society</strong> working together to improve life for everyon</span>e. The best way to be secure is to imagine a genuine politics of hope. Imagine<u>. Unfortunately, when John Lennon said, &quot;It's easy if you try,&quot; he was quite wrong. After six decades of our national insecurity state, it's incredibly hard. But it's an effort that anti-Bush forces ought to make.</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The alternative is</span><u>, however inadvertently,</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to reinforce the politics of fear that Bush and his kind thrive on.

Securing a Politics of Hope</span></u> The human resource -- potentially so readily available -- that can help us break out of this cycle of fear and numbing is imagination. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Imagine American political language and life no longer based simply on the question, &quot;How can we be safe?&quot;,</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> but on the question, &quot;How can we make life better for all of us?&quot; Imagine it for a little while, and you begin to realize that such a profound shift would give us the best chance -- maybe the only chance -- to be really secure</span>. <u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Consider, for example, Class 5 hurricanes. It's a good idea to build stout levees, if they are just a first step. For real security, though, we have to move beyond fear to hope. We have to focus on the positive changes that will help everyone, even if there is never another great storm. We should reclaim wetlands -- nature's own buffer against flooding -- to create a stable environment where a myriad of species, including humans, can flourish creatively. We should support the decades-old local organizations in poor, stricken areas, the folks who know how to build vibrant communities in their own neighborhoods. We should take steps to cool down the Earth to make wetlands more stable, growing seasons more predictable, and harvests more bountiful.</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The prospect of really making things better gives people a reason to think and act together. It makes them feel empowered</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span></u>Once set loose, hopeful attitudes and actions build on each other. That's when genuine change begins -- whether in relation to wetlands, poverty, global warming or any other issue, including the &quot;war on terrorism.&quot; <u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">You hardly have to be as well educated as the average Al Qaeda activist (who, it turns out, is pretty well educated) to see that present American efforts to &quot;make the world better&quot; are mainly efforts to protect U.S. power and interests. The President and the power brokers can hide that truth behind a verbal smokescreen, using phrases like &quot;protect America,&quot; &quot;keep our nation safe,&quot; and &quot;defend our homeland against foreign enemies.&quot; It's an easy rhetorical trick. Once you start talking the language of &quot;protecting and defending,&quot; though, you're on your way into the land of self-fulfilling prophecies. To make the smokescreen work, the administration then has to turn everyone who disagrees into &quot;the enemy.&quot; It's a natural next step to set out to destroy them, which, of course, turns them into genuine enemies. But suppose the U.S. had spent the last six decades letting other people decide what &quot;a better world&quot; means to them and then helping them achieve their own goals. That's so far from the pattern of our foreign policy that it takes a wrenching effort just to imagine. Try to make that effort; then ask what kind of &quot;terrorist threat&quot; we would have. There's no way to know for sure. But it seems a reasonable bet that we'd be a lot safer than we are today. It makes sense to join the liberal chorus of &quot;end the war in Iraq so we can protect ourselves against terrorists&quot; as long as it's just a first step, as long as we go on to say things like: &quot;Instead of draining our national treasury for endless war, we demand that our tax dollars be used to repair the damage done to Iraq and to fund services in our communities.&quot; Those words, from the United for Peace and Justice website, echo the sentiment of hundreds of groups that are imagining a better future. Many demand that our tax dollars be used to fund services and repair damage all over the world. After all, that's actually the best way to begin to protect ourselves from danger. But even that won't work if we do it simply because we are scared.</span></u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We'll never be safe if we make safety our ultimate goal. We'll be safe only if we let <strong>safety be a by-product of a society</strong> working together to improve life for everyon</span>e. The best way to be secure is to imagine a genuine politics of hope. Imagine<u>. Unfortunately, when John Lennon said, &quot;It's easy if you try,&quot; he was quite wrong. After six decades of our national insecurity state, it's incredibly hard. But it's an effort that anti-Bush forces ought to make.</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The alternative is</span><u>, however inadvertently,</u> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to reinforce the politics of fear that Bush and his kind thrive on. The belief that danger is everywhere -- that we must have leaders whose great task is to keep us safe -- is the one great danger we really do need to protect ourselves against.</span><br />

<u><span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The US </span></u><strong>Congress has found adapting the work visa</strong> <u>system to the new competitive realities in other than marginal ways (typically focusing on numerical ceilings</u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>) politically</strong> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">extremely contentious</span> <u>and difficult to do.

As a result, finding the right political balance between family reunification and labor-market immigration while holding firm to our proud humanitarian traditions and obligations has become increasingly difficult and the effort to redesign the work visa system ends up in repeated policy stalemates. To be sure, managing immigration well and with an eye to maximizing economic benefits must also involve highly technical questions about the effects of immigration on job opportunities for some Americans, wages, labor markets, growth, and long-term economic competitiveness. Too few admissions or a broken selection system (in terms of both timeliness and requirements) for immigrants with needed skills and qualifications inhibit America's growth and competitiveness; too much immigration, almost regardless of skills, can create disincentives for our own young people to enter certain fields of study and work and can sidetrack or even derail education and training priorities; and too much low-skilled immigration can impede innovation, slow productivity gains, and undermine wages and working conditions for similarly situated US workers.</u> <strong>Rapid economic restructuring and</strong> <u>slower but equally crucial demographic</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>change place a premium on a</strong> </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">flexible, responsive </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><strong>immigration system</strong></span><u>.

Indeed, Congress took a similar step for determining annual refugeeadmissions levels when it established the refugee consultation process in the 1980 Refugee Act.</u> <strong>The Standing Commission</strong><u>, which would be a permanent body,</u> <strong>would</strong> <u>have the following tasks: •</u> <strong>Analyze</strong> <u>existing</u> <strong>data on immigrants</strong> <u>in the US economy,</u> <strong>and manage the collection of new longitudinal data as needed</strong><u>.</u> <strong>The</strong> <u>proposed</u> <strong>new and ongoing data collection project would be similar to the New Immigrant Survey4</strong> <u>but with a larger sample size, multiple cohorts, and more of an explicit focus on labor markets.</u> <strong>Create and implement a policy-focused research agenda on the labor market roles,</strong> <u>integration trajectories, and economic impacts of all types of immigration3 , both</u> <strong>at the national</strong> <u>level but most importantly at the</u> <strong>state, regional, industrial sector, and occupational levels</strong><u>. The objective would be to address policy-relevant issues and</u> <strong>thus obviate the need for Congress to rely on the unpredictable and arbitrary interests</strong> <u>of the academy and the political and ideological agendas of most nonprofit research organizations. Perhaps more importantly,</u> <strong>such ongoing and systematic research would allow the Commission to treat congressional changes</strong> <u>in policy</u> <strong>as &quot;natural experiments&quot; whose analysis would inform and shape additional policy adjustments</strong><u>. •</u> <strong>Provide annual recommendations for adjustments to employment-based immigration levels that would take effect unless Congress voted to change them within a specified time frame</strong><u>. •</u> <strong>Publish research reports and make datasets publicly available so as to create the foundation for ongoing academic research and better informed public debate</strong><u>. Together, these functions would enable Congress to revisit the allocation of employment visas regularly and base immigration policy on a better and much more reliable understanding of the evidence about evolving needs and impacts than the current system provides. Over time,</u> <strong>the accumulated knowledge and experience the Standing Commission would amass would make Congress' responsibilities on immigration easier to manage and its decisions better informed</strong> <u>and much better aligned with the country's broader interests. To this end, the proposed Standing Commission should be seen as a key element of comprehensive immigration reform or, should legislation stall, a first step toward better policy solutions</u><br />

<u><span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">In contrast with previous one-time &quot;blue-ribbon panels&quot; like the Hesburgh and Jordan Commissions,1 8 an expert commission would create a resource for ongoing reviews by Congress of labor market and all immigration.

<u><span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Certain </span></u>recent <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">proposals seem to accept the loss of energy- intensive industries</span> <u>in the United States</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">as an inevitable consequence of climate</span> change <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">legislation</span></span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> Some have referred cavalierly to this as &quot;leakage.&quot;</u> In fact, the loss of <u>energy- intensive manufacturing industries like</u> steel as a consequence of climate change legislation would cost millions of <u>Americans their</u> jobs, damage our economy, and threaten our national security<u>. Even worse from a climate perspective, because American manufacturers are generally among the most efficient in the world, such &quot;leakage&quot; would result in increased global emissions of greenhouse gases, exactly opposite the intended result. One way to avoid this result is to promulgate and apply carbon intensity standards that set an upper limit on greenhouse gas emissions per ton of steel produced and that apply to all steel consumed in the United States, whether domestically produced or imported. These standards would be analogous to the fleet fuel economy standards that the United States already imposes on automobiles, and the energy efficiency standards that apply to appliances - regulatory regimes with which this committee is very familiar. First, Mr. Chairman, let me emphasize that however Congress seeks global reach on foreign manufacturers who sell in U.S. markets, carbon intensity is the only suitable metric, not total carbon emissions. This is true whether Congress creates a cap-and-trade system, levies carbon taxes, or imposes carbon intensity standards on foreign and domestic products. Whatever approach Congress takes, the only available metric is the carbon intensity of foreign products. Congress has no authority to impose carbon caps on the total emissions from foreign economies, and carbon intensity is the only reasonable way to enlist countries like China, Russia, Ukraine, India and Brazil to participate in a meaningful global framework. The fact is, all you have to work with is the carbon intensity of the products sold in our country. Again, that is the only hook on foreign-made products. Second, whatever approach Congress takes to achieve global reach, it must require the submission of verifiable data on carbon intensity from domestic and foreign manufacturers selling in the U.S. market. Submission of data should be simultaneous for domestic and foreign manufacturers doing business in the U.S. Only then is a regulatory agency, such as EPA, in a position to set regulatory requirements. Third, while calculating the carbon intensity of steel products and setting a carbon intensity standard sounds complicated, it is fairly straightforward. The first step in setting a standard would be to require domestic and foreign steel producers to report their emissions for different categories of steel products - steel slab, beams, sheet, etc. - on a per ton basis. The sources of greenhouse gas emissions from steelmaking are readily identifiable, and steel producers track their consumption of these inputs in the ordinary course of business. Domestic manufacturers already share this information in aggregate with EPA in a number of programs. To calculate the emissions arising from the use of these inputs, it is necessary to know how much CO2 is released on average from the use of a given quantity of the input, such as a ton of coal. By multiplying this &quot;greenhouse gas factor&quot; by the amount of the input consumed, a steel producer can calculate its total greenhouse gas emissions from the use of that input. The International Iron and Steel Institute has already calculated these emissions factors for a range of inputs. To determine its carbon intensity, the steel producer could in most cases simply (1) identify the quantity of each input it consumed during a given period; (2) multiply that quantity by the &quot;greenhouse gas factor&quot; for the input identified by the EPA; (3) add up the total emissions from all of its inputs; and (4) divide total emissions by the total tons of steel it produced. The calculations for different products would vary slightly, but the overall form would remain consistent. There are several ways to set a carbon intensity performance standard. We offer the following approach because it is market- based. Once domestic and foreign producers have reported their carbon intensity for various products, Congress would direct the EPA to set the standard so that a predetermined percentage of U.S. production (90 percent, for example) would meet the standard. Producers (both foreign and domestic) who did not satisfy the standard would have a fixed amount of time (several years), to bring themselves into compliance. If they did not do so, their products could not be sold in the United States. Finally, EPA would periodically review the standard to determine whether additional improvement in the standard is economically and technologically feasible. Carbon intensity standards provide an efficient and effective way to decrease greenhouse gas emissions globally while limiting the harm to American competitiveness. The key is that these standards would apply to both domestically produced and imported products. My colleague Charles Verrill has conducted an intensive analysis of the GATT consistency of such standards, and has concluded that they would be consistent with U.S. obligations under the GATT. Because the compliance of U.S. measures with our international obligations is such an important issue, we will make a copy of the latest analysis available to the Committee. Consideration of Steel Production Processes As you contemplate any climate change policy, we think it is vitally important for this Committee, and other members of Congress, to understand a few basic facts about steel production. Importantly, steel is a man-made alloy of iron, a natural element, and carbon is an essential ingredient and byproduct of that transformation. What is universally called the steel industry are actually two distinct but complementary production processes. The first involves smelting iron from various forms of mined iron ore, and then transforming the molten iron into steel by the introduction of various alloying elements. In the industry's vernacular, we refer to this as the &quot;integrated&quot; process, and it is characterized by coke ovens, blast furnaces, and basic oxygen furnaces, or &quot;BOFs.&quot; Iron production is essential to steel production, and an unavoidable byproduct of iron production is carbon dioxide, commonly referred to as &quot;process emissions.&quot; However, once steel is produced from iron, and after serving useful purposes for decades, it can be recycled, re-melted and reshaped into new products in a cycle that virtually has no end. It is notable that the domestic steel industry recycles its product at a higher rate than aluminum, paper, glass and plastic combined, including the steel from 100% of the automobiles produced in the United States. Typically, this form of steel production is accomplished by re- melting reclaimed scrap steel and other iron-bearing materials in an electric arc furnace, or &quot;EAF,&quot; and is often referred to as a &quot;mini-mill.&quot; Because re-melting scrap steel does not require the same chemical transformation needed to extract molten iron from iron ore, EAFs typically have much lower carbon emissions than the integrated process, even if indirect emissions from electricity purchased from upstream suppliers are factored in. The growth of recycling and the widespread deployment of EAF technology in the U.S. since the early 1980's are major reasons for the declining carbon footprint of the U. S. steel industry. Bonus allocations should be used to encourage the recycling of steel. Today, 60 percent of America's steel is produced using EAF technology. It is important to understand the interaction and interdependence of these two distinct processes. As I've noted, the United States already recycles 100 percent of the automobiles produced in this country, and has high recycling rates for other steel products. We are reaching the practical limits of EAF production, due to the constraints of the key ingredient - scrap steel. Metallurgically, certain steel grades have been obtained only through the integrated process. Because of these differences in steelmaking processes, carbon intensity will vary greatly between different types of mills. Some products, such as rebar, are made in the United States exclusively in EAF mills. Other products, such as hot-rolled steel sheet, are made in both types of facilities. Still other products, such as ultra-low carbon grades for special applications, are made exclusively in BOF shops. While EAFs utilize some pig iron, and BOFs utilize some scrap, there remain significant technological barriers to complete interchangeability of processes. Therefore, for individual products, EPA would set two different standards, depending on whether the product was produced using a BOF or an EAF, with a clear understanding of the competitive and technological relationships referenced above. Higher,</u> uncompensated regulatory <u>and related</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">costs imposed on steel producers</span> - regardless of which industrial process they employ --</span> will force manufacturers to move production from the U<u>nited</u> S<u>tates</u> to countries <u>like China, India and Brazil,</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">that do not have</span> comprehensive </span><u>and significant</u> greenhouse gas <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">reduction obligations</span><u>. For example,</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">while</span> electric <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">arc furnaces use some coal</span>, perhaps enough to create allowance obligations, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">their greatest vulnerability is from increases in electricity prices</span> </span><u>as electric utilities pass through their allowance costs to their customers downstream.</u> Unless these electric arc furnace operators obtain <u>some kind of</u> relief<u>, such as emission allowances to sell to offset these higher electricity prices,</u> these operators<u>, who emit the least greenhouse gases,</u> will not be competitive with higher emitters globally<u>. This is exactly what is happening in the European Union, which has the longest established and most comprehensive greenhouse gas cap-and-trade system in the world.</u> Steelmakers in the EU have been hit with substantial increases in electricity costs<u>, increases</u> that have made them less competitive <u>internationally. The President of WV Stahl, the federation of German steel producers, estimates that the EU's climate change regime will increase the costs of the German steel industry alone by two billion euros per year, or over 41 euros per ton of steel produced. As a consequence, European steelmakers have become reluctant to make large new investments in the EU.</u> Poorly-designed <u>climate change</u> legislation could have similar impact in the U<u>nited</u> S<u>tates. Duke Energy, one of the country's largest generators of electricity, predicts that</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">a cap and- trade system could cause electricity prices</span> </span><u>in the Duke service area</u> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">to rise by 53 percent</span> </span><u>by 2012.</u> Electric arc furnaces use large amounts of electricity. Such an enormous increase in electricity prices would have a clear impact on their competitiveness<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> Indeed, sharp increases in electricity prices will diminish the competitiveness of every business in the United States that uses substantial amounts of electricity - which includes practically every manufacturing industry in the country.</u> Sharp increases in electricity costs would be especially harmful to steel producers <u>who use electric arc furnaces and who do not generate significant process emission greenhouse gases. Finally, higher utility costs would also affect integrated and EAF producers in both downstream processing operations, such as rolling mills and coating lines. For example, increased electricity costs would dramatically harm producers making corrosion-resistant steels via the electro-galvanizing process, which, as the name implies, utilizes significant amounts of electricity, and which represents a major end-use market for appliances and automobiles. In this case, it should be remembered that substitution of these products from other sources will increase greenhouse gas emissions globally. Suggestions Regarding Cap and Trade Legislation I would be remiss if I did not tell you that the U.S. steel industry still has grave doubts about how well cap and trade can address climate change. Admittedly, the cap-and-trade approach worked reasonably well on the acid rain problem. Regulating greenhouse gases, however, is a much broader and more complex problem than regulating sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions.</u> The risks and costs of implementing the wrong policy are substantially higher<u>. The climate change issue is quite different. With climate change we have major technological gaps, the presence of foreign competitors and thus the need for global reach, and no guaranteed ability for pass-through of regulatory costs. If Congress does proceed with cap and trade, however, then we have some suggestions. First, with respect to steel and other energy-intensive industries, several principles must underlie any climate change legislation. The products of energy-intensive industries like steel, whether domestically produced or imported, must be subject to the same requirements, starting at the same time, with no exceptions and no discretion. These principles will encourage a &quot;race to the top&quot; in producers around the world. Conversely, a system that applies weaker measures to imports than goods produced in the United States will result in the off-shoring of American industries, the loss of American jobs - and an increase in global emissions of greenhouse gases. Second, the legislation must recognize the different vulnerabilities to a cap and trade regime of both the integrated steel mills and the electric arc furnaces and be designed to prevent the demise of either. While cap and trade legislation hits these firms in different ways, the costs are not borne at all by foreign competitors in mostly developing countries, thus creating a competitive disadvantage for domestic firms. In a recent speech, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, the President of the European Commission, raised precisely such an alternative arrangement for steel and other energy-intensive industries in Europe. Similarly, Canada is in the midst of a comprehensive regulatory review that aims to exempt certain industrial fixed process emissions (not entire industries) from its cap-and-trade system. This review is rooted in the understanding that the ability to reduce some emissions lies beyond reasonable or known control technologies. To that end, the Congress could consider exempting from regulation gasses from fixed process emissions such as the use of coal or coke in the chemical reduction of iron ore. In 1993 when the U.S. House of Representatives passed the ill-fated BTU tax proposal, there was general acceptance that certain industrial processes requiring energy as a feedstock (e.g., electricity for electrolytic processes, natural gas for chemicals, coal/coke for steelmaking, etc.) should be exempted at least in part from the proposed tax regime (and imported goods with substantial like inputs be commensurately taxed), precisely because of international competitiveness concerns. Similarly, the legislation could allocate allowances to the steel industry to offset higher energy costs and to reward those who recycle the most. Third, any cap-and-trade system will face the problem of how to achieve &quot;global reach&quot; as a part of the international competitiveness problem. The Senate legislation S. 2191 uses the American Electric Power approach. I am here to discuss performance standards, but I will say that the steel industry has examined the AEP approach in great detail, both as a stand-alone provision and within the context of S. 2191. As contained in S. 2191, the AEP approach is, we think, unworkable. We believe that any competitiveness provision should 1) apply simultaneously to domestic and foreign firms selling in the U.S. market; 2) use the same baseline periods; 3) not invite subsidies by foreign governments; and 4) not enable the Administration to waive the requirements on foreign manufacturers. Among options for addressing the international competitiveness problem within cap and trade, I am far less sanguine about proposals to offer &quot;premiums&quot; or other incentives to so-called developing countries to implement climate change legislation. In fact, countries like China, India, and Brazil have a huge incentive not to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. The absence of greenhouse gas regulations gives their products a powerful competitive edge in international commerce. It is doubtful that we could offer incentives sweet enough to convince these countries to surrender this advantage voluntarily. Several of these countries view existing incentive programs as a mechanism for transferring energy intensive industry onto their shores. While a negotiated, binding and enforceable global agreement could resolve many of these issues, I doubt that an effective agreement can be negotiated before 2012. Other Concerns about Cap and Trade Legislation The legislation pending in the Senate, S. 2191, rewards states with extra allowances if they impose more stringent cap and trade requirements than does the federal scheme. I shudder to think how American industry can cope with a federal cap and trade program and a multitude of conflicting, more stringent state programs. Recall that the states, under the U.S. Constitution and our trade laws, have no mechanism to achieve global reach, to avoid giving foreign manufacturers who sell in our markets a competitive advantage over domestic firms. We are also very concerned that</u> cap and trade legislation will encourage fuel switching from coal to natural gas, further escalating natural gas prices<u>. This scenario is already occurring, just in anticipation of legislation.</u> Electricity price hikes will unquestionably follow<u>, not just for us, but for the entire economy.</u> The technologies we need are not in place<u>, and will not be for many years. Unfortunately, energy supply is woefully neglected in current law. Obviously,</u> if <u>U.S.</u> energy costs continue upwards unabated, this will only increase the likelihood that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">foreign manufacturers</span>, who have access to affordable energy, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">will capture U.S. jobs and domestic market share</span>, <u>and consequently increase greenhouse<span style="font-size: 6pt;"> gas emissions. </span></u><br />

It is in our national interest to maintain </span></u>a vigorous steel industry<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The economic stability of the steel industry here at home, and our ability to remain competitive abroad, directly impacts our national security. The efficient low-cost producers that comprise the membership of our domestic steel market can compete effectively against any foreign producer in the global economy. To ensure their stature, the steel industry has invested billions of dollars in modernizing itself while simultaneously improving environmental compliance. It has learned the hard way the benefit of cutting-edge technology. These producers are heavily concentrated in northwest Indiana and at the end of 2006 they employed over 19,000 Americans in that region. Companies like Nucor of Crawfordsville and Steel Dynamics of Pittsboro contribute substantially to the ensuring a healthy local economy and thereby contribute to a stable and healthy national economy. The nation's annual production of over 100 million tons of steel, of which Indiana is the second-largest producer among the states, keeps this country at the top of the worldwide steel industry. However, if the competitive nature of this market is unfairly influenced by steel dumping or by illegal subsidies given to foreign producers by their governments or other entities, the integrity of the domestic and global market is jeopardized. In those instances, the domestic market loses its ability to effectively compete with its global rivals. When that occurs, it negatively impacts the economic stability of our domestic steel industry which in turn threatens our national security. We need to ensure that companies like Nucor and Steel Dynamics have the opportunity to modernize and grow to adequately meet the demands of the global market without the fear of sustaining financial damage from unfair or illegal trade practices. To ensure that our nation's defense remains adequate and capable, we must continue to enable mechanisms that will influence other countries to play by the rules. Simultaneously, we must be cognizant, and take appropriate action, to recognize those instances in which anti-dumping and countervailing duties are no longer required to safeguard our economic and security interests. In either instance, we cannot allow to go unchallenged the continuous violations of international and U.S. trade laws that lend to a skewed market and undercut the ability for fair competition to flourish in the global economy. </span></u>The preservation of the <u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">economic integrity of our domestic </span></u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">steel</span> industry <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">is fundamental to our</span> ability to protect our <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">very existence as a nation</span>.
