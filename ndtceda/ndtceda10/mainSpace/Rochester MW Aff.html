Although this year's topic asks the question of what people should be allowed into the United States, the question does not end there. Legal acceptance into the United States may or may not be granted, but acceptance to citizenship is at the core of the topic. <br />
<br />
Lister 2003 (Ruth &quot;Citizenship: Feminist Perspectives&quot; page 44-48)<br />
<br />
&quot;A double set of actual boundaries...that remain completely outside the agenda of Marshallian theories of citizenship.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This is due to the fact that citizenship was constructed on the basis of exclusion of women throughout history.Both the liberal and republican traditions of citizenship marginalize women in order to define citizenship.<br />
<br />
Lister 2003 (Ruth &quot;Citizenship: Feminist Perspectives&quot; page 70)<br />
<br />
&quot;Where the cloak of invisibility is set aside...for it was by protecting, subsuming and even owning others that white male property owners and family heads become citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that womens' admission to citizenship has not been on the same terms as men. Womens' citizenship as not remained the same, abstract citizenship as granted to men, but rather their citizenship is embodied by the same sexualized and familialized identity that has &quot;bound them in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lister 2003 (Ruth &quot;Citizenship: Feminist Perspectives&quot; page 73)<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not only the supposed weakness of women's bodies that has disqualified them from citizenship...Indifference to the question of women's citizenship also betrays a more general masculine norm in political theory masquerading as universalism so that women are either assumed uncritically to be incorporated in the form of a false gender-neutrality or they are simply forgotten; either way they are effectively invisible.&quot;<br />
<br />
And furthermore, immigrant women are also uniquely affected by the current status of citizenship.<br />
<br />
Bloemraad, Korteweg, Yurdakul 2008 (Irene, Anna, and Gokce &quot;Citizenship and Immigration: Multiculturalism, Assimilation, and Challenges to the Nation-State&quot; Annual Review of Sociology)<br />
<br />
&quot;A final area of research....often excluding (immigrant) women from full citizenship.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is evidence in the case of H-1B and H-4 visa through the perpetuation of instances of forms of violence against women such as domestic violence, exploitive jobs, or loss of child custody. <br />
<br />
Lodhia 2010 (Sharmila &quot;Constructing an Imperfect Citizen: Globalization, National 'Security,' and Violence against South Asian Women&quot; Women's Studies Quarterly Volume 38 No. 1 &amp; 2)<br />
<br />
&quot;H-1B visas are among the few nonimmigrant visa categories that allow 'dual intent,'...At the same time, women who arrive in this country as derivative spouses of H-1B visa holders are deprived of potentially life-saving legal protections against domestic violence as a result.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the ultimate impact is the veiling of the denial of the femal body and denial of agency within citizenship.<br />
<br />
Lister 1997 (Ruth, &quot;Dialectics of Citizenship&quot; acquired from Hypatia vol. 12 no. 4 &quot;Citizenship in Feminism: Identity, Action, and Locale&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;The principle of differentiated universalism can also be applied to the terms on which women's claims to citizenship, as both a status and a practice, are articulated...and that ist has proved very difficult to win recognition of the value of caring work in the construction of social citizenship rights...&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus our advocacy: Karimu and I endorse this year's resolution as an opportunity to re-construct citizenship through a politics of inclusion.<br />
<br />
We must embrace citizenship as both status and practice through a field of inclusion, rather than exclusion through a discussion of politics of solidarity in difference.<br />
<br />
Lister 1997 (Ruth, &quot;Dialectics of Citizenship&quot; acquired from Hypatia vol. 12 no. 4 &quot;Citizenship in Feminism: Identity, Action, and Locale&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;The starting point was to conceptualize citizenship as both status and practice...<u><strong>and the particularizing of rights while maintaining the principles of universalism and equality</strong></u>.&quot;<br />
<br />
And a dialectical approach is the best way for citizenship to be used for feminist theory and action. This provides the best means for agency and challenging the construction of women as passive victims.<br />
<br />
Lister 1997 (Ruth, &quot;Dialectics of Citizenship&quot; acquired from Hypatia vol. 12 no. 4 &quot;Citizenship in Feminism: Identity, Action, and Locale&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;This helps to underline the importance of a dialectical approach...People can be, at the same time, both the subordinate objects of hierarchical power relations and subjects who are agents in their own lives, capable of excercising power in the &quot;generative sense of self-actualization&quot;
