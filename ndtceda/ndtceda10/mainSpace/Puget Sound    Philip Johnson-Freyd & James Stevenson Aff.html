 Part 1 is normalization.<br />
<br />
Richard Adams, a United States citizen, was in love with Anthony Sullivan, an Australian national. They lived together in Colorado in 1975. With Sullivan's visa about to expire, Adams tried to sponsor him for permanent residency in the U.S. The written answer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service made its position clear: Your visa petition ... for classification of Anthony Corbett Sullivan as the spouse of a United States citizen [is] denied for the following reasons: You have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two fag-gots. n1 Three decades later, what has changed? &quot;Faggot&quot; relationships remain fake within the system. n2 And even the word resurfaces. One man wrote us: While traveling abroad I met the person I would spend the rest of my life with, and eventually start a family with. Bog-dan is a citizen of ... the former Yugoslavia. Because of both of our countries' treatment [of] its own gay citizens, it's been impossible to be together at some points. Most of the time I've had to go to Serbia, because after Bogdan tried obtaining a visa at the American Embassy in Belgrade, he was denied, because &quot;they don't give visas to fag couples,&quot; as we were told by the visa officer... . I, being an American, had the preconception that my country was the true land of the free. I guess I was wrong. n3 <br />
<br />
Historically, US immigration policy has served as a means of banishing difference. In order to secure an idealized, pure America, foreign elements are constructed as perverse and dangerous to justify their exclusion. Under this regime, eligibility restrictions for family based visas expressly prohibit queer relationships.<br />
Adam Francoeur, policy coordinator for Immigration Equality and BA at George Washington University in international affairs, &quot; The Enemy Within: Constructions of U.S. Immigration Law and Policy and the Homoterrorist Threat,&quot; Stanford Journal of Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties, 3 Stan.

Still lurking in immigration policy is the universal enforcement of heteronormativity, rendering entire populations as deviant and threatening. Exclusion is broadly applied beyond migrants to mark all LGBTQ persons as second-class and undesirable.<br />
Eithne Luibheid, director of the Institute for LGBT Studies and associate professor of women's studies at the University of Arizona, &quot; Queer/Migration An Unruly Body of Scholarship,&quot; GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Volume 14, Number 2-3, 2008, MUSE<br />

Finally, then, there is a dimension <br />

<br />
Part 2 is plenary powers.<br />
The abusive nature of contemporary immigration regimes is sustained by its protection from judicial review. By codifying immigrant as an issue of national security, the plenary power doctrine enables unchecked sovereign control over foreign nationals.<br />
Mathew Coleman, assistant professor of geography at Ohio State University, “Immigration Geopolitics Beyond the Mexico-US Border.” Antipode, Vol. 39, Issue 1, February 2007, Wiley Interscience<br />
How does one best conceptualize the above developments<br />

Placing immigration in a framework of national security fuels xenophobic violence and oppression. By erasing its social context, migrant securitization allows for unquestioned threat construction and violent governmentality.<br />
Didier Bigo, Professor at King’s College London Department of War studies and MCU Research Professor at Sciences-Po Paris, “Security and Immigration: Toward a Critique of the Governmentality of Unease,” Alternatives Vol. 27, No. 1, 2002<br />
Contrary to so many explanations concerning securitization of <br />

world is one of chaos and urban insecurity. <br />
<br />
Law must heed the call of the other – failure to incorporate ethical responsibility for spectral remainders into juridical structures makes massive unchecked violence inevitable.<br />

<br />
Part 3 is hauntology.<br />
<br />
Exclusive immigration measures do real violence to queer migrants. We should advocate policy change addressing queer access to the immigration system as part of a broader struggle for justice for the phantasmic subjects of exclusion. <br />

Subjectivity is founded on our relation to alterity, which means even if they win we die, you vote aff. Justice demands that our ethico-political approach incorporates the specter of difference in legal change.<br />

Normalization of heterosexuality establishes an invisible center of white heterosexual male privilege, constantly reproducing standards for rationality, desirability, and superiority. This becomes the primary instrument for oppressive power relations and the production of knowledge, providing rationalization for systemic marginalization of the abnormal.<br />

Binational queer relationships have become central in America's &quot;war on terror.&quot; Out cry and horror over terrorists faking relationships to get into the US fuel wider xenophobic attitudes about race, sex, and immigration, justifying increasingly intrusive surveillance and detention measures to ensure population-wide normalization and assimilation.<br />

By legally merging racial and sexual Others into a singular terrorist-queer figure, these policies create the perfect target with which to draw out internal aggression. The &quot;war on terror&quot; is thus waged against the ever-elusive apparition of the terrorist ghost.<br />

 Our political approach solves your argument better - conceptualizing rights as spectral resolves their oppressive functions while affirming their potentiality as productive and good. Because the alt is inevitably haunted by exclusion, there's only a risk that the particularity of the aff is productive and ethical - this is also a reason why the alt solves none of the aff.<br />

Hauntology hints at foundations in much the same way … that thinking back to the problem of rights. <br />
<br />
Our view of the law as ethically valid is preferable to Agamben's pessimism - while we can never fully prevent the possibility that an affirmation of the law might entail some form of violence, this incompleteness of our ability to know and predict the outcomes of our decisions nevertheless gives rise to a contingent view of ethics that enables us to care for Others in a way that their alternative cannot.<br />

Biopolitics requires an investigation of historical context - rejecting the state totalizes it and legitimizes contemporary violence. Responsibility demands that we use the state to work towards justice when the situation demands it.<br />

Calls for citizenship interrupt the law by problemitizing the status of law as such. Unconditional hospitality must begin by interventions in the state in order to move away from our economy of violence. We solve all their state bad args. <br />
Alex Thomson, lecturer in English at the University of Glasgow, 2005, Deconstruction and Democracy, p. 99-100<br />
Beyond the question of language, Derrida argues, his intervention functions as an affirmation: he is speaking ‘for the sans-papiers’. This is a delicate situation. Derrida speaks up for them, … other than this economy of violence.<br />

Only through unconditional hospitality can we make the absolute leap from finite legal appeals to an open acceptance that at once lies beyond juridical law and makes law itself possible. <br />

The limited pie theory, as a justification, makes no sense because it assumes a kind of fungibility of institutional capital that just doesn't comport with reality. How people feel about individual rights decisions will not be determined by whether the Supreme Court has said anything about constitutional federalism. Reactions to Roe v. Wade n41 or Miranda v.

 Observation I: The Status Quo<br />
<br />
Climate change is real and anthropogenic – greenhouse gases cause feedback loops that cause sea level rise.<br />

Advantage I: Environmental Justice<br />

Failure to respond to the problem of climate change for island nations denies human dignity and cultural survival – permanent relocation is the appropriate response.<br />

Advantage II: Climate Migrants<br />
<br />
Global warming will create between 80 and 400 million migrants by 2040 and makes disease spread, economic collapse, terrorism, and war inevitable. Failure to act now prevents future cooperation on climate migrants and makes later solutions impossible.<br />

Biodiversity not only provides direct benefits like food, medicine, and energy; it also affords us a &quot;life support system.&quot; Biodiversity is required for the recycling of essential elements, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. It is also responsible for mitigating pollution, protecting watersheds, and combating soil erosion. Because biodiversity acts as a buffer against excessive variations in weather and climate, it protects us from catastrophic events beyond human control. The importance of biodiversity to a healthy environment has become increasingly clear. We have learned that the future well-being of all humanity depends on our stewardship of the Earth. When we overexploit living resources, we threaten our own survival.<br />

Finally, massive energy shocks and the end of oil are inevitable without the plan. Only confronting global climate change and climate migration now can smooth the transition to renewable energy and ensure adaptation in the future. It’s try or die for the affirmative.<br />
