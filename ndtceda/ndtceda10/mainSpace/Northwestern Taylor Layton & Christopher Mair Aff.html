Contention One—The Myth of the Iconic Victim:<br />
In order to obtain a T-visa, victims are coerced into collaborating with prosecution—this places trafficking policy within the realm of law enforcement<br />
Jayashri Srikantiah, ‘7 (February, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Stanford Law School, “PERFECT VICTIMS AND REAL SURVIVORS: THE ICONIC VICTIM IN DOMESTIC HUMAN TRAFFICKING LAW” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume87n1/documents/SRIKANTIAH" rel="nofollow">http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume87n1/documents/SRIKANTIAH</a> v.2.pdf)<br />
The iconic victim concept … based on the full range of real trafficking stories<br />
<br />
<br />
The cooperation requirement instrumentalizes victims as a tool of law enforcement—this prevents access to T visa benefits<br />
Shannon Lack, ‘8 (Shannon Lack, JD U of Pittsburgh, CIVIL RIGHTS FOR TRAFFICKED PERSONS: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A MORE EFFECTIVE FEDERAL CIVIL REMEDY 26 J.L. &amp; Com. 151, Spring, 2008, lexis)<br />
Despite the advances the TVPA has made in the development … traffickers directly accountable for their exploitative actions.<br />
<br />
<br />
The narrative promoted by the law enforcement approach rests on a dichotomous relationship between victim and trafficker where in reality the conditions are much more complex<br />
Jayashri Srikantiah, ‘7 (February, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Stanford Law School, “PERFECT VICTIMS AND REAL SURVIVORS: THE ICONIC VICTIM IN DOMESTIC HUMAN TRAFFICKING LAW” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume87n1/documents/SRIKANTIAH" rel="nofollow">http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume87n1/documents/SRIKANTIAH</a> v.2.pdf)<br />
A simple mythology that assumes naïve victimhood … serving prosecutorial interests and protecting individual trafficking victims.<br />
<br />
<br />
The iconic victim dictates an androcentric approach to trafficking—stereotypes about the third world are used to prop up the notion that “west is best”<br />

<br />
Powerful interests frame trafficking narratives that prominently feature Good/Evil dichotomies and fuel moral panics over sexuality and “traditional American values”<br />

The problem is, the reduction of human … and chosen it as an issue for public outcry and political leadership.<br />
<br />
<br />
The law and order approach uses a securitarian frame that is detrimental to trafficking victims<br />

According to Kempadoo, states conceive of trafficking … leaving some people … at risk of being re-trafficked.<br />
<br />
<br />
The approach we take to human trafficking enforcement says a lot about how far we are willing to go to enforce rules of inter-human conduct on the global stage<br />

The study of the state - especially theories of sovereignty … in a globalized, race-aware and gendered frame<br />

This epistemological understanding of security is based on gendered threat construction<br />
Ann Tickner, ‘1 [Ann professor at the School of International Relations USC. B.A. in History, U London. M.A. in IR, Yale. PhD in pol sci, Brandeis U Gendering World Politics: Issues and Approaches in the Post-Cold War Era]<br />
New issues and new definitions of security have been … emancipatory agenda—are beginning to undertake such reanalyses<br />
<br />
<br />
That causes extinction<br />

Technology can be used to dominate societies … taking a wider and more humanistic view than these experts<br />
<br />
<br />
Focus on structural issues is the only way to truly achieve peace—conventional risk assessment fails<br />

1. It is necessary to focus more on the … the momentum towards protracted warfare is irreversible.<br />

<br />
Securitarian risk assessment prevents assistance from ever reaching trafficking victims<br />
Jacqueline Berman, ’10 (August, PhD, “Biopolitical Management, Economic Calculation and “Trafficked Women””, International Migration Special Issue: Special Issue on Human Trafficking Volume 48, Issue 4, pages 84–113)<br />
Of course, in a post-September 11th world, it is not surprising … from the labour of those trafficked into their economies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Framing is a key site to shape the terms of trafficking<br />

News debate is part of the “textually mediated discourses” … belong to the constellation of concerns that diverse speakers have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going out looking for savages to lock up and damsels to protect reflects an evangelizing spirit that often leads to violent interventions<br />

<br />
Contention Two—Solvency:<br />
The cooperation requirement shapes the popular cultural representations of the iconic victim—these images only include a narrow set of victims that fits within the law enforcement narrative<br />
Jayashri Srikantiah, ‘7 (February, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Immigrants’ Rights Clinic, Stanford Law School, “PERFECT VICTIMS AND REAL SURVIVORS: THE ICONIC VICTIM IN DOMESTIC HUMAN TRAFFICKING LAW” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume87n1/documents/SRIKANTIAH" rel="nofollow">http://www.bu.edu/law/central/jd/organizations/journals/bulr/volume87n1/documents/SRIKANTIAH</a> v.2.pdf)<br />
E. Cultural Effect on Understandings of Human Trafficking … and future legal decisions regarding trafficking victims.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is impossible to separate analysis of trafficking from narratives—the law and order approach treats trafficking as a linear and episodic event that has a clear beginning and clear end. This approach is inadequate because the material, institutional, and symbolic factors can only be understood in relation to eachother. The way we come to understand those relations are through narratives—A narrative view helps us understand that people’s behaviour is guided by the stories they believe about the events in which they are embedded. What is important is how we orient ourselves towards narratives.<br />
Mona Baker, ‘5 (Professor at Centre for Translation &amp; Intercultural Studies School of Languages, Linguistics and Cultures University of Manchester, “Narratives in and of Translation”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://manchester.academia.edu/documents/0075/2237/Baker_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://manchester.academia.edu/documents/0075/2237/Baker_2005.pdf</a>)<br />
More recent and equally pernicious conceptual … the world. Or at least so this narrative goes<br />
<br />
<br />
We must orient the ballot towards including the other in trafficking policy—bridging the gap in understanding is key to transformative trafficking politics<br />
Jonathan Todres, ‘9 (Associate Professor of Law, Georgia State University College of Law, “LAW, OTHERNESS, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING”, 49 Santa Clara L. Rev. 605)<br />
Human trafficking needs to be understood … reduction in the incidence of human trafficking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Challenging meta-narratives is vital to change trafficking politics<br />
