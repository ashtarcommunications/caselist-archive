 Contention 1: Ghostface Killah<br />
Technological identification has become the centerpiece of security policy at the border. Biometric identification is the U.S.’s primary tool to secure its citizens against the imminent threat of the stranger, creating a risk-society focused on managing anxieties.<br />
Ceyhan, Director of GEEST, 08 [Ayse, Surveilance and Society Vol. 5, Issue 2, “Technologization of Security: Management of Uncertainty and Risk in the Age of Biometrics” Group of Studies and Expertise of Security and Technology, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.surveillance-and-society.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.surveillance-and-society.org</a>]<br />
Often assumed as a consequence … untouchable power.<br />
Risk-society creates the citizen as neurotic, displacing personal responsibility to the state. The need for security predetermines our relationship to alterity.<br />
Isin, prof of social science @ Calumet College, 04 [Engin, Citizenship Studies, Vol 8, No. 3, “The Neurotic Citizen”]<br />
As is well known, Foucault … the neurotic citizen, neuropower and neuropolitics.<br />
Specifically, biometric identification determines future risks through expert calculation and scientific rationality. Decisions of hospitality are made for us, through identification of ‘risky’ persons.<br />
Aas, University of Oslo , Norway, 06 [Katja Franko, Crime Media Culture vol. 2, “‘The body does not lie’: Identity, Risk, and Trust in Technoculture”]<br />
It would be wrong, though, … correspond to computer programmes.<br />
The objectivity of biometric information predetermines to whom our responsibility lies, destroying ethical decision making.<br />
Derrida, Director of Studies at the School for Advanced Study in the Social Sciences, 1995<br />
(Gift of Death, trans. David Willis).<br />
To &quot;subordinate responsibility to … for freedom and for decision.<br />
This certainty of knowledge promotes governance at a distance which makes violence necessary in order to maintain our current lifestyle. The immigrant becomes the easy target on which to displace our anxieties, recreating cycles of violent exclusion.<br />
Bigo, prof of PoliSci @ Institute of Political Studies at Paris, 02 [Didier, “Security and Immigration: Toward a Critique of the Governmentality of Unease” Questia]<br />
The present period is interesting … (so-identified) or groups at risk. (70)<br />
The United States Federal Government should not require biometric identifiers of applicants for employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, and human trafficking-based visas.<br />
Contention 2: The Method, Man<br />
Removing biometric identifiers is an essential step in opening a space for ethical orientation of hospitality to an anonymous Other. Instead of classifying migrants as ‘unsafe,’ the aff embraces the possibility of hospitality to overcome our vulnerabilities.<br />
Kordvani, Melbourne Law School, 07 [Amir, April, “Hospitality, Politics of Mobility, and the Movement of Service Suppliers under the GATS” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ssrn.com/abstract=980864" rel="nofollow">http://ssrn.com/abstract=980864</a>]<br />
The second paradox of hospitality… on borders, names as borders.123<br />
By making ourselves hostage to the needs of the guest, the plan reshapes moral, spatial, and political conceptions that transform politics.<br />
Bernard-Donals, 2005—Michael, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Difficult Freedom: Levinas, Language, and Politics, Diacritics<br />
Is a politics founded in an … hosts, hostages, and guests.<br />

our response to the call of the other is a priori—we must reject totalizing theories that recourse to appropriative thinking<br />
Grob 1999—Leonard, professor of philosophy at Farleigh Dickinson University, Ethics After the Holocaust, p. 8-11<br />
This face-to-face encounter is… simply not good enough!<br />

 Case<br />
We internal link turn their argument- there’s only a risk that our hospitality through inversion solves, whereas they reify the other as an object of hate<br />

 Without political engagement, allows us ot get lost in our neurosis, reinforcing the risk society<br />
Isin 2004, <em>Citizenship Studies,</em> V. 8 and No. 3 “The Neurotic Citizen”)<br />
Restrictions are much more important than visas themselves. Plan is a pre-req<br />
Neumayer, 2006 (Eric, Unequal access to foreign spaces: how states uses visa restrictions to regulate mobility in a globalized world. Transavtions of the INstiute of British Geographers, 31 72-84)<br />
Permutation0 do the plan and all non-competitive parts of the alternative<br />
It solves their impact- allowing some regulation of immigration does not authorize all regulation of immigration- we cans till resist the most dangerous foms of exclusion<br />
