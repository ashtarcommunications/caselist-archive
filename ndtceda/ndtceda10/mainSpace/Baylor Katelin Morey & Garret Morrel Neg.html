Anxiety<br />
our relationship to death both defines the processes of choice and deliberation and the value to life. SUBJECTIVITY falls out of this relationship making each inauthentic response a unique refusal to take on the task of making death our own.<br />
Davis 89<br />
Death is the origin of subjectivity; our inwardness is touched… unshakable regret over opportunities not seized or harmful things done to others.<br />
<br />
AND, THIS CONFRONTATION WITH ANXIETY OUTWEIGHS THEIR EXTINCTION SCENARIOS BECAUSE DESTRUCTION HAS ALREADY occurred IN THE INNER-SPACE.<br />
davis 2k1<br />
[walter a., derascination: historocity, hiroshima, and the tragic imperative, p. 103-4]<br />
We begin with an effort to describe what is the deepest experience—the one most deeply denied. Catastrophic anxiety is that fear that haunts us from within,7… because the breakdown has already occurred.8<br />
<br />
in response to the 1ac, we advocate that the judge engage existential anxiety essentially.<br />
the affirmative’s concern with escalating war is more than a pragmatic concern. it is an expression of existential anxiety. we ought to refuse politically polemic contestation in favor of an existential realization of anxiety.<br />
SWAZO 2K2<br />
[Norman k, “Worth Order and Crisis Theory: Heideggerian Reflections, 12-3]<br />
Such philosophical work is a focus clearly… normative basis for our values we can hope to overcome the destructive proliferation of violently opposing ways of life.3’<br />

Security<br />
SURVIVAL ISOLATES BARE LIFE AS THE FOUNDATION OF POLITICS. THIS SEPERATION OF SPEAKING AND LIVING BEING JUSTIFIES THE EXTERMINATION OF WHOLE POPULATIONS WHO ARE RENDERED INCOMMUNICABLE – INCLUDED ONLY THE BARE SUBSTANCE OF CALCULATION WHICH PRODUCES THEIR EXCLUSION.<br />
Edkins 2K3<br />
[Jenny, Professor of International Politics .at Prifysgol Aberystwyth University, She has degrees from Oxford , where she was a Nuffield Scholar, the City University , the Open University and the University of Wales, Trauma and the memory of politics, pg. 188-189,]<br />
The act of biopower is to try and separate… Hence in its very form, testimony contests sovereign power.<br />
<br />
THE PARADIGM OF SECURITY IS A UNIQUE METHOD OF POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT THAT REQUIRE STHE CONSTANT REFERENCE TO A STATE OF EXCEPTION IN WHICH CATASTROPHES ARE NEVER ACTUALLY ADDRESSED, BUT ONLY REPRODUCED. THE RESULT IS WARFARE AND DEPOLITICIZATION, WHICH TURNS YOUR CASE.<br />
AGAMBEN 2K2 (giorgio, prof of aesthetics @ u of verona, security aand terror, theory and event 5:4, muse, trans by carolina emcke)<br />
Neither Turgot and Quesnay nor the Physiocratic… and not to reduce itself to attempts to control them once they occur.<br />
<br />
THE STATE OF EXCEPTION IS A GENOCIDAL KILLING MACHINE, BUT IT IS NOT AN INEVITABILITY, IT REQUIRES THE CONSTANT THREAT OF DESTRUCTION IN WHICH THE SOVEREIGN IS CALLED UPON TO MAINTAIN THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY. WE MUST REFUSE ALL ATTEMPTS TO RELINK POLITICAL LIFE WITH THE SOVEREIGN EXCLUSION OF BARE LIFE.<br />

Independent Commission CP<br />
CP Text: the United States federal government should establish a standing commission on migration tasked with setting the United States’ migration levels. The United States congress should be given 90 days to review the standing commission’s recommendations. Following the 90 day review period all policies not overturned by the United States congress should be enacted. The recommendation should include: _.<br />
<br />
CP Competes Resolved is a firm decision- Merriam Webster’s dictionary ’04. Congress can say no to any policy from the commission.<br />

Comission would function and set up migration policy-ACIP ’09 (American Council on International Personnel, “Examming Proposals to create a new commission on Employment-Based Immigration,”) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.immigrationworksusa.org/uploaded/file/ACIP%20Commission%20Paper%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigrationworksusa.org/uploaded/file/ACIP%20Commission%20Paper%20Final.pdf</a><br />

Independent Comission recommendations would happen , too difficult to block- North ’10 (David is a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, “Beware of Indirect Immigration Policy Making,”) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cis.org/indirect-immigration-policy-making" rel="nofollow">http://www.cis.org/indirect-immigration-policy-making</a><br />

This article …, legislative, and judicial.<br />
<br />
And, the agent of action test – The Aff has to specify in their plan text what is necessary for the plan to take effect. Not specifying the branch doesn’t meet since the “USFG” isn’t an agent and there wouldn’t be a political channel to implement the plan.<br />

Stoddard, ‘97<br />
(Professor of law at New York University, 72 New York University Law Review 967)<br />
Many of my colleagues … important as what it says.<br />
