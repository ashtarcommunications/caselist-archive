 INTERPRETATION. Admissibility standards apply to all visas under INA §212(a), while eligibility standards relate to specific categories of visas. Eligibility allows you to receive a visa before you travel, while admissibility gets you into the US once you have arrived.<br />
A. Tilman, &quot;An Overview of Immigration Law,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc</a> [date of essay checked with author by email on 7-25-10 DBH]<br />
B. The Act establishes a two check system as the main mechanism for deciding which immigrants are accorded lawful permanent residence.[1] These two checks correspond to two distinct types of limitation on the incoming flow of immigrants. The first limitation is based on the concept of ELIGIBILITY TO FILE AN APPLICATION TO IMMIGRATE. It corresponds to the limits in the Act on the number of immigrants that can be admitted in different categories each year. The second limitation is based on the concept of the individual alien’s ADMISSIBILITY, i.e., certain individual characteristics or attributes that the prospective immigrant must have, or must NOT have, in order to be “lawfully admitted for permanent residence.”[2]<br />
B. VIOLATION. Our interpretation includes and excludes possible affirmatives. The affirmative removes the terrorism admissibility requirement, which is excluded by our interpretation. This does not change eligibility for any of the topic visa categories<br />
Better Clash and Ground. Giving the negative the ground of admissibility allows us to propose PICs to increased or expanded eligibility category visas. Their interpretation takes away PIC ground and avoids a good test of the affirmative. <br />
Communication. They make the word “eligibility” meaningless by making it overlap with “admissibility”. Mooting words leads to misunderstanding, which blocks good communication needed for education.<br />
Bright Line Standard Avoids Extratopicality. The USCIS lists visa name-number categories according to the 4 groups in the topic. If the aff grows one of those government-listed categories, they are topical. Their interpretation would allow them to remove admissibility standards that relate of any category of visa. This is extratopical, and makes it impossible for the judge to make an objective determination of jurisdiction, which is unfair to both sides.<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and communication. It’s a game of competing interpretations.<br />

 SUBPOINT A: CULTURAL FORGETTING. Hospitality sustains hostility BOTH within culture and within our institutions. Hospitality makes it easier for American culture to forget both the violence that created this country and simultaneously makes it easier rationalize xenophobia. <br />

This dimension of his analysis turns AND included these contradictory attitudes of xenophilia and xenophobia.<br />
<br />
B. CO-OPTION<br />
1. EMPIRICALLY, THE GOVT DOES IT ALL THE TIME. We understand that you’re not a social movement, but pro-immigrant mobilizations are easily co-opted by the government into support for mainstream liberal immigration reform.<br />

Our organization was correct to appreciate the significance AND continue to play a dominant political role in the Latino community<br />
<br />
2. RIGHT WING CO-OPTION. Hybridity becomes another tool for the state to fight for. The impact is imperialism and anti-immigration politics<br />

This debate should be about producing EFFECTIVE contestations of citizenship. We need to be careful that our contestations of citizenship do not allow governments to assert their sovereign power more<br />
McNevin, RMIT University, Melbourne, 09<br />
(Anne, New Political Science, Volume 31, Number 2, June)<br />
It remains unclear what sort of political momentum AND negotiate political communities with and beyond the nation-state. <br />
<br />
D) The alternative is to reject the affirmative’s understanding of heteronormativity to open up a space for a personal relationship to violence. Recognizing our own personal responsibility is necessary to form a politics that refuses us to be complacent with the violence around us.<br />

Heterosexuality Is Not Monolithic. Although we are living in times of dec- laration AND argues that they are useful analytical tools for de- bunking myths of monolithic heterosexuality.<br />

Heterosexual identities reinforce the subordination of women- viewing heterosexuality as monolithic prevents women from having separate identities.<br />

Heterosexuality must continually affirm itself- you will never stop the boundaries the heteronormative society puts up to keep itself stable. Challenging it will only produce more boundaries and violence.<br />
