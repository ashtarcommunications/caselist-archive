<strong>Their imagination of a better world is a continuation of the ascetic ideal. This association of all that is good as not of this world expresses a hatred for the only one we’ve got—turns case. Fantasizing about a world without suffering produces creative impotence---only our relationship to life can escape this paradox of resentment—Turanli 2003</strong> [Aydan<span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Turanli</span></span>, Humanities and Social Sciences @ Istanbul University, <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">2003</span></span> “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein” <em>Journal of Nietzsche Studies</em> 26 p. 55-63] <br />
<br />
<strong>Their benevolence towards the oppressed is a thinly veiled attempt to exercise power over the subjugated—Nietzsche 1882</strong> [Freidrich <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Nietzsche</span></span>, Philosopher, <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">1882, </span></span>The Gay Science. P.38-39] <br />
<br />
<strong>Suffering is inevitable-the drive to abolish it holds life in contempt. The tension of the should in misfortune is what cultivates human greatness—Nietzsche 1886</strong> [Freidrich <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Nietzsche</span></span>, Philosopher, <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">1886</span></span>, <span class="underline">Beyond Good and Evil</span> P.153-154] <br />
<br />
<strong>The ultimate result of this negative orientation toward life is the inability to live life to its fullest. Instead, the affirmative holds life in contempt for its pains, never understanding that life is suffering, starvation, and dying. The desire to seek redemption from life through the creation of a future moral order annihilates life in the present. This is the worst possible danger: our existence becomes a dreary perpetuation of biological life, devoid of meaning, waiting only for passive death—Nietzsche 1872</strong> [Freidrich <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Nietzsche</span></span>, Philosopher, <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">1872, </span></span>The Birth of Tragedy. Translated Golffing, 1956, p. 9-11] <br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative’s embracing of humanity designates an unhuman enemy—endless wars and violence have been carried out in the name of their universal appeal to the human—Rasch 2003</strong> [William <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Rasch</span></span>, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, <span class="TagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">2003, </span></span>“Human rights as geopolitics” <em>Cultural Critique</em> 54, Spring. p 135-6] <br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">The alternative is to embrace suffering as something positive and necessary to life. Reject the idea that suffering is something to be avoided—Wrisley NoDate</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> [George Wrisley-University of Iowa Philosophy Department- No Date Given, “What Should Our Attitude Towards Suffering Be,” pg. 4-5]</span><br />
