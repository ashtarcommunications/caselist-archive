<span style="font-weight: normal;">Focusing on trying to include certain people only creates a triumphant narrative for the sovereign giving in the power to create and inclusive exclusion. The AFF’s legal reforms and citizenship VISA’s don’t actually create social equality.</span><br />

The alternative is to rject the AFF in favor of a method of culturally analyzing the foundations of sovereignty <br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Un-thought assumptions matter: the visas system is more of a case by case discretionary system where the cultural proclivities of the individual decision makers matters more than the stated rules, the politics of immigration must take this into consideration</span><br />
