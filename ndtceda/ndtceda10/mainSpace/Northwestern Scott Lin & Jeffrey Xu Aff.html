n order to obtain a T-visa, victims are coerced into collaborating with prosecution—this places trafficking policy within the realm of law enforcement<br />

&quot;The iconic victim concept is shaped not only by concerns about undocumented migration, but also by the statutory and regulatory focus on &quot;<br />

&quot;trafficking policy should be based on the full range of real trafficking stories&quot;<br />

The cooperation requirement instrumentalizes victims as a tool of law enforcement—this prevents access to T visa benefits<br />

The narrative promoted by the law enforcement approach rests on a dichotomous relationship between victim and trafficker where in reality the conditions are much more complex<br />

The iconic victim dictates an androcentric approach to trafficking—stereotypes about the third world are used to prop up the notion that “west is best”<br />

The cooperation requirement shapes the popular cultural representations of the iconic victim—these images only include a narrow set of victims that fits within the law enforcement narrative<br />

&quot;discourse and future legal decisions regarding trafficking victims.257&quot;<br />
<br />
It is impossible to separate analysis of trafficking from narratives—the law and order approach treats trafficking as a linear and episodic event that has a clear beginning and clear end. This approach is inadequate because the material, institutional, and symbolic factors can only be understood in relation to eachother. The way we come to understand those relations are through narratives—A narrative view helps us understand that people’s behaviour is guided by the stories they believe about the events in which they are embedded. What is important is how we orient ourselves towards narratives.<br />
Mona Baker, ‘5 (Professor at Centre for Translation &amp; Intercultural Studies School of Languages, Linguistics and Cultures University of Manchester, “Narratives in and of Translation”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://manchester.academia.edu/documents/0075/2237/Baker_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://manchester.academia.edu/documents/0075/2237/Baker_2005.pdf</a>)<br />

We must orient the ballot towards including the other in trafficking policy—bridging the gap in understanding is key to transformative trafficking politics<br />
Jonathan Todres, ‘9 (Associate Professor of Law, Georgia State University College of Law, “LAW, OTHERNESS, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING”, 49 Santa Clara L. Rev. 605)<br />
&quot;Human trafficking needs to be understood in the larger context of movement of persons globally, as &quot;in most cases [*667] (including most cases of trafficking) this &quot;<br />

&quot;systemic issues, including the operation of otherness, will we see a significant reduction in the incidence of human trafficking.&quot;<br />
