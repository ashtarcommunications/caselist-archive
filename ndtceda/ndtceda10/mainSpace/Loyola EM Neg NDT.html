 1nc: Integration/inclusion bad, debate and other structures of oppression will collapse upon themselves, competing methodology, method of terrorism, symbolic gesture better approach to material violence, criticism is a bad staregy , racial focus creates new forms of excluded and oppressed others<br />
<br />
2nr: we should burn down debate, criticism is bad, they essentialize and homogenize us which proves our arguments about racial oppression, perm is a form of integration and integration bad, aff demands new sidewalkds, we say walk where you want, appeals to institutions fail, narratives should not be tied to larger stategy of criticms. <br />

Criticism fails. Foucault’s project mirrors the panoptic system of power that he so vehemently criticizes by making visible the whole of the social body. Instead of this endless tracing we must recognize power as an illusion.<br />
<br />
Thomas 92 [Calvin Emerson Faculty Fellow in Modern Letters as Syracuse University “Baudrillard’s Seduction of Foucault” in Jean Baudrillard: The Disappearance of Art and Politics, pg 134]<br />
<br />
Baudrillard is not accusing Foucault of imagining… the seduction that is elsewhere.<br />
<br />
We are past the golden age of disillusionment; criticism only helps maintain the illusion of the object by allowing it to seep further and further into our lives<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 96 [Jean, Smart Frency, The Perfect Crime, Verso pp 27-28]<br />
<br />
IN what was the gold age of joyful disillusionment… his own clone, before he actually was cloned.<br />
<br />
We must wage theoretical terrorism against the Foucauldian paradigm of knowledge and power that believes itself to be positiviistically true. Refuse the call for knowledge to make everything visible and productive. <br />
<br />
Thomas 92 [Calvin Emerson Faculty Fellow in Modern Letters as Syracuse University “Baudrillard’s Seduction of Foucault” in Jean Baudrillard: The Disappearance of Art and Politics, pg 132-133]<br />
<br />
While Foucault’s post-structuralism remains… and sexuality are productive theories<br />
<br />
Foucault’s theory mirrors perfectly the power structure that he opposes by making everything visible. His hyperreal theory ypersaturates the social and extends the domain of capital. Your argument allows power to jerk itself off.<br />
<br />

<br />
Racism emerges as an artificial production of otheness in an age of assimilation and otherness; integration breeds hated.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 2k2 (Jean, Smart Frenchy, Screened Out, Verso, pg 55]<br />

Media information no longer order of representation. Images of war and biolence are no longer tracible back to the reality of the event. Media images are as much an instrument of war as bombs<br />
Baudrillard 5 The Intelligence of Evil or the Lucidity Pact p.77<br />
In the sphere…representation is severed<br />
<br />
To use suffering of others as the quilting point for your reality reveals profound ressentiment: a refusal to credit people with ability to escape material experience for thepurposes of having a backdrop by which to juxtapose the dream-like nature of first world bourgeois reality<br />
Baudrillard 96 The Perfect Crime p.95<br />
But surely, say…begins at home<br />
<br />
Masses are indifferent – no one cares about your project<br />
Baudrillard ‘8 Fatal Strategies, Semiotext(e) pp.126-128<br />
This would be…joyous and seductive<br />
<br />
Terrorism is more violent than violent; it’s a hostrage taking where even your death and meaning are out of your ahnds. In the nuclear system of securitization we are thus all hostrages, removed of a meaningful death by a system of insurance which makes all live equiavalence by statistical indifference.<br />
Baudrillard 2k8 Fatal Strategies, Semiotext(e) pp.55-58<br />
Violence is anomic…in its essence.<br />
<br />
We internal link turn their interpretation in that its politics are passive<br />

According to Nietzsche…type of tyrant.<br />
<br />
Death functions in the reduction of things to inert objects of knowledge defined by their exchange value, universal equivalence, only proves no unique value. Information itself only serves as a testimony to the grand meaningingless of our civilization. Buried under mountains of information, all the world has become a museum.<br />
Baudrillard 76, Symbolic Exchange and Death, p.185<br />
Pursued and censured…system of writing<br />

To quilt reality around suffering is to ignore the survival-instinct one has in the face of atrocity is to deny the reality of the event(s) in question. In an age in which we are unsure of our reality, we call upon the suffering of others to open up corridors of meaning from which we vampirically drain them of their illusions in the name of our reality<br />
