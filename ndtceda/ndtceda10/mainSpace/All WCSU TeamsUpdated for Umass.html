The la Boétiean notion of withdrawing popular consent is based on the premise that power dynamics operate in the interactive relationship between ruler and ruled. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>If people draw upon this power source they can fundamentally alter existing political structures and practices. Thus, by engaging in street demonstration and protest migration, as the East Germans did, common citizens are said to be interfering directly with power relations.</u></span></strong> Foucault shares some of these theoretical assumptions. He defines the exercise of power, somewhat like la Boétie, as 'a mode of action upon the actions of others', which indicates that his object of analysis is not power itself, but power relations. </span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">12 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Foucault does not deny that institutions are crucial embodiments of power. Indeed, they are often the place where power is inscribed and crystallised. Yet, <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>the fundamental point of anchorage of power relations</u></span></strong>, Foucault claims, <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>is always located outside institutions, deeply entrenched within the social nexus. Hence, instead of looking at power from the vantage point of institutions, one must analyse institutions from the standpoint of power relations.</u> </span></strong></span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">13</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"> The shared concern with how power functions relationally lead Foucault and la Boétie away from what most <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>modern theorists (and international relations scholars in particular) have constituted as the key focus of power analyses: the state. From a relational perspective, the state is only one among many sites of power, a super-structural site that operates primarily on the grounds of other, already existing power networks</u></span></strong>. </span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">14 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Foucault and la Boétie also diverge from the common tendency to define power primarily as a negative, restraining and repressive force. Both imbue power with an important positive and enabling component. In the la Boétiean tradition, it is the ability <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>to overcome domination through the withdrawal of popular consent</u></span></strong>. With Foucault things are more complicated. His earlier so-called archaeological phase clearly privileges systemic and discursive restraints over the individual's capacity to employ power for emancipatory objectives. </span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">15 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">His later work, however, revolves around a more affirmative core, one that sees power not just as a negative and repressive force, but at least as much as something enabling, an opportunity, an instrument of resistance. </span></span></span><br />

It imposes a patriarchal vision upon social dynamics and then objectifies this form of domination.</span></u></span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"> Gayatri Spivak is one of many authors who point towards the grave consequences of historiographical systems of exclusion. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>Looking at colonial and post-colonial contexts, she argues that despite female participation in insurgency movements, the annihilation of women's voices from the representation of things past has led to persistent practices of subjugation.</u></span></strong> </span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">35</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"> The power of discursive practices becomes most apparent when one observes development patterns over a long time-span. Gerda Lerner examines how patriarchy functioned and evolved throughout the Middle Ages and modernity. She argues convincingly that grave consequences arose from men's ability to frame history, to define what a political issue is and what is not. </span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">36 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Men had access to education. They wrote history, transmitted knowledge and built upon their insight, generation after generation. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>Because women were often denied access to education, they were also deprived of passing on their knowledge to subsequent generations of women</u></span></strong>. In making this claim, Lerner implicitly refutes Simone de Beauvoir's position that women's powerlessness is to be explained by the passive role that they have fulfilled historically. </span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">37 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Lerner, by contrast, argues that there was no lack of outspoken women who advanced insightful critiques of patriarchy. She draws attention to Hildegard von Bingen and Christine de Pizan who, writing in the twelfth and fifteenth century respectively, advanced powerful feminist criticisms of biblical texts. </span><span style="color: #264458; font-size: 12pt;">38 </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">But this critique was largely in vain. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>As a result of their marginalisation from religious and philosophical thought, critical authors like von Bingen and de Pizan could, in the long run, neither influence patriarchal practices nor further the creation of a feminist consciousness. Traces of their work were largely erased by the overwhelming mass of masculine historiographers.</u></span></strong></span></span></span><br />

The economic integration of immigrants of color in the United States has continued to depend on immigrants’ vulnerability as undocumented workers. Hondagneu-Soleto has remarked: <u>Three critical factors distinguish undocumented immigrants and refugees from citizens and immigrants with legal status: an outlawed presence, the criminalization of employment, and exclusion from social entitlements.</u> Undocumented immigrants are, first of all, denied the right to enter the nation-state legally. <span class="underline"><u>They enter surreptitiously, crossing on foot at night or hidden in trucks, or on commercial jets using falsified documents; or they may enter as authorized temporary legal status, on a tourist or student visa, and then overstay visa extensions.</u></span> Their existence within the national-political territory is outlawed, they live in fear of detection, and in all public and bureaucratic settings, they must attempt to “pass” as legally authorized persons. (1996, 105) <u>This highlights</u> the general pattern of <u>how immigration status, mediated by the state’s policies, is a primary source of vulnerability and exploitation</u>. Increasingly, immigrants of color are being incorporated into the economy, through the help of the state’s racializing and feminizing immigration laws, as inexpensive, casualized, and flexible labor. Clearly, Indian IT workers are not undocumented workers and are by no means subjected to the extreme threats and criminalization that working-class undocumented workers routinely encounter. <u><span class="underline">These differences notwith-standing, we must rethink how, despite documented status, the demands of neoliberal capitalism and contemporary visa regimes produce certain <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[End Page 105]</span></span></u><span class="underline"><u>deeply marginalized and vulnerable groups of immigrant workers and question to what extent a “valid” visa status confers adequate protection and legitimacy.</u></span> </span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0.2in 0pt 0in;"><span class="underline"><u>Immigrant progress cannot be made on the backs of blacks (or workers). Otherwise, we will end up reinforcing the subjugation of people of color by the white ruling class. Fighting for immigrant rights means also fighting against the corporate capitalist class. Business and Bush have been &quot;pro-immigrant&quot; for good reasons they want a particular brand of immigrant policy that provides a pool of cheap, abundant, and pliable labor.</u></span> Of course, they also seek high-tech workers, teachers, physicians, and nurses, among others, who fit in the racial and class division of labor above blacks and other native workers. Clearly, workers of all stripes have an interest in fighting against such policies. Thus, we argue, immigrant rights without worker rights is a formula for disaster.15</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0.2in 0pt 0in;">Similarly, blacks have a stake in the emancipation of immigrants, particularly the undocumented. As David Bacon (2007: 66) observes, <span class="underline"><u>&quot;inequality is the most important product of US immigration policy, and a conscious one.&quot; Essentially, US immigration policy is based on capital's need for a reserve army of cheap labor. Predictably, it reproduces inequalities and spreads the pain. Immigrants - especially the undocumented - do not have equal rights.</u> </span>As with practices rooted in slavery and the Black Codes, making someone &quot;illegal&quot; justifies exclusion and subordination. <span class="underline"><u>Weekly government raids on the undocumented, resulting in mass incarceration and deportations, assure that the state of terror remains unbroken (Chacon and Davis 2006). Equity as a goal in itself can foster common ground, as can the goal of secure jobs at a living wage, and rights in workplaces and communities. Successful struggles for these goals require political unity among diverse constituencies.</u></span></span><br />

In the struggle for equal pay for equal work, an end to racial and sexual stereotyping of jobs, elimination of discriminatory hiring, promotion, and retention policies, and affirmative action and restitution for past discrimination, women and African-Americans and homosexuals have struggled to limit the power of capital</u>. Some political economists have argued that the next phase of struggle against discrimination is likely to be the development of standards of comparative worth, by which to judge whether employers are illegally discriminating in the money awarded for unequal or dissimilar jobs; here disadvantaged groups will directly challenge the employer's right to set wage rates. Moreover in the 1980s and 1990s the increasingly desperate plight of unemployed African-Americans, Hispanics, and women<u>, the increasing number of patients with AIDS, and the situation of the homeless is linked to and rooted in capitalist priorities and policies, which in the United States take the form of attacks on labor and welfare and capital flight toward regions with fewer environmental restrictions, weaker unions, and more raw materials.</u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span></span><br />

What if you feel no negativity, if you are content to say 'we are, and the world is'? <u>It is hard to believe that anyone is so at home with the world that they do not feel revulsion at the hunger, violence and inequality that surrounds them. It is much more likely that the revulsion or dissonance is consciously or unconsciously suppressed, either in the interests of a quiet life or, much more simply, because pretending not to see or feel the horrors of the world carries direct material benefits.</u> <u>In order to protect our jobs, our visas, our profits, our chances of receiving good grades, our sanity, we pretend not to see, we sanitise our own perception, filtering</u> </span><br />

The negativity, the revulsion at exploitation and violence, is buried completely, drowned in the concrete of the foundation blocks of social science just as surely as, in some parts of the world, the bodies of sacrificed animals are buried by builders in the foundation blocks of houses or bridges. Such theory is, as Adorno (1990, p. 365) puts it, ‘in the nature of the musical accompaniment with which the SS liked to drown out the screams of its victims’. It is against such suppression of pain that this book is directed.</span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none;">But what is the point? Our scream is a scream of frustration, the discontent of the powerless. But if we are powerless, there is nothing we can do. And if we manage to become powerful, by building a party or taking up arms or winning an election, then we shall be no different from all the other powerful in history. So there is no way out, no breaking the circularity of power. What can we do? Change the world without taking power. Ha! ha! Very funny.</span>
