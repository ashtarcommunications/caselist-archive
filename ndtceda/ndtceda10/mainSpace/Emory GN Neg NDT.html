Expansion of arid lands results in extinction<br />
Barlow 2001(Maude, National Chairperson, Council of Canadians Chair, IFG Committee on the Globalization of Water, &quot;Blue Gold: The Global Water Crisis and the Commodification of the World's Water Supply&quot;)<br />
However, if the earth's surface is paved over, denuded of forests and meadows, and drained of natural springs and creeks, the drop will not form part of river basins and continental watersheds, where it is needed by people and animals, but head out to sea, where it will be stored. It is like rain falling onto a huge roof, or umbrella; everything underneath stays dry and the water runs off to the perimeter. The consequent reduction in continental water basins results in reduced water evaporation from the earth's surface, and becomes a net loss, while the seas begin to rise. In Slovakia, the scientists found, for every 1 percent of roofing, paving, car parks and highways constructed, water supplies decrease in volume by more than 100 billion meters per year. Kravèík issues a dire warning about the growing number of what he calls the earth's &quot;hot stains&quot;—places already drained of water. The &quot;drying out&quot; of the earth will cause massive global warming, with the attendant extremes in weather: drought, decreased protection from the atmosphere, increased solar radiation, decreased biodiversity, melting of the polar icecaps, submersion of vast territories, massive continental desertification and, eventually, &quot;global collapse.&quot; <br />
Ag collapse results in global conflict<br />
Calvin 1998 (William, Theoretical Neurophysiologist – U Washington, Atlantic Monthly, January, Vol 281, No. 1, p. 47-64)<br />
The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands -- if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem -- and could lead to a Third World War -- but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.<br />
Power grid shutdown would cause nuclear meltdowns<br />
Caldicott ‘5 (Helen, president of the Nuclear Policy Research Institute, “Nuclear-war threat still very real” Interview with Martin Sieff, 18 May 2005, lexis)<br />
There are 103 nuclear power plants across the United States. They all rely on external electricity supply that powers their water-coolant systems. If these were all knocked out, you would run the risk of more than 100 Chernobyl-scale nuclear core meltdowns across the United States. All the power plants have their own back-up generators, of course, but they would all need time crank up and too often their testing and maintenance has been neglected because they so seldom, if ever, have had to be used in the past, and some of them don't work when they're supposed to. Therefore there would indeed be a real risk of many Chernobyls all over the place.<br />
Meltdowns would cause extinction<br />
Wasserman ‘1 (Harvey, Senior Editor – Free Press, “America's Terrorist Nuclear Threat to Itself”, October, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2001/10/00_wasserman_nuclear-threat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2001/10/00_wasserman_nuclear-threat.htm</a>)<br />
The assault would not require a large jet. The safety systems are extremely complex and virtually indefensible. One or more could be wiped out with a wide range of easily deployed small aircraft, ground-based weapons, truck bombs or even chemical/biological assaults aimed at the operating work force. Dozens of US reactors have repeatedly failed even modest security tests over the years. Even heightened wartime standards cannot guarantee protection of the vast, supremely sensitive controls required for reactor safety. Without continous monitoring and guaranteed water flow, the thousands of tons of radioactive rods in the cores and the thousands more stored in those fragile pools would rapidly melt into super-hot radioactive balls of lava that would burn into the ground and the water table and, ultimately, the Hudson. Indeed, a jetcrash like the one on 9/11 or other forms of terrorist assault at Indian Point could yield three infernal fireballs of molten radioactive lava burning through the earth and into the aquifer and the river. Striking water they would blast gigantic billows of horribly radioactive steam into the atmosphere. Prevailing winds from the north and west might initially drive these clouds of mass death downriver into New York City and east into Westchester and Long Island. But at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, winds ultimately shifted around the compass to irradiate all surrounding areas with the devastating poisons released by the on-going fiery torrent. At Indian Point, thousands of square miles would have been saturated with the most lethal clouds ever created or imagined, depositing relentless genetic poisons that would kill forever. In nearby communities like Buchanan, Nyack, Monsey and scores more, infants and small children would quickly die en masse. Virtually all pregnant women would spontaneously abort, or ultimately give birth to horribly deformed offspring. Ghastly sores, rashes, ulcerations and burns would afflict the skin of millions. Emphysema, heart attacks, stroke, multiple organ failure, hair loss, nausea, inability to eat or drink or swallow, diarrhea and incontinance, sterility and impotence, asthma, blindness, and more would kill thousands on the spot, and doom hundreds of thousands if not millions. A terrible metallic taste would afflict virtually everyone downwind in New York, New Jersey and New England, a ghoulish curse similar to that endured by the fliers who dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagaskai, by those living downwind from nuclear bomb tests in the south seas and Nevada, and by victims caught in the downdrafts from Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Then comes the abominable wave of cancers, leukemias, lymphomas, tumors and hellish diseases for which new names will have to be invented, and new dimensions of agony will beg description. Indeed, those who survived the initial wave of radiation would envy those who did not. Evacuation would be impossible, but thousands would die trying. Bridges and highways would become killing fields for those attempting to escape to destinations that would soon enough become equally deadly as the winds shifted. Attempts to quench the fires would be futile. At Chernobyl, pilots flying helicopters that dropped boron on the fiery core died in droves. At Indian Point, such missions would be a sure ticket to death. Their utility would be doubtful as the molten cores rage uncontrolled for days, weeks and years, spewing ever more devastation into the eco-sphere. More than 800,000 Soviet draftees were forced through Chernobyl's seething remains in a futile attempt to clean it up. They are dying in droves. Who would now volunteer for such an American task force? The radioactive cloud from Chernobyl blanketed the vast Ukraine and Belarus landscape, then carried over Europe and into the jetstream, surging through the west coast of the United States within ten days, carrying across our northern tier, circling the globe, then coming back again. The radioactive clouds from Indian Point would enshroud New York, New Jersey, New England, and carry deep into the Atlantic and up into Canada and across to Europe and around the globe again and again. The immediate damage would render thousands of the world's most populous and expensive square miles permanently uninhabitable. All five boroughs of New York City would be an apocalyptic wasteland. The World Trade Center would be rendered as unusable and even more lethal by a jet crash at Indian Point than it was by the direct hits of 9/11. All real estate and economic value would be poisonously radioactive throughout the entire region. Irreplaceable trillions in human capital would be forever lost. As at Three Mile Island, where thousands of farm and wild animals died in heaps, and as at Chernobyl, where soil, water and plant life have been hopelessly irradiated, natural eco-systems on which human and all other life depends would be permanently and irrevocably destroyed, Spiritually, psychologically, financially, ecologically, our nation would never recover. This is what we missed by a mere forty miles near New York City on September 11. Now that we are at war, this is what could be happening as you read this. There are 103 of these potential Bombs of the Apocalypse now operating in the United States. They generate just 18% of America's electricity, just 8% of our total energy. As with reactors elsewhere, the two at Indian Point have both been off-line for long periods of time with no appreciable impact on life in New York. Already an extremely expensive source of electricity, the cost of attempting to defend these reactors will put nuclear energy even further off the competitive scale. Since its deregulation crisis, California---already the nation's second-most efficient state---cut further into its electric consumption by some 15%. Within a year the US could cheaply replace virtually with increased efficiency all the reactors now so much more expensive to operate and protect. Yet, as the bombs fall and the terror escalates, Congress is fast-tracking a form of legal immunity to protect the operators of reactors like Indian Point from liability in case of a meltdown or terrorist attack. Why is our nation handing its proclaimed enemies the weapons of our own mass destruction, and then shielding from liability the companies that insist on continuing to operate them? Do we take this war seriously? Are we committed to the survival of our nation? If so, the ticking reactor bombs that could obliterate the very core of our life and of all future generations must be shut down.<br />
Space war causes extinction<br />
Mitchell, et al 01 -Associate Professor of Communication and Director of Debate at the University of Pittsburgh<br />
(Dr. Gordon, ISIS Briefing on Ballistic Missile Defence, “Missile Defence: Trans-Atlantic Diplomacy at a Crossroads”, No. 6 July,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.isisuk.demon.co.uk/0811/isis/uk/bmd/no6.html</a>)<br />
The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense ‘use or lose’ pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting. Death Start with automated ‘hair trigger’ devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict. Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed ‘complexlyinteractive, tightly coupled’ industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, ‘[t]he odd term “normal accident” is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable’.36 Deployment of space weapons with predelegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to “normal accidents’. It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, ‘even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage- even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size!’.37 In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: ’One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people’. Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever seen.<br />
Cyberwarfare causes space war<br />
Coleman, 10 (Kevin Coleman, Defense Tech Chief Cyber War Correspondent, Cyber War = Space War, March 1st, 2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://defensetech.org/2010/03/01/cyber-war-space-war/#ixzz1948Fvj1r" rel="nofollow">http://defensetech.org/2010/03/01/cyber-war-space-war/#ixzz1948Fvj1r</a> )<br />
While the satellite broadband market slowed in 2009 because of the poor economy, it still increased. The market continues to expand after U.S. regulators outlined the national broadband plan that allows satellite operators to use their radio spectrum for Internet traffic. That is why cyber security professionals are so concerned about the convergence of cyber space and space. Its becoming increasingly evident that any future war between modern militaries would be both a space war and a cyber war, in fact, they would be one and the same. Russia, China, and the U.S. have all stated they don’t want a space war, but are all preparing for one if one occurs. That sounds so familiar – oh wait a minute, didn’t Russia, China and the U.S. say the same thing about cyber war? Yes, they did. Satellites in geostationary orbits provide broadband connectivity to businesses and customers. Those satellites and their computer control ground stations present a viable target for offensive cyber actions. A hacker could disrupt or interfere with satellite control communications and could disrupt the delivery of broadband services. In the absence of such command signals, a satellite would malfunction. Worldwide attention focused on China’s successful anti-satellite missile test. While military officials question the scale and progress of the Chinese anti-satellite program, one has to wonder if China has already tested their anti-satellite cyber weapon. Military leaders are all too aware of the convergence of space and cyber space. An increasing percentage of military operations occur in cyber space and are integrated with and dependent on communication satellite systems in outer space.<br />
Cyber warfare ensures accidental nuclear war – multiple warrants<br />
Fritz ‘9 (Jason - former Captain of the U.S. Army, July, Hacking Nuclear Command and Control)<br />
The US uses the two-man rule to achieve a higher level of security in nuclear affairs. Under this rule two authorized personnel must be present and in agreement during critical stages of nuclear command and control. The President must jointly issue a launch order with the Secretary of Defense; Minuteman missile operators must agree that the launch order is valid; and on a submarine, both the commanding officer and executive officer must agree that the order to launch is valid. In the US, in order to execute a nuclear launch, an Emergency Action Message (EAM) is needed. This is a preformatted message that directs nuclear forces to execute a specific attack. The contents of an EAM change daily and consist of a complex code read by a human voice. Regular monitoring by shortwave listeners and videos posted to YouTube provide insight into how these work. These are issued from the NMCC, or in the event of destruction, from the designated hierarchy of command and control centres. Once a command centre has confirmed the EAM, using the two-man rule, the Permissive Action Link (PAL) codes are entered to arm the weapons and the message is sent out. These messages are sent in digital format via the secure Automatic Digital Network and then relayed to aircraft via single-sideband radio transmitters of the High Frequency Global Communications System, and, at least in the past, sent to nuclear capable submarines via Very Low Frequency (Greenemeier 2008, Hardisty 1985). The technical details of VLF submarine communication methods can be found online, including PC-based VLF reception. Some reports have noted a Pentagon review, which showed a potential “electronic back door into the US Navy’s system for broadcasting nuclear launch orders to Trident submarines” (Peterson 2004). The investigation showed that cyber terrorists could potentially infiltrate this network and insert false orders for launch. The investigation led to “elaborate new instructions for validating launch orders” (Blair 2003). Adding further to the concern of cyber terrorists seizing control over submarine launched nuclear missiles; The Royal Navy announced in 2008 that it would be installing a Microsoft Windows operating system on its nuclear submarines (Page 2008). The choice of operating system, apparently based on Windows XP, is not as alarming as the advertising of such a system is. This may attract hackers and narrow the necessary reconnaissance to learning its details and potential exploits. It is unlikely that the operating system would play a direct role in the signal to launch, although this is far from certain. Knowledge of the operating system may lead to the insertion of malicious code, which could be used to gain accelerating privileges, tracking, valuable information, and deception that could subsequently be used to initiate a launch. Remember from Chapter 2 that the UK’s nuclear submarines have the authority to launch if they believe the central command has been destroyed. Attempts by cyber terrorists to create the illusion of a decapitating strike could also be used to engage fail-deadly systems. Open source knowledge is scarce as to whether Russia continues to operate such a system. However evidence suggests that they have in the past. Perimetr, also known as Dead Hand, was an automated system set to launch a mass scale nuclear attack in the event of a decapitation strike against Soviet leadership and military. In a crisis, military officials would send a coded message to the bunkers, switching on the dead hand. If nearby ground-level sensors detected a nuclear attack on Moscow, and if a break was detected in communications links with top military commanders, the system would send low-frequency signals over underground antennas to special rockets. Flying high over missile fields and other military sites, these rockets in turn would broadcast attack orders to missiles, bombers and, via radio relays, submarines at sea. Contrary to some Western beliefs, Dr. Blair says, many of Russia's nuclear-armed missiles in underground silos and on mobile launchers can be fired automatically. (Broad 1993) Assuming such a system is still active, cyber terrorists would need to create a crisis situation in order to activate Perimetr, and then fool it into believing a decapitating strike had taken place. While this is not an easy task, the information age makes it easier. Cyber reconnaissance could help locate the machine and learn its inner workings. This could be done by targeting the computers high of level official’s—anyone who has reportedly worked on such a project, or individuals involved in military operations at underground facilities, such as those reported to be located at Yamantau and Kosvinksy mountains in the central southern Urals (Rosenbaum 2007, Blair 2008) Indirect Control of Launch Cyber terrorists could cause incorrect information to be transmitted, received, or displayed at nuclear command and control centres, or shut down these centres’ computer networks completely. In 1995, a Norwegian scientific sounding rocket was mistaken by Russian early warning systems as a nuclear missile launched from a US submarine. A radar operator used Krokus to notify a general on duty who decided to alert the highest levels. Kavkaz was implemented, all three chegets activated, and the countdown for a nuclear decision began. It took eight minutes before the missile was properly identified—a considerable amount of time considering the speed with which a nuclear response must be decided upon (Aftergood 2000). Creating a false signal in these early warning systems would be relatively easy using computer network operations. The real difficulty would be gaining access to these systems as they are most likely on a closed network. However, if they are transmitting wirelessly, that may provide an entry point, and information gained through the internet may reveal the details, such as passwords and software, for gaining entrance to the closed network. If access was obtained, a false alarm could be followed by something like a DDoS attack, so the operators believe an attack may be imminent, yet they can no longer verify it. This could add pressure to the decision making process, and if coordinated precisely, could appear as a first round EMP burst. Terrorist groups could also attempt to launch a non-nuclear missile, such as the one used by Norway, in an attempt to fool the system. The number of states who possess such technology is far greater than the number of states who possess nuclear weapons. Obtaining them would be considerably easier, especially when enhancing operations through computer network operations. Combining traditional terrorist methods with cyber techniques opens opportunities neither could accomplish on their own. For example, radar stations might be more vulnerable to a computer attack, while satellites are more vulnerable to jamming from a laser beam, thus together they deny dual phenomenology. Mapping communications networks through cyber reconnaissance may expose weaknesses, and automated scanning devices created by more experienced hackers can be readily found on the internet. Intercepting or spoofing communications is a highly complex science. These systems are designed to protect against the world’s most powerful and well funded militaries. Yet, there are recurring gaffes, and the very nature of asymmetric warfare is to bypass complexities by finding simple loopholes. For example, commercially available software for voice-morphing could be used to capture voice commands within the command and control structure, cut these sound bytes into phonemes, and splice it back together in order to issue false voice commands (Andersen 2001, Chapter 16). Spoofing could also be used to escalate a volatile situation in the hopes of starting a nuclear war. “ “In June 1998, a group of international hackers calling themselves Milw0rm hacked the web site of India’s Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) and put up a spoofed web page showing a mushroom cloud and the text “If a nuclear war does start, you will be the first to scream” (Denning 1999). Hacker web-page defacements like these are often derided by critics of cyber terrorism as simply being a nuisance which causes no significant harm. However, web-page defacements are becoming more common, and they point towards alarming possibilities in subversion. During the 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, a counterfeit letter of apology from Prime Minister Andrus Ansip was planted on his political party website (Grant 2007). This took place amid the confusion of mass DDoS attacks, real world protests, and accusations between governments.<br />
Specifically, an accidental launch from a submarine would lead to full scale nuclear retaliation<br />

Given that U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and SLBMs have previously only carried nuclear warheads, many analysts argue that other countries, such as Russia or China, might “misinterpret the launch of a conventionally-armed ballistic missile and conclude that they are under attack with nuclear weapons.”35 Although this concern has been expressed in context of both Navy and Air Force conventional missile programs, concern over the CTM program is more acute: “To outside observers, the [Trident] sub’s conventional and nuclear weapons would appear identical—the same size, the same speed, shooting from the same locations.”36 Ian Davis and Robin Dodd argue that the deployment of conventional ballistic missiles will inject an additional dose of uncertainty into any U.S. long-range missile launch. As a consequence, countries “targeted by any ICBM strike would need to treat any attack as a nuclear one if they were to avoid being open to a successful surprise US nuclear first strike.”37 In other words, the United States could potentially exploit this capability by initiating a nuclear first strike under the guise of a conventional long-range missile launch. The implication of this argument is that deploying long-range ballistic missiles with conventional warheads will further complicate any efforts to reduce the readiness level of other states’ nuclear weapons, as they will feel that their arsenals are even more vulnerable to a U.S. first strike. Whether reducing the readiness level of nuclear weapons should be on the agenda in future arms control negotiations is a separate issue, but its omission from such should be the result of a conscious policy decision, not an unintended and unexamined consequence of a new weapon deployment. A recent article in Arms Control Today quotes a Russian source echoing this very concern: “Prompt global strike is very dangerous [because] you never tell what the load [is] when a strategic missile is launched.”38 Former Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed similar concerns: “The launch of such a missile could provoke an inappropriate response from one of the nuclear powers, could provoke a full-scale counterattack using strategic nuclear forces.”39Similarly, the congressionally-mandated NAS report affirmed that such concerns “merit serious consideration,” and also recommended “providing a modest amount of applied research (6.2) funding towards measuring the more challenging hypersonic flight technologies needed for other longer-term CPGS [conventional prompt global strike] options envisioned by the Air Force and the Army.”40<br />

The direct toll that would result from an accidental nuclear attack of the type described above would dwarf all prior accidents in history. Furthermore, such an attack, even if accidental, might prompt a retaliatory response resulting in an all-out nuclear exchange. The World Health Organization has estimated that this would result in billions of direct and indirect casualties worldwide.<br />
Retaliation to cyber-attack escalates to global nuclear war<br />
Lawson, 5/13/2009 (Sean - assistant professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Utah, Cross-Domain Response to Cyber Attacks and the Threat of Conflict, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.seanlawson.net/?p=477" rel="nofollow">http://www.seanlawson.net/?p=477</a>)<br />
At a time when it seems impossible to avoid the seemingly growing hysteria over the threat of cyber war,[1] network security expert Marcus Ranum delivered a refreshing talk recently, “The Problem with Cyber War,” that took a critical look at a number of the assumptions underlying contemporary cybersecurity discourse in the United States. He addressed one issue in partiuclar that I would like to riff on here, the issue of conflict escalation–i.e. the possibility that offensive use of cyber attacks could escalate to the use of physical force. As I will show, his concerns are entirely legitimate as current U.S. military cyber doctrine assumes the possibility of what I call “cross-domain responses” to cyberattacks. Backing Your Adversary (Mentally) into a Corner Based on the premise that completely blinding a potential adversary is a good indicator to that adversary that an attack is iminent, Ranum has argued that “The best thing that you could possibly do if you want to start World War III is launch a cyber attack. [...] When people talk about cyber war like it’s a practical thing, what they’re really doing is messing with the OK button for starting World War III. We need to get them to sit the f-k down and shut the f-k up.” [2] He is making a point similar to one that I have made in the past: Taking away an adversary’s ability to make rational decisions could backfire. [3] For example, Gregory Witol cautions that “attacking the decision maker’s ability to perform rational calculations may cause more problems than it hopes to resolveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Removing the capacity for rational action may result in completely unforeseen consequences, including longer and bloodier battles than may otherwise have been.” [4] Ã¯Â»Â¿Cross-Domain Response So, from a theoretical standpoint, I think his concerns are well founded. But the current state of U.S. policy may be cause for even greater concern. It’s not just worrisome that a hypothetical blinding attack via cyberspace could send a signal of imminent attack and therefore trigger an irrational response from the adversary. What is also cause for concern is that current U.S. policy indicates that “kinetic attacks” (i.e. physical use of force) are seen as potentially legitimate responses to cyber attacks. Most worrisome is that current U.S. policy implies that a nuclear response is possible, something that policy makers have not denied in recent press reports. The reason, in part, is that the U.S. defense community has increasingly come to see cyberspace as a “domain of warfare” equivalent to air, land, sea, and space. The definition of cyberspace as its own domain of warfare helps in its own right to blur the online/offline, physical-space/cyberspace boundary. But thinking logically about the potential consequences of this framing leads to some disconcerting conclusions. If cyberspace is a domain of warfare, then it becomes possible to define “cyber attacks” (whatever those may be said to entail) as acts of war. But what happens if the U.S. is attacked in any of the other domains? It retaliates. But it usually does not respond only within the domain in which it was attacked. Rather, responses are typically “cross-domain responses”–i.e. a massive bombing on U.S. soil or vital U.S. interests abroad (e.g. think 9/11 or Pearl Harbor) might lead to air strikes against the attacker. Even more likely given a U.S. military “way of warfare” that emphasizes multidimensional, “joint” operations is a massive conventional (i.e. non-nuclear) response against the attacker in all domains (air, land, sea, space), simultaneously. The possibility of “kinetic action” in response to cyber attack, or as part of offensive U.S. cyber operations, is part of the current (2006) National Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations [5]: (U) Kinetic Actions. DOD will conduct kinetic missions to preserve freedom of action and strategic advantage in cyberspace. Kinetic actions can be either offensive or defensive and used in conjunction with other mission areas to achieve optimal military effects. Of course, the possibility that a cyber attack on the U.S. could lead to a U.S. nuclear reply constitutes possibly the ultimate in “cross-domain response.” And while this may seem far fetched, it has not been ruled out by U.S. defense policy makers and is, in fact, implied in current U.S. defense policy documents. From the National Military Strategy of the United States (2004): “The term WMD/E relates to a broad range of adversary capabilities that pose potentially devastating impacts. WMD/E includes chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and enhanced high explosive weapons as well as other, more asymmetrical ‘weapons’. They may rely more on disruptive impact than destructive kinetic effects. For example, cyber attacks on US commercial information systems or attacks against transportation networks may have a greater economic or psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent.” [6] The authors of a 2009 National Academies of Science report on cyberwarfare respond to this by saying, “Coupled with the declaratory policy on nuclear weapons described earlier, this statement implies that the United States will regard certain kinds of cyberattacks against the United States as being in the same category as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and thus that a nuclear response to certain kinds of cyberattacks (namely, cyberattacks with devastating impacts) may be possible. It also sets a relevant scale–a cyberattack that has an impact larger than that associated with a relatively small release of a lethal agent is regarded with the same or greater seriousness.” [7] <br />
The threat of cyber warfare is real – Russia, China, and terrorists are developing capabilities that undermine U.S. ag, water, and power infrastructures and increase the risk of nuclear major power wars<br />

However, there are reasons to believe that what is going on now amounts to a fundamental shift as opposed to business as usual. Today’s network exploitation or information operation trespasses possess a number of characteristics that suggest that the line between espionage and conflict has been, or is close to being, crossed. (What that suggests for the proper response is a different matter.) First, the number of cyberattacks we are facing is growing significantly. Andrew Palowitch, a former CIA official now consulting with the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), which oversees the Defense Department’s Joint Task Force‐Global Network Operations, recently told a meeting of experts that the Defense Department has experienced almost 80,000 computer attacks, and some number of these assaults have actually “reduced” the military’s “operational capabilities.”20 Second, the nature of these attacks is starting to shift from penetration attempts aimed at gathering intelligence (cyber spying) to offensive efforts aimed at taking down systems (cyberattacks). Palowitch put this in stark terms last November, “We are currently in a cyberwar and war is going on today.”21 Third, these recent attacks need to be taken in a broader strategic context. Both Russia and China have stepped up their offensive efforts and taken a much more aggressive cyberwarfare posture. The Chinese have developed an openly discussed cyberwar strategy aimed at achieving electronic dominance over the U.S. and its allies by 2050. In 2007 the Department of Defense reported that for the first time China has developed first strike viruses, marking a major shift from prior investments in defensive measures.22 And in the intervening period China has launched a series of offensive cyber operations against U.S. government and private sector networks and infrastructure. In 2007, Gen. James Cartwright, the former head of STRATCOM and now the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the US‐China Economic and Security Review Commission that China’s ability to launch “denial of service” attacks to overwhelm an IT system is of particular concern. 23 Russia also has already begun to wage offensive cyberwar. At the outset of the recent hostilities with Georgia, Russian assets launched a series of cyberattacks against the Georgian government and its critical infrastructure systems, including media, banking and transportation sites.24 In 2007, cyberattacks that many experts attribute, directly or indirectly, to Russia shut down the Estonia government’s IT systems. Fourth, the current geopolitical context must also be factored into any effort to gauge the degree of threat of cyberwar. The start of the new Obama Administration has begun to help reduce tensions between the United States and other nations. And, the new administration has taken initial steps to improve bilateral relations specifically with both China and Russia. However, it must be said that over the last few years the posture of both the Chinese and Russian governments toward America has clearly become more assertive, and at times even aggressive. Some commentators have talked about the prospects of a cyber Pearl Harbor, and the pattern of Chinese and Russian behavior to date gives reason for concern along these lines: both nations have offensive cyberwarfare strategies in place; both nations have taken the cyber equivalent of building up their forces; both nations now regularly probe our cyber defenses looking for gaps to be exploited; both nations have begun taking actions that cross the line from cyberespionage to cyberaggression; and, our bilateral relations with both nations are increasingly fractious and complicated by areas of marked, direct competition. Clearly, there a sharp differences between current U.S. relations with these two nations and relations between the US and Japan just prior to World War II. However, from a strategic defense perspective, there are enough warning signs to warrant preparation. In addition to the threat of cyberwar, the limited resources required to carry out even a large scale cyberattack also makes likely the potential for a significant cyberterror attack against the United States. However, the lack of a long list of specific incidences of cyberterrorism should provide no comfort. There is strong evidence to suggest that al Qaeda has the ability to conduct cyberterror attacks against the United States and its allies. Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are extremely active in cyberspace, using these technologies to communicate among themselves and others, carry out logistics, recruit members, and wage information warfare. For example, al Qaeda leaders used email to communicate with the 9‐11 terrorists and the 9‐11 terrorists used the Internet to make travel plans and book flights. Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda members routinely post videos and other messages to online sites to communicate. Moreover, there is evidence of efforts that al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are actively developing cyberterrorism capabilities and seeking to carry out cyberterrorist attacks. For example, the Washington Post has reported that “U.S. investigators have found evidence in the logs that mark a browser's path through the Internet that al Qaeda operators spent time on sites that offer software and programming instructions for the digital switches that run power, water, transport and communications grids. In some interrogations . . . al Qaeda prisoners have described intentions, in general terms, to use those tools.”25 Similarly, a 2002 CIA report on the cyberterror threat to a member of the Senate stated that al Qaeda and Hezbollah have become &quot;more adept at using the internet and computer technologies.”26 The FBI has issued bulletins stating that, “U. S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have received indications that Al Qaeda members have sought information on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems available on multiple SCADA‐related web sites.”27 In addition a number of jihadist websites, such as 7hj.7hj.com, teach computer attack and hacking skills in the service of Islam.28 While al Qaeda may lack the cyber‐attack capability of nations like Russia and China, there is every reason to believe its operatives, and those of its ilk, are as capable as the cyber criminals and hackers who routinely effect great harm on the world’s digital infrastructure generally and American assets specifically. In fact, perhaps, the most troubling indication of the level of the cyberterrorist threat is the countless, serious non‐terrorist cyberattacks routinely carried out by criminals, hackers, disgruntled insiders, crime syndicates and the like. <br />
If run‐of‐the‐mill criminals and hackers can threaten powergrids, hack vital military networks, steal vast sums of money, take down a city’s of traffic lights, compromise the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic control systems, among other attacks, it is overwhelmingly likely that terrorists can carry out similar, if not more malicious attacks. Moreover, even if the world’s terrorists are unable to breed these skills, they can certainly buy them. There are untold numbers of cybermercenaries around the world—sophisticated hackers with advanced training who would be willing to offer their services for the right price. Finally, given the nature of our understanding of cyber threats, there is always the possibility that we have already been the victim or a cyberterrorist attack, or such an attack has already been set but not yet effectuated, and we don’t know it yet. Instead, a well‐designed cyberattack has the capacity cause widespread chaos, sow societal unrest, undermine national governments, spread paralyzing fear and anxiety, and create a state of utter turmoil, all without taking a single life. A sophisticated cyberattack could throw a nation’s banking and finance system into chaos causing markets to crash, prompting runs on banks, degrading confidence in markets, perhaps even putting the nation’s currency in play and making the government look helpless and hapless. In today’s difficult economy, imagine how Americans would react if vast sums of money were taken from their accounts and their supporting financial records were destroyed. A truly nefarious cyberattacker could carry out an attack in such a way (akin to Robin Hood) as to engender populist support and deepen rifts within our society, thereby making efforts to restore the system all the more difficult. A modestly advanced enemy could use a cyberattack to shut down (if not physically damage) one or more regional power grids. An entire region could be cast into total darkness, power‐dependent systems could be shutdown. An attack on one or more regional power grids could also cause cascading effects that could jeopardize our entire national grid. When word leaks that the blackout was caused by a cyberattack, the specter of a foreign enemy capable of sending the entire nation into darkness would only increase the fear, turmoil and unrest. While the finance and energy sectors are considered prime targets for a cyberattack, an attack on any of the 17 delineated critical infrastructure sectors could have a major impact on the United States. For example, our healthcare system is already technologically driven and the Obama Administration’s e‐health efforts will only increase that dependency. A cyberattack on the U.S. e‐health infrastructure could send our healthcare system into chaos and put countless of lives at risk. Imagine if emergency room physicians and surgeons were suddenly no longer able to access vital patient information. A cyberattack on our nation’s water systems could likewise cause widespread disruption. An attack on the control systems for one or more dams could put entire communities at risk of being inundated, and could create ripple effects across the water, agriculture, and energy sectors. Similar water control system attacks could be used to at least temporarily deny water to otherwise arid regions, impacting everything from the quality of life in these areas to agriculture. In 2007, the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit determined that the destruction from a single wave of cyberattacks on critical infrastructures could exceed $700 billion, which would be the rough equivalent of 50 Katrina‐esque hurricanes hitting the United States all at the same time.29 Similarly, one IT security source has estimated that the impact of a single day cyberwar attack that focused on and disrupted U.S. credit and debit card transactions would be approximately $35 billion.30 Another way to gauge the potential for harm is in comparison to other similar noncyberattack infrastructure failures. For example, the August 2003 regional power grid blackout is estimated to have cost the U.S. economy up to $10 billion, or roughly .1 percent of the nation’s GDP. 31 That said, a cyberattack of the exact same magnitude would most certainly have a much larger impact. The origin of the 2003 blackout was almost immediately disclosed as an atypical system failure having nothing to do with terrorism. This made the event both less threatening and likely a single time occurrence. Had it been disclosed that the event was the result of an attack that could readily be repeated the impacts would likely have grown substantially, if not exponentially. Additionally, a cyberattack could also be used to disrupt our nation’s defenses or distract our national leaders in advance of a more traditional conventional or strategic attack. Many military leaders actually believe that such a disruptive cyber pre‐offensive is the most effective use of offensive cyber capabilities. This is, in fact, the way Russia utilized cyberattackers—whether government assets, governmentdirected/ coordinated assets, or allied cyber irregulars—in advance of the invasion of Georgia. Widespread distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks were launched on the Georgian governments IT systems. Roughly a day later Russian armor rolled into Georgian territory. The cyberattacks were used to prepare the battlefield; they denied the Georgian government a critical communications tool isolating it from its citizens and degrading its command and control capabilities precisely at the time of attack. In this way, these attacks were the functional equivalent of conventional air and/or missile strikes on a nation’s communications infrastructure.32 One interesting element of the Georgian cyberattacks has been generally overlooked: On July 20th, weeks before the August cyberattack, the website of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was overwhelmed by a more narrowly focused, but technologically similar DDOS attack.33 This should be particularly chilling to American national security experts as our systems undergo the same sorts of focused, probing attacks on a constant basis. The ability of an enemy to use a cyberattack to counter our offensive capabilities or soften our defenses for a wider offensive against the United States is much more than mere speculation. In fact, in Iraq it is already happening. Iraq insurgents are now using off‐the‐shelf software (costing just $26) to hack U.S. drones (costing $4.5 million each), allowing them to intercept the video feed from these drones.34 By hacking these drones the insurgents have succeeded in greatly reducing one of our most valuable sources of real‐time intelligence and situational awareness.<br />
If our enemies in Iraq are capable of such an effective cyberattack against one of our more sophisticated systems, consider what a more technologically advanced enemy could do. At the strategic level, in 2008, as the United States Central Command was leading wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, a cyber intruder compromised the security of the Command and sat within its IT systems, monitoring everything the Command was doing. 35 This time the attacker simply gathered vast amounts of intelligence. However, it is clear that the attacker could have used this access to wage cyberwar—altering information, disrupting the flow of information, destroying information, taking down systems—against the United States forces already at war. Similarly, during 2003 as the United States prepared for and began the War in Iraq, the IT networks of the Department of Defense were hacked 294 times.36 By August of 2004, with America at war, these ongoing attacks compelled then‐Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz to write in a memo that, &quot;Recent exploits have reduced operational capabilities on our networks.&quot;37 This wasn’t the first time that our national security IT infrastructure was penetrated immediately in advance of a U.S. military option.38 In February of 1998 the Solar Sunrise attacks systematically compromised a series of Department of Defense networks. What is often overlooked is that these attacks occurred during the ramp up period ahead of potential military action against Iraq. The attackers were able to obtain vast amounts of sensitive information—information that would have certainly been of value to an enemy’s military leaders. There is no way to prove that these actions were purposefully launched with the specific intent to distract American military assets or degrade our capabilities. However, such ambiguities—the inability to specifically attribute actions and motives to actors—are the very nature of cyberspace. Perhaps, these repeated patterns of behavior were mere coincidence, or perhaps they weren’t. The potential that an enemy might use a cyberattack to soften physical defenses, increase the gravity of harms from kinetic attacks, or both, significantly increases the potential harms from a cyberattack. Consider the gravity of the threat and risk if an enemy, rightly or wrongly, believed that it could use a cyberattack to degrade our strategic weapons capabilities. Such an enemy might be convinced that it could win a war—conventional or even nuclear—against the United States. The effect of this would be to undermine our deterrence‐based defenses, making us significantly more at risk of a major war.<br />
This is our Achilles’ heel and the intent to destroy us real – we will lose any war that involves cyber weapons, because our air, land and sea power will be useless<br />
Brookes ‘8 (Peter Brookes, Peter Brookes is a Heritage Foundation senior fellow and former US deputy assistant secretary of defense. “The Cyber Challenge” March 10, 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed031008c.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed031008c.cfm</a>)<br />
It is no secret that modern warfare is increasingly dependent on advanced computers—and no country’s armed forces are more reliant on the digital age for information superiority than those of the U.S. This is both the American military’s greatest strength— and potentially its greatest weakness. Today, the Pentagon uses more than 5 million computers on 100,000 networks at as many as 1,500 sites in at least 65 countries worldwide. Not surprisingly, potential adversaries have taken note of America’s slavish dependence on information technology. The Defense Department suffers tens of thousands of computer network attacks annually. Although the department is understandably cautious about revealing the success of these attacks, some of the cyber assaults allegedly reduced the military’s operational capabilities. The Pentagon reportedly logged more than 79,000 attempted intrusions in 2005 — the most recent publicly available data. About 1,300 of the attacks supposedly were successful, including the reported penetration of computers linked to the Army’s 101st and 82nd Airborne and 4th Infantry divisions. Foreign cyberspace operations are a threat that is here and now — and cannot be ignored. Cyberspace operations, which include computer network attack, exploitation and defense, are not a new national security challenge. Cyber warfare was all the rage in the late 1990s but has faded in importance since 9/11, not surprisingly, in comparison to the threat of terrorism and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cyber operations appeal to many state and nonstate actors, including terrorists, because they can be low-cost, low-risk and highly effective, and provide plausible deniability for the attacker, who can route operations through any number of surrogate servers across the Web en route to its target. Talk about “low-DNA” operations. Malicious code can launch viruses, crash networks, corrupt data, collect intelligence, spread misinformation, and interfere with vital friendly military and intelligence operations, including command, control, communications, navigation and logistics. In essence, if it is wired to the Web, it is potentially vulnerable. According to McAfee, an Internet security company, about 120 countries are involved in developing the ability to use the Internet as a weapon, not only against government networks, but also against soft targets such as financial markets and even critical civilian infrastructure. Although it is impossible to say how many raids go undetected, cyber attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated. The threat has grown from the work of curious hackers to premeditated government-sponsored operations that embrace a variety of security-related purposes. No country is seemingly more active in cyberspace than China. ARMY OF HACKERS According to Pentagon sources, most attacks on America’s digital Achilles’ heel originate from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), making Chinese cyber operations an issue that deserves close attention. The PRC is serious about cyberspace and has made the development of cyber capabilities a top national- security priority. China’s military planners recognize that the United States’ reliance on computers is a potential strategic weakness ripe for exploitation. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has reportedly incorporated cyber warfare tactics into military exercises and created schools that specialize in it. The Chinese military is also hiring top computer-science graduates to develop its cyber warfare capabilities, literally creating an army of hackers. According to an annual report of the congressionally mandated U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC): “The Chinese realize that they cannot win a traditional war against the U.S. and are seeking unorthodox ways to defeat the U.S. in any such conflict ... while building up their military power to eventually match or exceed U.S. military capabilities in East Asia.” China’s plan is to develop asymmetrical warfare weapons, including so-called “assassin’s mace weapons” that will allow the PRC to balance America’s existing military superiority in Asia. These weapons include cyber tools for use across the electromagnetic domain. According to the USCC, the PLA’s cyber warfare hit list is expansive, including “forward-based command, control, communications, computers and intelligence (C4I) nodes, airbases, aircraft carriers, and sea- and space-based command-and-control platforms.” Describing what could be called a new “arms” race — this time in cyberspace — a Pentagon assessment states that China’s military regards offensive computer operations as “critical to seize the initiative” in the first stage of a conflict. Beginning in 2003, Chinese cyber reconnaissance has become so common in the Defense Department computer networks that the Pentagon created a program, which became known as “Titan Rain,” to collect data and work the problem. Industrial espionage against government and private defense research, development and production efforts is also a priority for Chinese cyber spies, cutting costs and time in support of Beijing’s massive effort to build up its military and develop a world-class defense industry. It is not just the U.S. the Chinese have in their cyber sights. Over the past year, the United Kingdom, France and Germany have pointed an accusatory finger at China for attempting to infiltrate — or successfully penetrating — their diplomatic or defense establishment’s computer networks. Beijing is also looking for cyber dominance over other key potential regional rivals, such as New Delhi, Moscow, Seoul, Tokyo and cross-strait rival Taipei. China’s increasing aggressiveness and ability to infiltrate the computer networks of key countries is setting off alarms across the security establishment, and rightfully so. UNRULY RUSSIA Russia is believed to be developing significant cyberspace capabilities, too. Indeed, in April 2007, a massive cyber attack on the tiny Baltic state of Estonia by Russian hackers demonstrated how potentially catastrophic a pre-emptive digital strike could be on a developed nation. <br />
Pro-Russian hackers, some likely associated with the government, attacked numerous Web sites in neighboring Estonia — one of the world’s most wired countries — to protest the controversial removal of a Soviet war memorial located in the capital, Tallinn. The hackers brought down government and other Web sites, including the office of the president, the parliament, political parties, banks, news organizations and communications firms, using denial-of- service attacks, in which a server is bombarded with so many bogus requests for information that it overloads and crashes. Some of the attacks came from botnets — chains of perhaps thousands of zombie computers that have been hijacked by the malicious code of cyber pirates and linked together to take part in raids, often generating large volumes of spam, with or without their owners’ knowledge. Interestingly, a number of Estonian commentators wondered whether their defense ministry should have called on NATO to invoke Article V’s collective defense provision. An interesting point, but for the moment, NATO does not seem to view cyber attacks as a military action. Estonia has not been the only victim of an alleged Russian cyber attack. Moonlight Maze is the name given to series of coordinated attacks on Pentagon computers going back to the 1990s that may have originated in Russia, possibly compromising sensitive national security data. The Russians see cyber dominance as central to warfare. At a recent conference, a senior Russian general said victory in future conflicts will be decided by suppressing the opponent’s military and state institutions through information technologies. But it is not only major powers that are using cyberspace to advance their political-military objectives. Terrorists are all over the Internet, too. They use the Web to recruit, communicate, share information (such as bomb-making), relay threats, seek publicity for their cause, spread propaganda or gather publicly available information for target development. Terrorists also effectively use the Internet for fundraising — from both witting and unwitting donors. Terrorists, like cyber criminals, will use Web scams such as phishing to obtain private information such as passwords, while acting as a legitimate entity, to line their pockets. The Internet offers terrorists a multitude of advantages in waging their unconventional warfare: mobility, flexibility (if hacked or shut down by an Internet service provider), world-wide coverage with huge potential audiences and high-speed communications. Some Islamist hackers have promoted the notion of carrying out electronic jihad against infidel civilian infrastructure, economic and military targets. Serious attacks in which cyber terrorists take innocent lives via the Web in an effort to advance their cause may become reality in the future. In testimony to Congress in March 2007, Gen. James Cartwright, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said: “America is under widespread attack in cyberspace. ... [T]he magnitude of cost, in terms of real dollars dedicated to defensive measures, lost intellectual capital and fraud, cannot be overestimated, making these attacks a matter of great national interest. Unlike the air, land and sea domains, we lack dominance in cyberspace and could grow increasingly vulnerable if we do not fundamentally change how we view this battle space.” State-sponsored and terrorist cyberspace efforts provide a cautionary tale to U.S. and other policymakers. Although many governments have devoted significant resources to cyber security, recent intrusions clearly demonstrate cyberspace vulnerabilities. A digital Pearl Harbor is by no means a certainty. But cyberspace is increasingly important to American national security — and complementary to the broad spectrum of modern warfare. The time to take heed of this challenge is now.<br />
War is inevitable – the only question is the perception of deterrence causing a first strike<br />

The last few years have seen the reemergence of Russia and China as regional superpowers. Both nations have strong militaries in which they are heavily investing,[43] substantial—and in China’s case—growing economies,[44] demonstrated indifference to human rights,[45] authoritarian regimes that show no signs of becoming democratic and—in Russia’s case—is moving away from democracy,[46] and nationalistic ambitions that are at odds with their neighbors and the United States.[47] Russia and China have been significantly increasing military spending;[48] and unlike the United States, which must pay high manpower costs to sustain a volunteer military, can spend their defense budget mostly on modernizing and procuring their weapons programs.[49] Russia increased military spending by approximately 30% in 2007, 27% in 2006, and 22% in 2005.[50] It is modernizing its submarine fleet and building new short and long-range ballistic missiles. It has highly developed cyber weapon capability,[51] and its army and navy performed far above expectations in the recent invasion of Georgia.[52] The Russians have threatened to use energy as a weapon against Europe and certainly could do so;[53] they control half of the natural gas Europe receives and are promoting an international natural gas cartel similar to OPEC.[54] Russia is building Iran’s nuclear reactor[55] and has systematically obstructed international attempts to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.[56] It has sold sophisticated weapons to Iran,[57] Syria,[58] and Venezuela,[59] and it has long been the source of China’s most sophisticated weaponry, including advanced fighter aircraft and carrier killer supersonic missiles.[60] Russia is controlled by a man—Vladimir Putin—who announced to his Parliament in 2005 that the most tragic event of the 20th century was the collapse of the Soviet Union.[61] China admits to spending approximately $60 billion per year on its military, and to increasing spending by an average of 17% to 18% each year.[62] American intelligence believes that China’s expenditures are actually two to three times higher than it admits.[63] China has money to spend on its armed forces; its economy is growing exponentially, and within the next decade China will have the largest industrial sector in the world.[64] China believes its national interests are served by promoting proliferation, tyranny, and even genocide. It is committing ethnic genocide itself in Tibet,[65] and is supporting genocide in Sudan,[66] oppression in Burma,[67] repression and political terror in Zimbabwe,[68] and nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran.[69] China has threatened Taiwan militarily on numerous occasions,[70] and its current military doctrine and procurement policies are aimed at excluding American naval power from the Western Pacific[71] and particularly the Straits of Taiwan.[72] China has an arsenal of submarines armed with carrier killer missiles which it purchased from the Russians,[73] as well as sophisticated fighters;[74] and it is rapidly building up a fleet of modern nuclear submarines, [75] for which it has opened up a base on the island of Hainan.[76] China is ruled by an authoritarian oligarchy that has shown the resiliency to survive the introduction of something like freedom into its economic system. Like Vladimir Putin, the Chinese leaders believe that asserting themselves abroad is a way of unifying their people and stabilizing the regime. In addition, and again like Russia, the Chinese have a history of dominating their part of the world.[77] The Russians and the Chinese have formed a cooperative organization and held unprecedented joint military maneuvers in 2005[78] and again in 2008. They will undoubtedly continue to pursue their national ambitions, particularly in Asia, Eastern Europe, and the former states of the Soviet Union;[79] whether or not they use aggressive tactics depends, as a threshold matter, on their perception of the deterrent strength of the United States. <br />
Perception is specific to our cyber defense – it increases the risk of miscalculation and escalation<br />

The United States’ lack of an effective cyberdefense system, Mr. Clarke ominously warns, “will tempt opponents to attack in a period of tensions,” and it could also tempt America to take pre-emptive action or escalate a cyberconflict very rapidly if attacked. Were such a war to start, it could easily jump international boundaries, causing cascades of collateral damage to unspool around the world.<br />
We will lose the war in every military domain – Cyber Command key to coordinate and de-escalate this tension<br />
Clarke ‘11 (Richard, Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy, served the last three presidents as a senior White House Advisor. He has held the titles of Special Assistant to the President for Global Affairs; National Coordinator for Security and Counter-terrorism; and Special Advisor to the President for Cyber Security. Prior to the White House, Clarke served for 19 years in the Pentagon, the Intelligence Community, and State Department, February 7, “Software Power: Cyber warfare is the risky new frontline”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/power/2011/02/07/software-power-cyber-warfare-is-the-risky-new-frontline/" rel="nofollow">http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/power/2011/02/07/software-power-cyber-warfare-is-the-risky-new-frontline/</a>)<br />
In the late 19th century, American Admiral Alfred Mahan described the rise of sea power and its relationship to a nation’s global strength. In the early 20th century Italian General Giulio Douhet was first to develop theories about the essentiality of air power to future military superiority. Today America’s “cyber warriors” have begun to talk about the need for their nation to be the “dominant” cyber war power in order to be assured of continued global military superiority. Although no Mahan or Douhet has yet emerged, America’s cyber generals have described cyberspace as a domain similar to sea, air, and outer space as a potential battleground. In some documents, the cyber warriors have admitted that without dominance in cyberspace, a military power will likely lose the battle in the other domains. With that in mind, the US Navy has created a new 10th Fleet, to accompany the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean and the 7th Fleet in the Pacific. The 10th Fleet will fight in cyberspace. A new US Cyber Command will coordinate Navy, Army, and Air Force cyber warriors. Using software applications as their weapons, cyber warriors can gain control of other militaries’ weapons, damaging, disabling or destroying them. Cyber attacks can also cause the machinery of civilian infrastructure to fail, leaving a modern society without functioning electric grids, railroads, pipelines, airlines, logistical systems, or financial markets. The most obvious public example is the attack on Iran’s nuclear enrichment facility, not with Israeli bombs, but apparently with American bytes. America is not alone in militarizing cyberspace. US intelligence has publicly claimed that between twenty to thirty nations are forming cyber war units. NATO has made cyber war a new priority. While slashing conventional Royal Navy and Army units, the United Kingdom’s recent defense review increased assets for cyber war. China’s cyber warriors have openly discussed how they plan to balance other force asymmetries to defeat a larger superpower (whomever could they mean?). History is replete with instances of smaller forces defeating traditional powers through the early adoption of new weapons and tactics. The potential is certainly present for the world’s current leading military to be vanquished because of its vulnerabilities in cyberspace. The US has made its military machinery highly dependent upon cyberspace and, therefore, potentially more vulnerable than any other military to disabling cyber attacks. Moreover, while it does now require a nation state actor to mount an effective cyber war, mid-size and even small nation states could develop sufficient skills and resources to launch devastating attacks against larger powers. Cyber war may be the next great leveler.<br />
None of their impact defense assumes Stuxnet<br />
Clayton 10 (Stuxnet 'virus' could be altered to attack US facilities, report warns, December 12, 2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/1215/Stuxnet-virus-could-be-altered-to-attack-US-facilities-report-warns" rel="nofollow">http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/1215/Stuxnet-virus-could-be-altered-to-attack-US-facilities-report-warns</a>)<br />
Stuxnet, a computer worm that hit and may have severely damaged Iranian nuclear facilities, is the type of cyberweapon that could broadly harm the United States, undermining both society and government ability to defend the nation, says a strongly worded report to Congress. A successful broad-based attack on the US, using new variants of the Stuxnet weapon, could do enough widespread damage to critical infrastructure – including water, power, transportation, and other services – that it &quot;threatens to cause harm to many activities deemed critical to the basic functioning of modern society,&quot; said the little-noticed report issued by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) Dec. 9. If retooled slightly, Stuxnet could be directed to target a wide swath of critical infrastructure facilities, rather than a narrow target such as Iran's nuclear fuel-enrichment facilities and nuclear power plant, the eight-page CRS synopsis warns, quoting researchers and other analysts. IN PICTURES: Who has nukes? &quot;Depending on the severity of the attack, the interconnected nature of the affected critical infrastructure facilities, and government preparation and response plans, entities and individuals relying on these facilities could be without life sustaining or comforting services for a long period of time,&quot; the study's summary states. &quot;The resulting damage to the nation’s critical infrastructure could threaten many aspects of life, including the government’s ability to safeguard national security interests.&quot; Terrorist groups, previously deemed not to have much independent ability to launch damaging cyberattacks, could potentially purchase or even rent a Stuxnet-based variant from organized crime groups to launch an infrastructure attack on the US, the report warns. While some experts say the &quot;cyber threat to critical infrastructure is exaggerated, regardless of the perpetrators’ capabilities,&quot; most such skepticism has been general in nature and does not factor in the new Stuxnet cyberweapon, the report says. The report quotes Dr. Udo Helmbrecht, executive director of the European Network and Information Security Agency, as saying in October that “Stuxnet is really a paradigm shift, as Stuxnet is a new class and dimension of malware.&quot; He went on to call it a &quot;first strike&quot; weapon that is &quot;one of the first organized, well prepared attacks against major industrial resources. This has tremendous effect on how to protect national (critical infrastructure) in the future.”<br />
A successful attack will destroy any resiliency<br />
Billo and Chang ‘4 (Charles and Welton, Senior Research Associate at ISTS and Research Intern at ISTS, “CYBER WARFARE AN ANALYSIS OF THE MEANS AND MOTIVATIONS OF SELECTED NATION STATES,” Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth College, November)<br />
The conventional wisdom holds that the Internet backbone is resilient because of back-ups and redundancies. The track record so far suggests that engineering “work-arounds” in response to router problems are achievable using alternative nodes; however, the Internet today may not be as resilient as some experts believe because of the free market progression toward central network hubs that present a potentially lucrative target for hackers. One of the corollaries of this trend is increasing convergence in industrial countries such as the United States of IT, telecommunications, and links to embedded computer systems employed to control physical infrastructure. The degree of convergence has accelerated markedly in the past five to ten years. IT security experts at local and national levels are often unsure of the interconnections. On top of this, our adversaries no doubt are becoming more and more proficient in harnessing and improving hacking skills intended to identify flaws and loopholes in network and software security. IT dependence in the United States is evolving into a strategic center of gravity. This represents an inviting target to a potential adversary. While intrusions and hacks are not the exclusive province of large, hierarchical organizations, military and intelligence services possess an advantage over terrorist units for example in terms of resources, depth of personnel, and longer time-horizon reconnaissance and probes. <br />
Not enough supply to meet demand in Cyber Command’s cyber security personnel – there’s no viable situation for 12 or more years<br />
Jackson ‘10 (William, is a senior writer for GCN and the author of the CyberEye column, Oct 21, “Feds experiencing critical cybersecurity staff shortage”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://defensesystems.com/articles/2010/10/21/cyber-workforce-search.aspx?admgarea=DS" rel="nofollow">http://defensesystems.com/articles/2010/10/21/cyber-workforce-search.aspx?admgarea=DS</a>).<br />
“We just don’t have enough people yet,” Philip Reitinger, deputy undersecretary in the National Protection and Programs Directorate, said Thursday at a forum on workforce development hosted in Washington by Deloitte. “This is going to be a continuing challenge for us.” DHS has been recruiting from other agencies as well as from the private sector, but Reitinger called that a “zero sum game,” because there are not enough trained professionals coming into the field to meet demand. “There are not enough people to go around.” The problem has been recognized for several years and a number of public-private initiatives are under way to identify students with the proper interests and abilities in high school or even earlier, and to provide them with educational opportunities and career paths. Several high school and collegiate cybersecurity competitions are flourishing, and the University of Maryland University College has established three cybersecurity degree programs to help fill the demand for tens of thousands of professionals in Maryland, which is home not only to the National Security Agency but also to the Pentagon’s new Cyber Command. It will be two to 12 years or even more before these new pipelines begin supplying significant numbers of new workers, however. In the meantime, the federal government is at a disadvantage in this market because of its recruiting and hiring practices. “The current federal process is a disincentive to come in” to government work, said James Lewis, director of the technology and public policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He said the problem was not limited to cybersecurity. “It’s a larger workforce problem.” Reitinger agreed. “Hiring in the federal government has to be modernized across the board,” he said. DHS has obtained waivers from the Office of Personnel Management to use greater flexibility in its hiring process and has experimented with techniques, such as a virtual job fair conducted online. But this cannot make up for the lack of a trained workforce produced by strong science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs. “This is a glaring weakness here in the United States,” said Jake Olcott, counsel to the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. “Our STEM educational system is not working well right now.” Colleges and universities have offered computer science programs since the days of punch cards, but the integration of computer science with security, law, law enforcement, government policy and all things cyber is only just getting under way.<br />

Yet, despite such positives for U.S. IT practitioners, it is for several reasons far from clear that America as a country can maintain its IT practitioner strength; In a period of rising demand and in a striking reversal of the accelerating global trend towards liberalizing immigration rules for high-skilled workers46 , U.S. businesses’ access to foreign IT practitioners remains curtailed at levels far below those of the 1990s. With U.S. IT practitioner employment projected to grow rapidly and foreign-born IT entrepreneurs historically establishing up to half of Silicon Valley’s new technology firms47 , America’s current high-skilled immigration policy is sure to aggravate any future IT practitioner skill shortages and is highly damaging for the nation’s broader information technology prospects. At the same time, the U.S. domestic education system seems increasingly unable to produce the required additional IT practitioners during the next decade, especially considering ongoing state and local government budget cuts in education. U.S. computer sciences degrees at the Bachelor and Master’s level has been in general decline in recent years, while only seeing some growth at the much smaller doctoral level. Foreign human capital (here students) play an important role in the U.S. IT-related education system. While foreign students account for only a relatively minor share of IT-related U.S. bachelor degrees, at the master’s and particularly doctoral level, their presence looms large. A substantial part of the growth in the number of doctoral degrees given between 2003 and 2007 is thus related to a continued increase in the presence of foreign IT-related students at U.S. education institutions. Please Don’t Go The large inflow of foreign graduate level students to the United States is a clear testament to the persistent global attractiveness of its universities and has always been a source of economic strength, as the world’s best and brightest came first to study and then remained in the U.S. workforce and contributed to the U.S. economy after graduation. However, with increasing economic growth and opportunities in many of the countries of origin for America’s foreign IT-students (over half are from either China or India), it is increasingly uncertain that America can maintain its historical ability to hold on to the foreign students educated at its universities. Any decline in U.S. retention of foreign IT-related students will rapidly worsen any future IT practitioner skill shortages.”<br />
Visa restrictions are creating an R&amp;D shortage crippling our cyber security<br />
Piper 09 (Greg, Washington Internet Daily Staff Writer, October 21, “Ex-Officials Tell Entrepreneurs How to Pitch Cybersecurity to Feds,” WASHINGTON INTERNET DAILY Vol. 10 No. 202)<br />
China's suspected role in much industrial espionage shouldn't drive U.S. decision making on cybersecurity, Wade said. &quot;I wouldn't get too hung up on where the threat comes from,&quot; he told a questioner. Much of the same technology to guard against cyberattacks is useful to prevent &quot;self- inflicted wounds&quot; by employees and software bugs. Minihan told another questioner that foreign adversaries already have a &quot;persistent presence&quot; in government systems, but that adversaries are limited by their ability to process all the information held by the government in exposed systems. The &quot;'gotcha' tip of the iceberg&quot; -- embarrassing breaches -- must not be the focus of agencies and cybersecurity providers, because the rest of the iceberg can be addressed with &quot;building codes and standards,&quot; Minihan said. Asked about an open letter to the White House from several security CEOs that called for more federal cybersecurity R&amp;D, Security Innovation Network founder Robert Rodriguez blamed the R&amp;D shortage partly on immigration rules. Some of the most innovative entrepreneurs in security have left the U.S. because of an H-1B visa shortage, he said. Wade said the National Science Foundation is promoting &quot;leap- ahead technology&quot; through sponsored conferences on both coasts to bring together academic researchers, and Defense is sponsoring similar gatherings. &quot;There's a substantial amount of money that's going to be thrown at this problem,&quot; but entrepreneurs must be ready to pitch a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in cybersecurity, not a marginally better product, Russell said. Any system can be hacked, so the U.S. needs a competitive advantage in advanced technology to stay ahead of threats, he said. -- Greg Piper <br />
Fast tracking EB visas are key to strengthening cyber-defense<br />

We have seen, when you look at the table of the top 20 firms that are H1-B visa requestors, at least 15 of those are IT firms. And as we're seeing across industry, much of the hardware and software that's used in this country is not only manufactured now overseas, but it's developed overseas by scientists and engineers who were educated here in the United States. We're seeing a lot more activity around cyber-security, certainly noteworthy attacks here very recently. It's becoming an increasingly dominant set of requirements across not only to the Department of Defense, but the Department of Homeland Security and the critical infrastructure that's held in private hands. Was there any discussion or any interest from DOD or DHS as you undertook this review on the security things about what can be done to try to generate a more effective group of IT experts here in the United States, many of which are coming to the U.S. institutions, academic institutions from overseas and often returning back? This potentially puts us at a competitive disadvantage going forward. MCLARTY: Yes. And I think your question largely is the answer as well. I mean, clearly we have less talented students here studying -- or put another way, more talented students studying in other countries that are gifted, talented, really have a tremendous ability to develop these kind of technology and scientific advances, we're going to be put at an increasingly disadvantage. Where if they come here -- and I kind of like Dr. Land's approach of the green card being handed to them or carefully put in their billfold or purse as they graduate -- then, obviously, that's going to strengthen, I think, our system, our security needs.<br />
Highly skilled recruits are the critical internal link to cyber security<br />
Conti and Easterly, 7/29/2010 (Gregory - academy professor and director of West Point’s Cyber Security Research Center, and Jen - member of the US Cyber Command Commander’s Action Group, Recruiting, development, and retention of cyber warriors despite an inhospitable culture, Small Wars Journal, p. 1-2)<br />
Make no mistake, our nation faces persistent, widespread and growing threats in cyberspace. Across the array of dangerous actors and their capabilities, we’ve witnessed an evolution from data compromise and loss, to the disruption of information networks to the physical destruction of information systems. Our military forces, in particular, depend heavily on classified and unclassified networks for command and control, intelligence, operations and logistics. These networks – over 15,000 of them – represent a very tempting target, and the number of attacks against them has increased dramatically over the past several years. The United States Government recognized the clear and present danger posed by this increasingly perilous threat environment and created United States Cyber Command. We are at a unique cusp in history, as we have the first-ever opportunity to create a large-scale organization to fight and win wars in cyber space. This isn’t a trivial undertaking; there are myriad details that must be addressed. In this article, we focus on what is arguably the most important – the human dimension, specifically how we attract, develop, and retain a world-class cadre of cyber warriors. By building the best possible team and creating an environment that attracts more, we can lay the foundation upon which we can successfully build Cyber Command. However, while the Defense Department has endorsed Cyber Command, the kinetic warfighting culture generally has not. Positive strides have been made recently to include the development of the Navy’s Information Dominance Corps and planned establishment of the Army’s Cyber Brigade. However, building the most effective Cyber Command will require fundamentally changing military culture – specifically how we think about networks and how we manage the talent that we need to leverage these networks for warfighting effects. Uncomfortable, but necessary change will be required, else we risk creating a large bureaucracy, staffed with marginally effective individuals, a “Cyber Command” in name only. This article presents a viable way ahead and suggests actionable solutions for building, developing and retaining a world-class team. The rise of the cyber domain as the battleground of the 21st Century provides a dramatic new environment in which the current United States military is ill-equipped to operate successfully. Today’s military excels at recruiting, developing, and retaining kinetic warfighting expertise, but is ill-suited for recruiting, developing, and retaining creative and intellectual talent on the scale required to successfully operate in the contested cyber domain. Until the end of the 20th Century combat arms expertise ruled the day, but in the 21st Century kinetic combat arms soldiers must learn to co-exist, cooperate, and coordinate with non-kinetic cyber warriors. Key to creating a formidable force in cyberspace is the recruitment, development, and retention of highly skilled individuals. The dynamics in play are significantly different from traditional military recruiting. The nation faces a severe shortage of information security savvy talent. The pool of candidates dwindles even more when considering such constraints as the ability to receive a Top Secret clearance, possession of U.S. citizenship, desire to undergo repeated drug tests, and, in some circumstances, ability to pass a polygraph exam. The combination of a highly competitive job market and a relatively small pool of candidates require the military to actively create a culture that attracts, not repels, talent. So how do potential cyber warriors perceive the military? It isn’t a pretty picture.<br />
Hiring immigrants into Cyber Command would solve cyber-deterrence<br />
Haddick, 8/6/2010 (Robert - editor of Small Wars Journal, Uncle Sam Wants You…Whoever You Are, Foreign Policy, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/06/this_week_at_war_uncle_sam_wants_you_whoever_you_are" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/08/06/this_week_at_war_uncle_sam_wants_you_whoever_you_are</a>)<br />
Writing in Small Wars Journal, Gregory Conti and Jen Easterly, both U.S. Army lieutenant colonels, discussed the problems the military faces recruiting &quot;cyber warriors&quot; into the newly created Cyber Command, which aims to &quot;conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to ... ensure US/Allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries.&quot; Yet Conti and Easterly note that Cyber Command will recruit from an already tiny pool of cybersavvy talent, a pool made even smaller by Cyber Command's requirement that its soldiers pass security clearances, polygraph examinations, and drug screening. Meanwhile, Cyber Command will have to compete with the likes of Google for talented techies who may not find military culture all that inviting. It should come as no surprise to eventually find Cyber Command mostly staffed by highly-paid civilian contractors rather than uniformed soldiers or career civil servants. Cyber Command's recruiting difficulties are a microcosm of the broader troubles the military, especially the Army, now faces. The all-volunteer military has been a success and should be retained. But evidence continues to mount that the Army has grown as big as it can under the all-volunteer system. If circumstances ever required a significantly larger Army, Army leaders and U.S. society would have to get used to an Army of much lower quality at the margin. Deploying such a force, especially into stability operations, would entail taking greater risks and paying higher costs. The recently released Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Independent Panel report called for an overhaul in the military's personnel system. The report concluded that compensation costs for the all-volunteer force have exploded and are no longer sustainable. Active-duty head count has declined from 2 million in 1991 to 1.37 million in 2009. Yet in spite of this 32 percent decline in head count, military personnel costs (in constant 2005 dollars) have grown from $122 billion in 1991 to $130 billion in 2009 ($60,939 per head in 1991 versus $94,533 per head in 2009, adjusted for inflation). Even with this vast expansion in soldier compensation, the Army has had to reduce enlistment standards to fill its ranks. According to the QDR Independent Panel, these reduced standards include raising the maximum enlistment age to 42; accepting more recruits without high school diplomas, with criminal records, and in Category IV (low mental aptitude) on the Armed Forces Qualification Test; and increasing the numbers of noncitizens serving. The overall population of the United States is growing, but the cohort qualified and willing to volunteer for military service is shrinking. (Seventy-five percent of American youth are ineligible for military service for physical, mental, or educational reasons, or due to criminal records.) The prime recruiting base seems to be narrowing by geographic area and to families of veterans, increasingly turning military service into a &quot;family guild.&quot; Immediately after taking office, Defense Secretary Robert Gates directed the Army and Marine Corps to increase their headcounts in response to the pressures of Iraq and Afghanistan. Regrettably, this decision collided with the evaporating pool of suitable military recruits. The Army recently released a report that studied suicide prevention and the Army's mental-health issues. The report revealed a broader range of rising high-risk behaviors and criminality in the Army's ranks. Part, maybe most, of the increasing incidence of suicide in the Army is related to the strain of wartime deployments. But the report noted that 68 of the 120 suicides (57 percent) the Army suffered during the first half of 2010 were to soldiers who had zero or one deployment. Over the past five years, the Army has suffered from increasing rates of discipline problems, crime, and drug use. The suicide prevention report noted that during this time, enlistment waivers increased and soldiers who previously would have been dismissed during initial training for unsuitability were instead retained, presumably due to the requirement to increase the Army's head count. Indeed, the Army calculated that one-third of the soldiers recruited to meet the Army's higher end-strength would have been dismissed from the service under the previous quality standards. It seems highly likely that the Army's retention of soldiers it would previously have found unsuitable for service is related to the increased suicide rate, along with other behavior problems. Thus, in spite of sharply increased (and in my view, well-deserved) compensation, the Army has reached an upper boundary on its size -- unless Army leaders and the country are willing to accept rapidly declining quality and rapidly increasing trouble at the margin. The increasing U.S. population is not offsetting the declining propensity to volunteer for military service or the shrinking percentage of the youth cohort medically, mentally, or socially qualified to serve. If the Army has reached the bottom of its U.S.-based recruiting pool, where could it go for additional manpower if it needed to? The U.S. military has a long tradition of recruiting non-citizens into its ranks. This would be a tempting option for expansion although language, culture, and security clearance problems place limits on its use. Instead, foreign auxiliary forces, organized, trained, and equipped by U.S. special operations forces, are likely to be used to supplement deployed U.S. forces, especially during long low-intensity stabilization operations.<br />
That deters and solves the impact to cyber-attacks while we develop new counter-measures<br />

Sami, Cyber Defense Agency, LLC, “Structuring for Strategic Cyber Defense: A Cyber Manhattan Project Blueprint”, 2008 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acsac.org/2008/program" rel="nofollow">http://www.acsac.org/2008/program</a> /keynotes/saydjari.pdf)<br />
As part of a dialogue with the government in 2002, the PCD elaborated on the proper solution to the strategic vulnerability sketched out by our Dark Angel analysis. Cyber war defense requires orders of magnitude more government involvement and resources to avoid overwhelming national damage from strategic attacks. The PCD recommended that the government (1) step up to a strong defense role against serious attacks, (2) focus on countering strategic attacks that have real-world effects, (3) develop a topdown architecture and engineered approach to the defined problem, (4) acknowledge that current technology is insufficient to defend against cyber war, and (5) divide the cost burden between the owner (to protect critical private cyber assets) and the government (to protect the integrity of the national commons). As mentioned earlier, the PCD chose the name “Cyber Manhattan Project” to reflect the gravity, urgency, priority, focus, top-talent, and funding levels needed. We acknowledge that aspects of the analogy are inapt, such as the fact that (1) there is no single, easily measurable artifact (such as a bomb), (2) a broad spectrum of talent and organizations must be involved, (3) much of the work must be conducted without classification constraint, and (4) once an initial capability is achieved, a continued investment will be needed to maintain our cyber defense’s effectiveness. We sketch the program below. Vision. We must rapidly overcome our nation’s vulnerability to coordinated strategic cyber attacks from serious enemies. Urgency. Major potential adversaries are actively pursuing cyber war capabilities, indicating the increasing probability of future cyber campaigns. Moreover, current cyber defenses and best practices are ineffective, active measures to shut down our adversaries’ abilities to attack through physical access will drive them to cyber space, and we face potentially greater vulnerability and lethality from combined cyber and physical attacks. Finally, developing a defense to this threat is a multiyear effort, so we can’t wait until we’re in the midst of our first major strategic attack campaign to start defending against it. Priority. A major initiative on the order of the Cyber Manhattan Project is the right path to address our current situation. The offensive threat is growing, so defense must be fielded at a faster rate. A top-down approach with a driving architect can address the problem and achieve the requisite objectives, but bottom-up efforts, even if coordinated, leave gaps because there’s no ownership of key parts of the problem. Cyber defense mechanisms must integrate into a coordinated system, and cyber defense operations must comprise a fully integrated defensive force. For success, the creation of national cyber defense capabilities must be a national funding priority. Can you imagine the original Manhattan Project succeeding without such a focus? Feasibility. Not only is the creation of national cyber defense capabilities critically urgent and important, it’s also feasible. (1) Technically, many effective defensive technologies exist but are in research stages and must be transitioned to operational use, some already have limited field testing, and others already exist to address broad classes of novel attacks. Moreover, the required computational resources for intensive activities such as correlation of attack and modeling/simulating attack strategies and tactics are available today. Ongoing research sponsored by the National Security Agency (NSA), National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Defense (DoD), Department of National Intelligence (DNI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and others is beginning to address additional hard science problems. (2) Economically, we can make a national business case for investing in a program intended to avoid the expected financial losses from strategic cyber attacks and ensure the proper public–private sharing of the burden. (3) Operationally, we can manage the complex infrastructure though judicious use of automation with a capable cadre of defenders. Through a combination of reasonable fire-code-like cyber security standards, improved operational guidance, and trained/experienced personnel, we would also be able to contain mission and cost impacts in the short term while we develop new capabilities. (4) Politically, public awareness of the threat is likely to make needed investments and standards acceptable. Industry is increasingly aware that nation-state-level attacks are a concern beyond its current ability to handle, yet such attacks threaten business continuity and the economic foundation of the entire country. With proper financial incentives and partnering for workable solutions, industry is likely to openly embrace government involvement and protection. (5) Finally, from a schedule perspective, a phased rollout of capabilities based on threat prioritization and available technologies is also feasible. Success is certainly not assured, but the alternative is to begin radically reducing our dependency on computing systems, which would seriously degrade our national competitiveness and suppress economic growth. Project Description. We need an aggressive, goaldirected, high-priority, national program to address these types of high-level, far-reaching threats. To do this, we must engage the brightest scientists, business experts, and engineers and provide them with adequate resources. To guide the program with strategic objectives, we need a top-down architecture that establishes concrete cyber defense capabilities on a specific timeline, including near-term capabilities within three years. The cyber vulnerabilities in our infrastructures have become deeply embedded and widespread through the economic forces that drive individual companies to reduce costs by adopting the most widely available and interoperable technologies. It won’t be easy to develop a cyber infrastructure that can resist strategic attacks: it will require short-term actions as well as a long-term plan and a willingness to keep that plan in focus over a number of years. 4. Strategic Cyber Capabilities Needed In the context of this work, a capability is the ability to defend cyber space in some specific fashion. Some cyber defense capabilities to include in a strategic national plan are as follows: (1) system resiliency and quick recovery from partially successful attacks; (2) a national cyber Command, Control, Communication, and Computer Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) system to measure and control mechanisms at multiple echelon levels; (3) a national threat assessment system to drive decisions at some “required” level; (4) cyber firebreak mechanisms and architectures to slow down attacks and reduce potential damage; (5) methods to gather intelligence and inject uncertainty through strategic deception; (6) models and simulations of the enemy, thereby honing our defenses before incurring damaging strategic cyber attacks; and (7) approaches for identifying and understanding available and acceptable responses from technical, strategic, legal, economic, and political perspectives. As a step toward a security research plan that includes such capabilities, we should identify endstates—goals in terms of how we want our systems to ideally operate. This fresh perspective includes the overall strategic picture and connects clearly with strategic actions that significantly mitigate strategic vulnerabilities. If, for example, the nation has a capability to quickly recover its critical information infrastructure, then the end-state is that strategic attack damages are mitigated and critical services are restored quickly, possibly deterring adversaries from attempting a future attack.<br />
The DOD can recruit the best immigrants using its wartime authority – the offer of a green card is crucial<br />
Preston, 2/14/2009 (Julia, U.S. Military Will Offer Path to Citizenship, New York Times, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html</a>)<br />
Although the Pentagon has had wartime authority to recruit immigrants since shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, military officials have moved cautiously to lay the legal groundwork for the temporary immigrant program to avoid controversy within the ranks and among veterans over the prospect of large numbers of immigrants in the armed forces. A preliminary Pentagon announcement of the program last year drew a stream of angry comments from officers and veterans on Military.com, a Web site they frequent. Marty Justis, executive director of the national headquarters of the American Legion, the veterans’ organization, said that while the group opposes “any great influx of immigrants” to the United States, it would not object to recruiting temporary immigrants as long as they passed tough background checks. But he said the immigrants’ allegiance to the United States “must take precedence over and above any ties they may have with their native country.” The military does not allow illegal immigrants to enlist, and that policy would not change, officers said. Recruiting officials pointed out that volunteers with temporary visas would have already passed a security screening and would have shown that they had no criminal record. “The Army will gain in its strength in human capital,” General Freakley said, “and the immigrants will gain their citizenship and get on a ramp to the American dream.” In recent years, as American forces faced combat in two wars and recruiters struggled to meet their goals for the all-volunteer military, thousands of legal immigrants with temporary visas who tried to enlist were turned away because they lacked permanent green cards, recruiting officers said. Recruiters’ work became easier in the last few months as unemployment soared and more Americans sought to join the military. But the Pentagon, facing a new deployment of 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, still has difficulties in attracting doctors, specialized nurses and language experts. Several types of temporary work visas require college or advanced degrees or professional expertise, and immigrants who are working as doctors and nurses in the United States have already been certified by American medical boards. Military figures show that only 82 percent of about 80,000 Army recruits last year had high school diplomas. According to new figures, the Army provided waivers to 18 percent of active-duty recruits in the final four months of last year, allowing them to enlist despite medical conditions or criminal records. Military officials want to attract immigrants who have native knowledge of languages and cultures that the Pentagon considers strategically vital. The program will also be open to students and refugees. The Army’s one-year pilot program will begin in New York City to recruit about 550 temporary immigrants who speak one or more of 35 languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Igbo (a tongue spoken in Nigeria), Kurdish, Nepalese, Pashto, Russian and Tamil. Spanish speakers are not eligible. The Army’s program will also include about 300 medical professionals to be recruited nationwide. Recruiting will start after Department of Homeland Security officials update an immigration rule in coming days. Pentagon officials expect that the lure of accelerated citizenship will be powerful. Under a statute invoked in 2002 by the Bush administration, immigrants who serve in the military can apply to become citizens on the first day of active service, and they can take the oath in as little as six months. For foreigners who come to work or study in the United States on temporary visas, the path to citizenship is uncertain and at best agonizingly long, often lasting more than a decade. The military also waives naturalization fees, which are at least $675. To enlist, temporary immigrants will have to prove that they have lived in the United States for two years and have not been out of the country for longer than 90 days during that time. They will have to pass an English test. Language experts will have to serve four years of active duty, and health care professionals will serve three years of active duty or six years in the Reserves. If the immigrants do not complete their service honorably, they could lose their citizenship. <br />

Can non-US citizens obtain security clearances? No. Non-US citizens can not obtain a security clearance; however, they may be granted a Limited Access Authorization (LAA). LAAs are grant in those rare circumstances where the non-US citizen possesses unique or unusual skill or expertise that is urgently needed to support a specific US Government contract involving access to specified classified information (no higher than Secret), and a cleared or clearable US citizen is not readily available.<br />
It’s part of the DOD authority to hire and put the immigrants on the faster track<br />
Bender ‘6 (Bryan, December 26, “Military considers recruiting foreigners”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/12/26/military_considers_recruiting_foreigners/?page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/12/26/military_considers_recruiting_foreigners/?page=1</a>)<br />
The armed forces, already struggling to meet recruiting goals, are considering expanding the number of noncitizens in the ranks -- including disputed proposals to open recruiting stations overseas and putting more immigrants on a faster track to US citizenship if they volunteer -- according to Pentagon officials. Foreign citizens serving in the US military is a highly charged issue, which could expose the Pentagon to criticism that it is essentially using mercenaries to defend the country. Other analysts voice concern that a large contingent of noncitizens under arms could jeopardize national security or reflect badly on Americans' willingness to serve in uniform. The idea of signing up foreigners who are seeking US citizenship is gaining traction as a way to address a critical need for the Pentagon, while fully absorbing some of the roughly one million immigrants that enter the United States legally each year. The proposal to induct more noncitizens, which is still largely on the drawing board, has to clear a number of hurdles. So far, the Pentagon has been quiet about specifics -- including who would be eligible to join, where the recruiting stations would be, and what the minimum standards might involve, including English proficiency. In the meantime, the Pentagon and immigration authorities have expanded a program that accelerates citizenship for legal residents who volunteer for the military. And since Sept. 11, 2001, the number of immigrants in uniform who have become US citizens has increased from 750 in 2001 to almost 4,600 last year, according to military statistics. With severe manpower strains because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and a mandate to expand the overall size of the military -- the Pentagon is under pressure to consider a variety of proposals involving foreign recruits, according to a military affairs analyst. &quot;It works as a military idea and it works in the context of American immigration,&quot; said Thomas Donnelly , a military scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a leading proponent of recruiting more foreigners to serve in the military. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan grind on, the Pentagon has warned Congress and the White House that the military is stretched &quot;to the breaking point.&quot; Both President Bush and Robert M. Gates, his new defense secretary, have acknowledged that the total size of the military must be expanded to help alleviate the strain on ground troops, many of whom have been deployed repeatedly in combat theaters. Bush said last week that he has ordered Gates to come up with a plan for the first significant increase in ground forces since the end of the Cold War. Democrats who are preparing to take control of Congress, meanwhile, promise to make increasing the size of the military one of their top legislative priorities in 2007. &quot;With today's demands placing such a high strain on our service members, it becomes more crucial than ever that we work to alleviate their burden,&quot; said Representative Ike Skelton , a Missouri Democrat who is set to chair the House Armed Services Committee, and who has been calling for a larger Army for more than a decade. But it would take years and billions of dollars to recruit, train, and equip the 30,000 troops and 5,000 Marines the Pentagon says it needs. And military recruiters, fighting the perception that signing up means a ticket to Baghdad, have had to rely on financial incentives and lower standards to meet their quotas. That has led Pentagon officials to consider casting a wider net for noncitizens who are already here, said Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Hilferty , an Army spokesman. Already, the Army and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security have &quot;made it easier for green-card holders who do enlist to get their citizenship,&quot; Hilferty said. Other Army officials, who asked not to be identified, said personnel officials are working with Congress and other parts of the government to test the feasibility of going beyond US borders to recruit soldiers and Marines. Currently, Pentagon policy stipulates that only immigrants legally residing in the United States are eligible to enlist. There are currently about 30,000 noncitizens who serve in the US armed forces, making up about 2 percent of the active-duty force, according to statistics from the military and the Council on Foreign Relations. About 100 noncitizens have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. A recent change in US law, however, gave the Pentagon authority to bring immigrants to the United States if it determines it is vital to national security. So far, the Pentagon has not taken advantage of it, but the calls are growing to take use the new authority. Indeed, some top military thinkers believe the United States should go as far as targeting foreigners in their native countries. &quot;It's a little dramatic,&quot; said Michael O'Hanlon , a military specialist at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution and another supporter of the proposal. &quot;But if you don't get some new idea how to do this, we will not be able to achieve an increase&quot; in the size of the armed forces.<br />
