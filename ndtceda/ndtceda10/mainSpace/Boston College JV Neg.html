<u><strong>H1-B Counterplan</strong></u><br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should ban the issuance of all future H-1B visas. All foreign students receiving undergraduate or graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and/or math fields from accredited US universities will receive permanent resident cards. <br />
<br />
Banning H-1B visas is the only way to solve for worker exploitation <br />
Roy Lawson, Immigration Daily, 2009, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.itpaa.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2215" rel="nofollow">http://www.itpaa.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2215</a><br />
&quot;We should not risk losing&quot; and &quot;most exploitable and cheapest workers&quot;<br />
<br />
Green cards for all STEM graduates solves for labor shortages and recruiting of high killed immigrants to the US<br />

<br />
Green cards promote innovation and competitiveness better than H-1B visas<br />

&quot;But how that opportunity is offered&quot; and &quot;pass the Lofgren EB reform bills.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><strong>H1-B Case Arguments</strong></u><br />
<br />
Turn: Domestic violence is widespread and increasing against the spouses of H1-B visa holders -- green card status is key to liberating women<br />
Sharmila Lodhia, Women's Studies Quarterly, Spring/Summer, 2010, p. 164-5<br />
&quot;In describing earlier patterns of gendered&quot; and &quot;citizens or legal permanent residents (Davis 2004).&quot; <br />
<br />
Turn: Lack of mobility means H-1B workers get exploited by employers -- green card status solves<br />
Paula Chakravartty, &quot;Weak Winners of Globalization&quot;, AAPI Nexus, 3.2., Winter 2005, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://people.umass.edu/pchakrav/research/publications/weak_winners.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://people.umass.edu/pchakrav/research/publications/weak_winners.pdf</a><br />
&quot;<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">However, unlike a green card holder</span>&quot; and &quot;or &quot;<span style="background-color: cyan; color: black;">techno-slaves</span>.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn: H1-B visa is unethical because it subjects foreign workers to exploitation by giving corporations control over immigration status<br />
Roy Lawson, Immigration Daily, 2009, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.itpaa.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2215" rel="nofollow">http://www.itpaa.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2215</a><br />
&quot;The H-1B is a 3-6 year&quot; and &quot;foreign workers from abuse&quot;<br />
<br />
Democracy Promotion<br />
a. Violating the rights of H-1B workers undermines US democracy promotion <br />
Sabrina Underwood, Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, Summer 2001, p. 743<br />
&quot;It is inconsistent and unjust for a country&quot; and &quot;pursuit of happiness with integrity.&quot;<br />
<br />
b. Democracy is key to preventing global nuclear war<br />
Joshua Muravchik, &quot;Democracy and Nuclear Peace&quot;, 2001, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.npec-web.org/Syllabus/Muravchik.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.npec-web.org/Syllabus/Muravchik.pdf</a><br />
&quot;The greatest impetus for world peace&quot; and &quot;law in international relations.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn: H-1B program denies temporary workers individual freedom and political equality because they lack job mobility and citizenship rights<br />
Sharmila Rudrappa, University of San Francisco Law Review, Fall 2009, p. 371-2<br />
&quot;The liberal American state is built on&quot; and &quot;seen as inherently non-existent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn: Temporary workers are treated as commodities <br />
Sharmila Rudrappa, University of San Francisco Law Review, Fall 2009, p. 366-7<br />
&quot;The incorporation, allocation, control&quot; and &quot;expanding the H-1B program&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn: Temporary status makes H-1B workers the target of social and political hostility <br />

&quot;The workers who are coming to the&quot; and &quot;Asian workers faced in the 1800s.&quot;<br />

&quot;Unfortunately, the polarizing atmosphere&quot; and &quot;necessary 67 votes is not a given.&quot;<br />
<br />
Impacts<br />
1. New START treaty is key to preventing a Cold War with Russia, a nuclear arms race, global proliferation, undermining crisis stability -- this would dramatically increase the <span style="background-color: fuchsia; color: black;">risk</span> of accidental war with Russia<br />
Stephen Blank, &quot;Russia and Arms Control: Are There Opportunities for the Obama Administration?&quot;, 2009, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf</a><br />
&quot;Similarly, under the circumstances&quot; and &quot;with a corpse in the cargo.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. US-Russian nuclear arms race increase the <span style="background-color: fuchsia; color: black;">risk</span> of nuclear war and extinction<br />
Bill Wickersham, The Missourian, April 30, 2008, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2008/04/30/us-russia-need-reverse-arms-race/" rel="nofollow">http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2008/04/30/us-russia-need-reverse-arms-race/</a><br />

<br />
Nuclear terrorism will cause global nuclear war, leading to extinction<br />

<br />
Conventional PGS capabilities are not restricted by START<br />
Kingston Reif, &quot;Joseph and Edelman Wrong on New START&quot;, June 23, 2010, p. nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2010/6/23/174512/662<br />
&quot;New START will count ICBMs&quot; and &quot;for example, boost-glide systems&quot;<br />
<br />
START will not prevent deployment of conventional PGS -- Bolton's claims are false<br />
Dennis Gormley, September 20, 2010, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.securityconsensus.org/2010/09/15/bolton-is-still-wrong-on-start/" rel="nofollow">http://www.securityconsensus.org/2010/09/15/bolton-is-still-wrong-on-start/</a><br />
