 <strong>What is Risk</strong><br />
<strong>Ulrich Beck Writes that:</strong><br />
Risk is not the same as catastrophe, ... is absolutized and held constant <br />
<br />
<strong>Decision-Makers Host Risk Whether They Like it or Not -- The 1AC only demand Hospitalitiy for Migrant to Allevieate Risk</strong> <br />
<strong>As Beck writes:</strong><br />
theories are usually orientated to stability .... insurable in their ultimate effects. <br />
<br />
<strong>The Question of this debate is NOT an Objective Calculus of Risk -- But Instead the Perception of Risk</strong> <br />
<strong>Beck writes:</strong><br />
The more overtly global risks ... sophisticated probability scenarios of the experts. <br />
<br />
<strong>Beck Continues in 2009 .... (Ulrich Beck, 2009 [Professor Sociology at Munich University and the London School of Economics and Senior Lab Fellow at Harvard &quot;The Normative Horizorn of World Risk Society: Normative and Descriptive Cosmopolitanism&quot; <em>Constellations</em> 16.1: 3-22])</strong><br />
it is easy to underestimate the subtlety of ... probability scenarios of the experts. <br />
<br />
<strong>Fiat Debate Has Become Like &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; Every Round Disposes of a New Extinction Event. This Endless Repetition of Banal Apocalypse Increases Public Cynicism and Elite Control.</strong><br />
<strong>Randals 2009 [Samuel, &quot;Precaution, preemption: arts and technologies of the actionable future.&quot; <em>Environment and Planning.</em> 27: .pp. 859-878]</strong> <br />
Politics we have argued that preemption ... often evacuated from media sensationalism. <br />
<br />
<strong>Refuse their Impact Calculus.</strong> <br />
<strong>The 1AC is Experienced as Meaningless Risk.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;Research&quot; which:</strong> <br />
unreflectively succumbs to ... political realist and splits it apart.<br />
<br />
<strong>Beck continues in 2009</strong><br />
Since the 1980s at the latest ... critical theory of the world risk society. <br />
<br />
<strong>This is the Starting Point for Politics -- We need to explore the Gps in Our Knowledge -- Voting Negative Cultivates Enchantment Which is Key to Education.</strong><br />

Carmen Dell’Aversano 2010 “the love whose name cannot be spoken: queering the human-animal bond” journal for critical animal studies, volume III issue ½ 2010<br />
A real oxymoronic…to have moved beyond ourselves.<br />
Kritik turns case—maintaining the human-non-human binary dooms them to endless cycles of subordination <br />
Steven Best, 2007 (no other cite info given)<br />
While a welcome advance over the anthropocentric conceit… Christianity left behind.<br />
<strong>1nc grammar of encounter</strong><br />
Grammar of encounter is used to describe a mode of critique dominating the status quo. It enables diverse crticial styles from policy research to post-structural theory. But this tens towards a three step method<br />
George Pavlich 05 University of Alberta Law and Critique 16: 95-112<br />
The development of critique…courses of action.<br />
Migrants surging beyond the limits of the status quo are their own. We might have decisions, but we do not have to appeal to external criteria<br />
George Pavlich 05 University of Alberta Law and Critique 16: 95-112<br />
stands at the threshold of what is…and incomplete mastery.<br />
Voting neg interrupts the assumption that judgment is the “natural” response. Radicalize the 1ac possibilities by leaving aside elements disposing us towards the status quo<br />
George Pavlich 2000 (“Nietzsche, crtitique, and the promise of not being thus…” <em>International Journal for the Semiotics of Law</em> 13: 357-375)<br />
As the collective name of its varied…process outside the quagmire.<br />
We welcome an experience of uncertain negotiation rather than a completed motion of judgement. Pavolich asks: <br />
George Pavlich 05 University of Alberta Law and Critique 16: 95-112<br />
must we ask the foreigner…different ways to be.<br />
The trick is to develop flexible openness to the process of negotiaions<br />
George Pavlich 05 University of Alberta Law and Critique 16: 95-112<br />
at stake here is…and even enemies.<br />
Welcome 1ac possibility that cannot be assimilated <br />
Rachel Jones 2009 “on the value of not knowing: wonder, beginning again, and letting be.<br />
Thus described, wonder is…again and beginning anew.<br />
<strong>2nc humanism:</strong><br />
Our challenge to humanism ruptures western aesthetics’ racist denigration of irrational bodily affect---this also proves Eshu’s abject body solves their impact<br />
Richard Twine 2001 (“Ma(r)king essence- ecofeminism and embodiment” <em>Ethics and the Environment,</em> 6(2)]<br />
Bodies then (as conceived)…upon categorization and epistemology.<br />
Their solvency locks us in a rationalized western aesthetic<br />
Susan McManus 2007 [theory &amp; event 10.3]<br />
Badiou’s case turns on two key movements…tends toward reification. <br />
The 1ac channels its harms through a narrative of redemption. This cuts off connection with the people described in the 1ac by establishing a “border of innocence” <br />
Tawia Ansah 2005 (“Genocide and the Eroticization of Death: Law, violence, and Moral Purity” <em>Southern California Interdisciplinary Journal</em> Vol. 14)<br />
By extension, I posit…dichotomized and contradictory.<br />
<strong>Eshu solvency:</strong><br />
Alt solves the case<br />
Jonathan Golberg 2009 (<em>Tempest in the Caribbean</em> pg. 98-99)<br />
The body is far more determinate…yearn for freedom.<br />
Our myth solves—Eshu communicates a rupture in western aesthetics of order<br />
David Allison 2009 (<em>The Obsessions of George Bataille: community and communication</em> ed. Mitchell/ Winfree p. 122-123, 127)<br />
To communicate with another is…communication with other humans.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Sacred Trickster</strong><br />
-The poem describes how Eshu was making perfect men and women but then he got drunk off of palm wine and started to make errors when creating humanity (this explains deformities and differences between people).<br />
- They do not explain what the poem means in the 1nc - only in cross-x<br />
- &quot; The aff is form of myth making but the this is a better way to engage in myth making - the 1ac talks about resisting harms but fails to foster enchantment&quot; - it is a better way to engage the public sphere (?)<br />
<br />
<strong>T (Framework)</strong><br />
<br />
a. interp: the aff must deliberate on teh resolution offering a reaction to its substance - the negatieve contests the choices of the 1ac.<br />
Resolved is an analytical reduction<br />
Should demands emotional reaction to past or present fact<br />
substantially means essentia<strong>l</strong><br />
<br />
b. fiat is a voting issue<br />
1. explodes predictable limits - they defend a narrow example of the resolution - their refusal to deliberate on its essentials justifies an infinite number of plans<br />
2. fiate stifles deliberation- restricting debate to a referendum on the plan inhibits the creativity of political argumentation<br />
chambers 2006<br />
3. fiat gives them extra-topical ground - this is a voting issue because it allows them to bypass the realities of political deliberation<br />
4. extra t justifies neg counterplaning out the extra t plan parts. we no claim the plan as negative ground and kritiks of the rest of the 1ac as net benefits<br />
<br />
c. this is a voter for education<br />
fiat distorts rhetoric, which is the lynchpin of immigration policy deliberation. they subordinate the discussion to policy outcome<br />
ono 2002<br />
<br />
even if predictions are good, reject the 1ac. the low-threshold of proof the 1ac offers to support the plan performs a flawed methodology or risk<br />
