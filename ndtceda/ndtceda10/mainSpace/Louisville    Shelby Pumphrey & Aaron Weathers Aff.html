Here is the caselist for all Louisville varsity teams on the affirmative and negative:<br />
<br />
This is a protest against the exclusionary practices and ideologies of the debate community, with minimal relation to the topic. Our squad's mission statement is to use policy debate to increase effective decision making in a multicultural democracy. <br />
<br />
Here are some of the key authors and arguments we use and the context is the same as what we use in the 1AC or 1NC.<br />
<br />
David Hall: (Invisibility) &quot;The American Dilemma: The Invisible Tears of Invisible Children.&quot;<br />
Cornell West: (Nihilism) &quot;Race Matters.&quot;<br />
Paolo Freire: (Oppression) &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed.&quot;<br />
Tim Wise: (White Privilege) &quot;White Like Me.&quot;<br />
Peggy MacIntosh: (White Privilege) &quot;White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack.&quot; <br />
Roy L. Brooks: (Reparations) &quot;When Sorry Isn't Enough.&quot;<br />

 I look through my eyes there are tears of struggle <br />
Flow destroys your heritage and we fade away—include minorities and gays<br />
Should I give up? We leave activity because of assimilation <br />
Leads to nihilistic threat that can only be solved by assimilation <br />
Whiteness is not to be soen as a bioloigical construction but a social construction <br />
Whiteness has nothing toi do with culture but social position—whites go through life accepting privileges without dealing with costs <br />
Minorities deal with the costs—leads to nihilism <br />
Whiteness is normalizing <br />
In this round—they say they are protests against cap but they clearly engage in it –we are trying to create change—not them <br />
They say we should use experiences but we need to use political systems—trying to transform institutions <br />
Speed makes it inaccessible –we are not trained in debate norms <br />
He purposely sped up when we said clear<br />
It harms education for everyone that does not adapy to this norm <br />
The worst norm is the flow—it is not objective and privleges those that use the flow and ignores the African American speaking style <br />
We need to stay true to our culture <br />
African American speaking puts emphasis on performance <br />
We engaged the rez just not the way they want us to<br />
African americans use their historical context to evaluate their lives <br />
They say whatever they need to just to win the round <br />
Whiteness situate s peapolple in social situations <br />
Minority impacts are never big enough because nuclear war always “outweighs”<br />
Get rid of the flow to lead to inclusion <br />
Will our wish be left unfilled or will our wishes be left like airplanes?<br />
<br />

 It is not a surprise that they change the way they debate against Louisville <br />
Personal experiences are important to how we represent ourselves <br />
They do nothing to solve this problem—they say they do for cap what we do for racism but they do nothing because they do not sacrifice their competitive success for cap <br />
Speed debate and flows are bad—they are complacent in the structure because they are not a minority so they are cool with it <br />
Debaters respond to what is important through wins and losses—so they need to acknowledge what we are saying or they lose <br />
They are reading cards that they have no emotional connection with <br />
We need to work in the spaces where we have direct agency—this is where we get our education—not in the USFG <br />
They are doing nothing for cap or racism<br />
They say we don’t talk about the topic correctly—this is ridiculous considering he never has to slow down, he sped up and now that voids our education <br />
They make all these framework arguments but they never have to engage with what we do <br />
Wwe lose debates because the minority is not valued—this is not our fault—we are trying to acknowledge this
