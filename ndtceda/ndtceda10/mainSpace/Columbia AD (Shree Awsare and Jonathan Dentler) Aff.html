Chapter 1: The Sacred<br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span><br />
The visa regime operates via an ideology of separation—in the interview room, subjects are forced to participate in a confessionary complex where they must reveal their identities in a benign manner to the INS agent. This self-policing reduces their subjectivities to abstractions shaped by sacred, social scripts, and is at the foundation of biopolitical management.<br />

<br />
The ideology of separation that manifests itself in the visa regime is also reflected within policy debate. Debate has evolved from an exclusive forum for future policymakers to a paradoxical community that is ungrounded and constantly shifting. For example, what it means to be resolved has undergone scrutiny—kritikal affirmatives interrogated what it means to be the subject of the resolution, and the proliferation of these perspectives show how there is no single, universal way to affirm. Yet, to maintain policy debate’s location as the intersection between competition and education, some participants continue to engage in sacred rituals to produce absolute, prima facie issues that determine what is and isn’t productive debate. The maintenance of the sacred requires ritual acts of sacrifice in the name of linguistic commonality—debaters are forced to disclose their arguments in a manner intelligible to the majority, which mandates the destruction of alterity.<br />

The systematic exclusion of the unintelligible from pedagogy is biopolitics par excellance—it requires the extermination of the Other to ascertain the health of debate. Even liberal forms become totalitarian as they become concerned with the administration of life in the name of everyone—this makes unconditional violence inevitable.<br />

The biopolitical determination of the threshold beyond which life ceases to have juridical value creates the category of a “life devoid of value” which spills over to the biological body of every living being and nullifies value to death<br />

</span></span><br />
<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In an attempt to uphold the sacred altar of fairness in debate, many members of our community voted for a resolution that condemns the topic of immigration solely to a discussion of visas, which eliminates core questions that do not lie within the bounds of what the community thinks is predictable. But, the resolution can’t be reduced to the brief verbal portrait shaped by its anonymous framers and discourses of power—our affirmation is a gesture of belonging-to-impropriety that reveals the central emptiness of the resolution and simultaneously makes reading it possible while exceeding its sacred intent.<br />
