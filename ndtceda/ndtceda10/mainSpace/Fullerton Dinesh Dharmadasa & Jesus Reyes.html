<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The history of immigration to the United States has a long and anachronistic relationship to the portrayal of sexualities. The late UC Santa Cruz professor of Sociology, Lionel Cantú, writes in <u>The Sexuality of Migration</u> </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(2009)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> about the way different immigration laws made a clear distinction between legal citizens/migrants, and “illegal aliens” who were not welcomed into the United States.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Cantú provides a blatantly clear example of the division between legal/illegal migrations in the mission statement of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The INS’ so-called “mission” is to help facilitate the naturalization of those people seeking “legal” citizenship. As part of their mission, the INS is also in charged of “apprehending or removing those <em><u>aliens</u></em> who enter or remain illegally in the United States and/or whose stay is not in the public interest” </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Cantú 2009, pg.42)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> According to Cantú, the creation of the binary between a legal person and an “illegal alien” sets the tone that an <em>alien</em> is unwanted and not in the public’s interest. Those who don’t follow the process of visas – a process in which the privileged bodies that benefit the U.S. economically and socially are readily admitted – are always marginalized as outsiders and undesirables. This creates a hatred that is always present to the millions of immigrants in the United States that do not have the proper paperwork in the status quo. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Dr. Martin F. Manalansan, in his article titled “Queer Intersections” goes to further explain what the law dictated as what was and was not part of the public interest. Manalansan’s historical research of queer bodies touches upon the sexualization of Chinese migrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Chinese women were the embodiment of illicit sex, loose morals, and diseases; while Chinese men were portrayed as either feminine, asexual men, or threatening heterosexuals preying on American women. Manalansan also touches upon the demonization of homosexuals in the history of immigration. The McCarren-Walter Act was an important act of immigration legislation that barred homosexuals from entering the United States because they were considered to suffer psychopathic conditions akin to infectious diseases </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Manalansan 2006, pg. 230-231)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">. Manalansan states that sexuality is a powerful tool that constructs particular groups of people as sexual deviants and morally corrupted “aliens” who should be restricted entry. These laws justify the violence done against sexualized bodies in the name of “American morals.” These morals give The State the power to normalize identities, and portray certain traits as normal. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The power that the State has through the normalization and restriction of sexual identities (through the visa system) creates a stratified system that reproduces identities that are assumed to be “biological” or “natural.” According to Cantú in 2009, he states that: </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span class="underline">The citizen....</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">mmigrants. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">These “normalized” identities create problems, not just to the immigrant populations, but also the communities of color that have been living “legally” in the United States. Dr. Eithne Luibhéid, Director of the Committee of LGBT Studies at the University of Arizona, states in her article titled “Queer/Migration” that the heteronormative governance of migrants spills over to those who already hold official “citizenship.” </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Luibhéid 2008, pg. 175)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> Peoples of color are always marked by their “queered” appearance, therefore the violent and racist remarks against “illegals” affect communities that have been established already as American. The normalized, negative image of the queer migrant marks those that are labeled as “non-whites” and forces those bodies to prove their “citizenship” in order to show their good behavior. This sort of laws crop up throughout America, most recently in the State of Arizona. Latina/o communities are being victimized for simply looking “Illegal” and must constantly prove their citizenship with the proper identification to the State. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Dr. Luibhéid has labeled this process of marginalization as Heteronormativity. Not only does Heteronormativity create hierarchies of race and class, but also of sex and gender </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Luibhéid 2008, pg 173-174)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">. Dr. Luibhéid explains that, in order for migrants to enter the United States, they have to show that they can do two things: (1) that they could be “exemplary American citizens” and also that (2) they uphold “American morals.” Those morals create a heteronormative queer body, and privileges those queer bodies that could recreate families that are deemed biological and natural. Dr. Luibhéid states that nation-states, like the United States “implemented eugenic policies that encouraged migration and settlement by families that both conformed to the normative sexual order and were (or would become) ‘white’”. Although these eugenic policies have become less explicit over the decades after their implementation, Luibhéid argues that migration policies still display preferences for bodies that do not challenge the rationalized heterosexuality. Thus, national heteronormativity is a regime of power that all migrants must negotiate, making them differentially vulnerable to exclusion at the border or deportation once inside the United States. Heteronormativity connects to larger imperial regimes of power </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Luibhéid 2008, pg 173-174)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Heteronormativity, as the foundation of our society, enforces the oppression of the sexualized Other. Dr. Gust A. Yep, professor of Communication Studies at SFSU, </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(The Violence of Heteronormativity) </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">further explains that this normalization is the site of violence. “Heteronormativity, as the invisible center and the presumed bedrock of society, is the quintessential force creating, sustaining, and perpetuating the erasure, marginalization, disempowerment, and oppression of sexual others”. Those individuals that are living at the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality must learn to conform and ignore their suffering in order to survive. According to Dr. Yep, the process of coping through the repression of pain is a powerful mechanism for heteronormativity to perpetuate itself in current forms of social organization. Queer bodies that do not fit the image of the “heteronormative queer” must continually police themselves. </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Yep 2003, pg. 18-19)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Heteronormativity is a powerful tool that recreates Soul Murder. Soul Murder allows for the eradication of the Other through self-hatred. Dr. Yep further explains that: </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="text-indent: .3in;"><span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">These are the internal injuries....</span></span>soul murder?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>Now, the framework for this debate is: who best disturbs heteronormativity and negative forms of whiteness as it relates to intercollegiate debate and encompassing parts citizenship</strong>  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>We believe that the heteronormativity that allows for the exclusion of queer bodies has permeated into academic activities such as debate. This year’s resolution focuses only on “legal” migration, forcing participants of the activity to prioritize bodies that are already deemed “good” for Society as a whole. The resolution forces participants to play the role of the INS, policing our selves and making sure we include the “good” policy debater that talks about the resolution, and forcing those “queer” debaters that aren’t topical out of the periphery.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><strong>We believe that in order to disturb and fight against heteronormativity, we must speak from the position of the Queer Migrant, the body that is already silenced and demonized through heteronormativity. Because of their position, Queer Migrants are the antithesis of what is the proper citizen.</strong></span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"><br />
<strong>Our advocacy: we should embrace the Queer Migrant, through the art exhibit of “El Doble”, to break down normalizing practices that perpetuate heteronormativity and negative whiteness.</strong>  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt;"><br />
</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">In 2003, artists Nelson Ricart-Guerrero and Christian Vauzelle, presented their art exhibit entitled “El Doble” in Ricart-Guerrero’s home country of the Dominican Republic. “El Doble” was made up of self-portraits of Ricart-Guerrero and Vauzelle. The images placed in the spotlight Queer Migrants (Ricart-Guerrero being a migrant in France) </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The portraits portrayed queer bodies in a way that they embodied a form of queerness, but at the same time, it wasn’t a queerness that could be understood. Dr. Maja Horn explained the significance of this exhibit in her article “Queer Caribbean Homecomings” because El Doble placed queer migrants as “neither fundamentally different from nor inherently the same as heterosexual subjects”</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(Luibhéid 2008, pg 182)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Dr. Horn further explains in her 2009 article that </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; font-weight: normal;">“El Doble” intertwines the relation between the Self and the Other.  </span><br />
<br />
“<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Their queer</span></span> <span style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 16px;">.....</span><span class="underline"> to identify with it.</span> “<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Horn goes on to further explain that El Doble was politically charged because it created the disturbance needed to break down heteronormativity. Luibhéid agrees with Horn, adding that it encouraged others into becoming politically active in the Dominican Republic</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> (Luibhéid 2008, pg. 182)</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Both Dr. Manalansan and Dr. Luibhéid conclude that representations of the Queer Migrant are needed in order to break down heteronormativity. Because of the Queer Migrant’s positionality on the outside of the “norm,” and because the queer migrant body is the site where <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">the racialized, ethnicized, and gendered disciplinary measures employed by various states and their agents come together, this gives the Queer Migrant body the tools to fight heteronormativity.</span></span> </span>
