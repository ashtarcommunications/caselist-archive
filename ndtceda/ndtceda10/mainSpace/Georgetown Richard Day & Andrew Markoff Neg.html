A. Interpretation – there is a distinction between eligibility standards and admissibility standards for visas. Beneficiary eligibility refers to ability to apply for a visa, admissibility is after the application.<br />
Hasche, 2005 (Tilman, partner with the firm of Parker, Butte &amp; Lane, P.C., “An overview of immigration law,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc</a>, July 25,<br />

Predictability – Only pre-application eligibility is stable and codified in law – post-application admissibility is unpredictable and subject to discretionary rulings<br />

Complexity in the Immigration … requiring professional assistance<br />

And the impact is a massive limits explosion – allowing admissibility gives you 8 tiny exclusions multiplied by 4 broad visa categories <br />

<br />
Grounds for Exclusion <br />
All aliens seeking … history of the provisions. <br />
<br />
And Direction of ground should determine the direction of limits – no serious academic supports restricting immigration – err toward a smaller topic that limits out tiny sad-face affs <br />

<br />

<br />
Finally, prefer our strict legal interpretation – Immigration law is complicated and word meanings are often counter-intuitive – Any loose counter-interpretation kills predictable limits because we don’t have a stable meaning for the resolution and independently kills education because we don’t learn about the intricacies of the topic <br />

Only our interpretation gives any meaning to the word “visa” – admissibility has nothing to do with the ability to receive a visa, only with entering the U.S. once you have a Visa <br />

In 1991, he was promoted to the position of Senior Special Agent and was assigned to the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force and worked with members of other federal and state law enforcement agencies as well as law enforcement organizations of other countries. The task force's investigations of aliens involved in major drug trafficking organizations ultimately resulted in the seizure of their assets and prosecutions for a wide variety of criminal violations. Mr. Cutler has testified as an expert witness at nine Congressional hearings on issues relating to the enforcement of immigration laws having been called by members of both political parties. Mr. Cutler also furnished testimony to the Presidential Commission on the Terrorist Attacks of September 11. Mr. Cutler has appeared on numerous television and radio programs including the O’Reilly Radio Factor, O’Reilly’s No Spin Zone, Fox News and the Lou Dobbs Tonight Program on CNN to discuss the enforcement of immigration laws and has participated in various public debates and panel discussions on issues involving the enforcement and administration of immigration laws. Among the areas of concern that he is able to speak about authoritatively are the nexus between immigration and national security, the impact of immigration on the criminal justice system, strategies to combat illegal immigration, and why amnesty for illegal aliens is wrong.<br />

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services should grant all individuals without regularized immigration status that meet earned requirements and immigrants working in temporary jobs formal deferred action status. The USCIS should notify all enforcement officers that these individuals should be classified as non-priority. The USCIS should publish this new regulation on its website in multiple languages and distribute a memorandum detailing the change to immigration attorneys and relevant affected communities. The USCIS should share this information with border enforcement agencies in the Department of Homeland Security, notifying them that potential non-immigrant workers posses deferred action status.<br />

H-1B CP <br />
<br />
The United States federal government should expand H1-B visa eligibility to residents of Israeli and Palestinian territories and require that recipients must meet eligibility requirements for the Q visa. The United States federal government should grant first priority access to H1-B visas to residents of Israeli and Palestinian territories provided that they meet these requirements with the stipulation that they are only allowed to stay in the United States for 24 months. <br />
<br />
The plan grants visas without numerical limits. The counterplan makes them eligible for the H1-B visa which is subject to a numerical cap. The only real difference between the plan and the counterplan is that they expand the overall amount of immigration and we keep it within existing numerical quotas.<br />
<br />
Exclude Palestine CP<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should expand Q-2 visa eligibility to residents of Israeli territories and should expand the number of such visas available without regard to numerical limitations.<br />
<br />
The plan devastates US-Israel relations by also giving visas to Palestinians---Israel wants special treatment and view any wavering by Obama as an affront to the alliance---turns the entire case because it means Israel will balk at all demands for peace<br />
