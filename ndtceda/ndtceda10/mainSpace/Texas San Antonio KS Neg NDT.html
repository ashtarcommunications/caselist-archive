<strong>Preparation for war is warefare in itself- state of pure war erases the line between military and civilian coordinating all life around that of warmaking. All life becomes reduced to war.</strong> <br />
<br />
Borg 03 [Mark, practicing psychoanalyst and community/organizational consultant working in NYC “Psychoanaltic Pure War: Interactions with the Post-Apocalyptic Unconscious” <em>Journal for the Psychoanalysis of Culture and Society 8.1</em> 57-67]<br />
<br />
The philosophy (or practice)…means of recognizing it.”<br />
<br />
<strong>The obsessive focus on nuclear war is an extortion attempt that robs us of value to life by locking us into nuclear shelters</strong>- <br />
<br />

<br />
Everywhere survival has become… blackmail and life can go on.<br />

Such a rethinking of approaches… on-going politics for labour.<br />
<br />
<strong>When role-playing is privileges above our own self-creation, we become nothing but actors, unable to plan for the future or pursue projects.</strong><br />

humanity could be extinguished… between education and catastrophe.<br />
<br />
The form of our argument is important and co-constitutes with its content not just in the sense that it embraces a strategy of evil but more specifically how it quite literally speaks the very evil it calls forth through the belly of the empire of the good. The prophylactic sanitizing of the negative only risks more hyperbolic forms of terror erupting everywhere. the very form of speaking evil that constitutes the 1nc has the possibility of overturning all power relations critiqued through “the symbolic force of utterance”<br />
Baudrillard 93 (the transparency of evil, pg 81)<br />
Terrorism is in all its forms… force of an utterance.<br />
<br />
Cards spec to the aff:<br />
<br />
Asteroids/get off the rock:<br />
The current ontological state is prime for a form of political manipulation over the affirmative. The threat of asteroids gives privelege to the military-science complex that places it in the role of unquestionable hero. This applies militaristic spatialization to the galaxy in an attempt to control the uncontrollable. This sparks a disciplinary attempt to control the global population in the name of planetary survival.<br />
Mellor 7 (“colliding worlds: asteroid research and legitimization of war in space”, social studies of science)<br />
The asteroid impact threat was… helping to unify the human species.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their calls to dismiss the aff to get off the rock only privileges the elites and serves the system of mass ecological destruction and exploitation of others<br />
Abdelrahim 8 (layla, “beyond the symbolic and towards the collapse: intro to john zerzan’s conferences in montreal”)<br />
I can understand how some … capitalist elites, for peril.<br />

Internet:<br />
No freedom in the internet like their turns speak to --- the hell of the same<br />
