According to the most recent UN data,</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the most authoritive figures at our disposal, </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">world forestland today covers 4 billion hectares, more than 30 percent of the total global land area. That figure has not changed appreciably since 1950</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, even in the midst of the population explosion, massive economic growth, and urbanization of the globe. Today forestland occupies about one-third of the United States, and that proportion has been expanding steadily for over 70 years. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">According to the U.S. Forest Service</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, 22 million new cubic feet of wood are grown annually </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">in the United States</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while only 16.5 million cubic feet are harvested. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Net annual growth exceeds annual harvests in commercial forests by 27 percent. Since 1920 U.S. forests have expanded by 57 percent</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a remarkable fact given that during the same period the U.S. population doubled, the economy grew by a factor of 6, and per capita output increased by a factor of 3. Forestland has increased by 27 percent since 1952.32 Although demand for wood products today is at an all-time high, the United States is still able not only to meet demand with currently available timber stock but to continue adding to forest reserves. In fact, there is only one-third less forestland in the United States today than there was in the 1600s when European settlers first encountered it. An example of the striking increase in U.S. forest reserves is found in New England, where logging thrived in the 19th century. From the mid-1800s to 1980 the amount of land covered by forests increased from 74 to 90 percent in Maine; from 50 to 86 percent in New Hampshire; from 35 to 76 percent in Vermont; and from 35 to 59 percent in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.33 That growth in forest reserves is reflected in the price of various wood commodities. The real prices of lumber and paper have fallen by 10 and 25 percent, respectively, since 1980.

<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Advocates of the conservation of biodiversity tend not to acknowledge the distinction between resilient and sensitive ES. This ‘low resilience assumption’ gives rise to, and is reinforced by the almost ubiquitous claim within the conservation literature that ES depend on biodiversity. An extreme example of this claim is made by the Ehrlichs in Extinction. They state that “all [ecosystem services] will be threatened if the rate of extinctions continues to increase” then observe that attempts to artificially replicate natural processes “are no more than partially successful in most cases. Nature nearly always does it better. When society sacrifices natural services for some other gain… it must pay the costs of substitution” (Ehrlich and Ehrlich 1982, pp. 95–96). This assertion—that the only alternative to protecting every species is a world in which all ES have been substituted by artificial alternatives—is an extreme example of the ‘low resilience assumption’. Paul Ehrlich revisits this flawed logic in 1997 in his response (with four co-authors) to doubts expressed by Mark Sagoff regarding economic arguments for species conservation (Ehrlich et al. 1997, p. 101). The claim that ES depend on biodiversity is also notably present in the controversial Issues in Ecology paper on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (Naeem et al. 1999) that sparked the debate mentioned in the introduction. This appears to reflect a general tendency among authors in this field (e.g., Hector et al. 2001; Lawler et al. 2002; Lyons et al. 2005). Although such authors may not actually articulate the low resilience assumption, presenting such claims in the absence of any clarification indicates its influence. That <strong>the low resilience assumption is largely false</strong> is apparent in the <strong>number of examples</strong> of species extinctions that have not brought about catastrophic ecosystem collapse and decline in ES, and in the generally limited ecosystem influence of species on the cusp of extinction. These issues have been raised by numerous authors, although given the absence of systematic attempts to verify propositions of this sort, the evidence assembled is usually anecdotal and we are forced to trust that an unbiased account of the situation has been presented. Fortunately <strong>a number of highly respected people have discussed this topic</strong>, not least being the prominent conservation biologist David Ehrenfeld. In 1978 he described the ‘conservation dilemma’, which “arises on the increasingly frequent occasions when we encounter a threatened part of Nature but can find no rational reason for keeping it” (Ehrenfeld 1981, p. 177). He continued with the following observation: Have there been permanent and significant ‘resource’ effects of the extinction, in the wild, of John Bartram’s great discovery, the beautiful tree Franklinia alatamaha, which had almost vanished from the earth when Bartram first set eyes upon it? Or a thousand species of tiny beetles that we never knew existed before or after their probable extermination? Can we even be certain than the eastern forests of the United States suffer the loss of their passenger pigeons and chestnuts in some tangible way that affects their vitality or permanence, their value to us? (p. 192) Later, at the first conference on biodiversity, Ehrenfeld (1988) reflected that most species “do not seem to have any conventional value at all” and that the rarest species are “the ones least likely to be missed… by no stretch of the imagination can we make them out to be vital cogs in the ecological machine” (p. 215). The appearance of comments within the environmental literature that are consistent with Ehrenfeld’s—and from authors whose academic standing is also worthy of respect—is uncommon but not unheard of (e.g., Tudge 1989; Ghilarov 1996; Sagoff 1997; Slobodkin 2001; Western 2001). </span></u><br />

<br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> The debate over climate change generally transpires within the cloistered confines of expensive hotels, executive boardrooms, and diplomatic halls. As seen in the failure to arrive at binding agreements in Copenhagen, the talks are generally as sterile as the surroundings. </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">As world leaders discuss the threat to the planet in various venues around the world, it’s the poor who face the dire consequences. Marginalized and vulnerable populations–from small farmers in Africa to fisher folk on the banks of island nations–suffer most from the refusal of developed nations and corporations to cut back on emissions that are heating up the planet. But these same populations offer important and sustainable solutions to global warming. </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The problem is that the world’s leaders are not listening. And that is not likely to change at the meeting on climate change in Cancun, Mexico that will start at the end of November and run through Dec. 10. </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Wasted Time </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">World leaders wasted precious years overcoming the bogus arguments of spurious scientists and purchased politicians who had a vested interest in denying that the climate was even changing. When that became impossible due to overwhelming scientific evidence, leaders have turned to a set of market-based mechanisms and technological fixes that avoid real commitments and promote the same economic model responsible for the crisis. </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">As a result, two worlds will collide in Cancun. The first is a world in denial where profits come before people and the planet, and the most threatening environmental crisis in history is viewed as a business opportunity. This world will be heavily represented by most developed country leaders and representatives of corporations hawking green projects as they continue to trash the environment and pursue unfettered access to ever-scarcer natural resources. </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The second is a world of small farmers, indigenous peoples, poor urban communities, and islanders that are suffering unprecedented droughts, water scarcity, and storms. Thousands of people from organizations throughout the world will travel to Cancun to make their voices heard. They are far from being just victims. The citizens of this second world are closely tied to local ecosystems, and in many cases their stewardship has guaranteed the conservation of the planet’s remaining forests (redefined by climate-change conservatives as “carbon sinks”), biodiversity, and watersheds. </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">Small farmers provide 70 percent of the world’s food supply. Global warming gravely threatens their ability to produce this food. Their farm practices can store carbon dioxide and reduce energy use in agriculture within a framework of small-scale production of local food and food sovereignty. Unfortunately, many of these small farmers have already joined the ranks of an estimated 50 million climate refugees. </span></span></u><br />
<u><span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The results of the Cancun climate change talks are a foregone conclusion. Following in the footsteps of the Copenhagen non-agreement, experts, activists, and the negotiators themselves have announced that they expect no binding agreements on emissions controls to come out of the conference.</span></span></u><br />

<u><strong>1) No impact to climate change – the rate of warming is slowing down now.</strong></u><br />
<u><strong>Science Daily</strong>, <strong>5/5</strong></u><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Science Daily, May 5 2008, “Will Global Warming Take A Short Break? Improved Climate Predictions Suggest A Reduced Warming Trend During The Next 10 Years”, &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080502113749.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/05/080502113749.htm</a>&gt;] </span></u><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">To date climate change projections, as published in the last IPCC report, only considered changes in future atmospheric composition. This strategy is appropriate for long-term changes in climate such as predictions for the end of the century. However, in order to predict short-term developments over the next decade, models need additional information on natural climate variations, in particular associated with ocean currents. </span></u><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Lack of sufficient data has hampered such predictions in the past. Scientists at IFM-GEOMAR and from the MPI for Meteorology have developed a method to derive ocean currents from measurements of sea surface temperature (SST). The latter are available in good quality and global coverage at least for the past 50 years. With this additional information, natural decadal climate variations, which are superimposed on the long-term anthropogenic warming trend, can be predicted. The improved predictions suggest that global <strong>warming will weaken slightly during the following 10 years.</strong> </span></u><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">“Just to make things clear: we are not stating that anthropogenic climate change won’t be as bad as previously thought”, explains Prof. Mojib Latif from IFM-GEOMAR. “What we are saying is that on top of the warming trend there is <strong>a long-periodic oscillation that will probably lead to a to a lower temperature increase</strong> than we would expect from the current trend during the next years”, adds Latif. “That is like driving from the coast to a mountainous area and crossing some hills and valleys before you reach the top”, explains Dr. Johann Jungclaus from the MPI for Meteorology. “In some years trends of both phenomena, the anthropogenic climate change and the natural decadal variation will add leading to a much stronger temperature rise.” </span></u><br />

<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Climate change is a much, much bigger issue than the public, politicians, and even the most alarmed environmentalists realize. Global warming extends to Mars, where the polar ice cap is shrinking, where deep gullies in the landscape are now laid bare, and where the climate is the warmest it has been in decades or centuries. &quot;One explanation could be that Mars is just coming out of an ice age,&quot; NASA scientist William Feldman speculated after the agency's Mars Odyssey completed its first Martian year of data collection. &quot;In some low-latitude areas, the ice has already dissipated.&quot; With each passing year more and more evidence arises of the dramatic changes occurring on the only planet on the solar system, apart from Earth, to give up its climate secrets. NASA's findings in space come as no surprise to Dr. Habibullo Abdussamatov at Saint Petersburg's Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory. Pulkovo -- at the pinnacle of Russia's space-oriented scientific establishment -- is one of the world's best equipped observatories and has been since its founding in 1839. Heading Pulkovo's space research laboratory is Dr. Abdussamatov, one of the world's chief critics of the theory that man-made carbon dioxide emissions create a greenhouse effect, leading to global warming. &quot;Mars has global warming, but without a greenhouse and without the participation of Martians,&quot; he told me. &quot;These parallel global warmings -- observed simultaneously on Mars and on Earth -- can only be a straightline consequence of the effect of the one same factor: a long-time change in solar irradiance.&quot; The sun's increased irradiance over the last century, not C02 emissions, is responsible for the global warming we're seeing, says the celebrated scientist, and this solar irradiance also explains the great volume of C02 emissions. &quot;It is no secret that increased solar irradiance warms Earth's oceans, which then triggers the emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So the common view that man's industrial activity is a deciding factor in global warming has emerged from a misinterpretation of cause and effect relations.&quot; Dr. Abdussamatov goes further, debunking the very notion of a greenhouse effect. &quot;Ascribing 'greenhouse' effect properties to the Earth's atmosphere is not scientifically substantiated,&quot; he maintains. &quot;Heated greenhouse gases, which become lighter as a result of expansion, ascend to the atmosphere only to give the absorbed heat away.&quot; </span></u><br />

<u><span style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong>A. The aff’s rhetoric of economic competition with other nations is misinformed and dangerous – it permeates government policy, resulting in serial failure and threatening the international economic system.</strong> </span></u><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Paul </span><strong>Krugman</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, professor of economics at MIT, “Competitiveness: A Dangerous Obsession,” </span><strong>1994</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucema.edu.ar/~agaletto/krugman_competitiveness.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucema.edu.ar/~agaletto/krugman_competitiveness.pdf</a> </span></u><br />

<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Guess what? Delors didn’t confront the problems of either the welfare state or the EMS. He explained that the root cause of European unemployment as a lack of competitiveness with the United States and Japan and that the solution was a program of investment in infrastructure and high technology. </span></u><br />
<u>It was a disappointing evasion, but not a surprising one. After all, the rhetoric of competitiveness—the view that, in the words of President Clinton, each nation is “like a big corporation competing in the global marketplace”—has become pervasive among opinion leaders throughout the world. People who believe themselves to be sophisticated about the subject take it for granted that the economic problem facing any modern nation is essentially one of competing on world markets—that the United States and Japan are competitors in the same sense that Coca-Cola competes with Pepsi—and are unaware that anyone might seriously question that proposition. Every few months a new best-seller warns the American public of the dire consequences of losing the “race” for the 21st century. A whole industry of councils on competitiveness, “geo-economists” and managed trade theorists has sprung up in Washington. Many of these people, having diagnosed America’s economic problems in much the same terms as Delors did Europe’s, are now in the highest reaches of the Clinton administration formulating economic and trade policy for the United States. So Delors was using a language that was not only convenient but comfortable for him and a wide audience on both sides of the Atlantic.</u><br />
<u>Unfortunately, his diagnosis was deeply misleading as a guide to what ails Europe, and similar diagnoses in the United States are equally misleading. The idea that a country’s economic fortunes are largely determined by its success on world markets is a hypothesis, not a necessary truth; and as a practical, empirical matter, that hypothesis is <strong>flatly wrong</strong>. That is, it is simply not the case that the world’s leading nations are to any important degree in economic competition with each other, or that any of their major economic problems can be attributed to failures to compete on world markets. The growing obsession in most advanced nations with international competitiveness should be seen, not as a well-founded concern, but as a view held in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence. And yet it is clearly a view that people very much want to hold—a desire to believe that is reflected in a remarkable tendency of those who preach the doctrine of competitiveness to support their case with careless, flawed arithmetic.</u><br />
<u>This article makes three points. First, it argues that concerns about competitiveness are, as an empirical matter, almost completely unfounded. Second, it tries to explain why defining the economic problem as one of international competition is nonetheless so attractive to so many people. Finally, it argues that the obsession with competitiveness is not only wrong but dangerous, skewing domestic politics and threatening the international economic system. This last issue is, of course, the most consequential from the standpoint of public policy. Thinking in terms of competitiveness leads, directly and indirectly, to bad economic policies on a wide range of issues, domestic and foreign, whether it be in healthcare or trade.</u><br />
<br />
<u><span style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong>B. Competitiveness rhetoric results in the commodification of institutional knowledge, gutting the effectiveness of our education and making global educational collaboration impossible.</strong> </span></u><br />

<br />
<u>For years, champions of high-stakes testing and mandatory curriculum standards have invoked a need to ratchet up the skills of future employees and, by extension, the revenues of U.S. corporations. Now, though, opponents of such policies are using the identical argument. In recent months, two prominent critics of No Child Left Behind have argued in separate articles that the law’s effect on instruction isn’t consistent with what’s needed to produce successful workers.</u><br />
<u>I’m sure they’re right. But just as we shouldn’t justify a wonderful curriculum by claiming it will raise standardized test scores – first, because such tests measure what matters least, and second, because claims of this sort serve to legitimate these tests – so we should hesitate to defend or criticize educational practices on economic grounds.</u><br />
<u>Various strands of evidence have converged to challenge the claim that the state of our economy is a function of how good our schools are at preparing tomorrow’s workers. For individual students, school achievement is only weakly related to subsequent workplace performance. And for nations, there’s little correlation between average test scores and economic vigor.</u><br />
<u>Schools make a tempting scapegoat when a company’s financial results are disappointing or when the economy as a whole falters. But an employee’s educational background is only one of many factors that determine his or her productivity. Worker productivity, in turn, is only one of many factors that determine corporate profitability. And corporate profitability is only one of many factors that determine the state of the economy – particularly the employment picture. Does anyone seriously believe, for example, that the main reason U.S. companies are shipping jobs by the millions to Mexico and Asia is because they believe those countries’ schools are better?</u><br />
<u>But let’s talk about values, not just facts. Is the main mission of schools really to prepare children to be productive workers who will do their part to increase the profitability of their future employers? Every time education is described as an “investment,” or schools are discussed in the context of the “global economy,” a loud alarm ought to go off, reminding us of the moral and practical implications of giving an answer in dollars to a question about schools. As Jonathan Kozol recently reminded us, good teachers “refuse to see their pupils as . . . pint-sized deficits or assets for America’s economy into whom they are expected to pump ‘added value.’”</u><br />
<u>Lending an even more noxious twist to the habit of seeing education in purely economic terms is the use of the word “competitiveness,” which implies that our goals should be framed in terms of beating others rather than doing well. When the topic is globalization, it’s commonly assumed that competition is unavoidable: For one enterprise (or country) to succeed, another must fail. But even if this were true – and economists Paul Krugman and the late David Gordon have separately argued it probably isn’t -- why in the world would we accept the same zero-sum mentality with respect to learning?</u><br />
<u>Consider the sport of ranking the U.S. against other nations on standardized tests. Once we’ve debunked the myth that test scores predict economic success, why would we worry about our country’s standing as measured by those scores? To say that our students are first, or tenth, on a list provides no useful information about how much they know or how good our schools are. If all the countries did reasonably well in absolute terms, there would be no shame in (and, perhaps, no statistical significance to) being at the bottom. If all the countries did poorly, there would be no glory in being at the top. Exclamatory headlines about how “our” schools are doing compared to “theirs” suggest that we’re less concerned with the quality of education than with whether we can chant, “We’re Number One!”</u><br />
<u>An essay published [in Education Week] last year reported that U.S. students are doing better in mathematics than earlier generations did. Was the author moved by this fact to express delight, or at least relief? On the contrary, he pronounced the current state of affairs “disturbing” because children in other countries are also doing well – and that, by definition, is considered bad news.</u> <br />
<u>Likewise, the New York Times warned in the late 1990s that “American high school graduation rates, for generations the highest in the world, have slipped below those of most industrialized countries.” Actually, on most measures, the U.S. is doing better than ever in terms of the proportion of our adults who finish school. But again we were invited to fret because progress had been made by other countries, too, meaning we were no longer king of the mountain.</u><br />
<u>What if we just ignored the status of students in other countries? That wouldn’t be especially neighborly, but at least we wouldn’t be viewing the gains of children in other lands as a troubling development. Better yet, <strong>rather than defending whatever policies will ostensibly help our graduates to “compete,” we could make decisions on the basis of what will help them collaborate effectively.</strong> Educators, too, might think in terms of working with – and learning from – their counterparts in other countries.</u><br />
<u>Even beyond the moral justification for transcending reflexive rivalry, Janet Swenson at Michigan State University points out that “we’ll all benefit from the best education we can provide to every child on the face of this planet. Do you care if it’s a child in Africa who finds a cure for cancer rather than a child in your country?” she asks.</u><br />
<u>It took me awhile to realize that at the core of the current “tougher standards” movement is a worldview characterized by artificial scarcity -- along with the assumption that schooling is ultimately about economic outcomes. A more reasonable and humane perspective is always hard to come by when we’re told that we’re in a race. <strong>The prospects for critical thought are particularly bleak if the race never ends</strong>.</u><br />
<u>Sadder still, the same competitive mindset shows up as district is pitted against district, school against school, student against student. Several years ago, one superintendent in the Northeast vowed that his city’s test scores would “never be last again” in his state. Like so many others, he was confusing higher scores with better learning. But this appalling statement also implied that his students didn’t have to improve; as long as kids in another community fared even more poorly, he would be satisfied. Such a position is not only intellectually indefensible (because of its focus on relative performance) but morally bankrupt (because of its indifference to the welfare of children in other places).</u><br />
<u>Almost any policy, it seems, no matter how harmful, can be rationalized in the name of “competitiveness” by politicians and corporate executives, or by journalists whose imaginations are flatter than the world about which they write. But educators ought to aim higher. Our loyalty, after all, is not to corporations but to children. Our chief concern – our “bottom line,” if you must -- is not victory for some but learning for all.</u><br />

<u>Today we face unprecedented complex and difficult problems that must be solved in order to ensure the continued existence of the human race on Earth. No policy of any kind can be formed without giving due consideration to environmental problems. Human knowledge must be gathered and wisdom brought to bear in the effort to find ways to continue the development of civilization while reducing the burden such an effort places on the environment. Universities must become aware of the role they should play in this regard. Universities engage in educational and research work in a wide range of fields such as technology, science, economics, and political sciences. Of course, all of these efforts touch upon the key question of sustainability. The question of just what sustainable development should be is debated by scientists, public policy makers, corporations, and environmental protection organizations. It is hoped that universities - by approaching the issue from the broadest possible perspective, one not tied to the interests of any particular group - will be able to develop concepts that will serve as a basis for productive debate. The subject of the Earth's environment and the totality of human activity is extremely large and complex. It cannot be properly addressed from the vantage point of a single branch of science or engineering, or by a single university, organization or national agency. <strong>What is needed is a comprehensive, international effort</strong>. Recognizing this, the former president of UT (The University of Tokyo), Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, MIT President Charles Vest, and the former president of ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology, Zurich) Jakob Nuesch signed an agreement under which their three universities would form an international cooperation research program called the Alliance for Global Sustainability (AGS) in 1996. (Chalmers University of Technology joined AGS in 2001.) Based on a partnership between these three universities, the AGS is designed to promote joint research projects that will result in realistic policy proposals for the development of a civilization that can be sustained within the limitations required to preserve the global environment. Specifically, the three universities aim to contribute to global society under a system of close cooperation among their departments created to carry out interdisciplinary projects in which scientific knowledge will be gathered, new technologies will be developed, and policy proposals will be made. The goal is to promote the type of development that will make it possible to preserve human civilization, resources and ecosystems on Earth. AGS' unique contribution lies in breaking down the barriers between the natural sciences, engineering, and the social sciences to enable researchers in a wide range of disciplines to participate in the debate. <strong>A comprehensive approach which transcends geographic regions and academic disciplines is needed to develop solutions that will make it possible to permanently sustain human life on this planet.</strong> Established by University of Tokyo, MIT, ETH, and Chalmers, the AGS will seek the participation of those in business and government as well as academic institutions in North and South America, Africa, Asia, Europe and other regions. The broadest possible cooperation among these participants will be sought to enable researchers to foster policy proposals and the development of new technologies that will make it possible to sustain civilization while preserving the natural environment. The cooperative relations for international research cooperation are conceived of in the broadest possible terms. Regional limitations on human activity are withering away, and environmental problems no longer can be confined within national or regional borders. This can only mean that wide-ranging cooperation is absolutely necessary. If a broad global perspective is not adopted, mankind will not be able to plot a course for sustainable social development. We are determined to utilize the international academic cooperation like the AGS to create a future that will guarantee health, safety and prosperity for our descendants -- for the entire human race.</u><br />

For nations, communities, and individual workers global competition is about competing against every other nation, community, and worker in the world for a declining pool of jobs by courting corporate favor. It is not about creating new jobs, but rather about redistributing them to those that are willing to give up the most in terms of wages, subsidies, tax breaks, working conditions, and environmental standards. More fundamentally it is about shifting wealth from communities and working people to corporations and share holders.<br />
The real issues behind economic globalization relate to power. Most so called trade agreements, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), are really agreements securing the rights of global corporations to operate freely wherever they chose. These agreements advance the process of delinking global corporations from accountability to all interests save one-a global financial system that relentlessly demands ever increasing financial returns. <br />
Accountable to the narrow interests of only one stakeholder, managers have little choice but to use the corporate power at their command to drive competitors from the market or absorb them through acquisitions, shed workers, bid down local wages and standards, and obtain ever greater subsidies and tax breaks from those localities they in turn favor with jobs. Those managers who do this successfully reap enormous financial rewards. Those who resist are cast out in favor of less principled replacements.<br />
It is quite disingenuous of those who sit at the pinnacles of corporate power to advise nations and communities to make themselves more globally competitive. The recommended measures do little to expand the total pool of jobs or increase average wages and the standards that make for healthy nations and communities. Rather they simply increase the public subsidies to those corporate managers and shareholders. The extreme inequality that is creating dangerous social and political instability throughout the world is an inherent consequence of an economic system in which people and communities are forced to compete for favor with giant corporations accountable only to the interests of global financial markets.<br />
<strong>Correcting the massive dysfunction that economic globalization has created will not be easy</strong>. The starting point must be a clear recognition that this dysfunction is inherent in a globalized economic system. We should also be clear that this system was put in place through intentional policy choices orchestrated by the powerful and well organized economic interests that have benefited from it. We can just as well put in place policies that result in a sharing of the benefits of technological change, and return both economic and political power to the local communities where people live and work.<br />
<strong>This will require people and communities to recognize that their interests are better served by international cooperation than by global competition</strong>. Through cooperation we can put in place policies that create a bias in favor of local rather than global capital and production systems, help us to move toward greater equity, protect the environment, nurture cultural diversity and exchange, raise living standards, and share experience, knowledge and technologies to the benefit of all people everywhere. If Messrs. Schwab and Smadja and their colleagues in the World Economic Forum truly wish to forestall the mounting backlash against the disruptive consequences of economic globalization, they should take the additional step of acknowledging that economic globalization is itself an inherently bad idea and join in this challenging endeavor.
