<br />
Borders and geopolitical control were achieved through violence – the states’ attempt to regulate its borders and the borders of other states is marked by an attempt to remove elements of centrifugal otherness that poses threats to the tenuous hold over territories and identities. As former stabilities of the bordered world turn into instabilities, violence is proliferated within the world and will continue to proliferation unless the impetus for control is removed.<br />

The Netherlands Provides Refugees with living and health necessities from the beginning, incorporating refugees into society quickly and more efficiently, solving the case and takes them off [Insert Country’s Name] hands<br />

<br />
Refugees were shown a video on daily life in the Netherlands; many had practical questions about topics ranging from the weather to housing, from the use of washing machines to health care services, from cycling to access to work. &quot;It was useful because we learned about life and our rights in the Netherlands,&quot; remembered teenage boy Malega, who attended the course. At the end of the training – now a standard component of the Dutch resettlement process – each participant received a certificate. After their arrival at Amsterdam airport, the immediate destination for the refugees was AZC Amersfoort, a reception centre where resettled refugees live until housing is allocated in a Dutch municipality. As residents of the centre, they receive additional cultural and language induction courses to help them prepare for integration in the Netherlands. Dutch classes at various levels are available, including a specific course for illiterate resettled refugees. In three months, the refugees will have a formal identity card, a bank account and a house in a Dutch municipality. The Dutch government began placing refugees in groups based on two main criteria: the refugees have the same nationality and come from the same camp, having been selected during the same resettlement mission. This benefits the refugees, who know each other before arrival. It is also appreciated by the receiving municipalities, which see resettlement in groups helps integration. The Netherlands was one of the first European countries to implement a refugee resettlement plan, starting in 1984. Since 1987, this country has welcomed 500 &quot;invited refugees&quot; each year.<br />

Travel arrangements to the resettlement country are paid for by the Nordic states and are arranged in cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The resettlement country's local embassy or mission undertakes the issuance of relevant and necessary travel documentation. At times the Nordic countries' embassies help each other when one state lacks a diplomatic presence in the specific country of asylum. Upon arrival in a Nordic country, the refugees are normally settled in an apartment or house, and only in rare situations do local communities have to offer temporary housing in a reception facility. None of the Nordic countries require that the refugees undergo medical check-ups before acceptance for resettlement, or before departure from the country of asylum. Upon entering the country of resettlement, all refugees are offered a thorough medical examination paid for by the state. All refugees are entitled to free health care on equal terms with the rest of the population. All refugees are offered the opportunity to participate in an introduction program. The lengths and contents of these programs vary from country to country, but commonly the introduction plans all offer language training, cultural programs, vocational training, and other elements aimed at integrating the refugee into the society of his/her new country. In Denmark, participation is mandatory for all (unemployed) refugees for the first three years. Failure to attend may have a negative effect on the amount of public relief received and the eventual acquisition of a permanent residence permit and citizenship. Refugees in all the Nordic countries have access to the regular education system, which for all students is paid for by the state. <br />

Refugees that Resettle in The Netherlands have full Government and Public Support to Succeed <br />
Selm ’03 (Joanne van Selm, Migration Policy Institute (Washington DC) and Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies (University of Amsterdam), Report: “Public-Private Partnerships in Refugee Resettlement: Europe and US, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d007516151387x30/fulltext.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/d007516151387x30/fulltext.pdf</a>, accessed: 8/21/10). <br />
<br />
A refugee being resettled to the Netherlands is faced with a whole range of organizations from the moment of arrival, some government, others nongovernment. All are active in some way where the resettled refugee will first live: a reception centre run by the Centraal Opvang Asielzoekers (COA-Central Reception Asylum-Seekers). The COA is a government body responsible for running all forms of collective housing or shelters for asylum-seekers and refugees in the Netherlands. Asylum-seekers go through various types of reception facilities depending on what stage they have reached in the asylum procedures. There is one type of facility for people who have just arrived and lodged their claim and another for people whose claim is being handled and for those who have been recently accepted as refugees before they are helped to find housing. The COA is also responsible for paying the weekly allowance to refugees, which is set out in the Regeling verstrekking asielzoekers (rule on assistance to asylum seekers). In the centre where a resettled refugee first lives, there will also be people whose asylum claim is in procedure, people who have just been accepted as refugees after applying for asylum, and people whose claim to asylum has been rejected. Some may be from the same country and/or ethnic group as the resettled refugee. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND in Dutch) is part of the Justice Ministry and is responsible for granting status to refugees. All invited refugees have a residence permit for one year on arrival, which can be renewed twice. On paper, only if the situation in their country of origin has not changed at the end of those three years are they granted a permanent residence status. In fact the regulations say that they will receive a permanent residence permit, which is logical given that resettlement is a durable solution. So they do not need to have direct contact with the IND until they have been in the country for three years unless there is some question about their status. The Foreigners' Service, another part of the Justice Ministry located in police stations, actually gives documentation to resettled refugees. The Dutch Refugee Council has offices in almost all municipalities and in the reception centres. This independent NGO, with 10,000 volunteers in a population of ]6 million, assists refugees in finding their way in society. It helps with questions about employment, education, housing, and so forth, but does not provide any of these services. Rather, it provides an information service for refugees to find their way to government-provided or assisted services. The MedicaI Reception of Asylum Seekers (MRA), a suborganization of the national government body responsible for health care, is also present in each of the reception centres. They do not provide medical services other than nurses' consultations: every refugee is helped to find a regular family practitioner, dentist, and other appropriate physicians and has the same access to health care as all Dutch citizens. Medical bills are covered by state-managed insurance until their income reaches a relatively high benchmark. The MRA is in the reception centres to advise and help the refugees to find the appropriate medical practitioners for their needs. Both the Dutch Red Cross (an NGO) and IOM (an interstate organization) are also available to refugees to assist them respectively with tracing family members and arranging the movement of those family members to the Netherlands as appropriate. In addition, an IOM representative is at the airport to greet newly arriving invited refugees and ensure they come through immigration and customs controls and to the reception centre, or to family members, to begin their life in the Netherlands.<br />

CNS News 10 “Obama Freezes Budget for Program Designed to Stop Terrorists from Getting U.S. Visas” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/65333" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/65333</a> <br />

Four months after the attempted Christmas Day bombing of Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit and nine years after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, only 14 of the 57 U.S. consulates identified as being at “high risk” for potentially providing visas to terrorists have been furnished with units of the Department of Homeland Security’s Visa Security Program (VSP). President Barack Obama, meanwhile, is planning to freeze the program’s budget for fiscal 2011. The VSP, established by the Homeland Security Act of 2002, puts Department of Homeland Security officials in the field at U.S. consulates to vet the backgrounds of people applying for U.S. visas. DHS uses a broader range of databases than the State Department to review the backgrounds of visa applicants. Also, many policymakers believe DHS officials tend to be more security-minded than State Department consular officers when reviewing visa applications. While administration officials have said publicly that five additional VSP units should be in place at high risk consulates by the end of 2011, President Barack Obama’s fiscal Year 2011 budget for DHS--submitted almost two months after the Christmas Day bombing attempt—does not increase funding for the program from its fiscal 2010 level. In fiscal 2010, Obama requested $32.2 million for the Visa Security Program and Congress approved $30.7 million, of which $7.3 million was earmarked for opening four new VSP units at high risk consulates. For fiscal 2011, Obama requested $30.7 million for the DHS, the same amount Congress approved for this year. According to a March 8 Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, a lack of funding could hamper expansion of the Visa Security Program to the many high-risk consulates that still do not have a unit. “The Obama administration is requesting that the VSP be funded at the same level in FY 2011 as Congress’ funding in FY 2010--$30.7 million,” says the report. “The modest size of VSP with 67 full-time equivalent staff has led some to question how many VSP units DHS will be able to realistically staff.”<br />

Link- Immigration overwhelms immigration officials with applications which allows for fraud and terrorism.<br />
Steven A. Camarota, Ph.D. from the University of Virginia in public policy analysis with a master’s degree in political science from the University of Pennsylvania, May 2002, “The Open Door: How Militant Islamic Terrorists Entered and Remained,” Center for Immigration Studies, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cis.org/node/52" rel="nofollow">http://cis.org/node/52</a> <br />
If we are to reduce the chance of another terrorist attack, we must carefully examine how these terrorists entered and remained in the United States in the past, including attacks prior to 9/11. The findings indicate that terrorists have used almost every conceivable means of entering the country. Thus, any set of solutions must address our entire immigration system and not focus on just one part of the system.<br />
The Immigration System is Overwhelmed. One of the main problems with the current immigration system is that the INS and State Department are simply overwhelmed by the number of applicants they must process. This fact is not in dispute. The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in May 2001 that the receipt of new INS applications (for green cards, citizenship, temporary work permits, etc.) has increased 50 percent over the past six years and that the backlog of unresolved applications has quadrupled to nearly four million. The crush of work has created an organizational culture wherein “staff are rewarded for the timely handling of petitions rather than for careful scrutiny of their merits,” in the words of a January 2002 GAO report. The pressure to move things through the system has led to “rampant” and “pervasive” fraud, with one official estimating that 20 to 30 percent of all applications involve fraud. The GAO concludes that “the goal of providing immigration benefits in a timely manner to those who are legally entitled to them may conflict with the goal of preserving the integrity of the legal immigration system.”<br />
Things are not much better at the State Department. Assistant Secretary of State Mary Ryan, who is in charge of visa processing, said in an November 2001 interview in the St. Petersburg Times that, “I think consular officers around the world are stretched just about as thin as they can possibly be. We do not have the personnel resources that we need to do the job the way it should be done.” Putting caps on or reducing the caps that exist for foreign students and guestworkers, and cutting permanent immigration back to the spouses and minor children of American citizens, eliminating the visa lottery, and limiting employed-based immigration to only a few highly skilled individuals would be a good start. The only way to give the State Department and the INS the breathing space they need to implement much-needed reforms is to reduce their workload. It is simply not reasonable to expect the INS in particular to deal with a constantly increasing workload, make significant process in the huge backlogs that exist, and at the same time fundamentally restructure and reform itself.<br />

Terrorist attack is synonymous with extinction.<br />
Mohamed Sid-Ahmed, internationally renowned reporter and columnist in Al Ahram, &quot;Extinction!&quot; Al-Ahram Weekly, September 1,2004&lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm</a>&gt; <br />
What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive.<br />
But the still more critical scenario is if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.
