your carving out of space still remains in civil society. That breeds tolerance. We just get out of the system<br />

<strong>how do Latinos deal with middle passage?</strong><br />
<br />
middle passage isn't key to slavery, we just say they don’t' have to give up their identity, but they should focus their politics on breaking down the state. We should recognize that ours is a slave state<br />

<br />
The political challenge, then, is to subvert the…must directly confront and undermine the white citizen.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>2NR</u></strong><br />
<br />
Politics that focus on immigrants’ rights crowd out the understanding that the nation was built on the backs of blacks. Even if they solve the creation of an ethical space, it is still against the background of a slave state. <br />
<br />
The idea that things are getting better ignores that we are here on stolen land and part of a violent state. We can never be content with a tolerant space in America. Then we'd be precluded from acting as a slave. America is founded upon the idea of subjugation. There aren’t chains and whips, but there is substandard housing, schooling, etc. They don't question America as a slave state. The only ethical relation to the state should be one that criticizes and kills it<br />
<br />
The best way to create a space that isn't predetermined by civil society. If we don't criticize civil society first, all rights will stay from the top down. Just token concessions. This makes rights conditional. The state can always take them away. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am not supposed to be here&quot; can be co-opted by the irish congressman. This allows broader co-option. The politics of the slave avoids this. It’s a wholesale rejection of the state<br />
<br />
What should we do? We should kill America, because civil society tells us where we should and shouldn't belong. We need to be able to define America as a slave state prior to combatting it. The alternative is a prerequisite to the affirmative.<br />
<br />
No perm. Politics of the slave cannot be combined with the politics of the other <br />
<br />
Their example of Katrina is indicative of what we hsould do. We should rebel against the institution and the squo and the resolution<br />
<br />
This solves for the debate community. If we kill america, then we obviously access that space<br />
