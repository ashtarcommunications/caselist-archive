Plan: The United States Supreme Court should rule that the spouses of all persons entering the United States on employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, or human trafficking-based visas be granted independent visas by holding that dependent spousal visas are grounded in the doctrine of coverture which violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.<br />

 <br />
Women entering the US on spousal visas are issued dependent visas making their resident status conditional on their marriage- this system shackles (non)immigrant women to their abusers and props up the domination of women by men in two important ways:<br />
<br />
<br />
First- dependent visas create a STAGGERING amount of domestic violence. Because immigration law treats women as chattel, the law isolates battered women within the walls of their abusive homes. <br />

I. Introduction<br />
In the United States, 34% to 49.8% of immigrant women AND choice between staying with the abuser or leaving and risking deportation. n27<br />

<br />
Social isolation of recent immigrants AND social isolation not only at the interpersonal level but also at the community and societal level. <br />
<br />
AND- Independent visas are the only remedy. Current domestic abuse relief is designed to benefit the state’s interest in prosecution, not the safety and welfare of abused women- fear for their safety, arrest, and deportation deter women from seeking relief. AND- The alternative of deportation perpetuates violence against women and ensures poverty, famine, political persecution.<br />
