1. limits – their interpretation devastates the topic – there are more than a dozen visa categories each with their<br />
own set of eligibility criteria now. The aff ADDS 8 broad categories of additional admissibility standards, each<br />
with its own subcategories, it makes being negative impossible.<br />
<br />
2. negative ground – there are few generics against eligibility standards in general other than politics, it avoids<br />
the core literature controversies surrounding visas, so you should prefer and extremely narrow interpretation<br />
of it.<br />

<strong>3. Increasing immigration in a downturn undermines the economy – displaces native jobs and wages</strong><br />
<strong>Peri, 10 – economist at the University of California, Davis (Giovanni, “The Impact of Immigrants in Recession and Economic Expansion”, June<span style="background-position: 100% 50%; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/Peri-June2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/Peri-June2010.pdf</a></span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, on one hand immigration … effect within the first year.</strong><br />
<strong>A third difference between expansion and downturn concerns the response of physical capital per worker. During a downturn investments do not respond as quickly to immigration as in expansion. This time the difference in response is close to being statistically significant within the two- and the four-year intervals. Since the economy has unused capacity during downturns, this may make firms reluctant to expand their productive capacity and/or to adopt the technologies (and pay the fixed cost) that would best take advantage of immigrant labor. However in the long run (seven- to ten-year intervals) no difference in adjustment is observed independently of the short-run effects.</strong><br />
