 Advantage Two is Organized Crime <br />
Organ trafficking is excluded from the TVPA <br />

Organ trafficking in India causes organized crime-strong national legislation key but unimplemented  <br />
Elaine Perason, GTZ, April 2004 (Coercion in the Kidney Trade?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-svbf-organ-trafficking-e.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gtz.de/de/dokumente/en-svbf-organ-trafficking-e.pdf</a>)  <br />

Organ trafficking, legally prohibited in most countries … acquired from such organs. <br />

 <a name="_Toc157053865"></a><br />
The United States federal government should eliminate the cap on T visas. <br />
<br />
Contention One is the Cap <br />
First note-the cap on T visas is unethical and contra human rights principles  <br />
DALRYMPLE 2005 (Joyce Koo, Boston College Third World Law Journal Staff Writer, Spring, 25 B.C. Third World L.J. 451) <br />
Moreover, the TVPA restricts the … enslaved within the nation's borders. 93  <br />
<br />
And, this exclusion of victims via the T-Visa cap denies human dignity-justifying all forms of war <br />
Fasching, Prof Relig @ U S Florida, 1993 (Darrell J., The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, p 179-181) <br />
Human rights claims are rooted in the spontaneous … dark social, political, and religious forces of dehumanization. <br />

The impact is the culmination of Nazist domination and control-causes endless violence  <br />

Contention Two is International Trafficking  <br />

Alison Siskin, Specialist in Immigration Policy, and Liana Wyler, Analyst in International Crime and Narcotics, 12/23 (Trafficking in Persons: U.S. Policy and Issues for Congress, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/154172.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/154172.pdf</a>) <br />
A broad consensus appears to be … assessments have compromised their credibility.”130  <br />
<br />
This causes other countries to buck US leadership <br />
Saifulbahri Ismail and Lynda Hong, Channel News Asia, 15 June 2010 (MFA questions US human trafficking report which downgraded Singapore's ranking, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1063388/1/.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1063388/1/.html</a>) <br />

Since 1904, the international community has … that concerns the whole of society.  <br />
<br />
We’ll isolate three internal links:  <br />
First, the cap embodies and signals hypocrisy  <br />

[*473] In this regard, the TVPA is bold … human rights abuses of our time. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, the plan solves-- <br />
First, other countries will model the U.S.-inclusion of visas  <br />

<br />
And, U.S. TVPA leadership compels source countries to address domestic trafficking  <br />

Plan: <br />
The United States federal government should provide T visas to victims of child trafficking for the purposes of intercountry adoption as victims of severe trafficking. <br />
<br />
<br />
Contention One is the Status Quo <br />
The TVPA excludes child laundering from its definition of severe trafficking <br />
David Smolin, Cumberland Law School @ Samford Univ, 2007 (Child Laundering as Exploitation: Applying Anti-Trafficking Norms to Intercountry Adoption Under the Coming Hague Regime, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://works.bepress.com/david_smolin/4/" rel="nofollow">http://works.bepress.com/david_smolin/4/</a>) <br />
Legitimate intercountry adoption provides a … international laws pertaining to trafficking. <br />
<br />
<a name="_Toc154328504"></a><br />
This status quo incentivizes child theft and trafficking for the purpose of illicit intercountry adoption-victims are rendered invisible <br />
David Smolin, Professor of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Samford University, 2005 (Child Laundering: How the Intercountry Adoption System Legitimizes and Incentivizes the Practices of Buying, Traﬃcking, Kidnapping, and Stealing Children) <br />
The term “child laundering” expresses the claim … legitimacy of intercountry adoption is threatened. <br />
<br />
This institutionalizes a regime of orientalist commodification-the purchase and trafficking of supposedly saved adoptees conceals the maintenance of a global system of racist exchange <br />
Ryiah Lilith, J.D. Candidate, American University Washington College of Law, 2001, 2001 (Buying a Wife but Saving a Child: A Deconstruction of Popular Rhetoric and Legal Analysis of Mail-Order Brides and Intercountry Adoptions, 9 Buff. Women's L.J. 225, LN) <br />
In the 1990s, Americans spent over $ 300 … the same or analogous elements are present. <br />
<br />
Specifically, Asian child laundering is crucial to a racialized strategy of divide and conquer-the &quot;rescue&quot; of children alleviates responsibility for a history of institutionalized racism and solidifies an orientalist myth of the Asian as the model minority <br />
Kathleen Bergquist, Assistant Professor, Illinois State University, School of Social Work. M.S.W., Norfolk State University; Ph.D. in Counselor Education, The College of William and Mary, Spring 2004 (INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION: INTERNATIONAL ASIAN ADOPTION: IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD?, 10 Tex. Wesleyan L. Rev. 343, LN) <br />
Asians have a history of otherness in the United … that they are a racial minority. <br />
<br />
The promise of rescue for a better life takes on a unique danger as a justification for forced trafficking to the West-the system's relationship to the worst excesses of orientalism remains invisible <br />

<br />
The intersection of exotic adoptees and the material sanction of child purchase exemplifies the crucial role intercountry adoptions play in institutionalizing a global political economy of racialized commodification <br />

At the most basic level, what Said exposes are those symptoms of prejudicial thinking-manifest, obsessional motifs, manipulative rhetoric, undocumented blanket assertions, and so forth-which signal the presence of an overriding drive … silence would certainly be one. <br />
<br />
This invisible violence renders populations disposable and is the largest proximal cause of war and genocide <br />

Two impacts— <br />
First: Regional Conflict Intervention <br />

Contention Two is Solvency <br />
Granting victims TVPA visa assistance solves child trafficking via deterrence and prosecution and international credibility via signaling and threat leverage <br />
Patty Meier is a December 2008 graduate of the University of Iowa College of Law, and Xiaole Zhang,LL.B., University of International Business and Economics School of Law (PRC), LL.M., J.D.

The United States leads the fight … for the purpose of its annual TIP Report. <br />

A child who is stolen from her … a severe form of human trafficking. <br />
<br />
Incorporating child laundering into the TVPA’s definition of severe trafficking solves internal inconsistencies necessary to enforce domestic and international law <br />
David Smolin, Cumberland Law School @ Samford Univ, 2007 (Child Laundering as Exploitation: Applying Anti-Trafficking Norms to Intercountry Adoption Under the Coming Hague Regime, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://works.bepress.com/david_smolin/4/" rel="nofollow">http://works.bepress.com/david_smolin/4/</a>) <br />
The Hague Convention, it turns out, is correct: abducting or selling … limited definition of “severe” forms of trafficking. <br />
<br />
And, cutting off the U.S. is key to short-circuit the global market and boost the credibility of multiple international legal regimes <br />
Nicole Graff, B.A. from Cornell in English and Africana Studies, and a J.D. from Syracuse University College of Law, Summer 2000 (NTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION AND THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD: CAN THE FREE MARKET IN CHILDREN BE CONTROLLED?, 27 Syracuse J. Int'l L. &amp; Com. 405, LN) <br />
Children who are adopted by Americans from strife … laid out in the Hague Convention. <br />
<br />
The TVPA is the best mechanism to combat trafficking—empirically proven <br />
Kara Ryf, JD magna cum laude Case Western Reserve University Law School, 2002 (The First Modern Anti-Slavery Law: The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Case W. Res. J. Int'l L.) <br />
Human trafficking touches almost all nations … trafficking laws are not enforced or do not exist. <br />
<br />
Expanding TVPA coverage is modeled by other countries—this is the only way to stamp out trafficking <br />

[*473] In this regard, the TVPA is bold … human rights abuses of our time. 151 <br />
<br />
Even if the state is usually bad we should use it to rein in the worst excesses of capitalism—the alternative is a totally uncontrolled tyranny of commercial interest <br />

<br />
Advantage 1 is Terrorism <br />
We’ll isolate three internal links: <br />
<br />
First, the border— <br />
<br />
Mass illegal immigration makes future acts of terrorism within the U.S. inevitable-multiple reasons <br />
Krikorian 2008 (Mark, Executive Director of the Center for Immigration Studies, MA from Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, “Immigration Policy and the Terrorist Threat”, p. 37-38, May 2008) <br />
The security challenges posed by … they do get in-is a security imperative. <br />
<br />
And, this will facilitate the transfer and use of nuclear weapons <br />
Allison 2004 (Graham, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Prof of Government at Harvard, former assistance Sec. Of Defense for policy, Nuclear Terrorism, p. 116) <br />
Drug trafficking is not the only trade exploiting … terrorist group can surely do better. <br />
<br />
Status quo supply side only enforcement efforts are facilitating a porous border that allows terrorists to bypass security-the plan is key to free up resources to effectively monitor the border <br />
Kerwin and Stock, legal scholars, 2007 Donald, Executive Director, Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., member of the American Bar Association Commission on Immigration, advisor U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Margaret, Associate Professor, Department of Social Sciences, United States Military Academy, West Point, New York and Lieutenant Colonel, Military Police Corps, United States Army Reserve, THE ROLE OF IMMIGRATION IN A COORDINATED NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY, Georgetown Immigration Law Journal <br />

Ehrenpreis 2006 (Jeffrey L., University of Southern California Gould School of Law, 79 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1203, Lexis) <br />
If someone comes across and you don't know … to focus its efforts on stopping potential terrorists. <br />
<br />
Second, cooperation— <br />
<br />
Cooperation is key to solve terrorism but the status quo is fueling immigrant community backlash <br />
Kerwin and Stock, legal scholars, 2007 Donald, Executive Director, Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc., member of the American Bar Association Commission on Immigration, advisor U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Margaret, Associate Professor, Department of Social Sciences, United States Military Academy, West Point, New York and Lieutenant Colonel, Military Police Corps, United States Army Reserve, THE ROLE OF IMMIGRATION IN A COORDINATED NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY, Georgetown Immigration Law Journal <br />
Law enforcement depends on the cooperation … came forward to register for this program.213 <br />
<br />
This makes nuclear and biological terrorism within the U.S. inevitable-better cooperation is key <br />

Despite the significant resources spent conducting … on the conditions of unauthorized employees. <br />
<br />
Third, resource overstretch— <br />
<br />
ICE is overstretched now forcing priority trade-offs that leave gaping security holes <br />
Peters 2010 (Katherine McIntire Peters, Government Executive, April 6, 2010 “IG: State and local immigration enforcement activities lack oversight”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cis.org/Griffith/MorningNews040710" rel="nofollow">http://www.cis.org/Griffith/MorningNews040710</a>) <br />

Since 1986, U.S. employers have been … from people who intend to do us harm. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, the plan frees up resources critical to solve terrorism <br />

Legalizing the flow through a large guest … consequently all Americans would improve. <br />
<br />
This allows the U.S. to disrupt major terrorist operations-preventing future attacks <br />

Advantage Two: Xenotransplantation<br />
<br />
First note, low human organ supply is driving xenotransplantation research <br />
WHITE 2010 (Prof. Dr. David J.G. White, Eurotransplant International Foundation, “Xenotransplantation,” Last Mod April 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eurotransplant.org/?id=xeno" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurotransplant.org/?id=xeno</a>) <br />
The success of organ transplantation … on waiting lists worldwide. <br />
<br />
This is driving by trafficking-the perception of unregulated organ trafficking deters voluntary donations internationally <br />
Bernard Cohen, Guido G. Persijn &amp; Yves Vanrenterghem, Eurotransplant International Foundation, 2000, Clinical Transplantation, 14: 28-31 [Blackwell-Synergy], p. 28 <br />
Commerce in transplantation is well known… problem as it would prevent doctors from taking part in unethical transplant procedures. <br />
<br />
And the link is huge-donation is cut in half by distrust of the system caused by weak regulation of illicit trafficking <br />

A poll has come out about the … some Americans go shopping. <br />
<br />
There’s no risk of a turn-the number of organs provided by trafficking is small compared to legal donations that would emerge in its place <br />

Organ transplantation, it would seem… Europe only receives about 16,000. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, increasing human organ supply solves xenotransplantation—there’s no risk of a turn because successful animal transplants would decrease human donations <br />

Next the impacts:<br />
<br />
Competitiveness is the key internal link to U.S. primacy-gains in S&amp;T leadership are necessary to stave off rising hegemonic challenges<br />

The United States' global primacy …at fostering technological entrepreneurship at home.<br />
<br />
And, the international balance of power is on the brink of transition-now is a key time to secure US dominance<br />

The balance in international…in shaping those collisions.<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact is a global power vacuum that causes great power wars<br />

First, the &quot;hybrid&quot; … it would suffer the most.<br />
<br />
And, these wars go nuclear-we control magnitude and probability-every conflict is inevitable and escalates<br />

 <br />
First note: H-1B visa holders return to their country of origin after their stay with better skills<br />
Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology and a research associate with the Economic Policy Institute, 2/17/2010, “Bridge to immigration or Cheap temporary Labor?

Third, the H-1B and L-1…to serve clients” (Elstrom 2007).<br />
<br />
And returns are only net good-H1B holders from rival competitor states stay in the U.S. while visa holders from allied return and share technology<br />

First, a great deal of… potentially powerful neutral states.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are three impacts:<br />
<br />
First Allied Deterrence--<br />
<br />
Buttressing allied conventional deterrent capabilities is key to overall strategic deterrence and dissuasion by denial-it’s the only way to avoid regional conflict<br />
SDJOC, Strategic Deterrence Joint Operating Concept, February 2004 (Department of Defense Publication)<br />
U.S. vital interests a…primarily in strike operations.<br />
<br />
<br />
This prevents inevitable low-level friction from becoming great power wars that escalate to the nuclear level<br />

In the Cold War, nuclear … jostling or more serious face-offs.<br />
Second, Science Diplomacy—<br />
<br />
Skilled return migration send goodwill science ambassadors to source countries facilitating international cooperation and effective diplomacy<br />
ORBACH 2007 (Dr. Raymond L. Orbach, Under Secretary of Science @ U.S. Department of Energy, 3/21/2007 “Fiscal 2008 Appropriations: Energy and Water Development”, Committee on Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, CQ Congressional Testimony, Lexis<br />
Science by its nature…U.S. research institutions were foreign-born.<br />
<br />
That solves science diplomacy—the impact is soft power, competitiveness, poverty, famine, disease, environmental destruction, terrorism, and war<br />

Accordingly, there is a significant…escalate to the use of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Fortunately the plan solves-status quo efforts to buttress U.S. science diplomacy are growing but largely ineffective; reforming H-1B visa policy is key<br />

<br />
Finally, H1B visas are key to solve-without work experience in the U.S. even talented foreign nationals would be relatively useless<br />

Exempting graduate students from the H-1B cap attracts the best S&amp;T talent, solving competitiveness<br />
ANTE 2004 (Spencer, computers editor for Business Week, Business Week, March 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2004/nf2004032_4623_PG2_db047.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2004/nf2004032_4623_PG2_db047.htm</a>)<br />
KEEPING THE BEST. … counted against the cap.<br />
<br />
Moreover the plan sends a signal to prospective H-1B beneficiaries, attracting foreign S&amp;T youth to U.S. universities, buttressing overall research systems<br />
Ed Frauenheim, Staff Writer CNET News, 6 August 2004 (Brain drain in tech's future?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.cnet.com/Brain-drain-in-techs-future/2100-1008_3-5299249.html?tag=mncol;txt" rel="nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/Brain-drain-in-techs-future/2100-1008_3-5299249.html?tag=mncol;txt</a>)<br />
Discussion about technology's future in the United States often centers on problems that eighth graders have in algebra. But … the program's annual cap.<br />
<br />
Even if the cap isn’t met now, the plan still sends a key signal to students <br />
Kato and Sparber 10 (Takao and Chad, Quotas and Quality: The Effect of H-1B Visa Restrictions on the Pool of Prospective Undergraduate Students from Abroad, May) <br />
“the H-1B visa offers many foreign-nationals with a college degree…. Distribution has changed in response to this policy” <br />
<br />
Foreign workers key to competitiveness <br />
Kato and Sparber 10 (Takao and Chad, Quotas and Quality: The Effect of H-1B Visa Restrictions on the Pool of Prospective Undergraduate Students from Abroad, May) <br />
“More sanguine views of highly-educated immigration focus… foreign-born workers, most were educated in the US.” <br />
<br />
And the plan sends a signal that keeps business domestic <br />
Lewin, Massini, and Peeters 09 (Arie, Silvia, and Carine, Why are companies offshoring innovation? The emergine global race for talent, Journal of international business studies 40) <br />
“However, in this paper we argue that talent is a different type… increasingly advanced and complex PD projects.” <br />
<br />
Even massively expanding the cap doesn’t solve- eliminating the advanced degree cap is necessary to avoid cumbersome stop-gap measures that only further delay gains in S&amp;T competitiveness <br />
Hahm 00 (Jung, 85 Cornell L. Rev. 1673) <br />
