T –Eligibilities<br />
Interpretation – the topic specifies “expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas,” which refers to eligibility requirements which currently apply to all visas – there ten such requirements – the aff can waive any requirement or subset of a requirement for their particular visa<br />
1. Health<br />
2. Criminal Activity<br />
3. Security Grounds<br />
4. Public Charge<br />
5. Labor Certification Requirements<br />
6. Illegal Entrants<br />
7. Proper Documentation<br />
8. Ineligible for Citizenship<br />
9. Previously Removed from the Country<br />
10. Miscellaneous – Polygamist, Guardian, Child Abductions, Unlawful Voters, Tax Evaders<br />

<br />
The following … toward that limit.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Violation – the affirmative does not expand beneficiary eligibility for one of the ten categories.<br />
<br />
Vote negative –<br />
<br />
1. Limits – our interpretation allows the affirmative to expand eligibility through any of ten categories and their subsets, plus the entire numbers part of the topic – allowing the affirmative to also change requirements within particular visas allows for literally hundreds of new affs which make the neg research burden unmanageable.<br />
<br />
2. Predictable ground – allowing the affirmative to change requirements specific to a particular visa functionally allows them to create entirely new visa categories – for example they could eliminate the “temporary or seasonal worker” requirement on the H2A which would fundamentally change the nature of that visa – forcing the affirmative to change requirements that apply to all visas means that the fundamental character of the affirmative’s visa remains the same, which is the only way to ensure a stable literature base for the negative. <br />
