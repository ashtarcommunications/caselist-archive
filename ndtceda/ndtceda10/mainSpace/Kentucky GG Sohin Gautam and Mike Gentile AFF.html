1AC—Advantage 1—Interest Convergence<br />
The debate surrounding immigration is never complete- they are merely snap-shots controlled by risk managers to describe an always incomplete picture of reality based on the anticipation of future threats; however, this coupling of security and immigration highlights the exact moment where security interest converge with immigrants bartering for ground are constantly taken back to justify never-ending violence<br />

The ability to control the flow of information and situation of immigrants forces the same the same rigged bargain as the postwar Civil Right Compromise: The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of action is accepting the current terms of debate which means that the official <em>solutions</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> elites and reformists advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.</span><br />
