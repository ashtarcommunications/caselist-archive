<strong>Provisional Visas CP (same as on BP's page)</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should lower the cap on H1B visas to zero<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer provisional visas to foreign specialty occupation workers and fashion models who aren’t considered inadmissible under §212(a) of the I.N.A. and U.S.C.I.S. regulations. The number should be equivalent to a lifting of the cap on H-1B visas. A worker with a provisional visa would be admitted to the United States for three years, and could renew his or her visa one time by demonstrating payment of all direct and indirect taxes; the maintenance of a clean criminal record; and acquisition of English language ability during the initial visa period. At the end of the second period the worker would have the option to transition to permanent status by applying for an available green card, without employer sponsorship. Twelve months after the worker initially took up employment, the visa would be portable, allowing him or her to change employers without applying for a new visa.<br />
<br />
The CP creates a more flexible visa that is both more immigrant and business friendly<br />

<strong>Condition CP (same as on BP's page)</strong><br />
<br />
1NC<br />
The United States federal government should not eliminate the cap on advance degree exemptions for specialty occupation temporary worker visas unless the government of India agrees to substantially reduce its tariffs on cars imported from the United States. The amount of the tariff reduction should be determined using Matoo’s economic values ratio of 375 workers making 40,000 to 1,000 cars worth $15,000 adjusted for inflation and changes in relative economic status as a guidline. The United States federal government should advocate this position in negotiations with India.<br />
The CP is competitive and legitimate- the plan is being withheld to use as a bargaining chip with India<br />

Parole CP<br />
The Executive branch of the United States should grant public interest parole and an employment authorization document to individuals with advanced degrees in science and technology from accredited universities in the United States who qualify for employment based visas.<br />
The Executive branch should announce that the annual number of people granted parole under this category will always be greater than or equal to the number granted this fiscal year. The Executive branch should announce it will set the numbers of available grants of parole by a certain date each fiscal year and that if the Executive branch fails to act by its deadline, the default rule will be that the previous year’s numbers will control.<br />
The Executive branch should grant parole status for people granted parole under this category indefinitely.<br />
The president can grant parole and work authorization on “public interest” grounds- is just as attractive as visas<br />

Text:<br />
<br />
We affirm that “crimes involving moral turpitude” should be used to restrict the eligibility of all visa applicants. All visa applicants found ineligible on the grounds of “crimes involving moral turpitude” should be admitted without condition.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The CP has two net benefits<br />
<br />
First, Whitewashing<br />
<br />
Voting aff glorifies us as the heroes who “delink our life from the operation of the law and its violent moralistic standards” without acknowledging our complicity in the system which gave rise to exclusionary sovereignty<br />
Jenny <u>Edkins</u>, International Politics—University of Wales, <u>2003</u>. (Trauma and the Memory of Politics, p. 172-4)<br />
It is not a remembering… <span style="border: medium none;">, not outside the trauma.</span><br />
<br />
Even the “empty” symbolic gesture of finding every applicant ineligible encircles the trauma of exclusion without neutralizing it as a past, depoliticized event—the counterplan makes criticism of sovereignty <em>relevant</em> to discursive practice and <em>renders visible</em> its fragility<br />
Jenny <u>Edkins</u>, Senior Lecturer in International Politics at the University of Wales Aberystwyth, <em>Postructuralism and International Relations: Bringing the Political Back In</em>, <u>1999</u>, p. 141-2<br />
This recalls the discussion in Chapter ...we are not lulled into forgetfulness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, the conditional invitation<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s expression of inclusion through visas is banal and <em>conditional</em> – Their political affirmation is contingent on the <u>law</u> and e<u>conomic exchange</u>. This is incompatible with true hospitality, resulting in violence.<br />
<u>Westmoreland, ‘8</u> (Mark W. June 2008 “Interruptions: Derrida and Hospitality” KRITIKE VOLUME TWO NUMBER ONE <u><span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21957039/Derrida-and-Hospitality" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scribd.com/doc/ 21957039/Derrida-and- Hospitality</a></span></u>)-mikee<br />
On the one hand, the ...; there is always some violence.<br />
<br />
The distribution of visas as a political strategy for inclusion injects <em>sovereign</em> authority into migration – turns the case by making all <em>inclusion</em> temporary and fleeting.<br />
<u>Salter, ‘8</u> (Mark, School of Political Studies, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada, “When the exception becomes the rule: borders, sovereignty, and citizenship” Citizenship Studies v. 12 n. 4 August 2008 365-380)-mikee<br />
Sovereignty is performed dialogically and reconstituted ...citizenship claims grounded in capricious sovereignty.<br />
<br />
Every enactment of a conditional hospitality devalues life and makes mass extermination possible.<br />
<u>Ajana, ‘6</u> (Btihaj Ajana, “Immigration Interrupted,” JOURNAL FOR CULTURAL RESEARCH VOLUME 10 NUMBER 3 (JULY 2006) Taylor &amp; Francis)-mikee<br />
This perpetual actualisation of borders or ...a state of self-enclosure.<br />

Jenny <u>Edkins</u>, International Politics—University of Wales, <u>2003</u>. (<u>Trauma and the Memory of Politics</u>, p. 15)<br />
In this book I examine the ...are ways of encircling the real.<br />
d. politics of the impossible- Affirming the eligibility requirement and then letting people who don’t meet stay enacts a radical politics of the imposible that reconfigures the space of democracy<br />

2. Conditional hospitality<br />
