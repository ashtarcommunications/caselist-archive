<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Five major risks threaten the world economy. Three center on the United States: renewed sharp increases in the current account deficit leading to a crash of the dollar, a budget profile that is out of control, and an outbreak of trade protectionism. A fourth relates to China, which faces a possible hard landing from its recent overheating. The fifth is that oil prices could rise to $60 to $70 per barrel even without a major political or terrorist disruption, and much higher with one. Most of these risks reinforce each other. A further oil shock, a dollar collapse, and </span><span class="underline0"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; font-size: 11pt;">a soaring American budget deficit would</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> all <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">generate much higher inflation and interest rates.</span> A sharp dollar decline would increase the likelihood of further oil price rises</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<strong>There’s currently a severe “skills shortage” undermining our space industry</strong><br />
<strong><u>Stephen 10</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – Chair of the Aerospace Industries Association Workforce Steering Committee (Rick Stephens (Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Administration @ The Boeing Company), “HEADLINE: SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH EDUCATION,” Committee on House Science and Technology Subcommittee on Research and Science Education, CQ Congressional Testimony, February 4, 2010 Thursday)</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Let me also provide a perspective that I believe is important to set a framework and context. In 1983, a blue-ribbon panel completed a seminal piece of work called “A Nation at Risk,” which set the tone and framework for improving education in America. While it focused on primary and secondary education, I believe this work is directly related to today’s topic. Today, nearly 27 years later, I contend that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">we are</span> no longer a “Nation at Risk”; we are <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">a “nation falling</span> further <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">behind</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”—this despite the fact that, as a nation, we spend more money on education at a total level and on a per-capita basis than any other country in the world. Hundreds of organizations are focused primarily on improving education in the United States and, more specifically, on STEM disciplines. These include the National Science Teachers Association, the Business–Higher Education Forum (BHEF), the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics (AIAA), and the National Defense Industries Association (NDIA). In addition, every college and university is focused on increasing the number of graduates. We are proud to be among those industries that have placed the United States in its leadership role in technology, innovation and the ability to solve highly complex problems. But </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">as both the pace of innovation and the need for problem-solving accelerate</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">globally, the United States faces a competitive gap that we can close only if more of our young people pursue careers in the growing fields of STEM disciplines. In my industry, the Aviation Week 2009 Workforce Study (conducted in cooperation with the Aerospace Industries Association, American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics, and the National Defense Industries Association) indicates aerospace companies that are hiring need systems engineers, aerospace engineers<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% lime;">, </span>mechanical engineers, programming/software engineers and program managers. Today, </span><strong><u>across the aerospace industry, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the average age of the workforce continues to increase,</span> and expectations are that the next three years.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As a result, in the very near future, our companies and </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">our nation’s aerospace programs will need tens of thousands of engineers</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—in addition to those joining the workforce today. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">These are becoming difficult jobs to fill not</span> because there is a labor shortage but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">because there is a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">skills shortage</span>:</span> Our industry needs more innovative young scientists,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> technologists, engineers, and mathematicians to replace our disproportionately large (compared to the total U.S. workforce) population of Baby Boomers as they retire. </span><strong><u>At the same time that retirements are increasing, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the number of American workers with STEM degrees is declining</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the National Science Board pointed out in 2008. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">This skills shortage is</span> a global concern across the board in all high-tech sectors—<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">public as well as private</span>.</u></strong><br />

<strong>Granting H-1B visas to students solves</strong><br />
<strong>Tiger 8</strong> (Joseph, a J.D. candidate at the Georgetown University Law Center. He graduated from Georgetown University in 2006 with a degree in economics, “NOTE: RE-BENDING THE PAPERCLIP: AN EXAMINATION OF AMERICA'S POLICY REGARDING SKILLED WORKERS AND STUDENT VISAS,” Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, Spring, 22 Geo. Immigr. L.J. 507, LexisNexis)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Furthermore, in terms of America's own interest, </span><strong><u>some <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">fields of study, such as aerospace</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> engineering or physics, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">are more valuable in terms of supply and demand than others</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">such as the liberal arts. The issue is not that science and technology are superior to the liberal arts, but that there are far fewer American students majoring in science and technology than in the liberal arts. Policies governing foreign students in America should take into account this disequilibrium. </span><strong><u>Upon graduation from American universities,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> those </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">foreign students</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> whose presence would constitute a real benefit to America </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">should be presented with</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> three long-term options: accept </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">an H-1B</span> temporary work <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">visa</span>,</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> accept EB green card status, or return to their native countries. The question is: which students are desirable? Although there is obviously no easy answer, the United States might be guided by the policies of Australia and Canada, which have set up general skill-based immigration systems. <a name="r198"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>198</strong></span> Their laws are modified regularly to reflect the changing demands of the economy. General skill-based immigration is beyond the scope of this article, but a similar system could be applied with relative ease to America's student visa system. It might be argued (as a topic for another paper) that any quotas set on foreign students and foreign workers with desired skill sets are counterproductive to the interests of America. However, as a potentially better alternative within a system that does employ quotas, Congress could delegate to a <a name="8231-527"></a>bipartisan committee <a name="r199"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>199</strong></span> the authority to determine which skill sets are deemed desirable now and in the future given the overall direction of the United States' economy. Such a committee would make its decisions based on economic studies, analysis of macroeconomic trends, and input from private industry. These determinations would be summarized in a statement outlining recommended policies for the special issuance of H-1B visas and green cards to foreign students in areas of academic concentration deemed desirable (possibly with specific quotas set for each of these fields of study); in contrast, foreign students majoring in other subjects would have to compete for H-1B visas and green cards issued within the limits of their respective general quotas. There is some parallel in the self-adjusting system in place. That is, the overall state of economy should be reflected by which employers make filings, on behalf of their prospective employees, for EB status or H-1B visas. However, the cap distorts the theoretically optimal results that one would otherwise expect to see. When too many applications for H-lB visas are filed at once, a lottery determines who gets the visas; consequently, visas are granted on a random basis rather than a basis directed at helping to meet America's current and anticipated needs. Employment-based green cards are granted on a first-come, first-served system, and there is currently a three-year backlog for the EB3 visa, creating a time lag in meeting America's needs. By delegating such authority to an expert committee, the federal government could retain control over immigration while resolving many of the above-described problems. Obviously, if Congress disagrees with the committee's decisions or wishes to promote an agenda outside of the scope of the committee, it always retains the power to pass laws granting certain foreign students the option of remaining in this country. For example, even if the price of fossil fuels were low and there were little motivation to invest in alternative energy by the private sector, Congress, concerned about the national security implications of dependence on foreign oil, could permit students with expertise in green energy to remain in the United States. Such a system would have the advantage of guaranteeing either an H-1B visa or an EB green card to students upon graduation, conditional upon them finding employment, while retaining federal control of the immigration system. V. CONCLUSION Foreign students at America's universities face real problems upon graduation. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Many graduating seniors are unable to obtain H</span>-<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">1B visas</span> and are not <a name="8231-528"></a>legally eligible for EB3 status given that the F-1 student visa does not permit dual intent</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Additionally, those students who do receive H-1B visas are often unable to begin work until the beginning of the fiscal year. These problems could be addressed by reform of either the H-1B program or the green card system. The SKIL bill is an ambitious and comprehensive attempt to address many of the issues facing foreign students at American universities wishing to work in the United States upon graduation. The days when immigrants were merely manual labor have passed. Operation Paperclip heralded a new era of competition for talent among post-industrial nations moving toward innovation-and knowledge-based economies. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The country that can attract the finest minds of the world will be at the forefront of innovation and tech</span>nology</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On December 14, 1972, Eugene Cernan of the Apollo 17 mission became the last man to walk on the moon. <a name="r200"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>200</strong></span> Since the end of the Apollo program, manned American spaceflight has been carried out using the space shuttle, which cannot travel past low Earth orbit. <a name="r201"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>201</strong></span> In 2004, with spectacular images coming from the unmanned Mars rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, President George W. Bush announced his Vision for Space Exploration, which calls for </span><strong><u>the development of new manned spacecraft to return to the Moon</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and to reach Mars. <a name="r202"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>202</strong></span> As part of Project Constellation, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">NASA hopes to return </span>Americans <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">to the Moon by 2020 and continue further into space with manned missions to Mars </span>by 2037</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. <a name="r203"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>203</strong></span> </span><strong><u>America has become the world leader in technology and science by attracting brilliant minds from all over the world rather than relying solely on native talent</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Wernher von Braun, a German immigrant, headed the team that designed the rocket system that carried the Apollo astronauts to the Moon. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">It would be unfortunate if</span> the success of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Project Constellation were compromised due to problems in America's visa programs. Talented foreign students</span>, drawn to America by her extraordinary university system, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">represent an enormous asset</span> that must not be squandered.</u></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Evidently, </span><strong><u>rhetoric emanating from the United States regarding space has made members of the international community suspicious that America could bar them from the medium on nothing more than a whim.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Such apprehensions unnecessarily contribute to further reductions in soft power. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">should take care </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to ensure that </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">other nations receive the impression</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> that it </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">has no intention of hindering </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">their </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">peaceful use of space</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u>If those countries find current US space supremacy tolerable, then perhaps in time they could endure the United States’ possession of weapons if this were a significant aspect of US primacy in space and maintenance of the status quo.

Doing so would enable it to accumulate rather than hemorrhage soft power. Such a rationale is not lost on the Chinese, who certainly have had their successes in recent years in building soft power and using it to extend their influence around the globe. According to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) administrator Michael Griffin, the </span><strong><u>Chinese have a carefully thought-out human-spaceflight program that will take them up to parity with the United States and Russia.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They’re investing to make China a strategic world power second to none in order to reap the deals and advantages that flow to world leaders.30 Analysts believe that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the U</span>nited</u></strong> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates</u></strong>’ <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">determination to maintain dominance </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in military space </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">has caused it to lose ground in </span>commercial space and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">space exploration</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They maintain that </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">is giving up its civilian space leadership</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">—</span>an action that will have huge strategic implications</u></strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">31 Although the US public may be indifferent to space commerce or scientific activities</span><strong><u>, technological feats in space remain something of a marvel to the broader world</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In 1969 the world was captivated by man’s first walk on the moon. The Apollo program paid huge dividends in soft power at a time when the United States found itself dueling with the Soviets to attract other nations into its ideological camp</span><strong><u>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Unless the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">has a strong presence on the moon at the time of China’s manned lunar landing, scheduled for 2017, much of the world will have the impression that China has approached the U</span>nited <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in terms of </span>technological sophistication and comprehensive <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">national power</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.32 </span><strong><u>If recent trends hold, this is likely to come at a time when the new and emerging ideological confrontation between Beijing and Washington will have intensified considerably.33</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The most recent space race reflects the changing dynamics of global power. “Technonationalism” remains the impetus for many nations’ space programs, particularly in Asia: “In contrast to the Cold War space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, </span><strong><u>the global competition today is being driven by national pride</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, newly earned wealth, a growing cadre of highly educated men and women, </span><strong><u>and the confidence that achievements in space will bring substantial soft power as well as military benefits</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The planet-wide eagerness to join the space-faring club is palpable.”34 India and Japan are also aggressively developing their own space programs.35 But </span><strong><u>the United States does not necessarily have to choose between civilian and military space programs since much of the technology developed for space is dual use</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u>The space industry provides a tremendous opportunity for militaries that desire more affordable access and space assets that can significantly augment terrestrial force</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s. As Alfred Thayer Mahan pointed out, “Building up a great merchant shipping lays the broad base for the military shipping.”36 </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The US military can maximize its resources</span>, not only financially but also politically, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">by packaging as much military space activity as possible into commercial space activity. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">One example involves satellite communications. The arrangement the Pentagon has with Iridium Satellite LLC gives the military unlimited access to its network and allows users to place both secure and nonsecure calls or send and receive text messages almost anywhere in the world.37 Another example involves space imagery. Even though the government must maintain sophisticated imaging capabilities for special situations, it could easily meet the vast majority of its routine requirements at lower cost by obtaining commercially available imagery.38 The Air Force could also use space transportation, another emerging industry, to maximize its resources. Private ventures now under way are reducing the costs of space access considerably. It is possible that one enterprise could become an alternative to Russian Soyuz spacecraft for NASA’s missions to the International Space Station.39 Such enterprises could prove attractive, cost-effective options for delivering the Air Force’s less-sensitive payloads to Earth orbit. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Space tourism</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a growing industry, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">could enable the Air Force to procure affordable capabilities </span>to routinely operate 60 to 90 miles above Earth</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.40 </span><strong><u>Advances that entrepreneurs are making in suborbital space flight could eventually evolve to a point where the Air Force would find it far easier</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, politically as well as financially, </span><strong><u>to acquire platforms capable of delivering munitions from space</u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Conclusion A glance at the global strategic situation reveals many nations rushing to develop space capabilities. Ostensibly civilian, the capabilities in </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">development</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> around </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the world </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">are largely dual use and will have profound effects on the balance of power</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The United States, therefore, would be foolish to slow the pace of its own space development. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The issue at hand is not whether to proceed with space weapons but how to proceed with these capabilities</span> and effectively manage the security dilemmas that will inevitably arise.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> By assuming a posture which suggests that its intentions in space are competitive scientific and commercial pursuits—and which does not suggest the desire to barricade the medium in times of peace for the purpose of geopolitical leverage—</span><strong><u>the United States can proceed without causing undue angst in the international community. Once we have laid the foundation for commercial activities</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., “merchant shipping”), </span><strong><u>military capabilities</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—or “military shipping”—</span><strong><u>will follow in due course and with far less controversy</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">If US policy makers can showcase scientific and commercial space endeavors while avoiding the perception of orbital despotism, they can steadily build dominant military space capabilities</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and retain soft power. </span><br />

Consequently, their first and best choice is </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the diplomatic route</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">through the United Nations (UN) </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">by</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">presenting resolutions and </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">treaties </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in hopes of countering US space-weaponization efforts with international law.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Although </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">such attempts have thus far failed to halt US plans</span></u></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> they have managed to build an international consensus against the United States. Indeed, on 5 December 2007, a vote on a UN resolution calling for measures to stop an arms race in space passed by a count of 178 to one against the United States, with Israel abstaining.6 The problem for the United States is that </span><strong><u>other nations believe it seeks to monopolize space in order to further its hegemonic dominance</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.7 In recent years, a growing number of nations have vocally objected to this perceived agenda. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Poor US diplomacy </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">on the issue of space weaponization </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">contributes to increased geopolitical backlashes</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of the sort leading to the recent decline in US soft power—the ability to attract others by the legitimacy of policies and the values that underlie them—</span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">which</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, in turn, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">has restrained overall US national power </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">despite any gains in hard power</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(i.e., the ability to coerce).8 </span><strong><u>The</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates </span><strong><u>should not take its</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> s</span><strong><u>oft power lightly since decreases in that attribute over the past decade have led to increases in global influence for strategic competitors, particularly Russia and China</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The ramifications have included a gradual political, economic, and social realignment, otherwise known as “multipolarism” and translated as waning US power and influence. “Soft power, therefore, is not just a matter of ephemeral popularity; it is a means of obtaining outcomes the United States wants. . . . When the United States becomes </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">so unpopular that </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">being pro-American is a kiss of death </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in other countries’ domestic politics, foreign political leaders are unlikely to make helpful concessions</span>.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> . . . And </span><strong><u>when U.S. policies lose their legitimacy in the eyes of others, distrust grows, reducing U.S. leverage in international affairs</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”9 Due to US losses of soft power, the international community now views with suspicion any legitimate concerns that the United States may have about protecting critical assets in space, making it far more difficult politically for the Air Force to make plans to offer such protection. </span><br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">Their misperceptions about US intentions will trigger preemptive space wars</span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Strategists in the United States and in China are clearly monitoring the other’s developments in space. How the United States judges Chinese intentions and capabilities will determine Washington’s response; of course, the reverse is equally true. As each side eyes the other, </span><strong><u>the potential for mutual misperceptions can have serious and destabilizing consequences in the long term</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, both </span><strong><u>countries’ <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">exaggerated views of each other could lead unnecessarily to competitive action-reaction cycles</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What exactly does such an action-reaction cycle mean? What would a bilateral space race look like? Hypothetically, in the next 10 years, </span><strong><u>some critical sectors of China’s economy and military could become increasingly vulnerable to disruptions in space.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> During this same period, </span><strong><u>Sino-U.S. relations may not improve appreciably</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the Taiwan question could remain unresolved. If Washington and Beijing could increasingly hold each other’s space infrastructure hostage by threatening to use military options in times of crisis, then potentially risky paths to preemption could emerge in the policy planning processes in both capitals. In preparing for a major contingency in the Taiwan Strait, </span><strong><u>both the United States and China might be compelled to plan for a disabling, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">blinding attack on the other’s space systems before the onset of hostilities</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The most troubling dimension to this scenario is that </span><strong><u>some elements of preemption</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (already evident in U.S. global doctrine) </span><strong><u>could become a permanent feature of U.S. and Chinese strategies in space.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Indeed, Chinese strategic writings today suggest that the leadership in Beijing believes that preemption is the rational way to prevent future U.S. military intervention.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> If leaders in Beijing and Washington were to position themselves to preempt each other, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">then </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the two sides would enter an era of mutual hostility, one that might include destabilizing, hair-trigger defense postures</span> in space where both sides stand ready to launch a first strike</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on a moment’s notice. One scenario involves the use of weapons, such as lasers or jammers, which seek to blind sensors on imaging satellites or disable satellites that provide warning of missile launches. Imagine, for example, Washington’s reaction if China disabled U.S. missile warning satellites or vice versa. In that case, </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Sino-U.S. </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">relations would be highly vulnerable to the misinterpretations and miscalc</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">ulations </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">that could lead to a conflict in space.</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although attacks against space assets would likely be </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a precursor</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or a complement </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to a broader</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">crisis or </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">conflict</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and although conflicts in the space theater may not generate many casualties or massive physical destruction, the economic costs of conflict in space alone for both sides, and for the international community, would be extraordinary given that many states depend on satellites for their economic well-being.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <strong>The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense ‘use or lose’ pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting. Death Start with automated ‘hair trigger’ devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms.

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed ‘<em>complexlyinteractive,</em> tightly coupled’ industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee </span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, ‘<em>[t]he odd term “normal accident” is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable’.36</em> Deployment of space weapons with predelegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to <em>“normal accidents’.</em></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M.

<u>Entrepreneurs have been backing space-related companies for years, but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">recent developments are pushing the private space race further into the spotlight.</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In April, President Obama laid out his plan for the future of the United States space agency</span></strong><u>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">A key part of his vision includes providing funding to private companies to build and fly their own spacecraft</span>.</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Although </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>the latest NASA budget</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> will do away with certain long-standing provisions of the space program, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Obama's</span> 2011 proposed <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">budget</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, announced in February, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">would dedicate</span></u> <strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>$6 billion over five years</u></span></strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">to the development of commercial spacecraft</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In addition, the proposed budget provides (only in FY 2011) $312 million for additional incentives for NASA's current domestic commercial cargo service providers. &quot;Obama's NASA proposal hands over more space operations to the commercial sector, saying it will create thousands of new jobs and hold costs down,&quot; </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Reuters</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reported in February, citing a handful of private firms awarded $50 million in grants in the first step toward implementing the president's vision of commercialized space transportation. This month's </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>successful launch</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the privately owned </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Falcon 9</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> shuttle bolstered that faith in space travel privatization. On June 4, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) announced that during the inaugural flight of its Falcon 9 vehicle, the craft </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>successfully launched and achieved Earth orbit</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> right on target, marking a key milestone not just for SpaceX, but for the commercial space flight industry. &quot;We achieved 100 percent of our objectives on the mission,&quot; Elon Musk, SpaceX's founder and chief executive, said in </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>a New York Times report</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on the event. According to Wired.com's </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Autopia</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> blog, Falcon 9's </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>orbital bullseye</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> &quot;once again pushed the private space race back into the spotlight.&quot; The <em>Times</em> agrees, saying &quot;success was a major boon to those supporting President Obama's proposal to turn the launching of astronauts over to private companies.&quot; Founded in 2002, SpaceX is a private company currently focused on delivering payloads to low Earth orbit. It aims to develop a family of launch vehicles that &quot;will ultimately reduce the cost and increase the reliability of space access by a factor of 10,&quot; according to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>the company's Web site</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. SpaceX, Autopia says, believes it will be able to deliver passengers to orbit for $20 million a seat, &quot;a fraction of the roughly $50 million NASA will be paying Russia for taxi services in the immediate future.&quot; Meanwhile, a start-up founded in 1999 by an entrepreneur who made his fortune in real estate and hotels, is working on a place to stay in space. &quot;Two prototype space modules built by Bigelow Aerospace are now circuiting the Earth,&quot; </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Space.com</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> says. &quot;Lofted in July 2006 and in June 2007, respectively, the company's Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 expandable modules served as forerunners to ever-larger and human-rated space structures.&quot; </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Bigelow Aerospace</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> plans to launch expandable modules by 2014, to be assembled into &quot;the solar system's first private space station,&quot; accommodating visitors a year later, according to </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>another New York Times feature</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, published days after the Falcon 9 launch. A second, larger station would follow in 2016. &quot;The two Bigelow stations would then be home to 36 people at a time — six times as many as currently live on the International Space Station,&quot; the<em>Times</em> reports. At $395 million per six-person module per year (less than a single shuttle launch), Bigelow will lease the space station to countries that lack funding for their own space programs, while simultaneously serving as a source of revenue for the commercial space shuttle companies Obama plans to fund. Other U.S. space companies include: </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>the Spaceship Company</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; a joint venture between U.S. firm </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Scaled Composites</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and U.K.-based </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Virgin Group</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; and</span></strong> Space Adventures<u>, a space tourism company that has sent seven private astronauts to the ISS.</u> <u>&quot;By showing there's a market, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">we inspire private investment in tech</span>nologies <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">that will one day make it less expensive</span></u><u>,</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; Space Adventures founder Eric Anderson said. <em>(Source:</em> </span><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>America.gov</u></span></em><em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">)</span></em></strong> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Outside the U.S., there is great interest in the business of space but fewer strictly commercial space companies</span></u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver; font-size: 8pt;">, </span> <span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>George Nield</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Federal Aviation Administration associate administrator for commercial space transportation, told </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>America.gov</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in April. &quot;</span></strong><u>The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">space programs</span> of Japan, Russia, Europe, China and India <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">are funded by national governments</span>,&quot;</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> America.gov explains. &quot;France's </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Arianespace</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is a quasi-private European space consortium founded in 1980 as the world's first commercial launch-services provider.&quot; &quot;We're departing from the model of the past, in which the government funded all human space activities,&quot; </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;"><u>Maj.

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> NASA e now past 50 e is well into middle age and seemingly experiencing a mid-life crisis. Any honest assessment of its performance over the past two decades leads to the inexorable conclusion that it is time for some serious reviewdand even more serious reform. National U.S. Space Study Commissions have been recommending major reform for some years and finally someone has listened. President </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Obama has had the </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">political and programmatic </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">courage to make some serious shifts in </span>how <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">NASA </span>does its business. It is no longer sufficient to move some boxes around and declare this is the new and improved NASA</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One of the key messages from the 2004 Aldridge Commission report, which was quickly buried by NASA, was words to this effect: “</span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Let enterprising space entrepreneurs do what they can do </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">better than NASA </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">and leave a more focused NASA do what it does best </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">- namely space science and truly long range innovation</span></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">”</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> <span style="color: #00167c;">[1]</span>. If one goes back almost 25 years to the Rogers Commission <span style="color: #00167c;">[2] </span>and the Paine Commission <span style="color: #00167c;">[3] </span>one can find deep dissatisfaction with NASA productivity, with its handling of its various space transportation systems, and with its ability to adapt to current circumstances as well as its ability to embark on truly visionary space goals for the future. Anyone who rereads the Paine Commission report today almost aches for the vision set forth as a roadmap to the future in this amazing document. True there have been outstanding scientific success stories, such as the Hubble Telescope, but these have been the exception and not the rule. The first step, of course, would be </span></strong><u>to retool and restructure NASA from top to bottom and not just tweak it a little around the edges. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The first step would be to explore what space activities can truly be commercialized </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and see where NASA could be most effective by stimulating innovation in the private sector rather than undertaking the full mission itself</span></u><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> XPrize Founder Peter Diamandis has noted that we don't have governments operating taxi companies, building computers, or running airlinesdand this is for a very good reason. Commercial organizations are, on balance, better managed, more agile, more innovative, and more market responsive than government agencies. People as diverse as movie maker James Cameron and Peter Diamandis feel that the best way forward is to let space entrepreneurs play a greater role in space development and innovation. Cameron strongly endorsed </span></strong><u>a greater role for commercial creativity in U.S. space programs</u> <strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">in a February 2010 Washington Post article and explained why he felt this was the best way forward in humanity's greatest adventure: “I applaud President Obama's bold decision for NASA to focus on building a space exploration program that can drive innovation and provide inspiration to the world. This is the path that can make our dreams in space a reality” <span style="color: #00167c;">[4]</span>. One of the more eloquent yet haunting calls for change came some six years ago. The occasion was when Space X founder Elon Musk testified before the US Senate in April, 2004 at a Hearing on The Future of Launch Vehicles: “The past few decades have been a dark age for development of a new human space transportation system. One multi-billion dollar Government program after another has failed..When America landed on the Moon, I believe that wemade a promise and gave people a dream. It seemed then that.someone who was not a billionaire, not an Astronaut with the “Right Stuff”, but just a normal person, might one day see Earth from space. That dream is nothing but broken disappointment today. If we do not now take action different from the past, it will remain that way” <span style="color: #00167c;">[5]</span>. One might think that, since Muskwas seeking to develop his own launch capability, he was exaggerating; but a review of the record suggests otherwise. Today nearly 25 years after the Rogers and Paine Commission reports that followed the Challenger disaster, we find that the recommendations for NASA to develop a reliable and costeffective vehicle to replace the Shuttle is somewhere between being a disappointment and a fiasco. Billions of dollars have gone into various spaceplane and reusable launch vehicle developments by NASA over the past 20 years</span></strong><u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span> Spaceplane projects have been started by NASA time and again amid great fanfare and major expectations and then a few years later either cancelled in failure or closed out with a whimper</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The programs that NASA has given up on now include the Delta Clipper, the HL-20, X-33, the X-34, X-37, X-38, and X-43 after billions of US funds and billions more of private money have been sacrificed to the cause <span style="color: #00167c;">[6]</span>. In the field of space research NASA has a long and distinguished career. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">In the area of space transportation</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and space station </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">construction its record over the past 30 years has largely been a record of failure.</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;">The Space Shuttle was supposed to have been an efficient space truck that would fly every two weeks and bring cargo to orbit at a fraction of the cost of early space transportation systemsdperhaps a few thousand dollars per pound to low-Earth orbit. In fact, the fully allocated cost of the Shuttle is over $1 billion a flight and it is by far the most expensive space transportation system ever. After the Columbia accident NASA spent years and billions more dollars to correct serious safety problems with the Space Shuttle and still was never able to fulfill the specific recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. Yes, that's correct. After grounding the Space Shuttle for some 2.5 years (from February 2004 to August 2006) and expending $1.75 billion dollars in the wake of the CAIB report, NASA was not able to correct the identified problems and complete the tasks asked of it. Then, after the foam insulation problem re-emerged with Discovery and STS flight 114, hundreds of millions more dollars were spent to solve the problem again, bringing the grand total to over $2 billion <span style="color: #00167c;">[7]</span>. The first rendition of a space station was scheduled during the Reagan years to have been completed in 1991 for several billions of dollars. The projected completion date extended to 1994 when the project was redesigned and it became the International Space Station (ISS). Today the ISS is not only late, but its total cost has ballooned to over $100 billion <span style="color: #00167c;">[8]</span>. Project Constellation, with a projected cost of over $100 billion until its recent cancellation by President Obama, seemed to loom as an eerie repetition of the ISS e another mega-project always over budget, always late, and with constantly lowered expectations. Henry Spencer, writing for the New Scientist, has characterized Project Constellation as an “Illusion, Wrapped in Denial.” His specific observations about the NASA Moon/Mars program were as follows: First, it probably wasn't going to work. Even so early in its life, the programme was already deep into a death spiral of “solving” every problem by reducing expectation of what the systems would do. Actually reaching the moon would probably have required a major redesign, which wasn't going to be funded <span style="color: #00167c;">[9]</span>. Any private company with NASA's record on the Space Shuttle, the ISS deployment and spaceplane development, would have gone bankrupt decades ago. In all three cases the US Congress has been told by NASA essentially what it wanted to hear rather than the grim facts as to cost, schedule and performance. I personally remember when Congress was being told quite unbelievable things about the cost and expected performance of the Space Shuttle. We at Intelsat presented testimony that strongly contradicted NASA's statements on cost and performance. There are dozens of examples of entrepreneurial space enterprises that have generated innovative ideas that seemed to show us how we could have gotten ourselves into space faster, cheaper and better. - A private, Boulder, CO-based company called the External Tanks Corporation (ETC) suggested in the 1980s thatwe could just add a little more thrust to the External Tanks for the Space Transportation System (i.e. the Space Shuttle) and lo and behold we could put them into Low-Earth Orbit. Dr. Randolph “Stick” Ware of the ETC explained that one could then strap these tanks together and create the structure of a space station at a fraction of the cost of the ISS, and much more quickly as well. - Bob Zubrin has for years championed the idea of sending methane generators to Mars to produce the fuel for the astronauts' return trip. The cost of a Mars mission with a refueling station on Mars would be dramatically lower. - Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites took a few million dollars of backing from Microsoft's Paul Allen and developed the White Knight carrier craft and the SpaceShipOne spaceplane. This vehicle system, which won the X Prize, set the stage for a space adventures industry that will begin launches in 2011. When this experimental spaceplane landed at Edwards Air Force Base in 2004, a spectator's sign said it all: “SpaceShipOne e NASA Zero”. Some have suggested that President Barack Obama's cancellation of the unwieldy and expensive Project Constellation to send astronauts back to the Moon for a few exploratory missions was a blow to NASA and the start of the end of the US space program. The truth is just the reverse. Project Constellation, accurately described by former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin as “Apollo on Steroids” provided little new technology or innovation and had an astronomical price tag. It was clearly too much for too little. If the opportunity costs of Project Constellation are examined (i.e. if we think what could have been done with an extra $100 billion of space funds), dumping it defies argument. With much less invested in a questionable Project Constellation enterprise we can do much more in space astronomy.We can invest more wisely in space science to learn more about the Sun, the Earth and threats from Near Earth Objects. David Thompson, Chairman and CEO of Orbital Sciences said the following in a speech that endorsed the new commercial thrust of the NASA space policies on Nine February 2010: “</span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Let </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">us, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the commercial space industry, develop the space taxis we need to get our Astronauts into orbit and to ferry those wanting to go into space to get to where they want to go.</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We are in danger of falling behind in many critical areas of space unless we shift our priorities</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” <span style="color: #00167c;">[10]</span>. With a change in priorities we can deploy far more spacecraft needed to address the problems of climate change via better Earth observation systems. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">We can fund competitions and challenges to spur space entrepreneurs to find cheaper and better ways to send people into space</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We can also spur the development of solar power satellites to get clean energy from the sun with greater efficiency. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We can deal more effectively with finding and coping with “killer” asteroids</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and near earth objects. We may even find truly new and visionary ways to get people into space with a minimum of pollution and promote the development of cleaner and faster hypersonic transport to cope with future transportation needs. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The real key is to unlock the potential of commercial space initiatives </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">while giving a very middle-aged NASA</span></u> <u>a new lease on life</u><strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Here are just some of the possibilities that are on the horizon of a revitalized commercial space industry. - Solar power satellites: The new space company Solaren has recently contracted with a US west coast energy utility to start J.N. Pelton / Space Policy 26 (2010) 78e80 79 beaming clean solar energy from space to Earth in 2016 via a tri-part solar power system. Its three key components are: 1) a lightweight solar concentrator; 2) a high performance solar cell array that will see the equivalent of many suns 24 h a day; and 3) a transmission system from space to Earth. Solar power satellites could be a major new part of the new mix of “green energy systems” we need to reduce our addiction to carbonbased fuels. Serious efforts are now underway not only in the USA but in Japan and other countries seeking a new source of clean energy <span style="color: #00167c;">[11]</span>. - Commercial spaceplanes and space stations: Space adventure tours to go into dark sky to see the big Blue Marble from space may become reality as soon as 2011. To date only some 500 people have gone into space since the dawn of the Space Age</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">This new industry</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(‘space tourism’ is not the right name for this high-risk-type adventure, which is much more dangerous than a commercial air flight) </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">will potentially create the opportunity for thousands of “citizen astronauts</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">to fly over 100 km into space. The space adventure business is currently being developed by enterprising billionaires. Sir Richard Branson, head of Virgin Galactic, is the most visible leader, but there are many others willing to risk capital on commercial space. They include Jeff Bezos, founder of <span style="color: #00167c;">Amazon.com</span>, Robert Bigelow, owner of Budget Suites, Paul Allen, one of the backers of the Space Ship Corporation, John Carmack, creator of video games such as “Doom”, and Elon Musk, founder of PayPal. Each of these entrepreneurs of great wealth is currently putting serious money into developing spaceplane technology and commercial space platforms. Robert Bigelow has already launched his Genesis 1 and 2 commercial space station prototypes <span style="color: #00167c;">[12]</span>.</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> High Return in Safety from Extra-terrestrial Settlement</span></strong><br />
<u>Investment in orbital access and other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">space infrastructure will facilitate the establishment of settlements </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">on the Moon, Mars</span>, asteroids <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and in man-made space structures</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the first phase, development of new regulatory infrastructure in various Earth orbits, including property/usufruct rights, real estate, mortgage financing and insurance, traffic management, piloting, policing and other services will enable the population living in Earth orbits to grow very large. </span></strong><u>Such activities aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of humans' historical spread over the surface of the Earth.</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As trade spreads through near-Earth space, </span></strong><u>settlements are sure to follow,</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which humans have created in the many different environments in which they live.</span></strong><br />
<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The success of such extra-terrestrial settlements will have the </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">additional </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">benefit of reducing the danger of human extinction due to planet-wide or cosmic accidents</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[20, 26]. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">These horrors include both man-made disasters such as </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">nuclear war, plagues or climate change</span>, and natural disasters such as super-volcanoes or asteroid impact.</u><br />
<u>It is hard to think of any objective that is more important than preserving peace</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Weapons developed in recent decades are so destructive, and have such horrific, long-term side-effects that their use should be discouraged as strongly as possible by the international community. Hence, </span></strong><u>reducing the incentive to use weapons by rapidly developing the ability to use space-based resources on a large scale is surely equally important</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [15, 20, 28</span></strong><u>]. The achievement of this depends on the low space travel costs which, at the present time, appear to be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism industry.</u><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> SUMMARY</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As discussed above, if space travel services had started during the 1950s when they first could, the space industry would be enormously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans' technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of the general public has not been used for that purpose, while suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the resulting lack of new industries have increased.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In response, policies should be implemented urgently to correct this error, and to catch up with the possibilities for industrial and economic growth that have been ignored for so long. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">This policy renewal is urgent because of </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the growing danger of</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> unemployment, economic stagnation, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">climate change</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, educational and cultural decline, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">resource wars and loss of civil liberties </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">which face civilisation today</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In order to achieve the necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between those working in the two fields of civil aviation and civil space. Although the word &quot;aerospace&quot; is widely used, it is largely a misnomer since these two fields are in practice quite separate. True &quot;aerospace&quot; collaboration to realise passenger space travel will develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Humans' Urgent Choice: Heaven or Hell on Earth?</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As discussed above, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the claim that resources are running out can be used to justify wars which may never end</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: present-day rhetoric about &quot;the long war&quot; or &quot;100 years war&quot; in Iraq are current examples. If political leaders do not change their viewpoint, the recent aggression by the rich, &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; countries and their cutting back of traditional civil liberties are ominous for the future. However, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">this &quot;hellish&quot; vision of endless war is based on an assumption about a single number</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– the future cost of travel to orbit – </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">about which a different assumption leads to a literally &quot;heavenly&quot; vision of peace</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and ever-rising living standards for everyone forever. If this cost stays above 10,000 Euros/kg, where it has been unchanged for nearly 50 years, the prospects for humanity are bleak. But </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">if humans make the necessary effort, and use the tiny amount of resources needed to develop passenger space vehicles</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, then this cost will fall to 100 Euros/kg, the use of extra-terrestrial resources will become economic, and </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">arguments for resource wars will evaporate entirely</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is not a decision for the far future or the 22nd Century. It has to be made very soon if humans are to have a reasonable future.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The main reason why this step has not been taken yet seems to be lack of understanding by investors and policy-makers of the myriad opportunities that space travel will create. Now that the potential to catch up half a century’s delay in the growth of space travel is becoming understood, continuing to spend 20 billion Euro equivalents/year on government space activities while continuing to invest nothing in developing passenger space travel would be a gross failure of economic policy, and strongly contrary to the economic and social interests of the public. As this policy error is corrected, and </span></strong><u>investment in profitable space projects grows rapidly in coming years, we can look forward to a growing world-wide boom.</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Viewed as a whole, humans' industrial growth has been seriously underperforming for decades, due to the failure to exploit these immensely promising fields of activity. The tens of thousands of unemployed space engineers in Russia, America and Europe alone are a huge waste. The millions of disappointed young people who have been taught that they cannot travel in space are another enormous wasted resource</span></strong><br />

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The future of peace </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and security </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">in </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">outer </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">space is at a critical juncture. The legal regime </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that guides</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">commercial, military, and scientific activities in </span><a name="8243-364"></a></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">space </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">is fragmented </span>and increasingly inadequate to meet the challenges posed by the growing number of actors seeking to exploit space</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The most serious challenge to the space regime is posed by the stated intent of the George W. Bush administration to pursue national dominance in space, which may eventually include stationing weapons there. Although </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">space is already militarized to some degree</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - that is, used for military support purposes - </span></strong><u>no nation has yet placed weapons in space. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Such a move would cross an important and longstanding</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> threshold, likely </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">provoking a battle for national superiority </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in space dominated by the<span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;"> U</span></span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates. </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">It would seriously undermine the current legal order </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in space that is widely supported by the rest of the world</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The deployment of ground-based antisatellite (ASAT) weapons would also constitute a serious departure from the current regime. Without a concerted effort to develop a more comprehensive legal regime for space that will limit unconstrained weaponization, the international community will likely face a new military competition in space, with destabilizing consequences for national and global security. Such a competition will place at risk existing military, commercial, and scientific activities. With the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent &quot;war on terrorism,&quot; and the U.S. occupation of Iraq dominating the headlines, the issue of national missile defense, and with it the larger issue of the control and weaponization of space, has receded from the front pages. The problem is imminent, however, as the United States moves forward with Pentagon plans to develop space control and global engagement capabilities, <a name="r1"></a></span></strong>1 <strong>which imply the deployment of weapons in space.</strong> <u>If conflict over the use of space, or even actual conflict in space, is to be prevented or at least significantly constrained by general agreement,</u> <strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">the international community will need to agree on permitted activity in space and more refined arrangements for distributing the benefits of that activity. Such a regime would be in the strong interest of commercial, scientific, and military support constituencies worldwide. Without such agreement, space will largely be shaped by the short-term interests of power rather than the long-term interests of law. This Article develops the case for a more refined, rule-based regime for outer space. In Part II of the Article, I describe the current challenge to the space regime posed by the U.S. <em>pursuit of national dominance in space</em>. After summarizing the current legal regime, I outline three alternative scenarios for the future of space - national dominance, &quot;muddling through,&quot; and a strengthened legal regime - and suggest why the first two are unlikely to lead to stable outcomes over the long term. In Part III of the Article, I argue that </span></strong><u>the traditional high seas analogy for outer space is no longer an adequate basis for rule-making for space</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">and in Part IV, I make the case for a strengthened, rule-based regime organized around new guiding principles: comprehensive security, equal protection in space, and equity in access to space. These principles would form the core of a space sanctuary regime. I justify each of <a name="8243-365"></a>the principles and suggest some guidelines for operationalizing them in practice. In making the case for a strengthened regime, I draw on insights from the evolution of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOS Treaty or LOS Convention) <a name="r2"></a></span></strong>2 <strong>about both the multilateral lawmaking process and new principles that might be used in developing a more specified legal regime for space. II. The Current Challenge: Law Versus Power in Outer Space The dominant challenge to the future of outer space lies in the existence of two competing visions of how activities in space should be organized, managed, and controlled. The first view emphasizes</strong> <u>the central role of law in preserving space for peaceful purposes and in promoting international cooperation in the use and exploitation of space for the benefit of all</u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">This view emphasizes the benefits of a multilateral legal regime as the best way to balance the various interests in space, to manage the possible interference of activities, and to ensure that no single power dominates and possibly jeopardizes access to space by others. Power is constrained by law, and national interests are pursued in the context of a developed and articulated legal framework and an assumption of mutual and reciprocal interests. This is the logic of the current legal regime for space (however weak and incomplete), as reflected in a set of outer space, arms control, and commercial treaties and agreements beginning in the 1960s. <a name="r3"></a></span></strong>3 <strong>The second view is the logic of national dominance projected by the former U.S. Space Command (SPACECOM). <a name="r4"></a></strong>4 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">With the United States increasingly reliant on space for both commercial and military support activities, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">SPACECOM argues that U.S. assets in space are vulnerable to attack and that</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, in order to protect them, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the U</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nited </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">S</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">tates </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">needs to dominate space militarily</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u> <strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">SPACECOM's Vision for 2020 argues that the protection of space requires superior U.S. space warfare capability and proclaims its members &quot;stewards for military space.&quot; <a name="r5"></a></span></strong>5 <strong>It sets out two principal themes: (1) dominating the space dimension of military operations to protect U.S. interests and investment; and (2) integrating space forces into warfighting capabilities across the full spectrum of conflict. <a name="r6"></a></strong>6 <strong>As Air Force General Joseph W. Ashy, a former commander of SPACECOM, explained, the United States &quot;will engage terrestrial targets someday - ships, airplanes, land targets - from space. We will engage targets in space, from space ... . [The missions are] already <a name="8243-366"></a>assigned, and we've written the concepts of operations.&quot; <a name="r7"></a></strong>7 <u>SPACECOM also claims that the United States must establish a military presence in space in order to preempt possible efforts by other nations to do so.</u> <a name="r8"></a><u>8</u><strong><span style="font-size: 4pt;"> Although this doctrine was once advanced exclusively by SPACECOM, prominent civilian defense officials have endorsed the global engagement strategy, and have begun to implement changes in Pentagon doctrine, organization, and budgets to move in that direction. The January 2001 Rumsfeld Commission report on the management of U.S. space assets, produced by a study commission chaired by Donald Rumsfeld before he became Secretary of Defense, signaled his strong support for the need to project force in space in order to counter presumed threats to U.S. military security there. <a name="r9"></a></span></strong>9 <strong>Although it stopped short of directly advocating space weapons, no one could miss the point. In late September 2001, the Quadrennial Defense Review Report, a wide-ranging assessment of U.S defense policy, called for beefing up military space surveillance, communications, and other applications of earth-orbiting spacecraft. It also underscored the need to deny the use of space by adversaries, and to address U.S. vulnerabilities in space with aggressive development of space capabilities. <a name="r10"></a></strong>10 <strong>Most tellingly, the Department of Defense's Nuclear Posture Review, portions of which were leaked in March 2002, reportedly advocates the use of space-based assets to enhance conventional and nuclear strike capabilities. <a name="r11"></a></strong>11 <strong>In October 2002, SPACECOM merged with the U.S. Strategic Command, which controls U.S. nuclear forces, to create a single entity responsible for early warning, missile defense, and long-range strikes. <a name="r12"></a></strong>12 <strong>The Pentagon requested $ 1.6 billion dollars over FY 2003-2007 to develop space-based lasers and kinetic kill vehicles to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles (and to destroy satellites). <a name="r13"></a></strong>13 <strong>Providing further evidence of high-level support for the global engagement strategy, the current Bush administration's decision to <a name="8243-367"></a>withdraw from the 30-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty <a name="r14"></a></strong>14 <strong>appeared to be less of a necessary move driven by technical demands of missile defense testing (since much testing could be done within the terms of the treaty, and deployment of a feasible system is not imminent) than a symbolic move to sweep away inconvenient legal obstacles to U.S. power projection in space. <a name="r15"></a></strong>15 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">This vision of </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">national dominance</span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the rest of the world, and especially China, contends, </span></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">is incompatible with the established legal regime in space.</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> <a name="r16"></a><span style="color: black;">*</span></span></u><strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">*16</span></strong> <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">The international community has </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">for over forty years </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">repeatedly reaffirmed </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">space should be preserved for peaceful purposes, </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">should be </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">available to all, and should be weapon-free</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Hence the relevant options appear to be reduced to two: an active contest over national superiority in space, or an elaborated legal regime that would undoubtedly be designed to prevent decisive predominance in space by any one country, the United States in particular. <a name="r17"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>17</strong></span> A contest over national superiority in space could extinguish the explicit equal right to use space that all nations enjoy, creating instead a de facto regime of control over access and use by the first nation to successfully deploy weapons based in space or weapons on the ground that target satellites. Given the immense value of outer space and its resources, other nations might develop their own antisatellite weapons designed to break this monopoly. Countries that lack the capabilities to build such weapons might purchase them. </span><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">Space-based weapons would </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">also </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">generate instability due to </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the incentives for </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">preemptive attack </span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that powerful but vulnerable weapons systems seem likely to create</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. <a name="r18"></a><span style="color: black;"><strong>18</strong></span> </span><a name="8243-368"></a><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">A more elaborated legal regime would be aimed at preventing destabilizing conflicts over the use of space</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The problem posed is how to balance the interests of the United States with those of the rest of the world. The SPACECOM position, if seriously pursued, would pit the United States against everyone else, and the support of even close allies could be in question. Equally if not more important, other significant interests of the United States in space would be jeopardized if an extended battle over space superiority were to develop. Given the inherent vulnerability of space activities, traditional military support activities (including space-tracking, early warning, communications, reconnaissance, weather monitoring, and navigation) would be placed in jeopardy. The viability of commercial and scientific activities in space would come into serious question as well. </span><strong><u>In a conflict, terrestrial components of space activities could become objects of attack</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, while attacks against satellites could litter space with speeding debris that might rip into commercial satellites and space vehicles, disrupting commercial and scientific activity and communications on the ground.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The United States and Australia are likely to build defensive fortresses around their countries because they have the resources and reserves to achieve self-sufficiency. With diverse growing climates, wealth, technology, and abundant resources, the United States could likely survive shortened growing cycles and harsh weather conditions without catastrophic losses.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Do we need an international ’tax on brains’ (or Bhagwati tax) to compensate the origin countries for the losses incurred as a result of the brain drain? When the idea was first proposed in the 1970s, it was taken for granted that the brain -----------income countries (the expected loosers) clearly deserve a larger share of the pie than large middle income countries (the expected winners). </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The typical policy wonk sees a daunting problem like America's broken immigration system and thinks, &quot;What we need here is comprehensive reform--I'll craft a perfect solution that addresses every aspect of the problem.&quot; This big idea is dispersed through think tanks, journalistic outlets and advocacy organizations, all in the hope that some legacy-minded politician intent on passing &quot;ambitious&quot; legislation seizes it.

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-right: 0.2in;">Despite focused resolve to repair the ailing economy, U.S. President Barack </span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Obama has vowed to tackle</span> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the hot issue of </span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">immigration</span> <strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">reform somewhat sooner than most expected. There are currently around 12 million undocumented workers in the United States, according to official estimates, and what to do about them has been a long-standing bitter debate. One side has called for a path toward citizenship, while the other favors tougher enforcement of immigration laws. Obama's preliminary plan includes provisions for securing borders, cracking down on employers hiring undocumented workers and increasing the number of legal immigrants. It also seeks to help Mexico develop economically, in order to reduce the number of Mexicans who need to cross into the United States to find jobs. Obama said in a recent speech that he wanted to enact reform, and a bill could come as early ,,,,,,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> per year -- as more such workers will be needed once the economy recovers, experts said. Alan </span></strong>Greenspan<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, recently </span></strong>said<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at a Senate hearing that </span></strong>he was in favor of expanding the number of H-1B visas. &quot;The quantity<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of temporary H-1B visas issued each year </span></strong>is far too small to meet the need<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially in the near future as the economy copes with the forthcoming retirement wave of skilled baby boomers,&quot; he said. </span></strong><br />
Neg means vote no. The debate is the introduction – voting no still costs capital – means it’s not a net benefit to the status quo<br />
The plan breaks GOP gridlock, <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">key obstacle all their links assume – its just a small, bipartisan down payment </span></strong><br />
