Some would like to look at slavery as a thing of the past only relevant for history class but the middle passage and chattel slavery all prove how White Supremacy was and still is crucial to the formation of policies of the past and is still the logic that order the world as we know it today<br />

This year’s topic is centered on US immigration policy and its visa system. The construction of this year’s resolution mirrors academia’s attempts to discuss America’s immigration policy outside its context. In reality American first immigration policy was chattel slavery and it is the ugly under belly of our immigration history. Fernando and I goal is to inject this discussion into the narrative of immigration<br />

THUS FERNANDO AND I ADVOCATE THE TOPIC AS A SITE TO AVOW THE MIDDLE PASSAGE AS AMERICA’S FIRST IMMIGRATION POLICY<br />
<br />
Talking about and educating people about slavery is important. The lack of discussions about America’s dark past and chattel slavery is what secures white supremacy and also causes double consciousness. Acknowledging slavery as America’s first immigration policy is what allows for a single-minded consciousness and dispels the white normative conception of immigration<br />

Talking about America’s immigration policy absent the oppressive history of chattel slavery is the same epistemology of ignorance that allows us to separate theories from actual practice. This is the same type of logic that allows the US to invade countries in the name of democracy. <br />

<br />
Our F/W is the judge should vote for whichever team has the best political strategy to disrupt white supremacy in relation in their discussion of the topic. <br />
<span style="font-family: Times;">Acknowledging the continuities of our current system of white supremacy by tracing them back to the chattel slavery is crucial to understanding how systems of oppression are normalized and not destroyed</span><br />
