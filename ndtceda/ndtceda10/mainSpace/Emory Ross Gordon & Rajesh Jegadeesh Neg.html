<span style="margin-left: 0.2in;"><u>Traditionally, the military has used human translators for communication and Pashto translation service</u>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or Dari translation service and other languages</span>. <u>However, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">human translators</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who serve as Pashto translators </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">have</span> a few <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">drawbacks</span></u>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">according to a project manager for NIST</span>. <u>First, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">human translators are often put into dangerous situations</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">when they serve as a walking language translation service for military units to various Afghani or Iraqi settings and villages</span>. <u>Secondly, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">some human translators <strong>may have ulterior motives or hidden agendas</strong></span> for making themselves available</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">for military or government translation service</span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thirdly, </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">human</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Pashto to English </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">translators</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">,</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or English to Pashto translators</span>, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">are sparse in numbers</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">, <u>and sometimes hard to come by</u></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is also true for Dari translation and even some localized <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tomedes.com/Arabic-to-English-translation-service.php" rel="nofollow">Arabic to English translation</a> for certain dialects. So </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">the military has decided that <strong>a technology substitute for even localized translation is a preferable solution</strong></span></u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus far, the</span> <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">TRANSTAC</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">translation device </span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">works by using automatic speech recognition</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% silver;">,</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">which uses software to translate the speech into a text file in the target foreign language. Then text-to-speech technology converts the foreign language text file into an oral response to the foreign language speaker. When the foreign language speaker responds, the reverse happens for the military personnel. The technology is used as a smart phone or iPhone application translation system, in which the smart phone basically acts as the interface for the translation technology. Recently, focus groups practiced using several different devices with this technology, including the smart phone software translation device, which performed oral English to Pashto translation, and then Pashto back to English, between two people participating in the research study and focus group</span>.</span><br />

<em>Nevertheless, while scientific racism was not important to the Enlightenment, many philosophers emphasised the role of climate in shaping civilisations, which, of course, opened the door to the idea of ‘polygenesis’ and the rise of explicit or scientific/genetic racism that took off in the nineteenth century. But even the rise of scientific racism, which flourished in Britain only after 1840, had an ambivalent relationship to colonialism. Not all ‘racialist theorists’ called for imperialism. Some such as Robert Knox and Comte de Gobineau explicitly rejected colonialism. Colonialism would either fail because it would lead to a degeneration of the superior race, or it was pointless because the inferior races were incapable of being civilised. Thus European thinking in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was neither purely racist (in a genetic sense), nor did all of it reject other cultures, and nor was scientific racism always imperialist.
