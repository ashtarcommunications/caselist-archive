&quot;Implementation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), for purposes of obtaining a T-Visa, has focused on an extremely narrowed interpretation of who constitutes a 'victim' - the requirement for cooperation with law enforcement has given prosecutors the dual power of identifying who constitutes an 'iconic' victim and assessing whether or not they have adequately cooperated with an investigation - in short, if one does not construct their political identity in alignment with the elements of a prosecutors 'iconic victim' then they will not receive a visa.

<em>&quot;Attaching Identity to suffering in an attempt to eliminate it negates life and makes destruction desirable.&quot;</em><br />

<em>&quot;This sort of politics creates a firm of political paralysis that destroys the possibility for self affirming action.&quot;</em><br />

Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate sections 101(a)(15)(T)(I), (III), and (IV) of the Immigration and Nationality Act&quot;<br />

<em><span style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">&quot;We must accept that there is no objective reason to preserve existence and that suffering is an inevitable condition of life. We should conceal this 'horror of existence' by an affirmation of the will to power, why we must do the aff despite it all.&quot;</span></em><br />

<em><span style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">&quot;Forcing sex-trafficked women to be answerable to the identity of victim constrains them to a negative existence.&quot;</span></em><br />

<em><span style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">&quot;However, law is not a neutral arbiter if injury but itself invested with power to produce identity - politics that universalize the identity of a 'trafficking victim' as rooted in 'injury' establishes a hierarchy of victims that depoliticizes inequality, marginalization, and conflict.&quot;</span></em><br />

<em>&quot;</em>Our aff opens up a political space for sex-trafficked women to refuse domination by 'refusing to speak' as a method of resistance - this allows individuals to refuse injurous interpellation and subjection through juridico-regulative confession.&quot;<br />

&quot;We can't abandon state politics. Politics must be grounded in secure foundational guarantees, like the law. Radical open-ended politics are bad.&quot; <br />
