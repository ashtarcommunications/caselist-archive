 The Department of Homeland Security should renew the Visa Waiver Program indefinitely and the following amendments should be made to the program:<br />
China and India should be added to the list of eligible companies. <br />
The Electronic System for Travel Authorization fee should be eliminated.<br />
Participants no longer must waive their right to challenge deportation.<br />
The length of stay should be extended indefinitely. <br />
Guarantee a spot in the program for foreign students that enroll in our universities. <br />

<h3 id="toc10"><a name="Liberty Round 1 vs Richmond FH--T-Must modify immigration law in US Code"></a>T-Must modify immigration law in US Code</h3>
 A) Our interpretation: The aff must deal with add, modify or remove some rule of immigration law created by statute, regulation, or court ruling. Extending Immigration benefits to SSBCs does not require resolving the issue of [DOMA or same-sex marriage], which is beyond the question of eligibility for visas.<br />
WILETS 8 – Professor of Law at Nova Southeastern University and Chair of the Inter-American Center for Human Rights (JAMES D., Spring, “SYMPOSIUM: IMMIGRATION: TO ADMIT OR DENY?: A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION LAW FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES: HOW THE UNITED STATES COMPARES TO OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED DEMOCRACIES”, 32 Nova L. Rev. 327, Lexis Law, Initials)<br />
In May 2007, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Congressman Jerrold Nadler …full legal recognition of same-sex unions.<br />
B) Violation: The aff’s goes beyond the resolutional mandate to increase the number of or eligibility for family based visas. <br />
[If DOMA]: and the aff does not modify any part of the US Code dealing with immigration (Title 8). DOMA isn’t even in the same part of the US Code (DOMA is at “TITLE 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS, CHAPTER 1. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION, § 1. Words denoting number, gender, and so forth” and “TITLE 28. JUDICIARY AND JUDICIAL PROCEDURE, PART V. PROCEDURE, CHAPTER 115. EVIDENCE; DOCUMENTARY, § 1738C. Certain acts, records, and proceedings and the effect thereof”):<br />
1 USCS § 7 § 7. Definition of &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;spouse&quot; … right or claim arising from such relationship.<br />
C) Vote Neg<br />
1) Ground: <br />
a) the neg interp still allows the aff; it just has to be a topical version that modifies the INA.<br />
b) the aff precludes core negative CP disad and K ground (the neg should get to counterplan to repeal DOMA and leave the INA alone, or run disads or Ks off of modifications to Title 8 of the US Code dealing with “Aliens and Nationality”)<br />
c) the aff has extra-topical advantages, which should not be considered in deciding the round because the judge does not have to affirm the resolution to solve the advantages.<br />
d) Effects-topicality: The aff only affirms the resolution as a secondary effect of the plan. This mixes burdens and destroys neg ground: The question of whether or not the aff leads to legalization fo same-sex marriage should be a question of solvency. This is an I/V<br />
