<br />
Immigration places black people at the bottom of the barrel- Olson 04<br />
<br />
Whiteness is everywhere- Olson 04<br />
<br />
Current immigration trends fuel the desire to be white- Olson 04<br />
<br />
Current focus on immigration only upholds current dominating system- Olson 04<br />
<br />
Left unchecked, white supremacy and citizenship ensures genocide- munford 96<br />
<br />
White citizen must be eliminated to stop oppression- Olson 04<br />
<br />
Must reject racism- x?<br />
<br />
Fw- the role of the ballot is to determine who best abolishes white citizenship.<br />
<br />
Performative studies operative from historical citezenship and allow for radical black subjectivity- Johnson 06<br />
<br />

Notes:<br />
Both debaters wear white plastic masks during the 1ac and throw them off to symbolize rejecting the white citizenship. They reject some practices of debate- (fw) - but still use perms, concessions. They collapse the flows, but don't read offense against line by line.<br />
<br />
2AC Answers Round 3<br />

<br />
On cap-<br />
Only aff solves root cuase- wilderson 07, uses example of slavery targting blacks instead of whites, uses language of Europe raping the African continent<br />
<br />
Must talk about minorities<br />
<br />

<br />
White supremacy only refers to privilede, priviledge is a first priority to address<br />
<br />
<br />
On queerness-<br />
Queerness done'st cross racial lines, read a johnson card on quare studies<br />

Our Johnson performance card justifies the permutation<br />
<br />
<br />
On Black White Binaries<br />
We have binary of white and dark, not black, is necessary and can build coaltions- olson 04<br />
<br />
Is only a question of privilege. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
