2ar: Ivory Tower scholarship bad, need to join experience with thoery, the perm burns down ivory tower, debate is a refuge from other experiences and can be good for some people, debate needs to be accessible&gt;&gt;&gt; is starting point, we need to question structures of oppression to challenge oppresion<br />

We believe this to be the purpose of debating immigration- this topic isn’t like many prio- the question we are asked to engage with is literally who should be a part of the American political body. The purpose of the resolution is to access important questions about who belongs here.<br />

 A debate, in the traditional sense, did not happen in this round. There were no “sides,” no traditional normative statements about the truth of the resolution or hostile cross examinations. This is not to say something productive did not come of this. In fact, the opposite is true. This was a strategy session in which an in depth discussion of the methodologies to deal with privilege inside, and outside, of the debate community was discussed. <br />

 <strong><u>1ac</u></strong><br />
<br />
Largely the same as round one, but with the addition of this evidence:<br />
<br />
<strong>What happened in New Orleans during the aftermath of hurricane Katrina demonstrates the importance of the rhetoric of citizenship to the real-life struggles of underprivileged folks. To them, being a legal citizen didn’t help them when they needed it most.</strong><br />

“Because citizenship has so many dimensions…citizenship in inexplicably separate ways.”<br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 14pt;">CX of the 1AC </span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>what is the method of the criticism?</strong><br />
<br />
convergence of the ivory tower and the experience. My experiences and tony. We don't have hands on levers of power<br />
<br />
<strong>why is belonging a good starting point?</strong><br />
<br />
our 1ac tries to inverse the logic of &quot;we shoud not be here.&quot; <br />
<br />
<strong>what constitutes non-belonging?</strong><br />
<br />
legal standards. Limitations. Anyone who occupies the space before another person comes to it. <br />
<br />
<strong>what is the opposite of the citizen or citizenship?</strong><br />
<br />

<strong><u>2AC</u></strong><br />
<br />
The negative focuses their approach on chattel slavery. This marginalizes those whose suffering is different/not related to “old-school” slavery.<br />
Ex. Doesn’t assume those who voluntarily came to New Orleans to work. They exercised agency coming here<br />
<br />
The alternative is insufficient. Asking everyone to overlay their suffering against the backdrop of the Middle Passage marginalizes me and them. <br />
<br />
The alternative fails to answer the key question of “where do we go from here” since “we aren’t supposed to be here.” Yes, slavery and chattel slavery happened, but what does that say about what we do now?<br />
<br />
The only way to rupture the squo is via the counterhegemonic discourse of the 1AC. We are the only ones with a methodology for those who occupy this current space.<br />
<br />
Only understanding how we got here will allow us to understand where we go from here. <br />
<br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 14pt;">CX of the 2AC </span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>how do you break through to white supremicists?</strong><br />
<br />
the counterhegemonic discourse in this space is unique. (campbell). <br />
<br />
<strong>if they don't want to change, why would they listen to you?</strong><br />
<br />
why not propose that they change even if they are stubborn. <br />
<br />
<strong>why do people want to come to america to work?</strong><br />
<br />
because they are sold a dream<br />
<br />
<strong>how is that dream created?</strong><br />
<br />
by the rhetoric of citizenship, community, and belonging. <br />
<br />
<strong>how is that citizenship created?</strong><br />
<br />
i don’t understand. i already answered that<br />
<br />
<strong>is the juxtoposition a permutation?</strong><br />
…<br />
<br />
<strong>if it is competing methodologies why do you get to make a permutation?</strong><br />
<br />
well, impact didn't explicitly make one, but impact did say that your methodology isn't mutually exclusive with ours…timer. <br />
<br />
<strong><u>1AR</u></strong><br />
<br />
The debate is about who best performatively and methodologically carves out space for those who don’t belong here. <br />
<br />
Our active politics allows narratives of the oppressed to become visible and relevant. <br />
<br />
Their alternative doesn’t do anything. Isolating the source of oppression is pointless. It has already happened. It isn’t relevant to those who are here and now. They’ve already forgotten where they came from. <br />
<br />
The alternative is void of a politics that can rupture the squo. We are that politics. We re-appropriate the phrase “we aren’t supposed to be here.”<br />
<br />
The alternative is not exclusive of our aff. We are an intersection of oppression. The discussion shouldn’t come at the expense of a discussion of current instances of oppression. <br />
<br />
They don’t carve out a space for those who can’t be part of the grand narrative of debate. Even if their alternative can overcome in the long run, we say immediacy is what matters. <br />
<br />
<strong><u>2AR</u></strong><br />
<br />
This debate is about the methodological exclusion going on in the status quo. <br />
<br />
They don’t have a strategy that fixes the problems with the status quo. What about me, ryan, tony, the Katrina victims?<br />
<br />
They kill America which means they kill debate. Then, we no longer have a platform to rupture the hegemonic policies of the status quo.<br />
<br />
We don’t preclude the discussion of the alternative, but the bottom line is that “we aren’t supposed to be here.” Killing America is a privileged understanding of how we got here. The question is where do we go from here? The alternative precludes the people at the westin making our bed. <br />
<br />
We access their alternatie. Affirming those who can’t be here can actually destroy America. <br />

NDT rd 2 vs Cornell HK<br />
1NC - F/W, Recognition K, Iraqi Refugee Counter Advocacy, &quot;Undocumented&quot; Kritik, Case arguments<br />
2ac – <br />
says you need a single consistent advocacy<br />
talks about how the aff is a reappropriation of words like “undocumented” and the phrase “we are not supposed to be here”<br />
1ar – impact turns framework, says that implicates the rest of neg advocacies in the debate<br />
2ar – argues that you should vote aff to take experience into account, personal stories and experience get instrumentalized in a world of the negative’s interpretation
