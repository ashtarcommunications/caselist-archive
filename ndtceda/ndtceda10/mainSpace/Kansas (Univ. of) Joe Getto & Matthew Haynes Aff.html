First – U.S. Trade Leadership<br />
<br />
US trade leadership and a successful Doha round is key to the multilateral trade regime – the alternative is preferential trade agreements that result in trade blocks and conflict – leadership averts every global conflict and is key to solving global problems.<br />

<strong>Contention 1.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The U.S. Immigration Control has been historically charged with the task of identifying and excluding queer relationships, including that of the LGBT community. These Systems of exclusion are perpetuated today through our current Immigration Policies including those excluding the Immigration of Permanent Partners of LGBT Couples.</strong><br />
<br />

In terms of…to their advantage<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government should remove sex and gender requirements for sponsorship of family based visas and add a visa track for unmarried couples.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 2 the enemy within.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Only through the queer pedagogy of the 1AC and the plan can we reframe the role of sexuality in the realm of migration, which is key to challenging, understanding, and solving the exclusionary identities and sexualities constructed through power, change, and migration.</strong><br />
Luibhéid 2008 (received a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California, Berkeley)<br />
(Eithne Luibhéid, “An Unruly Body of Scholarship”, A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Volume 14, Number 2-3, 2008 CB)<br />
<br />
Lessons drawn… queers and queerness.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus our plan acts as a point of rupture within the dominant narrative of U.S. heteronormative institutions and practices. It becomes the beginning point of the struggle against the exclusionary heteronormative exploitation of immigration policy.</strong><br />

Nonetheless…to undocumented parents.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The Affirmative “Queers” The way we look at Sexuality and Migration. Allowing us to view immigration through the lens of “Queer Citizenship.” Through this lens we can Crtique, undermine and expose the hetero-normative system from within.</strong><br />
Brandzel 5(Amy, candidate in feminist studies at the University of Minnesota, A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, “Queering Citizenship? Same-sex Marriage and the State”, 11.2, p. 198, KLB)<br />
<br />
A radical queer…citizenship altogether.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>We must come to challenge the Hetero-patriarchy through Family Based Immigration. Only by going through Family based Immigration can we come to “queer” Citizenship and Reframe and solve legal/illegal distinctions.</strong><br />
Luibhéid 2008 (received a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California, Berkeley)<br />
(Eithne Luibhéid, “Sexuality, Migration, and the Shifting Line between Legal and Illegal Status”, A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Volume 14, Number 2-3, 2008 CB)<br />
<br />
Heteronormative family preferences…limited to, sexuality.<br />
<br />
<strong>Furthermore the exclusionary forces of hetero-normativity make life Itself a contradiction for immigrants, reducing them to “spaces of Non-Existence” trapped between their physical presence and their “Illegality” thus leading to the erasure of the their “legal personhood.” This erasure leads to real impacts such as Exploitation and Death</strong><br />

<br />
The issues of citizenship…into the United States.72<br />
<br />
<strong>We must stop the every day violence perpetuated onto immigrants if we can hope to solve the largest proximal cause of violence.</strong><br />

This large and at… “state of emergency” (Taussig, Chapter 31). <br />

<strong>Contention 3 The enemy without</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Family Based immigration is the only secure way to challenge The Hetero-patriarchal norms stemming from immigration.</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
Supporters argue that…and relationship costs.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Heteronormative Nature of our Immigration system constructs “queer” relationships as Threats to our Heteropatriarchal System. Thus The U.S. Immigration System is not only the mechanism through which the Hetero-Patriarchy seeks to contain these threats to the system, but also the tool it uses to enforce it’s dominate power relations through methods of exclusion</strong><br />

(Eithne Luibhéid, “Sexuality, Migration, and the Shifting Line between Legal and Illegal Status”, A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Volume 14, Number 2-3, 2008 CB)<br />
The concept of…reflect these developments<br />
<br />
<strong>This view of “queer” relationships as a deviant threat Strips “queers” of their Humanity.</strong><br />
Anzaldua, 87 (Gloria, Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, DJL)<br />
<br />
My culture, selfishness…in-human, non-human.<br />
<br />
<strong>Those exclusionary normative policies governing sexuality that feed the U.S. Immigration Regime also give the system and it’s actors the power to become the “Managers of Life.” Who derive from that power the ability control the bodies of migrants.</strong><br />
Luibhéid 02 (received a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the University of California, Berkeley)<br />
(Eithne Luibhéid, CB) “Entry Denied Controlling sexuality at the Border “<br />
<br />
Despite such criticisms…could be managed.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>This ability to manage life leads to a violent biopolitical control of the body. This violent system of Bio-power is the root of nuclear war, violence, and genocide</strong><br />
Rabinow Professor of Anthropology 84 (Paul, , Berkeley, THE FOUCAULT READER, , p. 260 KNP)<br />

It is as managers…phenomena of population
