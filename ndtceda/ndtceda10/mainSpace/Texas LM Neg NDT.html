 Ballot projects a value system – vote neg to think, feel, and imagine a moral universe that respects more than human existence<br />
Weston 2009<br />
[Anthony, “The incompleat eco-philosopher p. 11-20]<br />
We know that…rise to this challenge.<br />
Humans will inevitably go extinct – choose to vote neg for a moment of ethical clarity<br />
Glikson 1998<br />
[Andrew, planet eaters chain reactions black holes climate change and existential philosophy]<br />
Possessed by a conscious…we must consider Sisyphus happy.” (Albert Camus, The myth of Sisyphus, 1942)<br />
Framing migrants as vital to our existence dooms them to be political footballs – prey to an endless cycle of xenophobia and xenophilia<br />
Vukov 2003<br />
[tamara, “imagining communities through immigration policies: governmental regulation, media spectacles and the affective politics of national borders” International journal of cultural studies 6:335]<br />
A strict focus on…for the good of the nation.<br />
Be open to the inorganic ecologies coming from their impacts – priviledging life is biocentric chauvinism<br />
Rowe 1996<br />
[Stan, Trumpeter 13.1]<br />
Therefore, the level…shock they deserve<br />
<h1 id="toc1"><a name="Complexity K"></a>Complexity K</h1>
 Framework:<br />
Evaluate the 1AC versus the alt as flows of communication – meaning that emerges through interactive process of affect and knowledge. Immigration deliberation is pre-determined by systems of interlocking anxiety – affect comes before cognitive content in the immigration policy context<br />
Adbauer 2008<br />
[Rice, “The new new:making a case for critical affect studies” Quarterly journal of speech, 94:2]<br />
The essays in…our full agreement.<br />

The Debate network is a complex and adaptive system – it self organizes through on-linear interactions between arguments, debaters, judges, and decisions. Promises of stable equilibrium are only an illusion – embracing the unexpected spills over to creative learning<br />
McDaniel 2003<br />
[Reuben, “Surprise, Surprise, Surprise! A complexity science view of the unexpected” Health Care Management Review July/Sept 2003]<br />
Although often we assume…what doesn’t work<br />
Even if the plan is good, you should still explore the gaps in 1AC knowledge – this cultivates enchantment and resonates as education for survival.<br />
Hart 2007<br />
[Tobin, “Reciprocal Revelation: Toward a Pedagogy of Interiority” Journal of cognitive learning, 3(2) Spring, 1-10. 1549-695]<br />
With most topics, there is…genuinely met today?<br />
<h1 id="toc2"><a name="Risk K"></a>Risk K</h1>
 What is risk?<br />
The 1AC demands hospitality for migrants to alleviate danger – but decision-makers host risk whether they like it or not the question of this debate is not an objective calculus of risk – but instead the perception of risk<br />
Beck 2009<br />
[Ulrich “the Normative horizon of world risk society: normative and descriptive cosmopolitanism” Constellations 16.1:3-22]<br />
The distinction between real…of the experts.<br />
But this is not a threat construction kritik<br />
Beck 2009<br />
Instead of making the reality…self-generated problems.<br />
Beck Continues<br />
Beck 2009<br />
Risk is not the same…scenarios of the experts.<br />
Fiat has become like “the boy who cried wolf” every round disposes of a new extinction event. This endless repetition of banal apocalypse distorts immigration deliberation – increasing public cynicism and elite control.<br />
Randals 2009<br />
[Samuel, “precaution, preemption: arts and technologies of the actionable future.” Environment and planning. 27: p 859-878]<br />
Politics we have argued..from media sensationalism<br />
There is always a risk of an infinitely larger impact – plausible scenarios that string out internal links destroy existential risk<br />
Kessler 2008<br />
[Oliver, “From insecurity to uncertainty: risk and the paradox of security politics” Alternatives 33(2008) 211-232]<br />
If the risk of terrorism…with relative certainty<br />
Refuse their impact calc – the 1ac is meaningless risk<br />

 Interpretation: Specific predictions require strong data including <br />
-Large sample size<br />
-And quantifying research methods<br />
Affirmative does not meet the criteria for strong data<br />
Zellner 2007<br />
[Arnold, Philosophy and objectives of econometrics, Journal of econometrics volume 136, issue 2, feb 2007, p 331-339]<br />
There must be a uniform…unless shown otherwise.<br />
Vote neg on presumption – challenging their knowledge production creates new policy-making habits that demand strong data<br />
Davies 2004<br />
[Phillip, “Is evidence-based government possible?]<br />
There is nothing a…effectiveness and efficiency.<br />

They skew analysis of existential risk by narrating plausible scenarios – this trades off with confronting numerous possibilities for inevitable extinction<br />

Marco Cicala…such antagonisms<br />
The 1AC’s attribution of political disruption to the figure of the immigrant understands ethnicity as alienated labor—the other becomes a spectacle to by commodified and consumed<br />
