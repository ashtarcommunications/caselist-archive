We begin the words of Marcelo Arellano as he describes a particular history – A history where the United States identified that Filipino’s could fight for us, die for us, and at the end of the day couldn’t become one of us. The first advantage of the 1ac is called Broken Promises – And you are about to learn why.<br />
<br />
The United States, under the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt, made a promise to conscripted Filipinos to provide citizenship and benefits in exchange for military service. Unfortunately, as repayment for bearing the brunt of the Bataan Death March, Congress broke the promise to these brave soldiers.<br />

In 1990 the US finally passed legislation providing citizenship to the remaining veteranos. This act, however, fails to overcome 60 years of discrimination as it functionally retained second-class standing for Filipinos. The bill did not extend immigration benefits to sons and daughters, or the spouses of the deceased.<br />
