The rhetoric of nuclear apocalypse is a mechanism to maintain heteronormativ domination. It ensures perpetual control of the population in the name of saving it from extinction. <br />

Three basic truths…what to call them.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc21"><a name="x1AC @ Binghamton Rd 1-AT: T Substantial"></a>AT: T Substantial</h2>
 1. We Meet- We expand the Family Based Visa system to include GLBT individuals this is Substaintial<br />
- it increases eligilibility for GLBT individulal by 100% -- <br />

2. Counter Interpretation-<br />

substantial (GENERAL) …. the things discussed).<br />

And Famliy Reunification is central to Immigration<br />

Family-based immigration….wrong with it.<br />
<br />
3. Neg interpertation is arbitarty- not in the context of immigration justifying reading any number to exclude our aff<br />
Substantial requires context<br />
<strong>Words and Phrases</strong>, Vol. 40A, 200<strong><u>2</u></strong>, p. 464.<br />
Cal. 1956. &quot;<u>Substantial&quot; is it relative term, its measure to be gauged by all the circumstances surrounding the matter in reference to which the expression has been used.</u>-Atchison, 'I'. &amp; S. F. IZy. Co. v. Kings County Water Dist., 3(12 P.2d 1, 41 Ca1.2J 140.<br />
<br />
4.Their Interpertation overlimits- Excluding marginlized individuals that currently don’t have access to family reunification—We open up the Family Based visa’s so that GLBT individuals now can qualify for spouse based visas<br />
<br />
5. We are Predictable- Family Unification is at the Heart of the Topic<br />
<br />
6. No Ground Loss- there is no articulation of any link they loose- we wont spike out of Family based links<br />
<br />
7. Reasonability check abuse and Don’t Vote on Potential Abuse- Make them show you where there is abuse on the flow<br />

<br />
2. Increases critical thinking- forces the aff to think strategically when writing the aff- AND all their reason the counterplan makes debate hard are just reason we pressure the 2AC which increases critical thinking and the quality of debates.<br />

3. Learning about the courts role in immigration policy is CRUCIAL in the immigration debate AND there is plenty of aff ground against our Plan<br />
