The thrust of the aff is, we affirm that the USFG should increase the eligibility for O visas (Artists of Excellence) within the Temporary Workers portion of the topic. This stems largely from the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, specifically the portion of Anti-Oedipus where they talk about commodity art versus revolutionary art. We state that we should increase the cap for artists who produce difference. We claim that this is revolutionary. Sometimes we defend instrumental implementation and sometimes we don't. The 1AC is written as a Dialogue between an artist who has filled out the I-140 form necessary to obtain a visa and a government employee. We read the following evidence:<br />

<strong><u>Schizo Aff</u></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;">Our affirmative says that we should expand benficiary eilgibility for all topical visas for schizophrenics. It is delivered in a series of contentions. They are as follows:</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><u><strong>Contention One</strong></u></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;">We tell the story of Oedipus talking to the Sphinx. Oedipus answers the riddle about which creature walks on 4 legs in the morning, two in the afternoon and three at night. The answer is man. We then turn this into a discussion of how Oedipus is used in pseudo-scientific theories to propose guilt as a justification to normalize life creating normalized citizens. We end by saying that a screeching comes across the sky with nothing to compare it to. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;">We cite: Homi K Bhabha, Location of Culture, (Routledge, 1994) in order to criticize psychoanalysis and Thomas Pynchon, Gravity’s Rainbow, pp.1 in our discussion of the screeching sky.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><u><strong>Contention Two</strong></u></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We cite this as proverbs for paranoids. We use this to describe the situations in which paranoia has become internalized within the status quo so that hierarchical systems of power are able to neutralize their citizens so that they become docile subjects. We also have a discussion of the idea that in current policy debate there are strict interpretations of what composes the government as being a body in Washington D.C. And this builds upon the paranoic machine within society. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We cite Thomas Pynchon, Gravity’s Rainbow, assemblage in two areas of this discussion, first in the internalization of paranoid politics within society and secondly that this internalization creates a narrow focus precluding politics. </span></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><u><strong>Contention 3</strong></u></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;">PLAN: the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for one or more of the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, human trafficking-based visas by amending section 221(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to exempt schizophrenia as a category of mental or physical disorders.</span></strong></u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We follow this with a Chen 09 card that describes the way in which the visa system, particularly the informationalization inherent within the system enables different lines of flight to escape the overcoding of the socius.</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><u><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;">Contention 5</span></strong></u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We begin a discussion of the Oedipus complex and how it codes society in order to preclude politics so that we can pacify society and create forms of violent exclusion. We also start a discussion of a revolutionary form of psychosis that escapes the social roles created by Oedipus. We move on to say that these forms of psychosis ultimately create possibilities for a transformative politics that has the power to overcome restrictive and violent binary systems.</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><u><strong>Contention Aleph</strong></u></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;">We discuss the ways in which Oedipalization can be used either to restrict society so that it creates violent systems of oppression. However, we can affirm a politics of difference that enables new forms of education and better political orientation.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><u><strong>Contention Tau</strong></u></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We propose that desire creates reality and that we should replace the psychoanalytic method of restriction with a method of schizoanalysis. We provide a distinction that it is not in celebration of the schizophrenic as an individual but the process of breakthrough they go through in order to explode the oedipal yoke that permits violence within society.</span></span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><u><strong>Contention Omega</strong></u></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">We describe the way in which our use of schizoanalysis introduces a dead language into a living language via the plan. We claim that this maddens the topic. This madness isn't crazy however, it is the affirmation of what the sane deem abject. We make the argument that this is no escape philosophy and that we don't have our hands on the levers of power. Schizophrenics are incapable of engaging in politics due to the exclusion of the status quo. Political power is only given to the good normative subject and anyone who falls outside of this is considered to be the abject. The role of the ballot is to schizoanalyze the topic. </span></span></span><br />
