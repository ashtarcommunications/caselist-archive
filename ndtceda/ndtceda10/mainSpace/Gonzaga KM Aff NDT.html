As these numbers indicate, to date TN visas have been used almost exclusively by Canadians rather than Mexicans. To a considerable degree, this will continue to be the case because a Canadian, unlike a Mexican, is not required to apply for a TN visa, have his eligibility adjudicated by a consular officer, or wait for the visa to be issued. A Canadian professional can simply arrive at the border, establish his professional credentials, and be granted a TN visa. n364<br />
