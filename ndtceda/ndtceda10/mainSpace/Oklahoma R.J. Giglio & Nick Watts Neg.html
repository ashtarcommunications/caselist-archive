Visa K from out rounds of Kentucky<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Extending visas strengthens immigration management by re-ifying the sovereign’s ability to manage what it deems ‘illegal’ entry into the sacred nation. The visa also relies upon a confessionary discipline that causes the immigrant to normalize themselves by stripping themselves of all ‘irregularities’. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Zeynep <strong><u>Kasli, and</u></strong> Ayse <strong><u>Parla</u></strong>, both in Department of Anthropology @ Sabanci University Istanbul, Turkey, <strong><u>2009</u></strong>, “Broken Lines of Il/Legality and the Reproduction of State Sovereignty: The Impact of Visa Policies on Immigrants to Turkey from Bulgaria”, Alternatives 34 (2009), 203–227 </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">The extension of visa does not render the immigrant a citizen, but instead marks them. Interrogating these subtle classifications is critical to immigration scholarship, because it elucidates the workings of immigration bureaucracy and on the ground class distinctions both of which are wished away in the affirmative’s idealization of a perfect visa process. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">By extending the visa as a legal mechanism of immigration, the aff defers judgment of legality, externalizing ethical responsibility and enabling banal complacency with violent atrocities towards illegal immigrants. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">The perpetual state of ontological limbo that the visa damns the immigrant to secures their status as disposable objects of international corporations solidifying a trans-national sovereignty that no longer wages inter-state wars but only engages in global civil wars on behalf of the health of the populace. </span><br />

Putting Foucault, de Beauvoir, and Agamben in Dialogue”, Paper presented at the annual meeting of the political science association </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">The affirmative’s love for the immigrant is a byproduct of a narcissistic absorption of the immigrant into the self based upon their utility. The survivalist politics of the aff can only reduce the immigrant to a means to an end, disposing of what they deem unproductive. Vote negative as an act of unconditional love for the foreign immigrant, recognizing our indebtedness to the other as a force that drives and defines us, and as such exceeds our capacity for sovereign manipulation before the law. </span><br />

The aff’s fear of protectionism is epistemologically bankrupt because they glorify an ideologically insulated Anglo-American system of free trade as the natural way of the world – we must repoliticize alternatives to free trade lest people who do NOT practice free trade become demonized as irrational and expendable.<br />

 1st - the H-1B Heidegger K<br />
Call to expand H1B visas occurs against the backdrop of international “war for talent” solidifying an imperial ontology that demands the rest of the world’s human resources be subject to consumption by American corporations, simultaneously solidifying the disciplinary assumption that every foreign worker should have an innate desire to help the US as the world’s anointed ones.<br />
Tannock, 2009 “White color imperialism: The H-1B debate in America” <em>Social Semiotics</em>, Routledge Vol 19, No 3<br />
This internationalization was driven… remains essentially unchanged. <br />

they no longer serve this purpose.<br />

&quot;Once the world becomes a mere picture... the will must be broken&quot;<br />
<br />
Our alt to the aff’s politics of policing border is occupy the ontological space of the immigrant in permanent exile, which resists the metaphysics of the America project by belonging to neither center nor periphery but frustrating the difference between them. Only an opening up of thought to the ontological potentialities that enframing renders invisible can create the possibility of transcending the stranglehold of imperial praxis. <br />

Their call for cooperation on Bird flu instrumentalizes the virus to domesticate the Chinese other and fetishizes the power of the state to prevent an outbreak by assuming total control of the population.

Finally the Aff enframes education <br />
Our alt to the aff’s politics of policing border is occupy the ontological space of the immigrant in permanent exile, which resists the metaphysics of the America project by belonging to neither center nor periphery but frustrating the difference between them.

Call to expand H1B visas occurs against the backdrop of international “war for talent” solidifying an imperial ontology that demands the rest of the world’s human resources be subject to consumption by American corporations, simultaneously solidifying the disciplinary assumption that every foreign worker should have an innate desire to help the US as the world’s anointed ones.<br />

The border is a permanent… economic and social information. <br />
<br />
Expanding visa eligibility fails and insulates biopolitics because it supplements border management by depicting legal immigration as benign thus diverting international mobility into the manageable avenue of customs obfuscating the agency of the illegal immigrant and it is fixated upon the transcendent sovereignty of visa law while the true decision to admit is an imananent one made by the customs officer and is shaped by disciplinary power<br />
