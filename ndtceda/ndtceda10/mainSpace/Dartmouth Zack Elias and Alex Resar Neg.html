 The United States federal government should substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its employment based, nonimmigrant temporary worker, and human trafficking visas by eliminating the list of communicable diseases of public health significance as grounds for inadmissibility for obtaining a visa. The United States federal government should ban the family based visa.<br />
The affirmative still excludes some people from receiving a family visa. This normalizes liberal notions of the family as natural mask disciplinary power – creates binaries between normal and deviant.<br />

First off, framework – <br />
A. Standards - The affirmative must advocate a topical plan and warrants must be linked to the plan<br />
<br />
Broader philosophical or critical positions are relevant only as they are causally linked to the plan. Plan adoption per se must be sufficient to solve.<br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">B. They don’t advocate a topical plan </span> <span style="display: block; text-align: left;">1. Not federal government. Federal government is the government in Washington</span><br />

<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1. to increase in extent,</span></span> size, volume, scope, etc.: <br />
3. Not visa eligibility and number. These are legal limits<br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">------Topicality is essential for deliberative debate </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">If the affirmative is not tied to a plan and its effects, then there is no limit on their potential advocacy. The negative could never be prepared to debate all the possibilities, and good debate becomes impossible.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">The requirements given thus far are primarily negative AND contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.</span><br />
------Decision calculus becomes unstable without the policy issues<br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Policy debates always involve the stock issues and those are the basis for decisions. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">What are the stock issues in non-policy debates? What are the lines of argument? How are the debates to be decided? Without a basis for argument and decision, debate is impossible.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
----Stable advocacy<br />
Stable advocacy is key to clash. Concrete ideas like a plan can be debated, but their position is amorphous. It can become a moving target that the affirmative can use to avoid clash. Letting the aff endorse actions other than the plan lets them explain away arguments no matter what we say because what constitutes a “security narrative” is arbitrary – this gives them infinite intrinsicness arguments.<br />
--- Balance<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Balanced debate is impossible when we shift to individual and social perspectives – we can’t say “considering other perspectives” or “being a better person” is bad. Their aff justifies mass private actor fiat where they could advocate our all loving one another and living in perfect harmony.</span><br />

Casey’s book makes a learned and comprehensive argument . . . with no indication of direction?”<br />
The 1AC grants you limitless authority for shaping society according to their ethical ideal. Ethical decisionmaking grants you the illusion of omnipotence at a time that we have no ground to stand on. Their discourse of ethics eliminates the need to test epistemology because we only know according to the way they say we <em>ought</em> to know.<br />

Their grounding of political action in an ethical framework creates a totalitarian politics. They produce a command and control ethics with their commitment to shaping society according to first principles.<br />
Dana Richard Villa, <u>Arendt and Heidegger: The Fate of the Political</u> 1996 pp 246-247<br />
Arendt appropriates Heidegger’s genealogy of the technical sense of action . . . modern antithesis of politics.<br />
Our Altnerative: refuse their demand to situate politics within an ethical framework. Embrace your capacity for action and judgment without the authority of ethical grounding. This avoids the totalitarian compulsion to legislate an ethical society into existence<br />

As a political principle, then, authority conflicts with Arendt’s basic . . . metaphysics’ “attributive-participative” schema<br />
