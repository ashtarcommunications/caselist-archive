Here is the caselist for all Louisville novice teams on the affirmative:<br />
<br />
This is a protest against the exclusionary practices and ideologies of the debate community as well as the topic. Our squad's mission statement is to use policy debate to increase effective decision making in a multicultural democracy. We examine the T1 Visa as a policy flawed by the system of whiteness and we defend that the amount of T1 Visas should be increased. <br />
<br />
Here are some of the key authors and arguments we use and the context is the same as what we use in the 1AC.<br />
<br />
David Hall: (Invisibility) &quot;The American Dilemma: The Invisible Tears of Invisible Children.&quot;<br />
Tim Wise: (White Privilege) &quot;White Like Me.&quot;<br />
Peggy MacIntosh: (White Privilege) &quot;White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack.&quot;<br />
Rhonda Magee: (Immigration) &quot;Slavery as Immigration.&quot;<br />
Audrey Thompson: (Whiteness) &quot;Summary of Whiteness Theory.&quot;
