We affirm that the following visas should be expanded by the United States Federal Government to nonsensical infinity: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, and human trafficking-based visas. <br />

Opening the Floodgates by Johnson ‘09, “Immigration restrictions effectively relegate many noncitizens to the lower rungs of a caste-like labor system in the United States. They also perpetuate a worldwide one. Dramatic change is necessary to bring the immigration laws into line with the nation’s moral compass.” <br />
<br />
Aliens and Citizens: The Case for Open Borders by Carens ‘09, “What justifies the use of force against such people? Perhaps borders and guards can be justified as a way of keeping out criminals, subversives, and armed invaders. But most of those trying to get in are not like that. They are ordinary, peaceful people, seeking only the opportunity to build decent, secure lives for themselves and their families. On what moral grounds can these sorts of people be kept out? What gives anyone the right to point guns at them? How can the gatekeepers refuse these people?”<br />
<br />
We are in a world where the border is ruled by gatekeepers who restrict and refuse, refuse those who do not meet a standard, who do not comply with the regulations. Those individuals are socially out casted – forbidden to enter American society and community. <br />

The Chinese Exclusion Act has provided the legal architecture and gatekeeping ideology that regulates legality and illegality, desirability and non-desirability of certain immigrations in the name of the maintenance of the American nation.<br />
Lee 2002, p37 Journal of American Ethnic History, <br />
What becomes clear is ... immigration in general. <br />
<br />
It is through this act of exclusion and gatekeeping that violence is done onto those who are trying to assimilate into communities by entering this country. The act of simply forcing individuals into certain classes of visas is a complete denial of who they are, like they are cattle being prepared to be sold based on their weight classification. They are pushed away and looked down upon if they are different – we have been plagued by this conscience of thinking ourselves as better. <br />
<br />
Identification is not reducible to identity - Visas calcify identity into problematic terms that result in violence done to the subject. <br />

Like the United States, debate is a Gatekeeping Nation. Every debate reinforces assumptions about the proper ways of debating and the proper ways of being debaters by invoking visions and metaphors about “who” belongs to the debate community. <br />

The Disappereance of an Issue in NDT Debate<br />
Morello ’91 Author: Morello, John T. Title: Policy Implementation: The Virtual Disappearance of an Issue in NDT Debate. Pub Date: 2 Nov 91. <br />
“Avoidance of questions ... NDT debate programs.”<br />
<br />
My partner, Paras Minhas, and I started Collegiate Policy Debate last year during my Freshman year of high school. We entered this system of cutting cards, writing D/As, crafting CPs and Plans, only to find that this community, THIS COUNTRY has yet to let us in. We are standing at the border of the Policy Debate Country, trying to enter only to find that there are gatekeepers – individuals who decide who to let in and keep out based upon the amount of cards you cut – the number of arguments that you run, and how fast you can speak. I feel that it is my sense of duty to stand here and say to you all that there is a problem with policy debate today. The ideological gatekeeping of the debate community, which per-determines who the good debaters are, parallels the gatekeeping of the United States which black, yellow and brown bodies as racially inferior and unworthy of acceptance into the American community. What is lost in our narrow minded vision and practice of debate is the material lives of the people the topic effects, and the material lives of ourselves, as debaters, in this room here and now. The worst part is that no one questions – we simply blindly accept this practice like Mindless automatons. <br />

Oppressors Use the Banking Concept of Education to maintain status quo, and mute change or effective dialogue – THIS IS NECROPHILIC.<br />
Freire ’09 (Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Pg. 73-74)<br />
It is not surprising ... has been disturbed.&quot; <br />
<br />
This is why we need to change the country of policy debate so that is becomes more user-friendly. So that the banking concept of education is no longer prevalent – so that people can express themselves – not conform otherwise we lose touch with reality and lose practical educational utility. Two things must happen:<br />
<br />
1) Debate must lose the techno-strategic discourse that it has right now with the premise that Policy Debate’s purpose is to educate<br />
2) Impacts and the consequences of arguments must become more materialistic, to have concrete aspects that apply to who we are here and now<br />
<br />
It is only through these processes that we can eliminate the gatekeeping aspects of Policy Debate and allow debate immigrants – such as Paras Minhas and myself into the community. The debate community mimics the way that American nationhood is established via the construction of borders and immigration policy that determines who are the right kinds of immigrants, the right kinds of potential members of the community. The Narrative style of traditional debate hijacks real conversation about material realities of the folks the topic is about (immigrants) via techno-strategic discourse, and apocalyptic scenarios.<br />

Searching for global solutions facilitates dehumanization and makes hegemonic violence inevitable<br />

Is it Too Late to Save Policy Debate? <br />
Herbeck ’89 Herbeck, Dale A. Nov ’89 Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the Speech Communication Association (75th, San Francisco, CA, November 18-21, 1989). <br />
“Experienced debaters have ... little educational utility.” <br />
<br />
Think about what this means. Those new to policy debate have to conform to fictitious arguments – arguments that lack reasonable results. Policy debaters do not look for practical arguments – they look for ones that have the most devastating impacts in the most apocalyptic scenarios– the human race is going to become extinct – the world as we know it will end. There is no need to be stuck in this fictitious world of impractical impacts and scenarios. This whole process of people repeating what happens using the same strategies to win and judges allowing this to happen creates a static system – a system of oppression that just maintains the status-quo and is necrophilic and is what leads to tyrannical violence. People conform to tyrants. Why must we conform to techno-strategic discourse? Today we welcome nonconformists in the debate community and the United States to stop this gatekeeping. Allow future members of the community to be themselves. Alterity needs to cease. Legitimate and realistic debate arguments need to be made. Critical thinking, the act of actually addressing issues with materialistic and practical solutions, needs to happen in order for individuals to keep their identities. <br />
<br />
Habermas ‘66, page 23, On the Pragmatics of Communication<br />
<br />
I shall develop ... to one another.<br />
<br />
In our current form of policy debate – we fail to have a “mutuality of reciprocal comprehension” – making debate illegitimate and unrealistic. Nothing can happen if we are stuck in this limbo of comprehension – if individuals are forced to conform in order to be accepted by the policy debate community. That is why we solve for both debate community and for immigrants – interrogating the gatekeeping ideology of nation building opens space for reconceptualizing the meaning and effects of immigration policy and border making for immigrants and the nation, thereby revealing the racist and classist underpinnings of American immigration policy. Likewise, interrogating the gatekeeping at work in the debate community exposes the processes by which we determine legal and illegal debaters and the effects for our community, our friends, and ourselves. Stop gatekeeping at the border and debate keeping here right and now.
