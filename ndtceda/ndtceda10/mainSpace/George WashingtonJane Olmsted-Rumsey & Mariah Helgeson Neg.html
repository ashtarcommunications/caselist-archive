Citizenship K 1NC (1/3)<br />
A. Link-- The aff has bought into the double discourse of citizenship—while they see admission and citizenship as universalizing, not all citizens are equally included in the national polity. The result is to reify an exclusionary notion of citizenship which justifies an interventionist paradigm and precipitated the war on terror<br />
Brandzel 05 (Amy, candidate in feminist studies at the University of Minnesota, A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, “Queering Citizenship? Same-sex Marriage and the State”, 11.2, p. 171-204http:<em>muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_lesbian_and_gay_studies/v011/11.2brandzel.html)</em><br />
<em>Calls for citizenship have often been universalizing…that presupposes universality and therefore exacerbates and negates difference. [End Page 176]</em><br />
<br />
<em>B. Impact—Modern citizenship rests on the basis of a logic of national security that not only securitizes the foreign “other”, in other words the immigrant, but also justifies the extension of political control over the domestic population—this was the justification both for domestic racism and international imperialism</em><br />
<em>Kaygusuz, assistant professor of international relations at Mersin University in Turkey, 2006. (Ozlem, “THE CITIZENSHIP DEBATE OF THE 2000s IN PERSPECTIVE: SECURITIZED CITIZENSHIP AND THE MODERN DILEMMA,” The Turkish Yearbook, Vol. XXXVII, 2006, p. 41-61 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/44/679/8640.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://dergiler.ankara.edu.tr/dergiler/44/679/8640.pdf</a>)</em><br />
<br />
<em>The above analysis clarified that historically, the …reproduction of the citizenship as a state identity?</em><br />
<br />
<em>C. The alternative—Reject the aff to prevent the extension of heteronormative conceptions of citizenship.</em><br />
<br />
<em>D. The alternative solves-- Redefinition of queer citizenship is piecemeal and insufficient—we must expressly oppose ideas of citizenship in order to undermine citizenship’s production of heteronormativity—location outside the state is necessary to break down the boundary maintenance of citizenship</em><br />
