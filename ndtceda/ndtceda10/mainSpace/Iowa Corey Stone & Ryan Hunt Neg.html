<strong>Precision – Theoretic or philosphical definitions are more precise than reportative definitions.</strong><br />
Hospers, '97 (Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Southern California, An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis, pp. 15-16)<br />
Reportive definitions. But most definitions of words AND he attempted to find the definition of justice.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Reportative definitions are too vague &amp; ambiguous -- undermines precision.</strong><br />

Most of the time when encountering a definition AND and that is rife with vagueness and ambiguity.<br />
<br />
<strong>Theoretic definitions – looking for the “true” definition of a word – are always by their nature more precise than reportive definitions since they aim for a more precise meaning to language.</strong><br />

Lack of clarity in meaning can hinder good AND of most animals would not qualify as language.<br />
