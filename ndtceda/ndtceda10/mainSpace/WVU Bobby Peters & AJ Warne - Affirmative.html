<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In Tanzania primarily, and growing throughout the continent of Africa, Albinos are hunted for the skin, blood, bones, limbs, hair, and genitals. This hunting transcends age and many children have been found dead in the recent months. This problem is growing in scope and sophistication; despite actions by local law enforcement and international organizations the body-count is still on the rise. Albinos in Africa, estimated to count upwards of 150,000 are constantly persecuted and live in fear of their lives. </span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Over 10,000 Albinos have gone into hiding in East Africa fearing for their lives. The International Red Cross and Crescent report that the vulnerability of Albinos in Africa needs to be addressed at once. Albinos that are not hunted are still grossly discriminated against, believed to be bad omens, retarded, and are highly susceptible to sun damage</span> <br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Despite actions taken by NGO’s such as the International Red Cross and Under the Same Sun, the hunting and mutilation of albino African’s is still rising. The attacks have spread from Tanzania and Burundi to the Congo, Swaziland, Guinea, and South Africa. Thousands have fled villages for the urban areas but are still not safe. The estimated number and prevailance of attacks is said to be far lower than the actual account and many attacks are not reported to government agencies. </span> <br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Plan:</strong> the United States Federal Government should exempt foreign nationals with oculotaneous albinism, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and/or ocular albinism from all immigration standards and requirements for the 8 U.S.C. § 1101 with exception to P.L 106-386 § 1513 (b)(3)(U)(I)(2000) and P.L 106-386 § 1513 (b)(3)(U)(III)(2000). </span> <br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Advantage 1 is Dehumanization</strong></span> <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">These individuals are otherized by society from the day they are born, which inevitably leads to dehumanization. This dehumanization occurring in Africa and throughout the world is the largest impact in this round. We must value each and every human life regardless of disease, ignoring the persecution of albinos will lead to the zero-point of the Holocaust. This means you must vote Affirmative in order to end the dehumanization of life. </span> <br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>Advantage 2 is Rape</strong></span> <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In Zimbabwe, Albinos are discriminated against in every instance; furthermore there is a very high instance of rape in Albino women by HIV positive men, believing that it will cure them. Furthermore, Albinos are unable to live as long as other Africans because of the susceptibility to the harshness of the African sun. This inability to escape the torture of the sun that shortens their lives tremendously is a horrible predicament that often ends in fatal skin cancer. </span> <br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Our Solvency is two-fold.</span> <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">First, The way that we construct the knowledge of particular phenomena is essential for the development of remedial courses of action. Our discourse is what constitutes material objects and subjects in the real world. Thus, the first part of our plan engages in a discourse that presupposes the concrete action embodied by our plan test</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Moreover, our discourse helps to minimize the danger of imposing one’s own subjective vision of social events, thus enabling a better handling of violent systems of exclusion and subjugation. </span> <br />
