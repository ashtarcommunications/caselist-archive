We’ll start with evidence about our framework. We are appealing to the in-round ability to make change as our starting point. We can debate external change agents without assuming we are them or have their resources.</span><br />

What do we do with the woman with no face, And the man with no name<br />
What do we do with the people who all look the same<br />
What do we do with the children with no future, Shining in their eyes<br />
What do we do with their silent whispers and cries<br />
<br />
Do we embrace them<br />
Do we try<br />
Or do we just turn them away<br />
As we reach for our skies<br />
<br />
What do we do with the poets and the priests, And the messages they preach<br />
What do we do with the dreamers and the dreams they dream<br />
What do we do with all the ordinary folk, And the truths that they speak<br />
What do we do with the judgments made by the weak<br />
<br />
Do we embrace them<br />
Do we try<br />
Or do we just turn them away<br />
As we reach for our skies.<br />
What do we do. . .<br />

<br />
Observation One: Framing the Status Quo.<br />
<br />
Our framework begins with the importance of rhetorical strategy.<br />
Lisa A. Flores Ph.D Professor of Communication University of Utah. (2003) ). Crafting rhetorical borders: Peons, illegal aliens, and competing narratives of immigrations. Critical Studies in Media Communication, 20, 362-387.<br />
To a degree, scholars …that process.<br />
<br />
These narratives cannot continue to be molded into a platform of exclusion through a process of governmentality. Engaging in these arrangements from the perspective of a debater—a debater debating—has the potential to disrupt the traditional flows of capital. Ron Greene, Prof. of Communication at Minnesota, explains in 2006 (Greene, Prof. Comm. U. Minnesota, 06 (“Orator Communist”, Ronald Walter, Philosophy and Rhetoric 39.1 (2006) 85-95) :<br />
Since it is the…enforced by the state.<br />
There are many forms of visas—some cost money and are restricted, others spend money and are restricted. Life takes visa. The “visa as an entrance pass” and the “visa as a credit card” deserve temporary conflation.<br />
<br />
Lysacker, U. Oregon, ’08 (John, “Life Takes Visa” The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, New Series, Volume 22, Number 2, 2008, pp. 71-81<br />
<br />
More Than Once in a Lifetime, I'm Afraid ….sign here.<br />
Lysacker continues…<br />
some human (and more than human) lives.<br />
Thus, that’s why we offer our planning, our advocacy:<br />
<br />
We are resolved that…..<br />
<br />
the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of, and substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for, its category-based visas for all those seeking entrance, regardless of any category-specific beneficiary restrictions on eligibility.<br />
<br />
Observation Two: VOTE AFF for VISAS.<br />
A visa is not the same type of legal document many assume it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Orchowski, '08 (Margaret, Phd, VP of programs of the natl. democratic women's foundation, _Immigration and the American Dream_, p53)<br />
<br />
&quot;Before going into the details of allowed to enter.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Visa for Avalon extends our metaphorical defense of the visa into literary criticism.<br />
<br />
Freedman, Concordia U., ’05 (Ariela, reviewing Bryher’s Visa for Avalon in Modernism/modernity, Volume 12, Number 3, September 2005, pp. 523-525)<br />
<br />
In her memoir of World War II,<br />
<br />
Fighting this apathy, we contend that the Visa application symbolizes the hopes for escape that are never quite realized. Making this pass more available might rewrite the story to add cautious optimism to a dystopian inevitability.<br />
<br />
Freedman, Concordia U., ’05 (Ariela, reviewing Bryher’s Visa for Avalon in Modernism/modernity, Volume 12, Number 3, September 2005, pp. 523-525)<br />
<br />
<br />
The two main characters … for their emigration.<br />
<br />
<br />
The implication is the root of violence and containing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jacques Derrida, 88 (“Afterword” in Limited Inc.,, p112)<br />
<br />
What are the roots—outside the university.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Our Third Observation is POLITICS—how our framework arguments coalesce.<br />
<br />
we can finally advocate the roots of a critique of capitalism, encouraging debate as a technology of citizenship to move away from the shallow push for &quot;deliberative citizenship&quot; and toward the more radical outpouring of the orator communist.<br />
<br />
Ronald Greene continues in 2006 (Greene, Prof. Comm. U. Minnesota, 06 (“Orator Communist”, Ronald Walter, Philosophy and Rhetoric 39.1 (2006) 85-95)<br />
<br />
Just as one must approach …of the multitude.3<br />
<br />
<br />
We stand resolved in defense of our plan as debater-scholars advocating the tropological effects of our statement. We live on one planet, in one world… We must be uncompromising on this point.<br />
<br />
Badiou, Ethicist, ’08 (Alain. The Meaning of Sarkozy. London: Verso Publishing, 2008. Pg.)<br />
The problem then has to be reversed. …women and men.'
