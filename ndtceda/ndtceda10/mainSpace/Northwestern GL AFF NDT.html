<strong>2AC Case</strong><br />
Our call to help Iraqi refugees is effective – even if we can’t change or know every situation we can take a stance – turns their suffering K and the perm solves<br />
CJC 2 (Canadian journal of Communication, Book review of Distant Suffering by Luc Boltanski)<br />
Inherent in the…in political communication.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>2AC Baudrillard</strong><br />
Representing the suffering of others motivates action<br />
Linklater 7, Distant Suffering and Cosmopolitan Obligations, International Politics (2007) 44, 19-36<br />
There has been…become cosmopolitan emotions<br />
<br />
Information overload arg is wrong – high volume of information doesn’t render it meaningless, and information is not consumed uniformly by mass society – it’s diffused, meaning individuals and social groups can accurately proves and employ information they consume for pragmatic political reforms<br />
Turner 94 – “Baudrillard for Sociologists,” in Forget Baudrillard? 2004 edition p.80-83<br />
While, as far…and formal politics<br />
<br />
Their passivity is just another form of ineffective politics – even worse, when combined with skepticism about our ability to influence social change, it’s tantamount to giving up on the possibility of social transformation altogether<br />
Robinson 4 “Baudrillard, Zizek and Laclau on “common sense” – a critique”<br />
Baudrillard thinks his…outside such claims<br />
<br />
Probing beyond appearances is necessary for developing an effective response against suffering and oppression – we need to reform the policymaking instuttions that are behind the production of simulation<br />
Best 97 The Postmodern Turn, pp. 112-113<br />
Hence, we subscribe…certain alternative realities.<br />
<br />
Their hyper-reality thesis overly generalizes the completeness of illusion and hyper-reality – since it is impossible to verify whether or not there has been a total break from all past forms of social relations we should discount their claims that our representations are meaningless<br />
Timothy W. Luke 91 Power and politics in hyperreality: The critical project of Jean Baudrillard, Social Science Journal, Vol. 28 Issue 3<br />
Baudrillard’s critical project…carefully considered evidence<br />

Academic research and arguments produced on the question of citizenship can have transformative effects on policymaking, but only if methodologically and empirically sound<br />
