Observation 2: Framewhat? <br />
<br />
Agency is a critical question in the context of the 1AC. In entering this community, we have been asked to act in certain ways, to accept a model subject position that learns certain practices and acts in ways deemed appropriate by other judges, teams and spectators. Instead of taking on the generic, neutral, and detached “policy-maker” role, we maneuver around this position and take on our own agency. Such acts offer the only hope for productive resistance and reformulation of our subjectivity. <br />

<br />
<u>The rhetorical maneuver is a ...</u> <strong>movement of subjectivity that I now turn.</strong><br />
<br />
The treatment of debate as a space where discourses can be bounded for 'the good of the community' destroys debate-- the language dies as it becomes rusted shut, unable to see its own censorship <br />
<br />
We must all be responsible for the ways we use knowledge and language- when knowledge becomes fiated, we lose the ability to make new arguments – means debate is already dead <br />
