Parker, Bush and Lane ‘6 (“OVERVIEW OF DIAZ FAMILY IMMIGRATION SITUATION”, DATED: At Portland, Oregon, this 11th day of November 2006. Respectfully submitted, PARKER, BUSH &amp; LANE, P.C. We assist in preparation of all temporary visa petitions and applications for permanent residence. Our clients include Fortune 500 high tech and biotech companies as well as small entities and individuals. In 1994 our immigration litigation department successfully presented the first ever deportation case raising the issue of female genital mutilation as a defense to deportation. Since then we have developed a reputation for outstanding achievement in litigating complex deportation and removal cases. We work with companies in all areas of immigration planning and document compliance, including I-9 and H-1B Labor Condition Applications.. We keep pace with constantly changing immigration laws and ever increasing client demand by conducting ongoing review of pending immigration legislation, analyzing new rules and regulations, and by integrating cutting-edge technology in our daily operations. All of our immigration attorneys are members in good standing of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.<br />
