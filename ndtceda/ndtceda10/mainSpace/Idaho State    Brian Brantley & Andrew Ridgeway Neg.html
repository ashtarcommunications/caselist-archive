PIC out of the resolution<br />
<br />
-Statism makes a moral course of action impossible to determine, it represses and dehumanizes us.<br />
(Chris Matthew Sciabarra '95)<br />
<br />
-The state co-opts resistance to keep itself in power.<br />
(Henderson, Spring, 99, Lynne, Indiana Law Journal, &quot;Authoritarianism and the Rule of Law&quot;<br />
<br />
-Hiding state oppression may provide temporary gains, but prevents true rebellion and freedom from state hierarchies. <br />
(Iain McKay, &quot;The Anarchist FAQ&quot;, 7-19-00)<br />
<br />
-Government forcing freedom is paradoxical and cannot accomplish. Direct action is critical. <br />
(Same as above)<br />
<br />
<br />
F/W--must affirm the resolution<br />
-Schively <br />
<br />
GUILT/PITY<br />
<br />
-Equality is the homogenization of difference.<br />
-You commodify the other like a t-shirt. <br />
-Oppression is situation, standing with the oppressed is impossible. <br />
-Guilt is imperialism. <br />
-Guilt produces no action.<br />
-Pity is hatred. <br />
-Pity is the revulsion of the other<br />
<br />
All of these are BRUCKNER '86 (Pascal, &quot;Tears of the White Man&quot;, 1986)
