 In the height of McCarthy-era xenophobia and the “gay” panic being led J. Edgar Hoover the Senate drafted immigration legislation to protect true Americans from the constant threat of psychopathic sexual deviants.<br />
Senator McCarran led the crusade arguing for more exclusions more protections for real American citizens.<br />
The McCarran-Walter Act of 1952 establishes homosexuality and all manner of sexual perversion as “psychopathic personalities.” If the INS could illicit a confession of sexual deviance including homosexual acts prior to entry into the US they could revoke a visa and deport the person. The eligibility requirement was created to prohibit the entrance of gay individuals into the United States.<br />
BOUTILIER v. IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE No. 440 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES 387 U.S. 118; 87 S. Ct. 1563; 18 L. Ed. 2d 661; 1967 U.S. LEXIS 1400 March 14, 1967, Argued May 22, 1967, Decided<br />
SUMMARY: The petitioner… &quot;afflicted&quot; with homosexuality.<br />
<br />
The 1952 Act influenced statutory law through the 1980s creating explicit exclusions, conflating medical and legal discourse, and establishing legal precedent in the Supreme Court. As the law changed and the exclusions shifted – confession became an important tool of marking sexual deviants for deportation.<br />

<br />
Thus Dylan and I advocate the following counter-factual plan:<br />
<br />
PLAN: &lt;PLAN READ IN THE DEBATE HAS BEEN LOST, BUT SOMETHING ABOUT NOT PASSING MCCARRAN-WALTER&gt;<br />
<br />
The counter-factual is not a perfect advocacy. It is not a utopian solution to exclusion or visa policies. A counter-factual advocacy allows us to examine how discourses and policies created as a result of the McCarran-Walter Act influences immigration policy today and how visa policy and socio-cultural understandings of queerness could be different.<br />
<br />
Douglas’s dissenting opinion highlights some of the ways legal precedent could have changed…<br />
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, … members of legislative bodies.&quot; 363 F.2d 488, 497-498.<br />
<br />
It didn’t have to be this way – the legacy of the 1952 act haunts the modern visa system. Applicants are forced to properly perform sexuality. Re-contemplating the history of eligibility through the lens of sexuality and the 1952 Act opens up space for queer understanding of citizenship and provides a cautionary tale about how the marking of certain bodies as threats to the system create a moral panic.<br />
