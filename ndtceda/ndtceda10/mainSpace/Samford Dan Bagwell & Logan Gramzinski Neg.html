Immigrant Eligibility Restrictions…<u>also may secure federal benefits.</u><br />

B. Violation – the plan makes more people eligible, not the benefits themselves <br />
<br />
C. Reasons to Prefer <br />
1. Limits – infinite different number of groups they could affect are impossible to predict- we need a manageable set of cases <br />
2. Ground – nothing links to minute changes in making people eligible, making someone who isn’t eligible for a benefit eligible, however, is controversial and drains resources <br />

The Standing Commission should recommend to Congress that the USFG should, pursuant to the Special Immigrant Visa programs for Iraqi and Afghan nationals, extend eligibility to people who have worked for nongovernmental organizations or private implementing partners funded by the United States government through grants and cooperative agreements and to people who claim, in response to questioning, that they face imminent danger, in the absence of evidence to the contrary subject to other provisions of the Special Immigrant Visa program and other requirements of United States Code. <br />

Immigrant Eligibility Restrictions. Categories of Immigrants: “Qualified” and “Not Qualified” <u>The 1996 welfare law created two categories of immigrants for benefits eligibility purposes: “qualified” and “not qualified.” Contrary to what these names suggest, the law excluded most people in both groups from <em>eligibility</em> for many benefits,</u> with a few excep-tions. The qualified immigrant category includes: • Lawful permanent residents, or LPRs (persons with green cards). • Refugees, persons granted asylum or withholding of deportation/removal, and conditional entrants. • Persons granted parole by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for a period of at least one year. • Cuban and Haitian entrants. • Certain abused immigrants, their children, and/or their parents.4 • Certain victims of trafficking.5 All other immigrants, including undocumented immigrants as well as many persons lawfully present in the U.S., are considered “not qualified.” 6 <u>In 2000, Congress established a new category of noncitizens, <em>victims of trafficking,</em> who are eligible for federal public benefits to the same extent as refugees, regardless of whether they have a “qualified” immigrant status.7 In 2003, Congress clarified that “derivative beneficiaries” listed on trafficking victims’ visa applications(spouses and children of adult trafficking victims; spouses, children, parents, and minor siblings of child victims) also may secure federal benefits.</u><br />
<br />
B. Violation – The plan makes one of an infinite number of changes to a visa - expanding admissibility to an infinite number of people and not eligibility for benefits <br />
C. Reasons to Prefer <br />
1. Predictable Limits – it is impossible for the negative to prepare for all the changes that can be made to each visa to allow more people into the country – establishing a predictable standard of increasing federal benefits for visa holders ties the resolution together into a manageable set of cases <br />
2. Ground – Nothing links to minute changes in making people who aren’t eligible for a visa eligible, making someone who isn’t eligible for a benefit eligible, however, is controversial and drains resources <br />
D. Topicality is always a voting issue – evaluate it through competing interpretations <br />

<br />
The term &quot;to increase substantially&quot; in claim 1 of the '705 patent refers to the claimed increase achieved by the invention in the relative productivity of the catalyst used in the Fischer-Tropsch process. <u>The specification defines &quot;substantially increased&quot;</u> catalyst activity or productivity <u>as an increase of at least about 30%,</u> more preferably an increase of about 50%, and still more preferably an increase of about 75%. '705 patent, col. 1, ll. 59-63. Based on that language from the specification, the trial court found, and the parties agree, that <u>the term &quot;to increase substantially&quot; requires an increase of at least about 30% in the relative productivity of the catalyst</u>. Notwithstanding that numerical boundary, the trial court found the phrase &quot;to increase substantially&quot; to be indefinite because the court concluded that there were two possible ways to calculate the increase in productivity, the subtraction method and the division method, and the patent did not make clear which of those ways was used in the claim. <br />

<br />
IF WINTER in America is cold, then spring seems full of angst, a brewing portentousness, like an impregnated sky ahead of a thunderstorm. The needle on the nation's psychic barometer has swung to threatening, attuned to intensifying signs of unrest in a political climate that is drawing gun-toting protesters on to the streets, has sent regard for government to new lows and prompted a dire warning from a former president that someone could get hurt <u>possibly even the present White House incumbent. Paranoia abounds, as if the election of Barack Obama 18 months ago signalled the end of American liberty, to be replaced by a rising socialism and increasingly intrusive Big Government.</u> And the coalescing of a wide range of issues <u>not least economic torpor and its inherent social upheaval</u> is playing into the hands of extremists, whose anti-government rhetoric is beginning to echo that which pervaded the country in the lead-up to the bombing of the federal government offices in Oklahoma City <u>in 1995.</u> &quot;We are in the midst of one of the most significant right-wing populist rebellions in U<u>nited</u> S<u>tates</u> history,<u>&quot; according to Chip Berlet, of the progressive think-tank Political Research Associates. &quot;</u>We see around us a series of overlapping social and political movements populated by people [who are] angry, resentful and full of anxiety. They are raging against the machinery of the federal bureaucracy and liberal government programs, and policies including healthcare, reform of immigration and labour laws, abortion and gay marriage.&quot; <u>The anti-tax, anti-government Tea Party movement is one thing, encouraged by opinion polls that suggest that the American people's trust of their politicians and their political system is at its lowest ebb since the early years of the Clinton administration (just 20 per cent), while 92 per cent want smaller government. But at its core, the Tea Party is essentially a movement of disaffected, white, middle-class Republicans re-energised by the Democrats' control of Congress and the White House, and who can be expected to influence the choice of Republican candidates in the lead-up to November's mid-term Congressional elections.</u> Yet the Tea Party's public dissent has resonated with a more extreme fringe racist and white supremacist groups, anarchists and the like eager to foment rebellion, and with their number rising across the landscape. According to the non-profit civil rights organisation Southern Poverty Law Centre, 360 new &quot;patriot&quot; groups emerged in 2009<u>, taking the total beyond 500,</u> including 127 militias. <br />

<u>WMD Thresholds</u><br />
<br />
Attacks have already occurred Chemical, biological and nuclear materials have been obtained, tested and deployed Thresholds are a thing of the past to right-wing terrorists<u>Weapons of mass destruction</u> (WMD) have been a constant theme in right-wing terrorist rhetoric for decades. <u>The Turner Diaries, a novel which has repeatedly served as a strategy manual of domestic terrorists, was published in May, 1978. It is now in its seventh printing and there are roughly 200,000 copies in circulation.</u> Domestic right-wing terrorists are and have been the most active, violent and deadly terrorist threat to American lives and property. Mortality due to domestic terrorist actions in the previous decade numbered in the hundreds. That figure roughly doubled this decade. The next decade may see casualties measured in thousands. <u>The seizure of a 30-gallon drum of sodium cyanide at The Covenant, The Sword and The Arm of the Lord in April 1985 provided clear evidence of WMD intentions and capabilities by domestic right-wing groups.</u> Since that time, there have been incidents involving most of the categories of WMD: large-scale explosives, chemical, biological and nuclear materials. Right-wing terrorists are innovators and early adopters of new techniques and tactics. They are quite skilled at low-tech operations and have been constrained by lack of resources. <u>The Oklahoma City bombing was done for the price of two used cars.</u> If Timothy McVeigh and his collaborators had been able to obtain more resources, the bomb would have been bigger. <br />

<u>Of all the weapons of mass destruction,</u> the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth<u>. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories.</u>  While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth <u>and severely compromise the health of future generations,</u> they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated<u>.</u> There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be<u>stolen or</u> accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause<u>.  Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over.</u> With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end<u>. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever.</u>  Potentially worse than that, bio-engineered agents by the hundreds with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine<u>.

<u>Polls measure current sentiment, not future behavior.</u> The current public mood is obviously toxic for the incumbent party, and the polls reflect that. <u>But most people - devoted as they are to living their lives, getting their children back to school, watching America's Got Talent - have barely begun to focus on the midterm races.</u> <u>Democrats still have time to get a fair hearing, and to frame this election - not as a referendum on Obama, but as a choice between Obama's party and the party that flamed out in 2006 and 2008. More money, better organization. The House Democratic campaign committee has a 2-1 cash advantage over its GOP counterpart. That means more money for TV ads, and more money for the ground game</u> (knocking on doors, cajoling people to go to the polls). Meanwhile, the <u>D</u>emocratic <u>N</u>ational <u>C</u>ommittee, having <u>absorbed Obama's</u> Organizing for America <u>campaign operation, is spending lavishly to methodically target the 15 million people who chose Obama while voting for the first time in 2008</u>. <u>By contrast, the R</u>epublican <u>N</u>ational <u>C</u>ommittee - <u>once feared in Democratic circles for its turnout prowess - is a disaster zone, thanks to the ineptitude of chairman</u> Michael <u>Steele</u>. GOP operatives have been trying to work around him, a move akin to political bypass surgery, but the Democrats remain stronger on the ground. <u>Obama in Truman mode. Yeah, the president's general popularity has plummeted since the inauguration, but he's still the party's best hope for juicing the liberal base</u>. If the base stays home on Election Day (apparently demoralized by all that Obama has thus far failed to achieve), the voting will be dominated by angry conservatives (who think that Obama has been too liberal, or &quot;socialist,&quot; or whatever). That's what happened in 1994: Newt's army showed up; Clinton's base did not. <u>Twice in the last week, Obama was feisty on the stump: &quot;Do we return to the same failed policies that ran our economy into a ditch, or do we keep moving forward with policies that are slowly pulling us out?</u> . . . It's still fear vs. hope, the past vs. the future. It's still a choice between sliding backward and moving forward. That's what this election is about.&quot; It's easy to poke holes in that kind of rhetoric (note the caveat about how his policies are &quot;slowly&quot; pulling us out of recession), but <u>it's solely aimed at persuading grassroots Democrats to shake off their torpor.</u> <u>They just might, if Obama can</u> shelve his cerebral vibe and <u>sustain a give-'em-hell spirit for the next 51 days</u>. (Big if.) <u>The other party is even worse. Republicans have successfully surfed the public's anger and frustration over the economy, but the polls consistently show that the congressional GOP is broadly unpopular. That gives Democrats an autumn opening to sow fresh doubts about the out party, to tag the GOP as a party with no new ideas</u> - except, perhaps, for the fringe sentiments expressed by its ascendant tea party faction. (Alaska GOP senatorial candidate Joe Miller insists, for instance, that jobless benefits are &quot;not constitutionally authorized.&quot; That may unnerve the millions who've been socked by the recession, but it certainly qualifies as a new idea.) Republicans keep promising to unveil a governing agenda; so far, nothing. Their economic prescriptions are simple: Extend the Bush tax cuts for the rich, and oppose whatever Obama wants to do - including various tax credits for small businesses, a proposal they have long supported, at least until Obama suggested it. As the president quipped on the stump Monday: &quot;If I say the sky is blue, they say no. If I say fish live in the sea, they say no.&quot; In fact, Obama and the Democratic candidates can rightfully highlight this dearth of GOP ideas, because even some conservative thinkers have confirmed it. <u>As former Bush speechwriter</u> David <u>Frum noted</u> the other day: &quot;<u>For 24 months, an emotionally intense opposition to the president has been unsupported by anything like a Republican policy agenda. . . . Republicans have done insufficient serious policy work over the past half-dozen years. The legacy of this inactivity is a party on the brink of power, lacking an intellectual framework for the use of that power.&quot;</u><br />

<u>Immigration is</u> also <u>likely to split the party along both ideological and geographic lines</u>. “<u>It would show fissures</u>,” said Rep. Jason Altmire (D-Pa.). For Altmire, voting no on comprehensive immigration reform is a no-brainer. “It’s not a tough vote for me at all. I’m not going to vote for amnesty,” he said. That pits him against the Congressional Hispanic Caucus — and against other vulnerable Democrats in districts with significant Hispanic populations, like Rep.

Senator Lindsey <u>Graham</u> (R-SC), initially a strong proponent of the climate change legislation, <u>has recently withdrawn his support, signaling that the difficulties in passing the bill will continue to mount</u>. Graham cited two main reasons for his change in opinion - the language of the APA in regards to offshore drilling, and the Democrat's decision to pursue immigration reform instead of climate change, which he believes has &quot;greatly compromised&quot; the legislation. Coupled with the ongoing oil spill, Graham believes that there is growing opposition among Senate Democrats that has now made passing the bill &quot;impossible.&quot; <u>Graham's predictions have already been supported by three Senate Democrats, Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Bill Nelson of Florida, who have threatened to withhold their support if offshore drilling is not dropped from the bill.</u> Notwithstanding the tense political climate in Washington<u>, the</u> Senate recently passed the controversial financial regulatory reform bill on May 20, 2010, giving some supporters of the APA hope that momentum can be harnessed to advance the bill before the summer break. <u>If this does not occur, with the looming November mid-term elections threatening the loss of Democratic representation in the Senate, it may be more difficult to get the 60 votes required to pass the bill next year.</u><br />

Another useful measure would be a carbon tax — or its approximate equivalent, <u>a cap-and-trade system</u> — scheduled for a gradual phase-in after the economy has again reached full employment. This <u>would stimulate an immediate, huge jump in private investment without the government having to spend a penny</u>. Why? <u>Investment is currently depressed because companies can already produce much more than people want to buy</u><u>.</u> But once a carbon tax was announced, the design of nearly every existing machine or structure that uses or produces energy would be rendered suddenly obsolete. Motor vehicle engines, electric power plants, refrigerators, air-conditioners, furnaces — all would have to be redesigned for greater efficiency. The resulting flood of research and investment would enhance our ability to cope with future energy shortages and would serve another crucial purpose. <u>Taxing carbon could eliminate the catastrophic risk of vastly rising global temperatures</u> by the end of this century; it would be a prudent act, quite apart from its utility as an economic stimulus. The tax would generate no revenue until its phase-in, so it wouldn’t reduce the current deficit. But deficits are a long-run problem, and its enactment alone would increase creditors’ confidence that we are committed to solving it. <br />

A) Link: Open immigration policies reaffirm the US as a shining city of tolerance and individual autonomy while creating the savage other: <br />
McKinley 2009 – Assistant Professor, University of Oregon School of Law, (Michelle A., Fall, “Cultural Culprits”, 24 Berkeley J. Gender L. &amp; Just. 91, Lexis Law) <br />
Although FGM has been criminalized by statute since 1996, State v. Adem is the first case involving a criminal conviction in a U.S. court. However, the [*107] scholarly attention to the issue of female genital cutting is extensive. n85 Adem and Nabulwala raise important questions for multicultural debates that voice concerns about the internal vulnerability of sub-groups - notably women, children, and sexual minorities within immigrant communities. n86 The varying uses of &quot;culture&quot; by feminists, universalists, and relativists (and the contested visions of &quot;culture&quot; that surface inside and outside of the courtroom) illuminates its multivalence. Nabulwala's case is part of an emerging trend in asylum jurisprudence that narrowly recognizes persecution on the grounds of sexual orientation as it is linked with social group membership. n87 Sexual orientation cases like Nabulwala's perform a related though distinct function to Adem or Kasinga. Extreme African homophobia, as opposed to diffident acceptance (don't ask, don't tell) distinguishes the United States as an enlightened, tolerant society vis-a-vis barbaric, intolerant Africa. Crackpot evangelical homophobia (of the Fred Phelps vintage) is still too marginal to de-center the genteel distaste of the heteronormative mainstream. As Wendy Brown notes: In the mid-nineteenth through mid-twentieth centuries, the West imagined itself as standing for civilization against primitivism, and in the cold war years [*108] for freedom against tyranny; now these two recent histories are merged in the warring figures of the free, the tolerant, and the civilized on one side, and the fundamentalist, the intolerant, and the barbaric on the other. n88 In another, somewhat unrelated vein, Bonnie Honig has pointed out the rejuvenating role that the &quot;foreigner&quot;plays in democratic debates. n89 Indeed, liberal democracy depends on new recruits to assuage doubts about persistent poverty and gendered and racialized inequalities among the domestic poor. n90 In the context of asylum and refugee protection, I argue that the claims brought by cultural refugees like Fauziya Kasinga, n91 Olivia Nabulwala, and Salimatou Bah succeed because they appeal to the host nation's normative ideals of citizenship, tolerance, and individual autonomy while reaffirming widely held ideas about the differences between &quot;our society and theirs.&quot; n92 Women seeking refuge based on the cultural practices of their social group are racialized &quot;others&quot; whose rescue is effectuated without great monetary cost to the United States and with extraordinary political benefits. To paraphrase Achille Mbembe, Africa constitutes a powerful metaphor through which the West asserts its difference from the rest of the world - its apologetic concerns and its exclusionary and brutal practices towards others. n93 <br />
<br />
B) These portrayals justify 21st century wars based on a crusader mentality: <br />
McKinley 2009 – Assistant Professor, University of Oregon School of Law, (Michelle A., Fall, “Cultural Culprits”, 24 Berkeley J. Gender L. &amp; Just. 91, Lexis Law) <br />
The issue of cultural essentialism in asylum jurisprudence inevitably entailed a renewed look at female genital cutting - a task I approached with considerable reluctance. In this post-CEDAW n37, Cairo+14, Beijing+15, gender-mainstreamed moment, it seemed unduly regressive to examine an issue that had defined the terrain of international women's human rights for over two decades. As many analysts of female genital cutting have observed, the practice of female genital cutting has been exhaustively debated because it encompasses so many thorny issues in human rights: &quot;The sacredness of the family; women's rights as human rights; state obligations in the &quot;private' sphere; human sexuality; ... the West's view of people in other cultures as &quot;exotic Others'; postmodern colonialism; and cultural autonomy.&quot; n38 Yet, the institutionalization of feminist inspired human rights that was evidenced by (increasingly) favorable asylum decisions based on FGM, n39 forced marriage, n40 state-sponsored coercive sterilization, n41 sexual orientation, n42 and domestic violence applications n43 was [*98] intriguing, given the intense moral condemnation and counter-accusations of human rights imperialism that had characterized the debates around these issues during the 1980s and 1990s. n44 The Pyrrhic victory won by feminist asylum advocates had to be tempered by a sobering realization that the approval of these claims was firmly embedded within a cultural essentialist framework - one which trafficked very easily in signs of victimization and racialization. n45 Feminist scholars and advocates have voiced concerns with regard to the insufficient questioning about the issue of cultural essentialism in portrayals of gender-based persecution and its infelicitous appropriation as a discursive tool to <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;">legitimate our various twenty-first century wars</span> (terror, fundamentalism, drugs, [*99] crime, trafficking, AIDS). n46 Indeed, while the institutionalization of women's rights as human rights authorizes the approval of gender-based asylum claims - and should be rightfully claimed as a success of the feminist movement - it should also be treated with a healthy degree of skepticism, caution, and ambivalence. <br />
<br />
C) The alternative is to challenge the AFF’s oversimplified representations—this is critical to create sustainable movements for change to challenge oppression and Western imperialism: <br />
Harvard Law Review 2004 (May, “117 Harv. L. Rev. 2365”, “SAVING AMINA LAWAL: HUMAN RIGHTS SYMBOLISM AND THE DANGERS OF COLONIALISM” lexis) <br />
V. Alternative Approaches to Human Rights Advocacy Challenging this symbolism means seriously examining current human rights campaigns and moving them away from the centuries-old method that confuses women's issues with cultural issues. It requires supporters of the rights of postcolonial women to struggle against the impulse to represent women's oppression as representative of national and cultural iniquity, even when it may be the quickest and most effective means of galvanizing international interest in a particular problem or case. It also requires creative thinking and action to restructure the terms of present-day discussions about human rights. Human rights activists must challenge oversimplified representations of human rights violations in postcolonial states. They should take care to situate campaigns on behalf of specific persons within the social, political, and economic context in which a human rights violation occurs. In a country such as Nigeria, human rights organizations should strive tocounter the focus that the international media places on convenient symbols such as Ms. Lawal, and instead should use resources such as the Internet to ensure that the stories of all persons affected by the Islamization of Nigeria get some, if not equal, attention. Human Rights Watch's continued reports on Nigeria exemplify this approach by including accounts of cases such as Ms. Lawal's as well as an abundance of information about political developments in the country. n114 In an era of &quot;sound bites,&quot; it may be impossible to present nuanced reports to all people; however, sound bites can be used strategically to direct interested persons to sources of more complete information. Through such tools, the human rights community should seek to promote an ethos of informed activism that, as much as possible, avoids the use of simplistic representations to generate support. <br />
The argument for an activism that resists the use of women as symbols does not require that human rights activists abandon gendered analyses or women-focused campaigns - a comprehensive and inclusive human rights discourse should include an understanding of [*2385] gender oppression. However, the symbolic use of women and the silencing effect of that use are important elements of gender oppression, and challenging them should be part of any gender-sensitive human rights campaign. A challenging approach might include the participation of human rights activists in developing more nuanced representations of women and their participation in postcolonial polities. Most major newspapers reporting Ms. Lawal's case failed to note that women have played a major role in protecting people from the human rights violations resulting from Nigeria's application of the Shari&quot;a penal code. Not only was Ms. Hussaini the first person, man or woman, to appeal the imposition of a corporal or capital punishment under the new code, n115 her defense was spearheaded by Hauwa Ibrahim, the first female lawyer from northern Nigeria. n116 Ms. Ibrahim is a Muslim woman who obtained a legal education in a region where most women are not permitted to study beyond an elementary level. n117 She has devoted her career to challenging the constitutional violations in Shari&quot;a cases n118 and was also lead counsel in Ms. Lawal's defense. Also prominent in the struggle to address human rights violations in Nigeria are women's groups such as BAOBAB, a human rights organization that focuses on legal rights issues under Nigeria's customary, statutory, and religious laws. n119 The story of the reintroduction of the Shari&quot;a criminal law is as much a story about the activism and leadership of Nigerian women as it is a story of the victimization and silencing of Ms. Lawal. As the backlash from the conferment of honorary Roman citizenship on Ms. Hussaini demonstrates, when human rights discourse tracks the language of the colonialist project by making use of symbols equating women with victims, it not only obscures the leadership role that women like Ms. Ibrahim play in challenging human rights violations in postcolonial states; it may also trigger resistance (in the name of culture) that can seriously hinder human rights work. To combat this danger, human rights activists should be careful to build international campaigns around the leadership of these women. More nuanced representations and more complicated campaigns, however, are not sufficient on their own because as long as the human rights project remains focused on postcolonial states, the sense that it [*2386] is a descendant of the colonialist Western interventions of the past will remain. n120 The full spectrum of the world's failure to meet human rights ideals must be emphasized, including the violations that occur in Western states, in order to challenge the double standard that many Western leaders apply in their approach to human rights. The Western states that criticize countries like Nigeria for their human rights violations are often the very states that shelter perpetrators of crimes against humanity, as was the case with England's hosting of Libya's ex-president Charles Taylor. n121 Human rights violations in Western states are often categorized differently from - and lack the stigma of &quot;savagery&quot; that attaches to - violations in postcolonial states. Activists should insist that the language of human rights be applied to the &quot;First World&quot; violations in the same way that it is applied to the Third; human rights violations in the &quot;First World&quot; should not be considered simply a violation of a &quot;civil&quot; right or a misapplication of a Western state's otherwise &quot;civilized&quot; law. n122 The history of colonialism has left an indelible mark in the discourses between the societies of former colonizers and colonized. It has created powerful symbols and a vocabulary for intervention in postcolonial states that Western movements have found difficult to replace, precisely because these symbols and this vocabulary can be so effective in mobilizing support for campaigns against oppression in postcolonial states. However, when international movements, such as the human rights project, make use of this vocabulary, they come dangerously close to repeating the mistakes of the colonialist past and provide fodder for criticisms from postcolonial activists. Moreover, the use of colonialist imagery and vocabulary does little to empower women - and other people who serve as the objects of salvation - to effect change in their countries on their own terms. If human rights advocates seek to create a sustainable international movement, they must actively challenge, rather than reinscribe, the very language of international intervention. <br />

<br />
The power of Congress over the admission of aliens and their right to remain is necessarily very broad, touching as it does basic aspects of national sovereignty, more particularly our foreign relations and the national security. Nevertheless, considering what it means to deport an alien who legally became part of the American community, and the extent to which, since (s)he is a &quot;person,&quot; an alien immigrant has the same protection for his life, liberty and property under the Due Process Clause as is afforded to a citizen, deportation without permitting the alien to prove that he was unaware of the Communist Party's advocacy of violence strikes one with a sense of harsh incongruity. If due process bars Congress from enactments that shock the sense of fair play -- which is the essence of due process -- one is entitled to ask whether it is not beyond the power of Congress to deport an alien who was duped into joining the Communist Party, particularly when his conduct antedated the enactment of the legislation under which his deportation is sought. And this because deportation may, as this Court has said in Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 284, deprive a man &quot;of all that makes life worth living&quot;; and, as it has said in Fong Haw Tan v. Phelan, 333 U.S. 6, 10, &quot;deportation is a drastic measure and at times the equivalent of banishment or exile.&quot; In light of the expansion of the concept of substantive due process as a limitation upon all powers of Congress, even the war power, see Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 251 U.S. 146, 155, much [*922] could be said for the view, were we writing on a clean slate, that the Due Process [*531] Clause qualifies the scope of political discretion heretofore recognized as belonging to Congress in regulating the entry and deportation of aliens immigrants. And since the intrinsic consequences of deportation are so close to punishment for crime, it might fairly be said also that the ex post facto Clause, even though applicable [743] only to punitive legislation, 4 should be applied to deportation. <br />

Afghan stability <br />
No impact to Afghan collapse– the danger is overblown <br />
Scott <u>Johnson, Nov. 23</u> (The Fight Against Al Qaeda Moves to Africa, Newsweek, U.S. Edition, LexisNexis) <br />
<br />
In response, U.S. security officials have claimed this huge expanse as the latest front in the war on terror. Last year Washington increased counter-terrorism funding for the region to $101 million, up from a paltry $8 million in 2002. The area is fast becoming one of the chief priorities for AfriCom, the regional U.S. military command. <u>And the Obama administration has made a huge effort to strengthen the military capabilities of 10 Sahel countries to help them combat the jihadists</u>. <u>But a closer look suggests the danger is overblown.</u> <u>Like the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan--which is a true terrorist haven--the Sahel is remote and inhospitable.</u> <u>Yet it has little of what Pakistan's border does in the way of hideouts, training camps, or madrassas full of potential recruits. What's more, unlike in the hinterlands of Pakistan and Afghanistan, jihadist ideology has never taken root in the Sahel.</u> Instead, moderate strains of Sufi Islam prevail,<u>and most locals condemn the brutality of the extremists.</u> And whereas Qaeda militants elsewhere are united by dreams of regional or global domination, the <u>Sahel terrorists have &quot;no global ambitions</u>,&quot; says Vijay Prashad, an expert on the region at Trinity College. <u>They don't &quot;even seem to have local ambitions. They've devolved into a gang,&quot; he says.</u> <u>So far, at least, the violence in the region bears few similarities to large-scale Qaeda operations elsewhere.</u> <u>Western institutions have largely been spared, and there's no flow of money between the Sahel and other Qaeda cells, according to U.S. military officials</u>. As a result, the biggest concern of some Africa watchers is that U.S. attention may actually attract jihadists to a region where few now exist. &quot;If you treat it from a solely security perspective, you're producing more jihadists,&quot; says Yahia Zoubir, a Sahel expert at Chatham House in London. Far from its being a jihadist hotbed, the <u>reality is that the Sahel is a barren desert with a relatively small group of thugs who just happen to have latched on to an internationally resonant name</u>. <br />

Zero risk of nuclear terrorism impact <br />
David <u>Lindsay 9</u> December 03, 2009 “The Myth of Nuclear Terrorism” Lindsay is quoting Mueller-John Mueller is professor of political science at Ohio State University. He is the author of Atomic Obsession: Nuclear Alarmism from Hiroshima to Al Qaeda <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://davidaslindsay.blogspot.com/2009/12/myth-of-nuclear-terrorism.html" rel="nofollow">__http://davidaslindsay.blogspot.com/2009/12/myth-of-nuclear-terrorism.html__</a><br />
<br />
John Mueller writes: According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, every senior government leader is kept awake at night by “the thought of a terrorist ending up with a weapon of mass destruction, especially nuclear.” This is, I suppose, understandable. It was in 1995 that the thoughtful analyst Graham Allison declared that “in the absence of a determined program of action, we have every reason to anticipate acts of nuclear terrorism against American targets before this decade is out.” Unabashed, he maintained in an influential 2004 book that “on the current path, a nuclear terrorist attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than not.” And it was on “60 Minutes,” on Nov. 14, 2004, that former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer assured his rapt interviewer that the explosion of a nuclear or dirty bomb in the United States was “probably a near thing.” In contrast to such bold proclamations<u>,</u> <u>the evidence about the degree to which al-Qaeda</u>—the only Islamic terrorist organization that targets the U.S. homeland—<u>has pursued, or even had</u> much <u>interest in, a nuclear-weapons program is limited and often ambiguous.</u> Still, the shards that exist have been routinely parlayed and exaggerated by a parade of official and unofficial alarmists. For example<u>,</u> <u>in 2004, the 9/11 Commission insisted that “al-Qaeda has tried to acquire or make nuclear weapons for at least ten years.”</u> The only substantial evidence it provided for this assertion comes from an episode that supposedly took place around 1993 in Sudan, when Osama bin Laden’s aides were scammed as they tried to buy some uranium. Information about this caper apparently came entirely from Jamal al-Fadl, who defected from al-Qaeda in 1996 after he had been caught stealing $110,000 from the organization. He tried selling his story around the Middle East, but only the Americans were buying. In his prize-winning The Looming Tower, Lawrence Wright relays the testimony of the man who allegedly purchased the substance for bin Laden, as well as that of a Sudanese intelligence agent. Both assert that, although there were various other scams going around at the time that may have served as grist for Fadl, <u>the uranium episode never happened</u>. It’s possible, of course, that Fadl—a “lovable rogue” who is “fixated on money” and “likes to please,” according to an FBI debriefer—is telling the truth, or at least what he thinks is the truth. But his allegations, now endlessly repeated, have gone from a colorful story relayed by an admitted embezzler on the lam to unquestioned fact. We know, it is repeatedly declared, that bin Laden tried to purchase weapons-grade uranium in Sudan. Qualifications, even modest ones, concerning the veracity of the evidence behind that declaration have vanished in the retelling. Various sources suggest that there were radical elements in bin Laden’s entourage interested in pursuing atomic weapons or other weapons of mass destruction when the group was in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Yet the same sources indicate that bin Laden essentially sabotaged the idea by refusing to fund a WMD project or even initiate planning for one. Analyst Anne Stenersen notes that evidence from a recovered al-Qaeda computer shows that only some $2,000 to $4,000 was earmarked for WMD research, apparently for very crude chemical work to make biological weapons. For comparison, she points out that the millennial terrorist group Aum Shinrikyo appears to have invested $30 million into manufacturing sarin gas. To show al-Qaeda’s desire to obtain atomic weapons, many have focused on a set of conversations that took place in Afghanistan in August 2001 between two Pakistani nuclear scientists, bin Laden, and three other al-Qaeda officials. Pakistani intelligence officers characterize the discussions as “academic.” Reports suggest that bin Laden may have had access to some radiological material—acquired for him by radical Islamists in Uzbekistan—but the scientists told him that he could not manufacture a weapon with it. Bin Laden’s questions do not seem to have been very sophisticated. The scientists were incapable of providing truly helpful information because their expertise was not in bomb design but in processing fissile material, which is almost certainly beyond the capacities of a non-state group. Nonetheless, some U.S. intelligence agencies convinced themselves that the scientists provided al-Qaeda with a “blueprint” for constructing nuclear weapons. Khalid Sheikh <u>Mohammed, the apparent mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks, reportedly said that al-Qaeda’s atom-bomb efforts never went beyond searching the Internet. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, technical experts from the CIA and the Department of Energy examined information uncovered in Afghanistan and came to similar conclusions. They found no credible proof that al-Qaeda had obtained fissile material or a nuclear weapon and no evidence of “any radioactive material suitable for weapons.”</u> They did uncover, however, a “nuclear related” document discussing “openly available concepts about the nuclear fuel cycle and some weapons related issues.” Physicist and weapons expert David Albright concludes that any al-Qaeda atomic efforts were “seriously disrupted”—indeed, “nipped in the bud”—by the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. After that, the “chance of al-Qaeda detonating a nuclear explosive appears on reflection to be low.” Rumors and reports that al-Qaeda has managed to purchase an atomic bomb, or several, have been around now for over a decade. One story alleges that bin Laden gave a group of Chechens $30 million in cash and two tons of opium in exchange for 20 nuclear warheads. If any of these reports were true, one might think the terrorist group (or its supposed Chechen suppliers) would have tried to set off one of those things by now or that al-Qaeda would have left some trace of the weapons behind in Afghanistan after its hasty exit in 2001. Yet absence of evidence, we need hardly be reminded, is not evidence of absence. Some intelligence analysts defensively assert that although they haven’t found most of al-Qaeda’s leadership, they know it exists. Since we know Mount Rushmore exists, maybe the tooth fairy does as well. A Pakistani journalist was brought in to interview bin Laden just a day or two before al-Qaeda fled Afghanistan. The published texts of what was said vary, but in one transcript bin Laden supposedly asserted, “If the United States uses chemical or nuclear weapons against us, we might respond with chemical and nuclear weapons. We possess these weapons as a deterrent.” Bin Laden declined to discuss the weapons’ origins, but his second-in-command separately explained, “If you have $30 million, go to the black market in the central Asia, contact any disgruntled Soviet scientist and ... dozens of smart briefcase bombs are available. They have contacted us ... and we purchased some suitcase bombs.” Given the military pressure that they were under at the time, and taking into account the evidence of the primitive nature of al-Qaeda’s nuclear program—if it could be said to have had one at all—these reported assertions were clearly a desperate bluff. Bin Laden has pronounced on nuclear weapons a few other times, talking about an Islamic “duty” or “right” to obtain them for defense. Some of these oft-quoted statements can be seen as threatening, but they are rather coy and indirect, indicating perhaps an interest, not any capability. And as political scientist Louise Richardson concludes in What Terrorists Want: Understanding the Enemy, Containing the Threat, “statements claiming a right to possess nuclear weapons have been misinterpreted as expressing a determination to use them … this in turn has fed the exaggeration of the threat we face.” When examined, <u>the signs of al-Qaeda’s desire to go atomic and its progress in accomplishing that exceedingly difficult task are remarkably vague, if not negligible</u>. After an exhaustive study of available materials, Stenersen finds that, although al-Qaeda central may have considered nuclear and other non-conventional weapons, <u>there “is little evidence that such ideas ever developed into actual plans, or that they were given any kind of priority at the expense of more traditional types of terrorist attacks.” There is no reason to believe, moreover, that the group’s chances improved after they were forcefully expelled from their comparatively unembattled base in Afghanistan.</u> Glenn Carle, a 23-year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency, where he was deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats, warns about taking “fright at the specter our leaders have exaggerated” and argues that we should “see jihadists for the small, lethal, disjointed and miserable opponents that they are.” <u>Terrorism specialist Bruce Hoffman remains quite worried about loose terrorist networks, but he also points out that they are likely to be “less sophisticated” and “less technically competent” than earlier terrorists.</u> In 1996, one of terrorism studies’ top gurus, Walter Laqueur, insisted that some terrorist groups “almost certainly” will use weapons of mass destruction “in the foreseeable future.” What was then the foreseeable future is presumably now history. In today’s reality, terrorists seem to be heeding the advice found in a memo on an al-Qaeda laptop seized in Pakistan in 2004: “Make use of that which is available ... rather than waste valuable time becoming despondent over that which is not within your reach.” That is: keep it simple, stupid. <u>Although there have been plenty of terrorist attacks in the world since 2001, all—thus far, at least—have relied on conventional destructive methods. There hasn’t even been much in the way of gas bombings, even in Iraq where the technology is hardly a secret. In sum, any notion that al-Qaeda is likely to come up with nuclear weapons looks far fetched in the extreme. We still have reason for concern or at least for watchfulness. But hysteria—not to mention sleeplessness—is hardly called for.</u><br />

(_/_)No nuclear terror attacks – recent international efforts to protect nuclear materials make bomb building nearly impossible <br />
Shane 10. (Scott, 4/15/2010. “Cold War Nuclear Fears Now Apply to Terrorists” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/world/16memo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/world/16memo.html</a>.) <br />
<br />
In the 1950s the United States knew its adversaries had weapons; the mystery was whether they might use them. <u>Today</u>, said Jeffrey T. Richelson, a historian of nuclear weapons, the situation is reversed: <u>Qaeda leaders have suggested publicly that they would use a nuclear weapon, “but</u> as far as we know, <u>Al Qaeda hasn’t even come close to building a bomb.</u>” Most<u>security experts believe the focus in recent years on destroying or locking up nuclear material is</u> far more <u>effective</u> than sealing American borders. <u>The global effort to reduce the threat was advanced at the summit meeting in Washington this week, with commitments from many countries to destroy or secure supplies of plutonium and highly enriched uranium</u>. Knowing the history of periodic panics about smuggled nukes offers a kind of reassurance in the face of a horrifying danger, said Mr. Zenko of the Council on Foreign Relations.“<u>If you consider that the threat has been around for more than 60 years</u>,” he said, “<u>you don’t get overwhelmed by fear.”</u><br />

A) Terrorism label justifies racism and massive bio-power: <br />
Glenn <u>Greenwald, 2/19/2010</u> (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/02/19/terrorism/index.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/02/19/terrorism/index.html__</a>) <br />
<br />
All of this would be an interesting though not terribly important semantic matter if not for the fact that <u>the term Terrorist plays a central role in our political debates</u>. <u>It is the all-justifying term for anything the U.S. Government does. Invasions, torture,</u> due-process-free detentions, military commissions, drone attacks, warrantless surveillance, obsessive secrecy, <u>and even assassinations of American citizens are all justified by the claim that it's only being done to &quot;Terrorists,&quot;</u> who, by definition, have no rights. Even worse, one becomes a &quot;Terrorist&quot; not through any judicial adjudication or other formal process, but solely by virtue of the untested, unchecked say-so of the Executive Branch. <u>The President decrees someone to be a Terrorist and that's the end of that: uncritical followers of both political parties immediately justify anything done to the person</u> on the ground that he's a Terrorist (by which they actually mean: he's been accused of being one, though that distinction -- between presidential accusations and proof -- is not one they recognize). <u>If we're really going to vest virtually unlimited power in the Government to do anything it wants to people they call &quot;Terrorists,&quot; we ought at least to have a common understanding of what the term means. But there is none. It's just become a malleable, all-justifying term to allow the U.S. Government carte blanche to do whatever it wants to Muslims it does not like</u> or who do not like it (i.e., The Terrorists). It's really more of a hypnotic mantra than an actual word: <u>its mere utterance</u> <u>causes the nation blindly to cheer on whatever is done against the Muslims who are so labeled.</u><br />
B) Racism outweighs the AFF: <br />
Albert <u>Memmi, 2000</u> (<u>Racism</u>, accessed online via google books) <br />
<br />
Of course, this is debatable. <u>There are those who think that if one is strong enough,</u> the assault on and <u>oppression of others is permissible. But no one is ever sure of remaining the strongest. One day,</u>perhaps, <u>the roles will be reversed. All unjust society contains within itself the seeds of its own death.</u> It is probably smarter to treat others with respect so that they treat you with respect. “Recall,” says the Bible, “that you were once a stranger in Egypt,” which means both that <u>you ought to respect the stranger because you were a stranger yourself and that you risk becoming one again someday. It is an ethical and a practical appeal</u>—indeed, it is a contract, however implicit it might be. In short, <u>the refusal of racism is the condition for all theoretical and practical morality</u>. Because, in the end, the ethical choice commands the political choice, a just society must be a society accepted by all. <u>If this contractual principle is not accepted, then only conflict, violence, and destruction will be our lot. If it is accepted, we can hope someday to live in peace.</u> True, it is a wager, but the stakes are irresistible. <br />
<br />
C) Exercises of biopower justify administration over the body politic – the ultimate impact is global nuclear conflict, genocide, and extinction <br />
Michel <u>Foucault</u><u>, 1978</u> Professor of the History of Systems of Thought at the Collège de France, 1978, The History of Sexuality Volume 1: An Introduction, translated by Robert Hurley, p. 135-137 <br />
<br />
For a long time, <u>one of the characteristic privileges of sovereign power was the right to decide life and death</u>. In a formal sense, it derived no doubt from the ancient patria potestas that granted the father of the Roman family the right to “dispose” of the life of his children and his slaves; just as he had given them life, so he could take it away. By the time the right of life and death was framed by the classi­cal theoreticians, it was in a considerably diminished form. It was no longer considered that this power of the sovereign over his subjects could be exercised in an absolute and un­conditional way, but only in cases where the sovereign’s very existence was in jeopardy: a sort of right of rejoinder. If he were threatened by external enemies who sought to over­throw him or contest his rights, he could then legitimately wage war, and require his subjects to take part in the defense of the state; without “directly proposing their death,” he was empowered to “expose their life”: in this sense, he wielded an “indirect” power over them of life and death. But if someone dared to rise up against him and transgress his laws, then he could exercise a direct power over the offender’s life: as punishment, the latter would be put to death. Viewed in this way, the power of life and death was not an absolute privilege: it was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, and his own survival. Must we follow Hobbes in seeing it as the transfer to the prince of the natural right possessed by every individual to defend his life even if this meant the death of others? Or should it be regarded as a specific right that was manifested with the formation of that new juridical being, the sovereign? In any case, in its modern form—relative and limited—as in its ancient and absolute form, the right of life and death is a dissymmetrical one. The sovereign exercised his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by refraining from killing; he evidenced his power over life only through the death he was capable of requiring. The right which was formulated as the “power of life and death” was in reality the right to <em>take</em> life or <em>let</em> live. Its symbol, after all, was the sword. Perhaps this juridical form must be re­ferred to a historical type of society in which power was exercised mainly as a means of deduction (<em>prelevement</em>), a subtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of the wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and blood, levied on the subjects. Power in this instance was essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize hold of life in order to suppress it. Since the classical age the West has undergone a very profound transformation of these mechanisms of power. “Deduction” has tended to be no longer the major form of power but merely one element among others, working to incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak­ing them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis­tering power and to define itself accordingly. This death that was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, maintain, or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts on their own populations. But <u>this formidable power of death</u>—and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits—<u>now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that exerts a positive influence on life,</u> that endeavors to adminis­ter, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations. <u>Wars are</u> no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are <u>waged</u> <u>on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire popula­tions are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter</u> <u>in the name of life necessity:</u> massacres have become vital. It is as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that closes the circle, as the technology of wars has caused them to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. <u>The</u> <u>atomic situation</u> <u>is now at the end point of this process: the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s con­tinued existence.</u> The principle underlying the tactics of bat­tle-that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on living-has become the principle that defines the strategy of states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical existence of sovereignty; <u>at stake is the</u> <u>biological existence of a population</u><u>.</u> If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population. <br />

<u>The turn of the decade brings with it a momentous shot in the arm to the moribund Indo-Pak peace process with the unveiling of a grand cross-border collaborative peace project.

<u>Pakistan and India on Friday exchanged lists of their respective nuclear installations.</u> The Foreign Affairs Ministry handed over the list of Pakistan’s nuclear installations and facilities to an Indian High Commission (IHC) officer at the Foreign Office. Simultaneously, Indian officials handed over its list to a Pakistan High Commission (PHC) officer at the External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi. <u>The lists were exchanged in line with Article 2 of the Agreement on Prohibition of Attack Against Nuclear Installations and Facilities</u> signed between the two countries on December 31, 1988. Under the 1988 agreement, both nations are to refrain from attacking nuclear facilities in the event of war. <u>The neighbours have also set up a</u> <u>telephone hotline to prevent accidental nuclear conflict</u><u>,</u> AFP reported.

<u>The history of confidence-building between India and Pakistan spans many years.</u> Despite the fact that these countries could not achieve a major breakthrough, yet <u>these CBMs have saved them from major disasters. For example, in the post-1980 years, when the two had joined the nuclear race, the CBMs saved them form any major collision</u>. A good step in that direction was the agreement on informing each other about their military exercises beforehand. The other CBMs include the willingness for non-violation of each other’s airspace, an agreement about the non-use of chemical weapons (1992), establishment of a hotline at military level, and agreement about not attacking each other’s nuclear installations (1988). These measures eased the prevailing tension. <u>When the two nations became nuclear powers in the late 1990s, it was the CBMs which, along with the respective civil societies of the two nations, kept the hope alive for a rational approach amidst war hysteria.</u><br />

Arms sales to Taiwan decimate US-China relations <br />
Chase ’10 [Michael Feb, 2010/ <u>Selling Weapons to Taiwan Was the Right Decision</u>] <br />
Last Friday, <u>the U.S</u>. Department of Defense <u>announced the approval of a major arms sales package for <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://realclearworld.com/topic/around_the_world/taiwan/?utm_source=rcw&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=rcwautolink" rel="nofollow">____Taiwan____</a></u>. The $6.4 billion deal <u>includes 114 Patriot advanced capability</u>(PAC-3) missiles, 60 Blackhawk helicopters, and two Osprey-class mine-hunting ships, among other items. The Obama administration is still considering Taiwan's request for the F-16 C/Ds that it wants to replace some of its aging fighters. As it has in the <u>past, Beijing quickly expressed its indignation through multiple channels.

Innocent 9. (Malou, <em>foreign policy analyst at the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/" rel="nofollow">__Cato Institute__</a></em> <u>China: Peace Partner or Warmoner?</u><br />
While there is some evidence to support the presumption that China will become adversarial, <u>others see China becoming a status quo power seeking peaceful relations with the rest of the global community.</u> For these experts, <u>the potential for hostile US-China relations is all the more reason to encourage Beijing's integration into the global economic and trading system, which may undermine China's propensity to base its interests simply in military terms</u>. To put a twist on the old saying, so <u>long as goods cross borders, soldiers won't. Nations that trade and cooperate are less likely to go to war, and given today's economic climate, it's hoped that Chinese and American strategic interests are converging because of economic interdependence.</u><br />

MAD deters conflict between India &amp; Pakistan—media reports merely hype the impact-- <br />

<u>What prevented a nuclear Armageddon during the Cold War was the notion of Mutually Assured Destruction -- the theory that nuclear powers are equally vulnerable and that launching a nuclear strike against the enemy was akin to committing suicide</u>. There was even no guarantee that launching a nuclear strike first would destroy the opponent's retaliatory strike capacity. <u>In some ways, the same sort of logicappears to be at work in preventing India and Pakistan from going to war in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks</u> in late November that left at least 170 people dead. <u>But tell that to the media in both countries.</u> Even as the attacks were unfolding, the Indian media was quick to pin the blame on Islamabad. And as the story of the Mumbai attacks dominated Indian and international news cycles, Pakistani media began responding forcefully against what it saw was a smear campaign against their country. In particular, they said Indian journalists weren't questioning hard enough &quot;the official truth&quot; -- the one that they said framed Pakistan in the Mumbai attacks and was put out by Indian officials. <u>In this atmosphere of mutual distrust, both medias have exaggerated the statements and warped the intentions of the other country.</u> This apparently led Stratfor to declare on December 24 that Indian troop movements along the Pakistani border were tantamount to signs of a coming war between the two neighbors. And the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; reports that internal political pressures might push New Delhi and Islamabad toward brinkmanship. <u>However,</u> &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on December 29 that despite the rising tension, <u>hardly anyone among the Indian political elite is advocating a military confrontation with its western neighbor.</u><br />

Congress-led regime of India, which is under pressure of a hysterical media acting upon the hot pursuit policy of the Hindu fundamentalist parties like BJP, RSS and Shiv Sena including military hawkish elements wants to make Pakistan, a scapegoat of Mumbai carnage to win the coming election. It must know that Pakistan’s deterrence is credible, making its defence invincible. <u>Without any doubt, Pakistan possesses a variety of nuclear weapons and missiles which could be used against India as the last option in case of war. While both the neighbouring adversaries are nuclear powers, Indians should not ignore the principles of deterrence, popularly known as balance of terror</u>. In 1945, America dropped atomic bombs on Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as Tokyo had no such devices to retaliate. After the World War 11, nuclear weapons were never used. These were only employed as a strategic threat. <u>During the heightened days of the Cold War, many crises arose</u> in Suez Canal, Korea, Cuba and Vietnam <u>when the US and the former Soviet Union were willing to use atomic weapons, but they stopped due to the fear of nuclear war which could culminate in the elimination of both the super powers. It was due to the concept of ‘mutually assured destruction’ that the two rivals preferred to resolve their differences through diplomacy</u>. <br />

David <u>Yost, 2009</u> (Assurance and US extended deterrence in NATO, International Affairs 85: 4 (2009) 755–780; accessed via EBSCO) <br />
Supporters of the ‘political and strategic functions perspective’ note that the <u>US nuclear weapons in Europe, and the US and allied dual-capable aircraft, provide assurance to the NATO allies as to the existential nature of the US commitment. The weapons and aircraft make it possible for the United States and its NATO allies to constitute and maintain an alliance deterrent. Through these arrangements the allies demonstrate their solidarity and share risks and responsibilities, and they maintain capabilities for forward basing and political signalling (including a message of alliance cohesion) that might well be useful in crisis management</u>. From this perspective, <u>the United States and its NATO allies can maintain assurance and US extended deterrence</u> <u>far more effectively</u> <u>by sustaining the longstanding arrangements than by experimenting with an entirely US-based and operated nuclear deterrent posture</u>. <br />

<br />
Today, <u>thanks to the partnership between our nation and others, Europe is stronger than ever</u>. The bitter divides of the Cold War have been replaced by unity, partnership, and peace. Russia is no longer our adversary but often a partner on key global issues. <u>Nations that once were members of the Warsaw Pact and eyed NATO with suspicion are now active members of our Allian</u>ce. And the European Union has grown to include 27 nations, from the British Isles to the Baltic states, and is poised to become even more dynamic with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon. As I recently expressed to the new EU High Representative Baroness Catherine Ashton, the challenges we face in our Euro-Atlantic relationship demand collective responses, and the European Union is an invaluable and increasingly effective force for global progress. So the accomplishments of the past half century have showcased how vital European security is, not only to the individual nations, but to the world. It is, after all, more than a collection of countries linked by history and geography. It is a model for the transformative power of reconciliation, cooperation, and community. But at the same time, much important work remains unfinished. The transition to democracy is incomplete in parts of Europe and Eurasia. Arms control regimes that once served us well are now fraying. And in too many places, economic opportunity is still too narrow and shallow. Adding to these ongoing challenges, the institutions that guarded Europe’s and North America’s security during the 20th century were not designed with 21st century threats in mind. New dangers have emerged, such as global terrorism, including cyber terrorism and nuclear terrorism; climate change; global criminal networks that traffic in weapons, drugs, and people; threats to Europe’s energy supply, which, if exploited, could destabilize economies and stoke regional and even global conflict. Tanks, bombers, and missiles are necessary but no longer sufficient to keep our people safe. Our arsenal must also include tools that protect cyber and energy networks, halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, counter the threats of terrorism and destructive ideologies, in part by confronting the political, economic, and social conditions that give rise to such ideologies in the first place. <u>The transatlantic partnership has been both a cornerstone of global security and a powerful force for global progress</u>. Now we are called to address some of the great challenges in human history. And to meet them, we are required to modernize and strengthen our partnership. <u>New thinking is underway on both sides of the Atlantic. NATO is revising its Strategic Concept to prepare for the alliance’s summit at the end of this year here</u> at (inaudible). I know there’s a lot of thinking going on about strategic threats and how to meet them. Next week, at the Munich Security Conference, leaders from across the continent will address urgent security and foreign policy challenges. France has urged all of us for a high-level discussion to address European security. Other nations have proposed new approaches and agreements. <u>Russia has recently suggested both a new European security treaty and a new NATO-Russia treaty.</u> The United States, too, has also been studying ways to strengthen European security and, therefore our own security, and to extend it to foster security on a global scale. Today, I’d like to discuss the core principles that guide the United States today as we consider the future of European security and our role in shaping, strengthening, and sustaining it. But first, let me address some questions raised in recent months about the depth of the United States commitment to European security. Some wonder whether we understand the urgent need to improve security in Europe. Others have voiced concern that the Obama Administration is so focused on foreign policy challenges elsewhere in the world that Europe has receded in our list of priorities. Well, in fact, European security remains an anchor of U.S. foreign and security policy. A strong Europe is critical to our security and our prosperity. Much of what we hope to accomplish globally depends on working together with Europe. And so we are working with European allies and partners to help bring stability to Afghanistan and try to take on the dangers posed by Iran’s nuclear ambition. We are working with Europe to help meet the crisis of climate change and revitalize the global economy. And we’re working in the fight against extreme poverty, gender-based violence, and pandemic disease. Human rights and universal values, shared as part of our common history between Europe and the United States, must always be a cornerstone of our security efforts, because if Europe is not secure, Europe cannot lead. And we need European leadership in the 21st century. But European security is far more than a strategic interest of my country. It is also an expression of our values. We stand with Europe today, as we have stood with Europe for decades, because enduring bonds connect our nations and our peoples. We are united by an understanding of the importance of liberty and freedom. We have fought and died for each other’s liberty and freedom. These are ties that cannot and never should be broken. And we seek both to venerate and reinforce them by helping to maintain peace and security in Europe, today and all the tomorrows to come. But as we move forward, a set of core principles will guide us in our approach and in our joint effort. First, the cornerstone of security is the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states. Much of the suffering that occurred in Europe during the 20th century emanated from a failure to respect borders or to honor the right of all nations to pursue their own foreign policies, choose their own allies, and provide for their own self-defense. These are fundamental rights of free nations and must and will remain vigilant in our efforts to oppose any attempt to undermine them. The United States has demonstrated our adherence to this principle in recent years with our support for new European democracies seeking to chart their own political futures, free from external intimidation or aggression. We have repeatedly called on Russia to honor the terms of its ceasefire agreement with Georgia, and we refuse to recognize Russia’s claims of independence for Abkhazia and South Ossetia. More broadly, we object to any spheres of influence claimed in Europe in which one country seeks to control another’s future. Our security depends upon nations being able to choose their own destiny. For years, Russia has expressed a sense of insecurity as NATO and the EU have expanded. But we strongly believe that the enlargement of both has increased security, stability, and prosperity across the continent, and that this, in turn, has actually increased Russia’s security and prosperity. Furthermore, the right of all countries to enter into alliances of their own choosing has been endorsed by Russia and all members of the OSCE at the 1999 Istanbul summit. NATO must and will remain open to any country that aspires to become a member and can meet the requirements of membership. But we do not seek to create divisions between neighbors and partners. Russia’s confidence in its security enhances our own. So that brings us to our second principle: Security in Europe must be indivisible. For too long, the public discourse around Europe’s security has been fixed on geographical and political divides. Some have looked at the continent even now and seen Western and Eastern Europe, old and new Europe, NATO and non-NATO Europe, EU and non-EU Europe. The reality is that there are not many Europes; there is only one Europe. And it is a Europe that includes the United States as its partner. And it is a Europe that includes Russia. For in this century, security cannot be a zero-sum game. The security of all nations is intertwined. And we have a responsibility to work to enhance each other’s security, in part by engaging with others on these new ideas and approaches. Now, the Russian Government under President Medvedev has put forth proposals for new security treaties in Europe. Indivisibility of security is a key feature of those proposals. And that is a goal we share, along with other ideas in the Russian proposals which reaffirm principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the NATO-Russia Founding Act. However, we believe that these common goals are best pursued in the context of existing institutions, such as the OSCE and the NATO-Russia Council, rather than by negotiating new treaties, as Russia has suggested – a very long and cumbersome process. I want to emphasize, though, even though we may have differences with Russia, the United States is very proud of what our two countries have accomplished together during the past year. The Obama Administration inherited a deteriorating relationship with Russia, and we immediately set out to build a more substantive and constructive relationship based mutual respect and mutual interests. Together, we have made progress on a range of such matters, including helping to address Iran’s nuclear program through the P-5+1, sharing a concern about stabilizing Afghanistan, confronting North Korea’s defiance of its international obligations, negotiating a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, tackling non-traditional threats such as pandemic disease, cyber warfare, and the trafficking of children. We will build upon this foundation as we seek to revitalize the NATO-Russia Council, so it can make concrete contributions to areas where we are working together and need to be doing even more, such as in missile defense, counternarcotics, and Afghanistan. And we are committed to exploring ways that NATO and Russia can improve their partnership by better reassuring each other about respective actions and intentions, through greater military transparency, the sharing of information, and other means of building trust and confidence. Now, I don’t need to state, but I will, that the United States and Russia will not always agree. We have different histories, different experiences and perspectives. Our interests will not always overlap. But when we disagree, we will seek constructive ways to manage our differences. <u>Third, we will maintain an unwavering commitment to the pledge enshrined in Article 5 of the NATO treaty that an attack on one is an attack on all. When France and our other NATO allies invoked Article 5 in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11th, 2001, it was a proclamation to the world that our promise to each other was not rhetorical, but real.</u> And the people of Europe brought great comfort to the people of the United States by reminding us that even in such a difficult hour, we were not alone. I was a senator representing the state of New York at that time, and I well remember the extraordinary outpouring of support that the people of New York specifically received. And for that, I thank you. And I assure you and all members of NATO that our commitment to Europe’s defense is equally strong. <u>As proof of that commitment, we will continue to station American troops in Europe, both to deter attacks and respond quickly if any occur. We are working with our allies to ensure that NATO has the plans it needs for responding to new and evolving contingencies</u>. <u>We are engaged in productive discussions with our European allies about building a new missile defense architecture that will defend all of NATO territory against ballistic missile attack. And we are serious about exploring ways to cooperate with Russia to develop missile defenses that enhance the security of all of Europe, including Russia.</u><br />

As global policymakers gather for the annual Munich Security Conference, Russia is growing more strident in its complaints that the European security system is dysfunctional. <br />
At the same time, <u>the United States and the West insist that the NATO alliance is and will remain the foundation of security on the continent.</u><br />
Is it time, then, to move seriously toward a membership action plan -- and eventual NATO membership -- for Russia? <br />
Since taking office more than 18 months ago, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has argued forcefully that the mechanisms of ensuring security in Europe are outdated to the point of being dysfunctional. Russia feels excluded from key security arrangements, and Moscow has increasingly adopted an old NATO slogan -- that security must be indivisible. <br />

It is inaccurate to suggest, as NATO partisans often do, that the only alternative to Atlanticism is a return to the dark ages of the interwar era: nationalized European defenses, American isolationism, xenophobia, demagoguery, and the other evils associated with the rise of Hitler and World War II. Former U.S. senator Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) warns that weakening NATO will have dire consequences. &quot;As we have thrice before in this dreadful century, [we will] set in motion an instability that can only lead to war, shed blood, and lost treasure. Pray that we are wiser.&quot;(4) Lawrence di Rita of the Heritage Foundation similarly defends NATO as an &quot;insurance policy&quot; against a future world war. &quot;If keeping 65,000 young Americans in Europe will prevent 10 times that many new headstones in Arlington cemetery once the Europeans turn on themselves again--as they have twice this century--then it's a small price to pay.&quot;(5) Such alarmism underestimates the significance of 50 years of economic and political cooperation among the West European powers and the role of pan-European institutionssuch as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It also ignores the fact that a viable institutional alternative to NATO--the Western European Union--already exists. With the proper resources and recognition on the part of Washington and the Europeans that an independent European defense is essential in the post-Cold War era, the WEU is a promising alternative to Atlanticism. Far from being a lame second choice to NATO or defense on the cheap, a robust WEU would be superior to NATO in many ways, better suited in the long run to protecting European and, indirectly, American interests. <br />

If the Alliance survived a debacle of the magnitude of Suez in 1956, it can withstand anything. The main danger for NATO therefore is not military failure or even a Suez-like temporary political meltdown, but something more insidious. Over time, what an ill-conceived globalization of NATO could lead to is the transformation of the tactical coalition that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization currently is into a strategic “NATO of the East” while at the same time perverting the Atlantic Alliance into, so to speak, a “SEATO of the West” — namely, a make-believe alliance with no viable strategy (because a conventional military configuration is irrelevant when the threats are of the asymmetric variety) and no coherent policy (because the interests of the global members are simply too heterogeneous to ever converge.) The Long War promises to be a thinking man’s war. As a full-fledged Alliance, NATO possesses the kind of staying power that mere ad hoc coalitions cannot deliver; but NATO still has to come to terms with the fact that thinking power will matter more than fighting power. If NATO is to avoid the twofold danger of the SCO becoming a NATO of the East while NATO becomes a mere SEATO of the West, the Alliance will have first of all to downgrade its “toolbox” dimension and beef up its “think-tank” dimension. <br />

Long before the Bush administration began selling &quot;the surge&quot; in Iraq as a way to avert a general war in the Middle East, observers both inside and outside the government were growing concerned about the potential for armed conflict among the regional powers. Underlying <u>this anxiety was a scenario in which Iraq's sectarian and ethnic violence spills over into neighboring countries,</u> producing conflicts between the major Arab states and Iran as well as Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government. These wars then destabilize the entire region well beyond the current conflict zone, involving heavyweights like Egypt. This is scary stuff indeed, but with the exception of the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds, the scenario is far from an accurate reflection of the way Middle Eastern leaders view the situation in Iraq and calculate their interests there. <u>It is abundantly clear that major outside powers like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey are heavily involved in Iraq.</u> These countries have so much at stake in the future of Iraq that it is natural they would seek to influence political developments in the country. <u>Yet, the Saudis, Iranians, Jordanians, Syrians, and others are very unlikely to go to war either to protect their own sect or ethnic group or to prevent one country from gaining the upper hand in Iraq.</u> The reasons are fairly straightforward. <u>First,</u> <u>Middle Eastern leaders,</u> like politicians everywhere, are <u>primarily interested in one thing: self-preservation</u>. <u>Committing forces to Iraq is an inherently risky proposition</u>, which, if the conflict went badly, could threaten domestic political stability. Moreover, most Arab armies are geared toward regime protection rather than projecting power and thus have little capability for sending troops to Iraq. <u>Second, there is cause for concern about the so-called blowback scenario in which jihadis returning from Iraq destabilize their home countries, plunging the region into conflict.</u> Middle Eastern leaders are preparing for this possibility. Unlike in the 1990s, when Arab fighters in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union returned to Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and became a source of instability, Arab security services are being vigilant about who is coming in and going from their countries. In the last month, the Saudi government has arrested approximately 200 people suspected of ties with militants. Riyadh is also building a 700 kilometer wall along part of its frontier with Iraq in order to keep militants out of the kingdom.<u>Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in which they are not directly involved.</u> The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq. The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars. But <u>given its experience with ambiguous conflicts, the region has also developed an intuitive ability to contain its civil strife and prevent local conflicts from enveloping the entire Middle East.</u> Iraq's civil war is the latest tragedy of this hapless region, but still a tragedy whose consequences are likely to be less severe than both supporters and opponents of Bush's war profess. <br />
Iraq has been unstable for forever- they went through an entire transition in their government <br />

<u>Many developing countries do not have the government and social infrastructures in place to cope with the types of stressors that could be brought on by global climate change. When a government can no longer deliver services to its people, ensure domestic order, and protect the nation’s borders from invasion, conditions are ripe for turmoil, extremism and terrorism to fill the vacuum.</u> Lebanon’s experience with the terrorist group Hezbollah and the Brazilian government’s attempts to reign in the slum gang First Capital Command [12] <u>are both examples of how the central governments’ inability to provide basic services has led to strengthening of these extra-governmental entities.</u><br />

We’d end a nuclear war before it escalated <br />

<br />
This debate may now seem like ancient history, but it is actually more relevant than ever -- because <u>the age of MAD is nearing an end. Today</u>, for the first time in almost 50 years, <u>the United States stands on the verge of attaining nuclear primacy. It will probably soon be possible for the United States to destroy the long-range nuclear arsenals of Russia or China with a first strike. This dramatic shift in the nuclear balance of power stems from a series of improvements in the United States' nuclear systems, the precipitous decline of Russia's arsenal, and the glacial pace of modernization of China's nuclear forces</u>. Unless Washington's policies change or Moscow and Beijing take steps to increase the size and readiness of their forces, Russia and China -- and <u>the rest of the world -- will live in the shadow of U.S. nuclear primacy for many years to come.</u><br />

Major war is obsolete – multiple factors prevent escalation and conflict <br />
MANDELBAUM, American foreign policy professor at the Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University,1999(Michael, “Is Major War Obsolete?”,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/conf/cfr10/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__http://www.ciaonet.org/conf/cfr10/__</a>) <br />
<br />
Most simply,<u>the costs have risen and the benefits of major war have shriveled. The costs of fighting such a war are extremely high because of the advent in the middle of this century of nuclear weapons</u>, but they would have been high even had mankind never split the atom. As for <u>the benefits</u>, these <u>now seem</u>, at least from the point of view of the major powers, modest to <u>non-existent. The traditional motives for warfare are</u> in retreat, if not <u>extinct</u>. War is no longer regarded by anyone, probably not even Saddam Hussein after his unhappy experience, as a paying proposition. And as for <u>the ideas on behalf of which major wars have been waged in the past, these are in steep decline</u>. Here the collapse of communism was an important milestone, for that ideology was inherently bellicose. This is not to say that the world has reached the end of ideology; quite the contrary. But <u>the ideology that is now in the ascendant</u>, our own, <u>liberalism, tends to be pacific</u>. Moreover, I would argue that three <u>post-Cold War developments have made major war even less likely</u> than it was after 1945. <u>One of these is the rise of democracy, for democracies</u>, I believe, <u>tend to be peaceful</u>. Now carried to its most extreme conclusion, this eventuates in an argument made by some prominent political scientists that democracies never go to war with one another. I wouldn’t go that far. I don’t believe that this is a law of history, like a law of nature, because I believe there are no such laws of history. But I do believe there is something in it. I believe there is a peaceful tendency inherent in democracy. Now it’s true that one important cause of war has not changed with the end of the Cold War. That is the structure of the international system, which is anarchic. And realists, to whom Fareed has referred and of whom John Mearsheimer and our guest Ken Waltz are perhaps the two most leading exponents in this country and the world at the moment, argue that that structure determines international activity, for it leads sovereign states to have to prepare to defend themselves, and those preparations sooner or later issue in war. I argue, however, that <u>a post-Cold War innovation counteracts the effects of anarchy</u>. This is what I have called in my 1996 book, The Dawn of Peace in Europe, common security. By common security I mean <u>a regime of negotiated arms limits</u> that <u>reduces the insecurity that anarchy inevitably produces by transparency-every state can know what weapons every other state has and what it is doing with them</u>-and through the principle of defense dominance, <u>the reconfiguration through negotiations of military forces</u> to <u>makes them more suitable for defense and less for attack</u>. Some caveats are, indeed, in order where common security is concerned. It’s not universal. It exists only in Europe. And there it is certainly not irreversible. And I should add that what I have called <u>common security is not a cause, but a consequence, of the major forces that have made war less likely. States enter into common security arrangements when they have already, for other reasons, decided that they do not wish to go to war. Well, the third feature of the post-Cold War international system that seems to me to lend itself to warlessness is the novel distinction between the periphery and the core, between the powerful states and the less powerful ones. This was previously a cause of conflict and now is far less important.</u><br />

Extend the Pittsburgh Times evidence- the Democrats will win for several reasons: they have more funding, Obama is energized and the GOP looks like they’re out of ideas <br />
Dems will lose seats but maintain control of BOTH chambers- they have a winning strategy <br />
AllVoices 9/17/10 [With six weeks to go until Midterms, Democrats finally find the right strategy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6789993-with-six-weeks-to-go-until-midterms-democrats-finally-find-the-right-strategy" rel="nofollow">http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/6789993-with-six-weeks-to-go-until-midterms-democrats-finally-find-the-right-strategy</a>] <br />
<br />
Against what had appeared to be insurmountable odds, <u>the Democratic Party seems to have finally found a message that could transform the</u> 2010 <u>Midterms</u> into a much more competitive series of contests and prevent the widely anticipated Republican takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives. <u>That message? It’s more or less, “We know voters are angry at the government, but they’d be even angrier if the Republicans controlled Congress.”</u>As cynical and desperate as it may appear to some novice (and even seasoned) political observers,<u>the shift in strategy represents the best hope for the Democratic Party in 2010</u>. Why? Because <u>it is a position they can actually defend</u>.&quot;This needs to be a choice, not a referendum,&quot; on the Democratic-led Congress and Obama administration, said Erik Smith, a Democratic campaign advisor (Associated Press, 9-17-10)When Republicans controlled Congress under G.W. Bush, they pushed an unpopular agenda which included, among other things, the privatization of Social Security. <u>If the Democrats really want to hold on in Congress, they need to put out a kind of “reminder list” highlighting disastrous Republican legislation that failed because Democrats stood with the majority of the American people in opposing the bad ideas in question</u>. This is the only way to highlight the choice between two bad options, and <u>if handled properly by the Democrats, it could become a future model with which to fight large leads by opposing parties that seemingly have momentum</u> but may, in fact, have nothing more than wasted motion. It all grinds to a halt and results in a collective decision on Election Day. That, after all, is the only poll that counts.This factual rundown would make no difference to fiercely anti-Obama Tea Party followers, most of who are more anxious to vote than at any other time in their lives. And they will follow through. They will offer rides. They will get out the vote, no doubt about it. They’re not about to let a dose of Democratic realism, however depressing, derail their nebulous yet ambitious goal of “taking back the country.”But as Election Day draws near, and independent voters keep hearing the “Republicans are worse than we are” refrain from the Democrats, the message will sink in and take hold. <u>The Democrats will still lose seats in the House and Senate, but the Punditty Theorem</u> (based on a concept known as Intuitive Probability Analytics, which will be explained in a later column) which recently predicted that the Democrats would lose 44 seats <u>has been unexpectedly affected by the “They Suck Worse Than We Do” late-in-the-game brilliance of the Democrats. Preliminary calculations</u> following the release of a Sept. 17 AP report (link below) <u>now indicate the Democrats will lose just 29 seats in the House.Democrats, however, will have to embrace the “Republicans Suck Worse” message wholeheartedly and not run from it. A series of ads with an opening voice-over saying something like, “The last time Republicans controlled Congress, this is what happened…” would go a long way to driving this potentially winning message home</u>.With so many Bush-era GOP congressional disasters from which to choose – including the heavy-handed Republican attempt to steal Social Security in the name of “privatization,” the Republican votes against border security funding and voting against the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations on immigration and border security – <u>Democrats could end up happier than kids in the proverbial candy store if they just stay with the new message</u>. <br />

In an interview, Rep. Tim <u>Ryan</u> (D-Ohio), the lead sponsor of the China bill under consideration, <u>argued his bill could be “tremendously helpful” to Democrats trying to rally their base in the fall, particularly in the Rust Belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost to China. “A lot of people talk about the enthusiasm gap. A lot of that is labor and union voters,”</u> Ryan said. <u>Taking on China “makes sense to a lot of workers in the industrial Midwest” and will move Democratic and independent voters to the polls, he said. It will convince voters that Democrats are the party that is “going to be on your side, taking on the Chinese</u>.” Treasury Secretary Timothy <u>Geithner will appear before panels in the House and Senate on Thursday to defend the administration’s diplomacy with China, which many Democrats find too weak</u>. <br />

Nervous Democratic incumbents in Congress received a sliver of good news Thursday from a new poll that found them tied with Republicans when people were asked which party they'd vote for in November. However, the bipartisan Politico/George Washington University Battleground Poll found that, by a 9-point margin, most voters still think that the GOP will reclaim control of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Still, when they were asked which party they'd vote for if they had to do it today, both Democrats and Republicans registered 43 percent. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who helped conduct the survey with GOP pollster Ed Goeas, said the results proved that Democratic incumbents weren't as dead in the water as pundits thought. <br />

Carl <u>Paladino stood at the victory podium and bellowed:</u> &quot;Tonight the ruling class knows. They have seen it now. <u>There is a people's revolution</u>.&quot; Paladino, <u>the Tea Party</u>-backed<u>candidate whom New York Republicans nominated for governor on Tuesday, crushed his establishment opponent – a former congressman with a somewhat moderate reputation – by two to one</u>. <u>This was after a campaign in which he went round the state with a pit bull at his side, tried to bury his opponent in demagogic rhetoric about the proposed Manhattan Islamic centre, and likened the Democratic and Orthodox Jewish speaker of the state's lower legislative chamber to Hitler.</u> <u>Within the Tea Party movement, a group that has about as many Jews as an average al-Qaida meeting, such antisemitism was not judged a terribly great offence</u>. In other respects, though, Paladino is an unlikely vanguardist in this revolution against the state: he's a multimillionaire real-estate mogul who makes at least $10m a year leasing office space to various state agencies. (The government is good for some things after all, I guess.) <u>It is unlikely Paladino</u> will defeat Democrat Andrew Cuomo <u>to</u> actually <u>become governor. But he typifies what's going on in the Republican party this year, a process that gathered steam on Tuesday with Paladino's win and Christine O'Donnell's victory in Delaware. She is the eighth Tea Party insurgent to defeat an established Republican in a Senate primary this year, and her win has set off an unprecedented feud</u> between Karl Rove on the one side (who at first said <u>she can't possibly win in November</u>, before rowing back from that the next day) and Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin on the other (who say she can win). <u>Democrats have spent the week rejoicing over O'Donnell's victory. The recent media narrative has been that the Republicans may</u> not only <u>take control of the House</u> of Representatives – which is essentially a conventional-wisdom given – but of <u>the Senate, as well. Winning in Delaware was a necessary ingredient of that mix, so that talk has been stopped cold for the time being.</u><br />

It’s no wonder then that Democrats with defeatist tendencies have bought into it. They are morose and slumped, prematurely assuming the crestfallen posture of a party rejected, rending their garments like a PETA spokeswoman in a meat dress. Sure, some seats will change party control, but a landslide is hardly certain, particularly if Democrats can change their tune and energize their base. <u>A New York Times/CBS News poll released this week asked respondents whom they would vote for in their own districts if the midterms were held today</u>. Among those the poll determined to be likely voters, Republican candidates held a small edge. (Likely voter models are used to make predictions about the midterms.) However, <u>among all registered voters, Democrats held a larger edge</u>. According to a Gallup report issued earlier this month, blacks, women and young adults — many of whom were new voters in 2008 — are “not poised for high turnout on Nov. 2.” Some falloff is to be expected, but the gap this year in electoral interest between blacks and whites and men and women is much wider than in previous midterm elections. <br />

Dems will eventually win- 5 reasons <br />
TIME 8-2-10 [“Why 2010 May Not Be as Dire for the Dems as 1994,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1977313,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1977313,00.html</a>] <br />
<br />
Democrats had hoped that passing health care reform would give them a much-needed bump in the polls ahead of this year's difficult midterm election; instead, their ratings have dipped, renewing worries about a political debacle in November. The worst-case scenario recalls the ghosts of 1994, when Newt Gingrich's Republicans took control of the House following the failure of the Clinton Administration's attempt at health care reform. There are certainly parallels. In 1994, Bill Clinton's favorability poll numbers were at 51%, about where Obama's are now. And the Dems were polarized by a series of tough (and strikingly familiar) issues: a carbon tax, gays in the military and health care. But will history repeat itself, with the party in power bearing the brunt of a wave of discontent? Here are five reasons the 2010 midterm scenario is different, and perhaps less dire for the Democrats, than 1994's. (See the top 10 alternative political movements.) 1.Michael Steele For the Democrats, the Republican National Committee chairman is the gift that keeps on giving. Hardly a week goes by without some gaffe or scandal involving Michael Steele, from his threat to back primary challenges to moderate Republicans who supported the stimulus bill, to this week's episode in which a staffer was fired for taking young donors out for $2,000 worth of &quot;meals&quot; at a risqué lesbian-themed nightclub. That one had top GOP donors and groups such as the Family Research Council openly calling for a boycott of the RNC, urging supporters to instead give their money directly to candidates or congressional committees. At a time when Republicans should be celebrating their momentum, Steele is stealing headlines — and not in a good way. 2. Fundraising Most polls may put the GOP ahead in voter enthusiasm, but that excitement has yet to translate into campaign cash. By the end of February, the National Republican Campaign Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the House, had slightly more than $6 million in the bank, compared with the nearly $20 million held by its Democratic counterpart. The Republican committee in the Senate that finances campaigns had $12.9 million on hand, compared with $14.3 million available to Senate Democrats. And the Republican National Committee trailed the Democratic National Committee, $9.5 million to $10.7 million. The war-chest gap in the House is the most notable, because that chamber is the one Republicans have the highest hopes of recapturing. 3. Tea Parties While a lot of money is going directly to Republican candidates, they're not always the candidates the GOP would prefer to field. In Kentucky, for example, insurgent Tea Party darling Rand Paul has raked in nearly $2 million, outraising the establishment candidate, Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson, by more than $100,000. In Florida, conservative insurgent Marco Rubio has raised more than $3.4 million and is leading Governor Charlie Crist, the presumptive Republican candidate, in the polls. To see the potential dangers of the Tea Party groundswell, the GOP leadership need look no further than the debacle in New York's 23rd district — where Democrats won a Republican safe seat after conservative activists put up a third candidate against Dede Scozzafava, a GOP candidate deemed too moderate by Tea Party types. (Watch a video about the Florida GOP.) 4. Who's the Leader? In 1994, the GOP had Gingrich, an outsize personality whose Contract with America manifesto gave congressional Republicans a simple and accessible platform around which to rally voter discontent. This time, there's no clear-cut, dynamic leader to spearhead the charge and challenge Obama the way Gingrich challenged Clinton. On the other hand, in 1994 no one knew who Democratic House Speaker Tom Foley and Democratic Senate majority leader George Mitchell were. These days, the faces of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid are plastered all over GOP attack ads. 5.Legislative Wins By November 1994, the Democratic presidency had been enfeebled by a series of disastrous setbacks. President Clinton decided right out of the gate to take on the polarizing issue of gays in the military, creating the widely unpopular &quot;Don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy. He also forced through the House an energy tax, known as the BTU tax, that would have charged all fuel sources based on their heat content; the measure failed in the Senate, and many vulnerable House Dems blamed that vote for the loss of their seats. And, of course, Clinton's attempt at health care reform tanked just before the 1994 elections. (See a brief history of gays in the military.) By contrast, Obama has managed to pass the stimulus; is working on a bipartisan solution to DADT, which looks set to pass with relatively little controversy; and passed health care reform after a yearlong struggle. Whatever the bill's faults, health care is a big win. Indeed, many in the Obama Administration argue that all Dems would be far worse off right now if health care had failed. <br />

<u>We'll hear no</u> such <u>subtlety or nuance from Republicans this fall</u>, though. <u>We'll hear thunderous allegations</u> <u>that</u> <u>the Obama administration -- the big, bad federal government --conspired with an unelected federal judge to keep the state of Arizona from enforcing a law that seeks only to kick out of the country a bunch of people who have no right</u> to be here. We'll hear from GOP candidates that Arizona had to act because the federal government refuses to &quot;secure the border.&quot; <u>The fact is that President Obama has sharply increased border enforcement and deportations; the influx of undocumented immigrants is greatly reduced from what it was during the Bush administration</u>. But there Obama goes again, trying to find <u>a sane, moderate course of action</u>. Predictably, he's getting hit from both sides -- the anti-immigrant crowd that claims he's not doing enough, and the pro-immigrant crowd that complains he's doing too much. <u>Immigration wasn't always a partisan issue, but that's what it has become; even John McCain, once a strong advocate of comprehensive reform, now sides with the xenophobes.</u> This is a huge long-term problem for Republicans, who risk becoming branded as the anti-Latino party -- and driving the nation's biggest and fastest-growing minority group into the arms of the Democratic Party for a generation or more. <u>Smart GOP strategists</u> such as Karl Rove understand this danger and have sounded warnings. But their <u>voices are drowned out by those who demand that authorities somehow track down, apprehend and expel the estimated 12 million people here without documents, the vast majority of whom are law-abiding and productive. Anything short of an all-out pogrom is labeled &quot;amnesty&quot;</u> -- the kind of <u>craven surrender</u> favored by such liberal bleeding-hearts as Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. <br />

CP causes a political firestorm amongst independents and Latinos <br />
TIME 7-14-10 [“Will Obama's Immigration Focus Hurt Democrats?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,2003675,00.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,2003675,00.html__</a>] <br />
<br />
Back in 2007, when Rahm Emanuel was in charge of electing Democrats to the House, he famously marveled at how immigration reform had overtaken Social Security as &quot;the third rail of American politics.&quot; Emanuel wasn't the only Democrat who looked at President George W. Bush's failed attempts to push through reform as a giant gift — in the form of the Latino vote — to the Democratic Party. All of the progress Bush had made with Latino voters in 2004 was wiped out by Republican opposition to what critics dubbed an &quot;amnesty&quot; for undocumented immigrants, and that trend continued in 2008, when Latinos supported Obama over McCain by a 35-point margin. But as the Obama White House has tried in recent weeks to show that it is serious about immigration reform, it is fast discovering that third rails harm whoever touches them, Republican or Democrat. This time around, it's not the Latino vote that's most at stake. Instead, western Democrats — egged on by rather large swaths of their moderate white base — are growing increasingly nervous at the Administration's twin push on immigration: the Justice Department's lawsuit against Arizona's tough new immigration law, which asks law enforcement to validate immigration status when pulling people over if they have a reasonable suspicion that that person may be in the country illegally, and President Obama's continued focus on the issue of immigration reform in an election year. (See photos of immigration detention in Arizona.) &quot;The White House's infatuation with immigration reform is a lose-lose proposal for Democrats this election year,&quot; says a senior Democratic aide. &quot;Talk of immigration angers independents, at the same time angering Hispanics because there is more talk and no action just in time for an election. The President would be better served by his advisers if they focused on job creation rather than on hot-button issues like immigration that weaken support for the President, his agenda and Democrats in Congress.&quot; Dealing with immigration for politicians has always come down to a difficult balance between border security and civil rights. It's hard to be tough on one of the issues and not perceived as weak on the other. When Republicans focused on border security in 2005 and 2006, Latino voters viewed them as unsupportive of their civil rights. Conversely, as Democrats have focused on civil rights — whether it be Attorney General Eric Holder's lawsuit against the Arizona law or Obama's push for immigration reform — moderate and conservative white voters see them as falling down on border security. And herein lies many Democrats' frustration with the Administration: for fear of Latino backlash, they have done little to highlight what in reality is Obama's tough enforcement record. <br />

<u>On the Democratic side, which faces a stiff headwind going into this fall’s 2010 elections, this hugely divisive issue does no favors to moderates in swing districts – many of whom are in tough reelection battles. Any legislation that promises a “pathway to citizenship” instantly becomes “amnesty” in Republican attack ads.</u> But on the plus side for Democrats, the issue has the potential to energize a key constituency – Hispanics – who have been lobbying for comprehensive reform for years. <br />

Plan would be a loss for Democrats- unemployment fears <br />
Hornick 7/21/10 (Ed, “Democrats Agenda Running Out of Gas AS Midterms Approach”) <br />
<br />
The reason? As the political phrase goes, &quot;It's the economy stupid.&quot; With high unemployment and worries over the federal debt, other issues seem to pale in comparison. &quot;Some may see immigration and energy as being very important but second to the issue of creating jobs,&quot; said Epstein, former chief minority counsel to the House Judiciary Committee. &quot;It's always difficult to push through immigration reform. It's especially difficult to push through the reform when you're facing 10 percent unemployment.&quot; A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released in May found that42 percent of those surveyed said the economy was the most important issue facing the country today. Only 5 percent said that energy was a top issue; immigration didn't even make the list. In a June CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, 73 percent said things were going badly in the country; 27 percent said things were well. Those statistics are undoubtedly front and center for members of Congress as they head back home to campaign for November elections. The time for legislative work will likely be pushed to the side. For Democrats in close races, any work on controversial issues could hurt them in November. <br />

Voter motivation determines midterms – its about getting people energized <br />

<br />
All elections are about intensity and passion -- and midterm elections are even more so. Democrats saw across-the-board gains in 2006 because the party base as well as lots of Democratic-leaning independents were dead-set on sending President George W. Bush a message. Republicans -- and Republican-leaning independents, on the other hand, were significantly less energized to vote, feeling as though Bush had abandoned them on spending and size of government issues, not to mention the cloud cast by his Administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina. The White House and congressional Democrats insisted that the best political outcome from the passage of the health care bill last month was that it re-energized what had been a very listless party base since Obama's election in 2008. Perhaps. But, the Pew numbers suggest that Republicans today still hold the high ground in the intensity battle heading into the fall campaign. Eliminating that edge may well be impossible -- the party out of power is always more motivated to &quot;throw the bums out&quot; -- but Democrats must find ways to mitigate it if they hope to keep their losses at historic norms (or below) in November. <br />

In his letter to his two colleagues, Mr. Graham said that he was troubled by reports that the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and the White House were planning to take up an immigration measure before the energy bill. Mr. Graham has worked with Democrats in the past on immigration matters and was expected to be an important bridge to Republicans on that issue, as well as on energy. Mr. Graham said that <u>any Senate debate on the highly charged subject of illegal immigration would make it impossible to deal with the difficult issues involved in national energy and global warming policy</u>. He said in his letter that <u>energy must come first and</u> that <u>Democrats appeared to be rushing to take up immigration because of rising anti-immigrant sentiment</u>, including a harsh new measure signed into law in Arizona on Friday. <br />

At issue is the contentious matter of &quot;future flow,&quot; the desire by business for legal temporary worker programs. Unions and business interests are at loggerheads over how to regulate the flow of foreign workers. Organized labor has proposed a government commission to set numbers in order to protect American jobs. Organized business prefers a more market-oriented system. Talks aimed resolving differences have broken down, a dispute that has gone public with the release of opposing statements issued by the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The groups issued dueling press releases following meetings last Thursday between President Obama and immigration reform advocates. &quot;A new temporary worker program in today's economy would be political suicide,&quot; declared AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka in a strongly-worded broadside aimed at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. &quot;American workers are facing a prolonged jobs crisis and nearly 10 percent unemployment, with no sign of recovery in sight. If immigration reform is to have any chance of passing this year, the Chamber of Commerce is going to have to abandon its insistence on the creation of a new temporary worker program and embrace a solution based on real employment needs,&quot; said Trumka on Friday. <br />

<br />
The despair that currently grips the Democratic Party is enhancing the clout of big labor in the party. The AFL-CIO has joined the other big unions - AFSCME and SEIU - in making lavish promises about mobilization and spending this cycle. At the national AFL-CIO conclave Wednesday, union boss Richard Trumka pledged to spend $40 million across 26 states, including more than 70 House races - all fighting &quot;corporate traitors.&quot; With similar pledges from other unions and new rules regarding campaign spending, it's conceivable that big labor could spend more than $150 million - a staggering sum for a midterm election. Every day, another prognosticator has more bad news for Democrats. Today, Larry Sabato predicts a 47-seat gain for Republicans in the House and says the Senate is &quot;on the bubble.&quot; While Democrats continue to enjoy the cash cushion provided by easier fundraising in the majority, the party is in dire need of help, especially when it comes time to get out the vote. Trumka is offering a hand - and showing his muscle. The union has already put up a Labor Day ad that shows blue-collar workers in old economy jobs - lots of steel and hard hats, not the kind of clean, green jobs imagined by the Obama Democrats. The AFL-CIO still relies on manufacturing and industry for its dues. Like the Teamsters, the AFL-CIO has never fully embraced the Democratic agenda on the environment. The other big unions - SEIU and AFSCME - focus on government workers and low-wage service employees. Then-candidate Obama is definitely an SEIU man, using union president Andy Stern as an adviser and seeing huge expenditures on his behalf - SEIU spent more than $85 million in 2008. But Stern is gone and the SEIU is tapped out. And while the group promises big political spending this cycle, it's not clear what will qualify as &quot;political.&quot; Perhaps new member outreach (that includes handing out voter registration cards) among immigrant service workers in the southwest would qualify. Whatever it is, it seems unlikely that the SEIU will bring the kind of money to bear this year in direct campaign spending as it did during the Stern-Obama salad days. Government workers have done the best in the Obama era and AFSCME will no doubt be out in force to show their thanks. While the group has never made the kind of political expenditures as the other big unions, it provides tens of thousands of Democratic ground troops on Election Day. But the Obama era has not been as good as labor had hoped. Some choice picks to key appointments and some stimulus spending, yes,. But not Card Check or the kind of infrastructure spending that the blue-collar workers of the high-wage, high-dues unions wanted to see. When unions spent millions to try to defeat White House-backed Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas Democratic primary, it was a warning shot to be sure. Rest assured that Democrats are very busy these days assuring big labor that if they are allowed to keep the majority for another cycle, unions will have more to show for it. <br />

Different clouds have different effects—cancelling out the benefits: <br />
Michaels &amp; Balling, 2000 (The satanic gases : clearing the air about global warming; 60) <br />
Even more difficult is cloud type. <u>Low, puffy clouds, such as stratus and the familiar fair-weather cumulus, are so bright that their ability to reflect the sun's radiation from above exceeds their ability to trap heat</u> (via the greenhouse mechanism) from below. <u>Consequently, low-level clouds are net coolers of the surface temperature</u>, and increasing their coverage results in a drop in global mean surface temperature. <u>Above roughly 20,000 feet in the midlatitudes, most clouds are ice crystals. The prime example is the feathery cirrus cloud.</u> The optical thinness of these clouds (you can usually see the sun through them) means that they are reflecting not nearly so much radiation as the lower cumulus clouds; and, in the case of thin cirrus, <u>the effect is a slight net warming as their greenhouse effect overtakes their albedo effect.</u><br />

Office of Tax Policy, 2007 (U.S. Department of the Treasury). December 20, 2007. “Approaches to Improve the Competitiveness of the U.S. Business Tax System for the 21st Century.” Accessed Sept. 12, 2010 at <br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/hp749_approachesstudy.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/hp749_approachesstudy.pdf__</a><br />
<br />
On July 26, 2007, the Treasury Department hosted a conference on Global Competitiveness and Business Tax Reform that brought together distinguished leaders and experts to discuss how the U.S. business tax system could be improved to make U.S. businesses more competitive. The conference highlighted the need for the U.S. business tax system to be reformed to keep pace with the changing global economy and the changes in the business tax systems of other nations. This report is a follow-up to the July 26th conference and, as with the conference, it seeks to advance an important dialogue on the key linkages between tax policy and American competitiveness in the global economy. Three broad approaches for reforming the U.S. business tax system are outlined: (1) replacing business income taxes with a business activities tax (BAT), a type of consumption tax, (2) eliminating special business tax provisions coupled with either business tax rate reduction or faster write-off of business investment, potentially combined with the exemption of active foreign earnings, and (3) implementing specific changes that focus on important structural problems within our business tax system. Rather than present a particular recommendation, this report examines the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches. The various policy ideas discussed in this report represent just some of the approaches that could be considered. This report does not advocate any specific recommendation nor does it call for or advance any legislative package or regulatory changes. The approaches discussed in this report would improve the competitiveness of the United States as compared to the current system for taxing U.S. businesses. Nevertheless, the approaches differ in a number of dimensions. The BAT described in Chapter II would possibly provide the largest benefit in terms of its effect on expanding the size of the economy – ultimately increasing output by roughly 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent – but raises a number of serious implementation and administrative issues. Chapter III discusses base broadening, which could entail elimination of certain business tax provisions that make substantial contributions to economic growth, such as accelerated deprecation. Thus their elimination may offset some of the economic benefits of business tax rate reduction. While dramatically broadening the business tax base could finance a reduction of the business tax rate to 28 percent, retaining accelerated depreciation and maintaining revenue neutrality would only lower the business tax rate to 31 percent. Alternatively, base broadening and faster write-off of business investment (i.e., 35-percent expensing) would have a substantial effect on the size of the economy – ultimately increasing output by roughly 1.5 percent – but would have effects that may vary considerably across industries and sectors. Chapter III also discusses international taxation and considers issues regarding territorial tax systems. iii Chapter IV focuses on specific areas of business income taxation that could be reformed separately or in the context of a broad-based reform. These include, for example, the multiple taxation of corporate profits, the tax bias favoring debt finance, the tax treatment of losses, and book-tax conformity. A comprehensive approach, however, is likely to be more effective in improving the competitiveness of the U.S. business tax system than addressing specific issues outside of broad-based business tax reform. A fundamental question is the extent to which any of these approaches would markedly affect the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. Lowering the business tax rate to 31 percent would mean that instead of having the second highest statutory corporate tax rate among the thirty OECD countries, the United States would have the third highest tax rate, while with a 28-percent U.S. statutory corporate tax rate, the United States would have the fifth highest tax rate. Providing faster write-off of investment, either through partial expensing or replacing business income taxes with a BAT, may provide larger economic benefits, but would take the United States in a different policy direction. Moreover, today’s global landscape continues to shift as other countries contemplate further changes in their business tax systems. Thus, it remains unclear whether a revenue neutral reform would provide a reduction in business taxes sufficient to enhance the competitiveness of U.S. businesses. In summary, because the role of the United States in the world economy is changing, because business taxes play an important role in economic decision-making by influencing the incentive to acquire and use capital, and because foreign competitors are reforming their business tax systems, now is the time for the United States to re-evaluate its business tax system to ensure that U.S. businesses and U.S. workers are as competitive as possible and Americans continue to enjoy rising living standards. <br />

Robust action to re-establish trust The relatively upbeat mood of the PCAST meeting reflected the window of opportunity that currently exists for a new era of partnership between US and developing world scientists. The demand for effective collaborations with the US scientific community is out there, and it is growing. And, at least in its rhetoric, the Obama administration seems willing to both listen and respond. Now, <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">nothing would do more</span> to assure developing countries that US aid efforts are genuinely intended to help them — rather than simply promote US interests — than a robust, long-term commitment to support true scientific alliances, <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;">backed by the type of funding</span> that seems to emerge all too easily when it comes to supplying military assistance. To flourish, such partnerships need a strong framework that also protects them from the short-term horizons and political contingencies of much of foreign policy. Establishing such a framework now could help re-establish some of the rapidly-eroding international trust in the Obama administration. <br />

The plan turns workers into indentured servants <br />
Fulmer ’09 [Christopher, J.D., Lewis &amp; Clark School, “Note and Comment: A Critical Look At the H-1B Visa Program And Its Effects On U.S. And Foreign Workers- A Controversial Program Unhinged From Its Original Intent, lexis] <br />
<br />
<u>Finally, the H-1B program has raised troubling issues that stem from the relatively powerless position that many foreign workers occupy while in the United States.</u> n36 <u>There are documented cases of unscrupulous employers who force foreign workers into adhesion contracts, de facto indentured servitude, and in some extreme cases, resort to psychological mistreatment. The current legal framework permits employers to wield power over foreign workers in other ways, such as forced loyalty and the power to deport</u>. In order to effect meaningful change to the H-1B visa, the interests and protection of both American and foreign workers must be kept in mind. The legal protections that actually exist should be identified and clarified before one can formulate solutions. <u>This raises another point of disagreement -</u> <u>whether current statutory protections provide an adequate basis for increased enforcement, or whether those protections are so insufficient that enforcing them would allow the most serious abuses to continue unchecked</u>. <br />

H-1Bs allow men to justify domestic violence and spousal abuse <br />

H-1B visas are among the few nonimmigrant visa categories that allow “dual intent,” which means that one can apply to become a legal permanent resident while on an H-1B visa. Because H-1B visas are issued by [End Page 165] employers, however, they retain the power to sponsor an employee for a green card (Sullivan and Bennet 2005). In these situations, the visa holder is entirely at the mercy of the employer, who wields total control over the employee’s citizenship status. As Mehtrotra explains, “You’re basically a total slave to your employer so if your employer decides they want you permanently then they can go through a process to sponsor you for a green card. But they can also decide they don’t want to sponsor you and say, ‘Okay, your visa is up’” (Mehrotra, interview by the author). According to Kavitha Sreeharsha, an attorney at Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach in San Francisco, the theory behind the law and the lack of protections for the H-4 spouse is that “the U.S. is not going to give someone a benefit that they wouldn’t have otherwise received,” especially since the United States expects them to return to their home country (Kavitha Sreeharsha, staff attorney, Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach, and board member, Narika, interview by the author, San Francisco, October 14, 2004). In reality, Sreeharsha explains, most workers who come to the United States on an H-1B visa do ultimately get sponsored for a green card. This provides no security for a woman experiencing abuse, however, because her legal status remains conditioned on her spouse and this presents a problem if she decides to leave the abuser (the primary visa holder) before he obtains his green card. If a woman files for divorce during the period in which the green card process is taking place, then she can fall “out of status,” or essentially become undocumented in the eyes of the law. A related issue in these situations is the fact that abusive husbands often keep their wives uninformed about whether their employer is sponsoring them for a green card. In addition, men will hold their spouse’s passports and other documentation hostage in an effort to prevent them from attempting to leave (Shah 2005). Lack of access to this information presents a significant advocacy challenge because in order for a woman to change her visa status she must submit documentation that proves that her spouse is in the United States legally (Shah 2004). According to advocates, sometimes an abusive spouse is able to convince the immigration attorney representing both parties that his wife wants to withdraw her green card application. This can also put her legal status in jeopardy (Shah 2004). In what could be described as the most extreme cases of spousal control, women married to H-1B visa holders have been coerced into relinquishing custody of their children in order to get access to their immigration documents (Bhuyan 2007).

Patriarchy increases violence, wars, and dooms us all to extinction. <br />
Betty Reardon, Director, Peace Education Program, Columbia, WOMEN AND PEACE, 1993, pp. 30-1. <br />
<br />
A clearly visible element in the escalating tensions among militarized nations is the macho posturing and the patriarchal ideal of dominance, not parity, which motivates defense ministers and government leaders to “strut their stuff” as we watch with increasing horror. <u>Most men in our patriarchal culture are still acting out old patterns that are radically inappropriate for the nuclear age. To prove dominance and control, to distance one’s character from that of women, to survive the toughest violent initiation, to shed the sacred blood of the hero, to collaborate with death in order to hold it at bay all of these patriarchal pressures on men have traditionally reached resolution in ritual fashion on the battlefield.</u> But there is no longer any battlefield. <u>Does anyone seriously believe that if a nuclear power were losing a crucial, large-scale conventional war it would refrain from using its multiple-warhead nuclear missiles because of some diplomatic agreement? The military theater of a nuclear exchange today would extend, instantly or eventually, to all living things, all the air, all the soil, all the water. If we believe that war is a “necessary evil,” that patriarchal assumptions are simply “human nature,” then we are locked into a lie, paralyzed. The ultimate result of unchecked terminal patriarchy will be nuclear holocaust.</u><br />
<br />
Causes unchecked biopower, makes life meaningless <br />

<br />
As I reflected on all this, I realized that one of the things passed on from slavery, which continues in the oppression of people of color, is a belief structure rooted in a concept of black (or brown, or red) anti-will, the antithetical embodiment of pure will. We live in a society in which the closest equivalent of nobility is the display of unremittingly controlled willfulness. To be perceived as unremittingly will-less is to be imbued with an almost lethal trait. Manyscholars have explained this phenomenon in terms of total and infantilizing interdependency of dominant and oppressed.6 Consider, for example, Mark Tushnet's distinction between slave law's totalistic view of personality and the bourgeois &quot;pure will&quot; theory of personality: &quot;Social relations in slave society rest upon the interaction of owner with slave; the owner, having total dominion over the slave. In contrast, bourgeois social relations rest upon the paradigmatic instance of market relations, the purchase by a capitalist of a worker's personality. Slave relations are total, engaging the master and slave in exchanges in which each must take account of the entire range of belief, feeling, and interest embodied by the other; bourgeois social relations are partial, requiring only that participants in a market evaluate their general productive characteristics without regard to aspects of personality unrelated to production.&quot;7 <br />

<br />
There is probably something in humans and in every generation that makes us think that the problems we face are uniquely difficult. Much has been written about the economy and, if you accept certain assumptions from what you read, you might think that we are in the midst of a global depression. Yet, it is important to put the current economy in perspective. We might even try reviewing and analyzing some objective data. Last quarter, GDP fell at a rate of 0.5%, which means that the total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. fell by a half of one percentage point last quarter over the previous quarter. (1) For the first two quarters of this year, GDP grew by 0.9% and 2.8%, indicating that economic growth is relatively flat this year, but that it is not falling off a cliff. This isn’t the first time GDP has fallen and it won’t be the last. A decrease in GDP after almost 6 years of increases is not positive, but almost predictable. No economy grows indefinitely and consistently; there are always temporary lapses. In fact, if you consider the media coverage of the economy over the past year and the consequent way people have been scared, it is remarkable that anyone is buying anything. Some would say that we cannot only look at GDP, so let’s look at other factors. Interest rates remain at historically low levels. (2) This means that if you want to borrow money, you can borrow money inexpensively as a bus iness or as a person. Loan volume in the country, according to the FDIC and contrary to what you read about the credit crisis, actually increased last quarter compared to the same quarter last year. (3) Someone is getting loans and they are not paying excessive interest rates for them. How about employment? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment sits at 6.7%. At this time last year, unemployment was 4.7%. The decrease in employment is not favorable, but historically an unemployment rate of 6.7% is not close to devastating. The 50-year historical rate of unemployment is 5.97%. (4) Most economists agree that the natural rate of unemployment, which is the lowest rate due to the fact that people change jobs or are between jobs, is around 4%. So, today we sit at 2.7% above that rate. Once again, the very recent trend is not good but it is certainly not horrifying. I have noticed many recent media references to the Great Depression (the period of time between late 1929 and around 1938 or so, depending upon the definitions used and personal inclinations). It might be illuminating to note that by 1933, during the height of the Depression, the unemployment rate was 24.9%. During that same time period, GDP was falling dramatically, which created a devastating impact on the country. Americans have good hearts and empathize (as they should) with those who are unemployed, yet it would be easy to go too far in our assumptions on how the working population is currently affected in aggregate. If 6% of the people are unemployed, approximately 94% of the people are working. We should always shoot for full employment, but why would we view our efforts as poor when we don’t quite make that mark? A good student might try to get straight A’s, but getting an occasional “B” or “C” won’t end the world. Look at personal income today Personal income is income received by individuals from all sources, including employers and the government. Personal income rose last quartercompared to a year ago according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Compared to five years ago, personal income has risen by 32.1% . Even considering that inflation was 18.13% over this period, people are generally making more money than they used to. This is another one of those statistics that can easily get bent to fit a story. You often hear things like “personal income fell last month by 23%”, but writers tend to leave larger and more important statistics out. In this case, wouldn’t you be more interested in trends over a quarter or a year? using isolated statistics to fit your view is something that has become accepted and rarely challenged. Next, there is inflation The inflation rate measures the strength of the dollar you hold today as compared to a year ago. The inflation rate is currently 3.66%. Over the past 50 years, the inflation rate has averaged about 4.2% . Inflation remains well within control. Yet, would you be surprised to read a story next month citing an X% jump in inflation over the last day, month? I wouldn’t be. (Ironically, the one thing about the economy that is alarming from a historical standpoint is our national debt, which gets some but not enough media coverage. We now owe $10.6 trillion and have become a debtor nation over the past several decades. We now depend on the goodwill and investments of outside countries, while we continue to spend more than we make). Now, the skeptics reading this will undoudebtly point to other (I believe, far lesser) statistics that validate their gloomy view of the economy and the direction of the country. I ask the reader: if people are employed, are making good wages, can borrow inexpensively, hold a dollar that is worth largely what it was worth a year or five years ago, and live in a country where the value of goods and services is rising, tell me exactly where the crisis is? There is no doubt that the economy has slowed, but slowness does not equal death. It is true that the financial markets are a mess (and the depreciation of the value of equities is both scary and bad), but analysts typically go too far in ascribing the fall of the financial markets with the fall of a whole economy. The markets are an important component of the economy, but the markets are not the totality of the economy. No one can say whether conditions will worsen in the future. However, we have learned that the United States economy has been tremendously resilient over the past 200 years and will probably remain so, as long as the structural philosophies that it has been built upon are left intact. Americans are hard-working and innovative people and the country will be just fine. <br />

No CCP collapse—the government represses instability <br />

It might seem reasonable to expect that challenges from the disaffected urban middle class, frustrated college graduates, and unemployed migrants will constitute the principal threat to the party's rule. If those groups were in fact to band together in a powerful coalition, then the world's longest-ruling party would indeed be in deep trouble. But that is not going to happen. Such <u>a revolutionary scenario overlooks two critical forces blocking political change in China</u> and similar authoritarian political systems: <u>the regime's capacity for repression and the unity among the elite</u>. <u>Economic crisis and social unrest may make it tougher for the CCP to govern, but they will not loosen the party's hold on power. A glance at countries such as Zimbabwe, North Korea, Cuba, and Burma shows that</u>a relatively <u>unified elite in control of the military and police can cling to power through brutal force, even in the face of abysmal economic failure</u>. Disunity within the ruling elite, on the other hand, weakens the regime's repressive capacity and usually spells the rulers' doom. <u>The CCP has already demonstrated its remarkable ability to contain and suppress chronic social protest and small-scale dissident movements. The regime maintains the People's Armed Police</u>, a well-trained and well-equipped anti-riot force of 250,000. In addition, <u>China's secret police are among the most capable in the world</u> and are augmented by a vast network of informers. And although the Internet may have made control of information more difficult, <u>Chinese censors</u> can still <u>react quickly and thoroughly to end the dissemination of dangerous news</u>. Since the Tiananmen crackdown, the Chinese government has greatly refined its repressive capabilities. <u>Responding to tens of thousands of riots each year has made Chinese law enforcement the most experienced in the world at crowd control and dispersion</u>. Chinese state security services have applied the tactic of &quot;political decapitation&quot; to great effect, quickly arresting protest leaders and leaving their followers disorganized, demoralized, and impotent. If worsening economic conditions lead to a potentially explosive political situation, the party will stick to these tried-and-true practices to ward off any organized movement against the regime. <br />

Economic decline won’t cause war <br />

Poverty Wars. In a second scenario, declining living standards first cause internal turmoil. then war. If groups at all levels of affluence protect their standard of living by pushing deprivation on other groups class war and revolutionary upheavals could result. Faced with these pressures, liberal democracy and free market systems could increasingly be replaced by authoritarian systems capable of maintaining minimum order.9 If authoritarian regimes are more war-prone because they lack democratic control, and if revolutionary regimes are warprone because of their ideological fervor and isolation, then the world is likely to become more violent. <u>The record of previous depressions supports the proposition that widespread economic stagnation and unmet economic expectations contribute to international conflict</u>. <u>Although initially compelling, this scenario has major flaws</u>. <u>One is that it is arguably based on unsound economic theory</u>.<u>Wealth is formed not</u> so much <u>by the availability of cheap natural resources as by capital formation through savings and more efficient production</u>. <u>Many resource-poor countries</u>, like Japan, <u>are very wealthy, while many countries with more extensive resources are poor</u>. Environmental constraints require an end to economic growth based on growing use of raw materials, but not necessarily an end to growth in the production of goods and services. <u>In addition, economic decline does not necessarily produce conflict.</u> <u>How societies respond to economic decline may largely depend upon the rate at which such declines occur</u>. <u>And as people get poorer, they may become less willing to spend scarce resources for military forces</u>. <u>As</u> Bernard <u>Brodie observed</u> about the modein era, <u>“The predisposing factors to military aggression are full bellies, not empty ones</u>.”’” <u>The experience of economic depressions over the last two centuries may be irrelevant, because such depressions were characterized by under-utilized production capacity and falling resource prices</u>. <u>In the 1930 increased military spending stimulated economies, but</u> if economic growth is retarded by environmental constraints, <u>military spending will exacerbate the problem</u>. Power Wars. A third scenario is that environmental degradation might cause war by altering the relative power of states; that is, newly stronger states may be tempted to prey upon the newly weaker ones, or weakened states may attack and lock in their positions before their power ebbs firther. But such alterations might not lead to war as readily as the lessons of history suggest, <u>because economic power and military power are not as tightly coupled as in the past.</u> The economic power positions of Germany and Japan have changed greatly since World War 11, but these changes have not been accompanied by war or threat of war. <u>In the contemporary world, whole industries rise, fall, and relocate, causing substantial</u> <u>fluctuations in the economic well-being of regions and peoples without producing wars.</u> <u>There is no reason to believe that changes in relative wealth and power</u> caused by the uneven impact of environmental degradation <u>would inevitably lead to war</u>. <u>Even if</u> environmental <u>degradation were to destroy the basic</u> social and <u>economic fabric of a country</u> or region, <u>the impact on international order may not be very great. Among the first casualties in such country would be the capacity to wage war.</u> <u>The poor and wretched</u> of the earth may be able to deny an outside aggressor an easy conquest, but they <u>are themselves a minimal threat to other states.</u> <u>Contemporary offensive military operations require complex organizational skills, specialized industrial products and surplus wealth</u>. <br />

US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) figures show that <u>for the third year in a row, a steep decline continues in utilization of the H-1B visa programme. Current figures for petitions received show that only a fraction of the available annual cap of 85,000 has been used so far this year. The slowdown in demand is similar to 2009</u>, when the H-1B annual cap was not reached until late December. <u>The number of new H-1B visas issued continues to decline from a peak in FY2007</u>, when initial petition approvals crested at 120,031,(2) including cap-exempt users such as university and research institute employees. Initial H-1B petitions approved further fell off to 86,300 (FY2009) from 109,335 (FY2008).(3) FY2010 H-1B report shows continuing trends In 1998 Congress mandated that Immigration and Nationality Services publish an Annual Report on Characteristics of Specialty Occupation Workers. There is now a full decade of reports on H-1B workers. USCIS has just released the 2010 version, Characteristics of H-1B Specialty Occupation Workers: USCIS Report, which shows the continuation of a rapid fall-off in demand for H-1B visas that started in FY2007.(4) <u>Some of this decline is no doubt a response to a worsening domestic economy. However, the decline in H-1B utilization began well before the general financial collapse of the third quarter of 2008. The drop in demand for H-1B visas can instead be attributed to a dramatic increase in costs and risks to business immigration users due to increasingly severe USCIS enforcement and compliance pressures. The drop in demand is part of an across-the-board decline in business demand for immigration services,(5) particularly impacting on IT consulting companies that place workers at third-party client worksites</u>. As issuances of new H-1B visas have fallen by more than 40% between FY2007 and FY2009, the pace of corporate outsourcing and offshoring by US companies has continued to accelerate. This casts one of the key assumptions of the H-1B critics – that the programme is directly connected with layoffs of US workers – into doubt. <br />

Software lobby group Nasscom said <u>Indian IT companies are increasingly hiring U.S. citizens, which has led to a drop in their penchant for H-1B visas</u>. &quot;Traditionally, lots of Indian companies wanting to hire U.S. citizens could not do so because of high costs and difficulty in finding talent. The downturn has reversed the trend,&quot; said Ameet Nivsarkar, Vice President, Nasscom. <u>TCS</u>, for example, <u>hired 225 U.S. based associates</u> for its Cincinatti centre in Ohio, scaling its American head count to 300. <u>&quot;We did not feel a need to file for H-1B visas last year. We had already made provisions for our onsite needs,&quot;</u> said a TCS spokesperson. The company is likely to keep off H-1B this year too. &quot;It's a good insurance against any more restrictive visa policies, which encourages local employment. It also positions us well for certainly state government business,&quot; said Azim Premji, Chairman, Wipro. <u>&quot;Both American and Indian firms are wary of applying for an H-1B as the government is going over applications with a fine-tooth comb</u>. If companies have not hired U.S. citizens over one year or offered the same job to them, a visa application has a high chance of getting rejected,&quot; said an immigration consultant based near Union Square in San Francisco. &quot;And rejections spoil a company's brand name,&quot; he said, requesting anonymity as he has had a large number of rejection cases this year. <u>IT watchers presage up to 20,000 workers returning to India in a year. Many H-1B visa holders are said to be posting resumes on Indian recruitment websites</u>. An upshot of visa non-renewal is workers having to dispose of assets prematurely. A notable example is mortgaged cars dumped at airports. <u>The lure of H-1B visas is also fading because of a sharp drop in wages. A job in India suddenly appears more attractive, given that it offers up to a 14 percent annual growth against a three percent rise at US tech firms</u>. <br />

<u>Harvard Business School’s Class of 2010 will send 900 new MBAs out into the job market, but one-third who are non-U.S. citizens will be effectively off limits for recruiters from Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs</u>. All three companies recruit on Harvard’s campus but now fall under new restrictions on H-1B visas, the primary vehicle for hiring foreign students graduating from U.S. universities.<u>The new H-1B restrictions</u>, which are part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 signed into law on February 17, <u>apply to any company receiving Troubled Assets Relief Program funds</u>. If Citigroup, for instance, wants to hire Stanford University’s top Ph.D. computer science graduate and that graduate happens to be an Indian nonresident, <u>Citigroup’s recruiters will find that their hands are tied because the company is covered under the new law</u>. Still, Harvard’s 297 non-U.S. citizen MBAs likely will find work elsewhere; so will the 274 non-U.S. citizen MBA graduates from MIT’s Sloan School and the 320 non-U.S. citizen graduates from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School—40 percent of its MBA class. The foreign companies that routinely recruit at the top U.S. business schools will welcome these MBAs, while some of the largest and best-known U.S. companies will lose their first-choice candidates to overseas competitors. &quot;<u>Most employers receiving federal funds will not take the risk of filing H-1B petitions because the new requirements are almost impossible to comply with,&quot;</u> says Jim Alexander, managing partner at Maggio &amp; Kattar, an immigration law firm based in Washington. <u>The jobs filled by H-1B visa candidates</u> each year represent less than one-twentieth of 1 percent of total U.S. employment, but <u>were singled out for special protection under the $787 billion stimulus act</u>. In fact, <u>the congressional debates about this minuscule number of jobs unleashed a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment that could threaten the entire H-1B category and deter the most talented students and workers worldwide from looking for or accepting employment in the United States</u>. <br />

<u>Why would such talented people voluntarily leave Silicon Valley</u>, a place that remains the hottest hotbed of technology innovation on Earth? Or to leave other promising locales such as New York City, Boston and the Research Triangle area of North Carolina? My team of researchers at Duke, Harvard and Berkeley polled 1203 returnees to India and China during the second half of 2008 to find answers to exactly this question. What we found should concern even the most boisterous Silicon Valley boosters. We learned that these workers returned in their prime: the average age of the Indian returnees was 30 and the Chinese was 33. They were really well educated: 51% of the Chinese held masters degrees and 41% had PhDs. Among Indians, 66% held a masters and 12% had PhDs. These degrees were mostly in management, technology, and science. Clearly these returnees are in the U.S. population's educational top tier?precisely the kind of people who can make the greatest contribution to an economy's innovation and growth. And it isn't just new immigrants who are returning home, we learned. Some 27% of the Indians and 34% of the Chinese had permanent resident status or were U.S. citizens. That's right, it's not just about green cards. What propelled them to return home? <u>Some 84% of the Chinese and 69% of the Indians cited professional opportunities. And while they make less money in absolute terms at home, most said their salaries brought a &quot;better quality of life&quot; than what they had in the U.S.</u> (There was also some reverse culture shock?complaints about congestion in India, say, and pollution in China.) <u>When it came to social factors, 67% of the Chinese and 80% of the Indians cited better &quot;family values&quot; at home. Ability to care for aging parents was also cited, and this may be a hidden visa factor: it's much harder to bring parents and other family members over to the U.S. than in the past. For the vast majority of returnees, a longing for family and friends was also a crucial element. A return ticket home also put their career on steroids</u>. About 10% of the Indians polled had held senior management jobs in the U.S. That number rose to 44% after they returned home. Among the Chinese, the number rose from 9% in the U.S. to 36% in China. When we asked what was better about the U.S. than home, 54% of Indian and 43% of Chinese said that total financial compensation for their previous U.S. positions was better than at home. Health-care benefits were also considered somewhat better in the United States by 51 percent of Chinese respondents, versus 21 percent who thought it was better in their home country. (Indian respondents were split more evenly on this). <br />

Even if they attract workers, they don’t solve- <br />
<br />
A. Not enough green cards <br />

<br />
<u>The</u> legal permanent resident (<u>green card) program is important predominantly as a tool to maintain rather than expand the existing high-skilled workforce in the United States. More than 90 percent of the green cards are issued via adjustment of status</u> (e.g., from H-1B temporary worker to legal permanent resident) <u>requested for high-skilled foreigners already residing and most likely employed in the United States. But national bottlenecks in the current green card system</u> (e.g., per-country limits for countries such as India and China, long waiting periods, and costly and time-consuming application process) <u>may force many employed high-skilled workers to leave the United States once their temporary visas expire</u>. <br />
<br />
<br />
B. Workers aren’t high-skilled <br />
Fulmer ’09 [Christopher, J.D., Lewis &amp; Clark School, “Note and Comment: A Critical Look At the H-1B Visa Program And Its Effects On U.S. And Foreign Workers- A Controversial Program Unhinged From Its Original Intent, lexis] <br />
<br />
Besides the claim that the H-1B program provides &quot;cheap labor&quot; is the criticism that <u>most &quot;H-1Bs are ordinary people, doing ordinary work.&quot; n244 Clearly, the &quot;highly specialized knowledge&quot; standard imposed by H-1B law does not seem to encompass &quot;ordinary work.&quot; An analysis of the DOL's four-tier method</u> n245 <u>for assessing level of skill is illustrative in that employers rated fifty-six percent of their H-1B workers at Level I (entry level).</u> n246 Employees rated at Level I are &quot;beginning level employees <u>who</u> <u>have only a basic understanding of the occupation</u> [and who] perform routine tasks that require limited, if any, exercise of judgment.&quot; n247 <u>Thirty-one percent were rated at Level II (qualified),</u> n248 <u>which applies to &quot;qualified employees who have attained, either through education or [*852] experience, a good understanding of the occupation</u>.&quot; n249 Two conclusions can be drawn from the rating of most H-1B workers at Levels I and II: <u>either they really are &quot;ordinary people, doing ordinary work,&quot; or employers are misrepresenting a worker's skill level in order to obtain a lower prevailing wage. Only eight percent were classified at Level III (experienced), and five percent at Level IV (fully competent).</u> n250 Level III applies to &quot;experienced employees who have a sound understanding of the occupation and have attained, either through education or experience, special skills or knowledge.&quot; n251 Given the similarity of the wording of Level III skill and the &quot;highly specialized knowledge&quot; standard imposed by H-1B law, it seems odd that only thirteen percent of H-1B workers are classified at Level III or higher. If a worker meets both prongs of the legal standard, i.e., she has the required specialized degree and is able to apply that body of highly specialized knowledge, the language in DOL's prevailing wage determination guideline suggests she should be classified above Level II. <br />

C. Job limitations kill flexibility <br />
Wadhwa ’09 [Vivek, executive in residence for the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University and a senior research associate in the labor and work-life program at Harvard Law School, “America's Perilous Anti-Immigrant Protectionism,” April 15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2009/tc20090415_771803.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2009/tc20090415_771803.htm</a>] <br />
<br />
These same skilled foreigners are far more likely to start technology businesses than the general populace. India-born immigrants, for example, constitute less than 1% of the U.S. population. Yet they started 6.7% of the nation's tech companies. So immigration is actually an economic multiplier. But it can work both ways. Send those smart brains back home, and India and China will reap many of the benefits we forfeit. None of this is to say that the H-1B program is perfect; it's actually bad. <u>By limiting career mobility and travel, the H-1B program can be used to do the negative things critics accuse it of. A far more open immigration policy, without H-1B wage and career restrictions for science and technology workers, would be a better solution</u>. This is what Canada and Singapore have done, with great success. We want more engineers and scientists; they help make the pie bigger by creating jobs and boosting innovation. A software engineer working at a big bank can go on to launch the next Google (GOOG). An equity analyst pumping out spreadsheets could later build the next Mint.com. Silicon Valley startups are rife with numerically astute Wall Street refugees. And <u>by putting them in a box at the immigration application window, we discount future possibilities and give lie to the notion of America as the land of limitless opportunity</u>. <br />
<br />
And, plan hurts the economy- <br />
<br />
A. Causes overdependence that leads to global talent shortages <br />
Edward ‘09 [Gordon, “The global talent crisis: contrary to popular opinion, there are plenty of open jobs. What's missing are candidates with skills,” The Futurist, September 1,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/labor-employment/working-hours-patterns-part/12775419-1.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.allbusiness.com/labor-employment/working-hours-patterns-part/12775419-1.html__</a>] <br />
<br />
Over the last 10 years, the real U.S. economy did grow. Unfortunately, too much of the wealth created was based on short-term financial speculation all around the globe and the manipulation of exotic financial instruments. The tech-based U.S. economy failed to invest enough longterm resources to educate the nation’s youth, preparing them to work in the next wave of emerging science, technology, engineering, or mathematically based (STEM) jobs. While much attention has been focused on how many millions of lowskill U.S. jobs have been outsourced, little notice has been paid to how many millions of high-pay, high-skill tech jobs have been outsourced to Europe, Japan, Singapore, or other countries with well-educated labor pools. Meanwhile, U.S. businesses are importing STEM talent from abroad using H-1B visas to keep the nation’s tech-based economy operating. The United States has outsourced advanced technological production, design, and management capacity. Also, many U.S. industries have become over-reliant on H-1B “specialty occupation” visas to import workers from overseas. However, over the next decade, U.S. companies will have trouble building new high-tech factories in high-skill countries like South Korea, Japan, or Germany, be- need for talent grows, even China’s and India’s educational systems will not be able to produce enough qualified graduates for themselves, let alone act as safety valves for the rest of the world. But the heart of this issue is the seldom understood fact that the education-to-employment system worldwide is badly out of date. The United States and most other nations are not producing enough graduates with the kinds of technical, communications, and thinking skills needed in the twenty-first-century workplace. <br />
<br />
B. Causes outsourcing that hurts our markets and helps our competitors <br />
Fulmer ’09 [Christopher, J.D., Lewis &amp; Clark School, “Note and Comment: A Critical Look At the H-1B Visa Program And Its Effects On U.S. And Foreign Workers- A Controversial Program Unhinged From Its Original Intent, lexis] <br />
<br />
<u>Another weakness of the H-1B program is that it can be manipulated to allow foreign companies to strengthen their overseas position and hurt American workers in the process</u>. According to a 2006 list, <u>five of the top ten companies receiving the most H-1B visas were Indian job shops, or outsourcers</u>. n252 Nearly one-third, or 19,512 of the 65,000 visas allotted for nonexempt H-1Bs, were granted to nine Indian outsourcers. n253 India's Commerce Minister Kamal <u>Nath has dubbed H-1B &quot;the outsourcing visa&quot; because it allows outsourcers to &quot;gain expertise and win contracts from Western companies to transfer critical operations to places like Bangalore.&quot;</u> n254 &quot;&quot;To deliver the solutions from a remote environment ... you need a certain number of people being with a customer, understanding his needs and collecting the requirements,'&quot; says the chairman of Satyam Computer Services, number five on the list of top visa recipients. n255 <u>The primary benefit to an offshore outsourcer using the H-1B visa is knowledge transfer</u>. n256 <u>Foreign workers spend time with their U.S. clients</u>, [*853]<u>observing and learning their operations, before taking their newly acquired knowledge back to their home country</u> where the same work can be done more efficiently and at a fraction of the cost. Not uncommonly, <u>American workers are forced to cooperate and train their H-1B replacements as a condition of receiving a severance package. &quot;A bodyshop allows the employer to say it never hired any H-1B workers, and the bodyshop can in turn say it never fired any Americans.&quot;</u> n257 <br />
<br />
C. Reduces labor training <br />
Zavodny ’03 [Madeline, research economist and associate policy adviser in the regional section of the Atlanta Fed’s research department “The H-1B Program and Its Effects on Information Technology Workers,” online] <br />
<br />
There are several ways the H-1B program might affect native-born and other foreign-born workers. <u>Standard economic theories predict that if H-1B workers are substitutes for other workers, then the availability of H-1B visas would depress wages and wage growth by increasing the supply of labor</u>. The program could also raise unemployment rates if some firms hire H-1B workers instead of other workers and if those other workers remain in the labor force but do not find jobs with other employers. <u>If employers hire H-1B workers because of a labor shortage resulting from other qualified workers not being currently available, the effect might be to reduce training; absent the H-1B program, employers might instead train workers for those positions as well as pay higher wages to induce entry into those jobs</u>. Any such effects are likely to be concentrated in the IT field since most H-1Bs are hired into computer-related occupations. <br />

Status quo solves- <br />
A. We can already bypass the cap and FTAs solve worker shortages <br />

<br />
As mentioned in the “What is an H-1 B visa?” section of this report, there is currently an annual cap of 65,000 for new H-1 B visas, with exemptions to that cap detailed below. <u>H-1 B visa caps have been as high as 195,000* in the recent past</u>, however, <u>and large numbers of these visa holders continue to renew their visas</u>. 58 <u>These visa renewals make the number of people in the U.S. on high-skilled guest worker visas much higher than it would appear just by looking at annual cap numbers</u>. Additionally, <u>there are several major exceptions to the cap: •</u> <u>There is no numerical limit for H-1 B visas for institutions of higher education or non-profit organizations</u>. In other words, <u>these visas are not counted under the cap</u>. 59 • Second, <u>an additional exemption created in 2004 provides 20,000 annual H-1 B visas to U.S. educated foreign workers with advanced degrees. More than 31,000 applications were received in 2009 for H-1 B visas under this exemption</u>. 60 <u>With these exemptions the USCIS grants far more than the specifically enumerated 85,000 H-1 B petitions each year</u>. In 2008, USCIS granted a total of 276,252 H-1 B petitions. The chart below demonstrates the increased number of H-1 B petitions granted as a result of cap exemptions. 61 <u>The United States has also entered into two</u> free-trade agreements <u>(FTAs</u>)- the U.S. -Chile and U.S. -Singapore FTAs - with guest worker visa provisions providing 6,800 visas under the H-1 B1 program each fiscal year. <u>The U.S. -Chile and U.S. Singapore FTAs create provisions for professionals to temporarily work in the United States. Under these agreements, business visitors, traders and investors, intra-company transferees, and other professionals can be granted temporary entry into the US. Each year, 1,400 Chilean professionals and 5,400 professionals from Singapore 62 are eligible to enter the United States under their country's FTA</u>. I f these visas are unused, they are made available for H-1 B use for the next fiscal year. 63 <br />

Although action on the bill isn't likely in this session of Congress, Cleveland said legislation was introduced by Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., that would increase the cap from 65,000 to 115,000 initially. If the larger cap is hit, the number would escalate on a small percentage basis so the same problem wouldn't exist in the following year. <u>The industry is hopeful the increased caps and an easier path to the green cards are part of a comprehensive federal package of immigration reforms</u>. And while Arizona's Senate Bill 1070 has put immigration reform front and center, technology leaders worry that Congress could be caught between the desire to change the laws for companies and members' fears of piecemeal legislation that could hurt broader attempts at change. McKeown said, &quot;There are those who are members of Congress, the federal government or the administration who only want to pass it if it's comprehensive reform. And then there are those who would say, 'Yes, we support your idea, but there's no way I'm doing comprehensive (reform.).' &quot; The Obama administration may be more agreeable to changes sought for years, lobbyists say. <u>&quot;The current administration has said this is a priority, and obviously President Obama has made it clear this is something he wants to see done,&quot;</u> said Jessica Herrera-Flanigan, co-executive director of America Competes, a coalition based in Washington that includes Intel and other advocates for reform of U.S. immigration policy for highly-educated foreign professionals. &quot;It's not merely a presidential call, however. You have to look at the political temper of the country, you have to look at Congress, and <u>it has to be a joint effort. But I do think there is some will there</u>.&quot; <br />

Obama’s commitment to science diplomacy is exceeding international expectations now—if the status quo isn’t solving there’s no reason to think the AFF will: <br />

Clinton's enthusiastic speech surpassed the expectations of many of the conference participants. Vaughan Turekian, chief international officer for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said the meeting represented &quot;an intensification in the way that science and technology is embedded across the whole of diplomacy, not just science and technology issues&quot;. &quot;What this is telling us is the prominent role that science and technology is now playing in the administration and the entire development community in the US government,&quot; Turekian told SciDev.Net. &quot;It is a recognition that science and technology are inherently linked to almost every aspect of development.&quot; <br />

Science diplomacy isn’t a precursor to political diplomacy or peace-making—the Middle East proves our argument: <br />
David Dickson, 2009 (Director, SciDev.Net ). June 4, 2009. “The limits of science diplomacy.” Accessed Sept. 11, 2010 at <br />

Only so much science can do Recently, the Obama administration has given this field a new push, in its desire to pursue &quot;soft diplomacy&quot; in regions such as the Middle East. Scientific agreements have been at the forefront of the administration's activities in countries such as Iraq and Pakistan. But — as emerged from a meeting entitled New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy, held in London this week (1–2 June) — using science for diplomatic purposes is not as straightforward as it seems. Some scientific collaboration clearly demonstrates what countries can achieve by working together. For example, a new synchrotron under construction in Jordan is rapidly becoming a symbol of the potential for teamwork in the Middle East. But whether scientific cooperation can become a precursor for political collaboration is less evident. For example, despite hopes that the Middle East synchrotron would help bring peace to the region, several countries have been reluctant to support it until the Palestine problem is resolved. Indeed, one speaker at the London meeting(organised by the UK's Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science) even suggested that the changes scientific innovations bring inevitably lead to turbulence and upheaval. In such a context, viewing science as a driver for peace may be wishful thinking. <br />
It’s absurd to think science diplomacy solves underlying peace problems—conflicts have deep political roots that can’t be papered over by scientists: <br />
David Dickson, 2010 (Director, SciDev.Net). June 28, 2010. “Science in diplomacy: “On tap but not on top”” Accessed Sept 11, 2010 at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/" rel="nofollow">__http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/__</a><br />
Another example that received considerable attention was the current construction of a synchrotron facility SESAME in Jordan, a project that is already is bringing together researchers in a range of scientific disciplines from various countries in the Middle East (including Israel, Egypt and Palestine, as well as both Greece and Turkey). The promoters of SESAME hope that – as with the building of CERN 60 years ago, and its operation as a research centre involving, for example, physicists from both Russia and the United States – SESAME will become a symbol of what regional collaboration can achieve. In that sense, it would become what one participant described as a “beacon of hope” for the region. But others cautioned that, however successful SESAME may turn out to be in purely scientific terms, its potential impact on the Middle East peace process <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;">should not be exaggerated</span>. Political conflicts have deep roots that <span style="border: solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;">cannot easily be papered over</span>, however open-minded scientists may be to professional colleagues coming from other political contexts. <br />

Resource wars literature is overly simplistic &amp; deterministic: there is no inherent reason why resource shortages lead to war— <br />

<br />
<u>One aspect of the debate has motivated critical work by geographers, who</u> <u>reject the neoMalthusian overtones</u><u>, covert environmental determinism and naturalization of violence implicit in the ‘green wars’ literature</u> (Peluso and Watts 2001; Dalby 2002). <u>Another element of this critique has focused on the quasi-deterministic spatial arguments linking war to the location of resource endowments, and on the</u> <u>oversimplification of geographical arguments in the war studies literature more generally</u> (Flint 2003; Flint 2004; Le Billon 2005).<u>These critiques, in short, have largely portrayed the resource wars argument as being predicated upon an</u> <u>environmentally deterministic (and mistaken) set of assumptions</u><u>about the ‘geographical destiny’ inherent in struggles over resources</u>. <br />
<br />
Resource shortages don’t cause war—leadership failures do: <br />

Each of these three dimensions of resource wars outlined above is not, in itself, a necessary or sufficient condition for armed conflict. <u>Resource dependent countries are not the only ones affected by war. Nor are ‘resources’ per se to be blamed.</u> <u>It does not follow</u> <u>either, of course, that wars in</u> <u>resource rich or resource dependent countries stem primarily from resource-related context or causes</u>.5 <u>As argued by a prominent Angolan journalist jailed for denouncing the corruption and war fuelled by oil and diamonds in his country: “It’s fashionable to say that we are cursed by our mineral riches. That’s not true. We are cursed by our leaders.”</u> (Raphael Marques, cited in (Salopek 2000). <u>Attributing governance failure solely or primarily to the abundance of resources, in other words, is profoundly depoliticising (or ‘economising’) – insofar as this obscures the political strategies and goals of belligerents</u>. <br />

Science diplomacy isn’t a signal—there are three contextual uses of the term—none of which deal with just sending a signal that we are good at science in the United States: <br />

Over the past 60 years, “science diplomacy” – a concept that encompasses the various interactions between science and foreign affairs – has developed as an increasingly important component of international diplomatic activity. In some instances, the concept is used to describe efforts to organise large-scale scientific experiments requiring support from several countries, such as those in astronomy or high-energy physics. A second use covers the engagement of scientists in diplomatic negotiations with high scientific or technical content. Typical issue here is the need to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, or to combat global warming and the social impacts of climate change. Thirdly, the “scientific diplomacy” is increasingly used to describe how scientific collaboration between countries can be used as a lever to achieve diplomatic goals without resorting to more aggressive tactics, such as trade embargoes or even military intervention. <br />
<br />
(--) And tech solves—we constantly create new resources: <br />
Julian <u>Simon, 1994</u> (February 9, 1994, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/TCHAR28.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/TCHAR28.txt</a>) <br />
<u>This point of view is not limited to economists. A technologist writing on minerals</u><br />
<u>put it this way: &quot;In effect, technology keeps creating new resources.&quot; The major</u><br />
<u>constraint upon the human capacity to enjoy unlimited minerals, energy, and other raw</u><br />
<u>materials at acceptable prices is knowledge</u>. And the source of knowledge is the human mind. Ultimately, then, the key constraint is human imagination acting together with educated skills. <u>This is why an increase of human beings, along with causing an additional consumption of resources, constitutes a crucial addition to the stock of</u><br />
<u>natural resources.</u><br />

Climategate undermines efforts to create science diplomacy: <br />

The modern science career may not be so brutal, but the difficulties of bureaucratic control of science and discovery still remain. The best social outcomes from science need an ongoing commitment from politicians for open, transparent and independent advice and not politically or ideologically motivated science. But issues such as the &quot;climategate&quot; inquiries, threatened prosecutions of climate scientists in the US, and even the indictment of Italian earthquake scientists for manslaughter, show that science advice is under pressure around the world. <br />

Hira ’07 [Ron, assistant professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology and research associate with the Economic Policy Institute, August 6, “How &quot;Guestworkers&quot; Promote Outsourcing,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_guestworkers_promote_outsourcing" rel="nofollow">__http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=how_guestworkers_promote_outsourcing__</a>] <br />

<u>The abuse of the program is the result of three loopholes</u>. <u>The first loophole</u> <u>strikes right at the heart of the rationale for the program -- the supposed shortage of workers with specialized skills, particularly in science and engineering</u>; the H-1B program allows firms to hire foreign guest-workers to fill those gaps. But, because of this loophole, <u>companies do not have to demonstrate a shortage exists for U.S. workers and can even force a U.S. worker to train his or her foreign replacement</u>. The U.S. Department of Labor's 2006 Strategic Plan puts it bluntly, <u>&quot;H-1B workers may be hired even when a qualified U.S. worker wants the job, and a U.S. worker can be displaced from the job in favor of the foreign worker.&quot;</u> In spite of this unequivocal statement, <u>there is widespread and mistaken public belief that firms must demonstrate a shortage before hiring an H-1B</u>. For example, news stories over the past year in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Diego Union-Tribune, and Wall Street Journal (in a front page story at the height of last year's immigration debate) have all erroneously claimed the program requires firms to first look for American workers. And the New York Daily News even recently made the false claim in editorial support for H-1B expansion. Many politicians also hold this misconception, making similarly false claims in their correspondence in response to constituent letters on the matter. <u>The second loophole enables firms to use the program for cheap labor</u>. The H-1B program's primary safeguard for U.S. as well as H-1B workers is the requirement that an H-1B worker be paid the prevailing wage. In theory the prevailing wage should be at least the market wage -- the wage paid to an American worker with the same skills -- but <u>in practice the regulation is chock full of loopholes allowing employers to pay below market wages. How do we know this? Employers say so</u>. The Government Accountability Office conducted interviews of H-1B employers and reported that, <u>&quot;Some employers said that they hired H-1B workers in part because these workers would often accept lower salaries than similarly qualified U.S. workers</u>; however, these employers said they never paid H-1B workers less than the required [prevailing] wage.&quot; And examples of approved H-1B applications show how big the cost savings can be. In 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) rubber-stamped applications by HCL America, a major offshore outsourcing firm, to import 75 computer software engineers at annual salary of $24,710. That's a 70 percent discount on the median wage rate for those occupations and a far cry from the $100,000 claimed by Microsoft's Bill Gates. In fact <u>low wages for H-1Bs is the norm. The median wage for new H-1Bs computing professionals is even lower than the salary an entry-level bachelor's degree graduate would command</u>. So, half of the 52,352 H-1B computing professionals admitted in FY2005 earned less than entry-level wages. And even at the 75th percentile, new H-1B computing professionals earned just $60,000. A recent study by John Miano found that 56 percent of the H-1B applications for computing jobs were for the lowest skill level, &quot;Level 1.&quot; The DOL defines such jobs as &quot;internships&quot; or &quot;workers in training.&quot; <u>A third problem, deficient oversight, permeates nearly all aspects of the H-1B program. This leads to a program with pages of regulations that are essentially ineffective and toothless. The DOL's own Office of Inspector General has described the labor certification process, the primary means of safeguarding the labor market, as simply a &quot;rubber stamp&quot; of the employer's application</u>. <u>The process is completely automated, with no person reviewing applications, and the employer is not required to submit any supporting documentation</u>. Based on its examination of the process, the GAO concluded that, &quot;…as the [H-1B] program currently operates, the goals of preventing abuse of the program and providing efficient services to employers and workers are not being achieved. Limited by the law, Labor's review of the [labor certification process] is perfunctory and adds little assurance that labor conditions employers attest to actually exist.&quot; And it is no better after an H-1B is issued.<u>Employers are never scrutinized except in the rare case that an investigation is triggered by an H-1B worker whistleblower, something that is exceptionally rare since H-1B employees have especially strong disincentives to blow the whistle on their employer</u>. Because the employer holds the visa, <u>an H-1B worker who gets terminated is out of status</u> (they would have to leave the country) <u>in the eyes of the USCIS</u>. With cases against employers often taking five or more years to adjudicate, it is no wonder that few violations are ever brought to the attention of the DOL. Any one of these flaws would cause a program to fail to meet its goals. <u>Couple them together and the result is a disaster, a program that directly contradicts its goals. Rather than filling skills shortages as originally conceived, the H-1B program in practice gives employers a temptation, cheaper labor, they simply can't resist</u>. The raison d'etre of modern corporations is maximizing profits, not maximizing their U.S. workforce or increasing the economic welfare of the United States. <u>If companies can lower costs by hiring cheaper foreign guest-workers, they will</u>. If they can hire vendors who hire cheaper foreign guest-workers, they will. And who can blame them? If they don't take advantage of blatant loopholes, their competitors surely will.<u>Cheap labor explains why the H-1B program is oversubscribed and it also explains why the technology industry has fought to expand government intervention to keep wages low</u>. A sizable share of the U.S. high-tech workforce understands this logic, and justifiably views the H-1B program as a threat and a scam. <u>That's the real danger to U.S. competitiveness. Young people considering a technology career see that industry prefers cheaper foreign guest-workers and that the government uses immigration policy to work against technology professionals</u>. <br />

When a program can increase U.S. security and counterterrorism efforts and benefit the American economy at a time of a struggling recovery, you have hit a double jackpot. And when the program—in this case the United States Visa Waiver Program (VWP)—is also an effective public diplomacy tool for improving the image of the U.S. abroad, it is a triple jackpot. <br />
From 1986 to 2007, the ability to travel visa-free to the U.S. for 90 days was enjoyed by citizens from 27 countries, the preponderance of which came from the Western European part of the EU. In 2007, however, Congress enacted far-sighted legislation that implemented progressive changes to the VWP statute ensuring security and increasing the incentive to expand the program to include additional countries friendly toward the U.S. and like-minded with regard to security objectives. The majority of the eight new VWP countries were from Central and Eastern Europe, whose governments had also shown themselves to be good allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. The countries that joined in 2007 were the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, South Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Slovakia. The data showing the program’s impact is clear. After a slump in travel to the U.S. following 9/11, the number of visitors traveling for pleasure or business from the new VWP countries began to increase consistently after the VWP regime took effect. According to the <em>Yearbook of Immigration Statistics</em> released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, temporary visitors to the U.S. increased from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia—six of the eight countries admitted into the VWP in 2008.<table class="captionBox"><tr><td class="captionedImage"><img src="file:///C:%5CDOCUME~1%5CDEBATE~1%5CLOCALS~1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_image001.gif" alt="Description: Anchor" title="Description: Anchor" style="height: 12px; width: 11px;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="imageCaption">Description: Anchor</td></tr></table><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2010/08/visa-waiver-as-an-effective-public-diplomacy-tool#_ftn1" rel="nofollow">__[1__</a>] All of these countries are important new allies of the U.S. whose transatlantic ties with Washington need constant reinforcement. The data reported the most dramatic change in travel from the Czech Republic. While in 2000, 44,395 temporary visitors from the Czech Republic traveled to the U.S., by 2007 that number had declined to 42,923. In 2008, however, the year after the expanded VWP took effect, an additional 7,353 visitors arrived in the U.S. from the Czech Republic for a total if 50,276. That represents a 17.13 percent increase in temporary visitors over 2007. The ability for foreigners to experience the U.S. firsthand has proven to be an extremely beneficial strategy for U.S. public diplomacy. Surveys have shown that foreigners who have had the opportunity to visit the U.S. are more than 74 percent likely to have a favorable view of the country, and 61 percent of travelers to the U.S. are more likely to support the U.S. and its policies. As a public diplomacy issue, however, there is more to the VWP program than just increasing America’s global popularity. The staunch support exhibited by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the U.S. after 9/11 also meant that they sought recognition of the risks they were taking to stand in solidarity alongside Americans. Ironically, citizens of Germany and France—whose governments actively opposed the Iraq war at the United Nations—continued to enjoy VWP status. Polish soldiers are “daily risking their lives for America’s war on terror, and these are people who while they are in Iraq, they learn that they will have to be fingerprinted [when they visit the United States]. They feel that they will be treated as criminals,” said Radek Sikorski, then-Executive Director of the American Enterprise Institute’s New Atlantic Initiative and later to hold posts as his country’s defense and foreign minister. “Isn’t there a better way to treat allies?” For many of the governments in question, VWP became the most important bilateral issue with the U.S., adversely affecting public opinion of the U.S. <br />

Driven by legitimate but misdirected concerns about radical Islamic terrorism, current U.S. visa policy is discouraging hundreds of thousands of peaceful and well-meaning people from visiting the United States for business and pleasure--costing our country lost economic opportunities totaling millions of dollars and the goodwill of millions of people. For most people outside the United States, the U.S. government requires that they obtain a visa before entering our country. But for residents of Canada and 27 other countries in the Visa Waiver Program, no visa is required for tourism or business visits of fewer than 90 days. The 27 countries include most countries of Western Europe, and Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Brunei.<table class="captionBox"><tr><td class="captionedImage"><img src="file:///C:%5CDOCUME~1%5CDEBATE~1%5CLOCALS~1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_image001.gif" alt="Description: Anchor" title="Description: Anchor" style="height: 12px; width: 11px;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="imageCaption">Description: Anchor</td></tr></table><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10662#_edn1" rel="nofollow">__[1__</a>] Another group of countries would like to join the list, but not a single country has been added since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. <br />

Despite this admission, <u>the Obama Administration continues to drag its feet on beefing up the Visa Security Program—which puts homeland security officers at U.S. consulate offices to perform background checks on visa applicants.</u> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/print/65333" rel="nofollow">__In fact the Administration has only deployed officers at 14 high risk countries (out of 57 likely candidates)__</a>. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Reports/2010/01/Six-Questions-for-Detroit-Terror-Plot-Hearings" rel="nofollow">__**__Tackling visa security is the right kind of lesson to be learned from plots like Times Square and Christmas Day__**__</a><u>.</u> More often than not, jurisdictional disputes between the Department of State and Department of Homeland Security have interfered with this process.

And isn’t secure – USCIS lost over 100 thousand files <br />
Michael <u>Cutler</u> January 14, <u>2010</u> [Exclusive: Better Security Needed in Visa Process, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.5257/pub_detail.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.5257/pub_detail.asp</a> <br />
It was also Sen. Grassley who, in 2006, joined Sen. Sue Collins (R-ME) to request that the GAO (General Accountability Office), the investigative arm of the Congress, conduct an investigation into the practices at USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) in light of allegations they had apparently received from USCIS employees that the adjudicators were not being provided with the relating immigration alien files of aliens who applied for all sorts of immigration benefits, including aliens who applied for resident alien (lawful immigrant) status and even United States citizenship. <u>The GAO conducted that investigation and concluded that USCIS had claimed to have &quot;lost&quot; some 111,000 immigration files, including the files relating to 30,000 aliens who applied to acquire United States citizenship via the naturalization process.</u> Sen. Grassley is among those politicians who understand that immigration is far more than the issue of the lack of border security to be found along the Mexican border. Please do not misunderstand: <u>obviously our failure to secure that dangerous and increasingly violent border is a national security disaster, but it is only one of many disasters to be found throughout the entire immigration system. A chain is as strong as its weakest link.&quot; Where immigration is concerned, it is clear that all that we have are extremely weak and – all but nonexistent – links.</u> When reading the Washington Times article linked above, please pay attention to the ridiculous arguments and finger-pointing that constitutes nothing more than the adult version of the childhood &quot;blame game&quot; we played when we went to school. It would appear that we have a bunch of incompetent fools in charge of protecting our nation and our citizens. When the news stories began to break about the unsuccessful attempt by Umar Farouk <u>Abdulmutallab to detonate a bomb onboard the Delta Airlines flight on Christmas Day</u>, questions had been asked about why this Nigerian citizen had not been placed on the &quot;No Fly&quot; list even though his father, a respected banker, warned our government's officials that he believed that his son had become radicalized and had traveled to Yemen. <u>Others questioned why Abdulmutallab's visa had not been canceled.</u> My first thought was, &quot;<u>Why was he issued a visa in the first place?&quot;</u> Then he would never have been allowed on the airplane in the first place, regardless of whether or not his name was on the &quot;No Fly&quot; list. Sen. Grassley describes the visa process: Congress directed DHS when it was established in 2002 to create the units in question to help State Department consular officers abroad in screening visa applicants. Mr. <u>Grassley called them vital for &quot;shoring up one of America's first lines of defense against foreign terrorist attacks.&quot;</u> As you read through the approximately 40 questions on the State Department website where foreigners can apply for a tourist visa, you can see that it can help our officials to screen aliens before they set foot on a U.S. bound airliner. <u>Yet there are many weaknesses in the visa process, including:</u> 1. How many translators are present where DHS personnel are assigned to visa issuing posts at U.S. embassies and consulates? And how many of those translators are U.S. citizens and employees of the U.S. government and how many are foreign nationals – so-called &quot;locals&quot; – whose integrity may not be easy to assess or guarantee? <u>There have been instances in a number of foreign countries where these local employees acted as spies or failed to properly translate what was being said – either because they had taken bribes or because they were incompetent. When these locals were discovered to have taken bribes to assist criminals and others who would have failed to qualify for visas, often the State Department simply fired them because it would have been extremely difficult to have brought criminal charges against them in their native countries.</u>2. Are <u>consular officials</u> being given and adequate amount of time to truly question foreign nationals who apply for visas, or are they still<u>expected to process a visa application in a couple of minutes</u>? 3. Are consular officials trained to review the passport of each visa applicant to check for admission stamps relating to &quot;Special Interest&quot; countries? That is to say, countries associated with terrorism such as Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, the Sudan and others? <u>Do they even have enough time to do this basic review of travel documents?</u> 4. Are consular officials required to check all of the relevant databases to search for evidence that the applicant for a visa may be on a terror watch list? 5. How are slight variations in names dealt with when these names do appear on watch lists? Remember, in many foreign countries, the languages that are used have different alphabets and so often names can be transcribed from that foreign language to English in many different ways. 6. How often are the databases used by consular officials updated? 7. Are consular officials trained to give visa applicants the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; or are they taught to err on the side of caution? 8. Here is the real key question: how are consular officials evaluated? Are there any rewards or incentives for denying a visa application especially when the reason for the denial relates to national security, or are these State Department employees evaluated by the quantity of the visas that they approve and the speed with which they do it? Going back to the instant matter of Mr. Abdulmutallab, it is also worth considering that he had applied for a visa to return to Great Britain, the country where he obtained his degrees in finance and engineering, but was denied that visa. Clearly, the British authorities had concerns about him. Was any derogatory information that was developed by British authorities shared with their American counterparts? <u>Newspaper accounts have reported that Abdulmutallab was the president of the Islamic Society at UCL (University College London) from 2006 until 2007. This was at least a year before he applied for the visa for the United States that enabled him to seek to enter the United States when he boarded the Christmas flight to Detroit two weeks ago.</u><br />
Politics NB <br />
Democrats are distancing themselves from obama now in a concerted effort to succeed in the midterms – but a vote for the plan makes that impossible – only the CP gives dems cover <br />
Washington Post 8/16 (Chris Cillizza, 8/16/10, &quot; Should Democrats run with or from President Obama? &quot;blog, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/white-house/should-democrats-run-with-or-f.html" rel="nofollow">http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/white-house/should-democrats-run-with-or-f.html</a>) <br />
<br />
That is the question Democratic incumbents and challengers in this fall's elections are asking themselves when it comes to dealing with President Obama. Powerful forces are lining up on both sides of that strategic divide. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine made clear in an interview with &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot; last week that he thinks candidates distancing themselvesfrom the president -- and from high-profile congressional leaders such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- are making the wrong move. &quot;I can tell you Democrats who kind of are afraid to be who they are, or pushing back on their leaders, I think they're crazy,&quot; Kaine said. And yet, in campaigns across the country, many Democrats are doing just that. In Indiana, Rep. Joe <u>Donnelly is running a television ad in which he details his generally conservative stance on immigration while images of Obama and Pelosi are shown on screen. &quot;That may not be what the Washington crowd wants, but I don't work for them,&quot;</u> Donnelly says in the ad. &quot;I work for you.&quot; Rep. Travis Childers, who represents a district in northern Mississippi where Obama won just 38 percent of the vote in 2008, takes a similar approach in his TV advertising -- promoting the fact that he has &quot;voted against every big budget&quot; since winning a special election two years ago. Even some Democratic candidates who are being heavily touted by the White House appear determined to keep the president at arm's length. Shortly after Obama played a lead role in helping Sen. Michael Bennet defeat former state House speaker Andrew Romanoff in a Democratic primary fight last Tuesday, Bennet was asked whether he would want the president to campaign with him this fall. &quot;We'll have to see,&quot; Bennet told ABC's George Stephanopoulos -- a response well short of a ringing endorsement of Obama's political standing. One senior Democratic consultant suggested that the distance candidates are seeking to put between themselves and Obama is reflective of the ascendance of economic issues in voters' minds. &quot;Barack Obama's economic policy of spending our way out of recession is seen as a failure at best and harmful at worst,&quot; the source said. &quot;That should tell candidates in competitive jurisdictions all they need to know about running with the president.&quot; Polling on the issue is slightly less stark. In a recent Washington Post-ABC News survey, 51 percent said it was more important to have Republicans in charge of Congress &quot;to act as a check on Obama&quot; while 43 percent said they would rather have Democrats in charge to &quot;help support Obama's policies.&quot; Although it appears as though most candidates won't be following Kaine's advice in the final three months of the midterm campaign, it's far less clear whether any Democrat -- particularly those who have spent the past two years in Congress -- can succeed in gaining separation from the president. &quot;Even if it made strategic sense, it is hard for Democratic incumbents with a voting record to literally distance themselves from the president,&quot; said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. Obama himself has long argued behind closed doors that Democratic incumbents are stuck with him in good times and in bad; that is, voters simply will not differentiate between the Democratic president and their Democratic member of Congress in the vast majority of districts across the country. By embracing the president and his policies, the argument goes, the Democratic base will be fired up. And, in midterm elections, base intensity isn't everything -- it's the only thing. But Tom Davis, a former congressman from Virginia and one of the Republican Party's leading strategists, noted that although Democrats need the &quot;Obama turnout model in urban and minority areas,&quot; <u>the president is &quot;radioactive&quot; in the &quot;South, border and mountain states</u>.&quot; That push and pull creates a &quot;dilemma&quot; for Democrats on the ballot this fall, Davis said. Martin Frost, a longtime Texas Democratic congressman who, like Davis, spent much of his time in Washington focused on campaigns, said that while &quot;candidates in the Southand Midwest will need to put some distance between themselves and Obama,&quot; the president can still help his party avoid disaster this fall. &quot;Obama's best contribution to the campaign will be to raise money for the party committees, as he did in Texas&quot; recently, Frost said. &quot;He can raise big money even in red states, and he shouldn't be offended when Democrats like Bill White andChet Edwards don't show up for a photo,&quot; he said, referring to the party's candidate for Texas governor and a congressman from the state, respectively. <br />

The CP avoids public awareness generated by legislative action <br />
<u>Stoddard 97</u> (Thomas, Fmr Prof of Law @ NYU, 72 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 967, November, lexis) <br />
Changes that occur through legislative deliberation generally entail greater public awareness than judicial or administrative changes do. Public awareness is, indeed, a natural concomitant of the legislative process. A legislature - any legislature - purports to be a representative collection of public delegates engaged in the people's business; its work has inherent public significance. Judicial and administrative proceedings, by contrast, involve private actors in private disputes. Those disputes may or may not have implications for others, and they are often subject to the principle of stare decisis, but they are not public by their very nature. (Administrative rulemaking is a different animal, akin - at least in theory - to legislative activity, but it is still typically accorded less attention than the business of legislatures.)Legislative lawmaking is, by its nature, open, tumultuous, and prolonged. It encourages scrutiny and evaluation. Thus, it is much more likely than other forms of lawmaking to promote public discussion and knowledge. For that reason alone, such lawmaking possesses a special power beyond that of mere rulemaking. Indeed, the real significance of some forms of legislative lawmaking lies in the debate they engender rather than the formal consequences of their enactment. <br />

Top ranking dems are distancing themselves from Obama – it’s issue specific – immigration is a hot bed – proves the CP gives cover <br />
Atlanta Journal Constitution 8/17 (Jamie Dupree, 8/17/10, &quot; Mosque Distance &quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs.ajc.com/jamie-dupree-washington-insider/2010/08/17/some-mosque-distance/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.ajc.com/jamie-dupree-washington-insider/2010/08/17/some-mosque-distance/</a>) <br />
It wasn't any old Democrat who signaled Monday that he wanted some space between himself and President Obama on the question of a mosque near Ground Zero. It was Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. &quot;The First Amendment protects freedom of religion,&quot; read a statement from Senator Reid's spokesman. &quot;Senator Reid respects that but thinks that the mosque should be built some place else.&quot; Aboard Air Force One, the issue of dissecting what the President meant to say on Friday and how he tried to amend it on Saturday really wasn't at the top of the agenda. &quot;I think we've had a pretty fulsome conversation about it,&quot; said Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton, who didn't take the bait when asked about GOP efforts to take advantage of the issue in this election year. &quot;I can't speak to the politics of what the Republicans are doing,&quot; Burton told reporters. &quot;And the President didn't do this because of the politics. He spoke about it because he feels he has an obligation as the President to address this.&quot; But the silence on the issue from Democrats in Congress was deafening, as even from New York, few lawmakers have stepped forward to speak their mind about the mosque issue, as my email inbox remains somewhat quiet. Reid's decision drew a big rebukefrom more liberal web sites, which accused him of hanging the President out to dry and being a complete election year chicken. It should be noted that Reid is in a very close re-election race in his home state of Nevada. Democrats charge that Republicans are trying to focus on issues like the Ground Zero Mosque and the Arizona Immigration law because the GOP doesn't have a real plan for the economy. That talk is probably born more out of frustration than anything else, asDemocrats have seen how Republicans can turn a symbolic argument (like the mosque) into votes in November, all the while scaring the dickens out of Democratic candidates. Finally, as this argument rolled on, more generic poll numbers came in on Monday suggesting that Republicans are solidifying their advantage in this election year, with Gallup showing a 7-point edge for the GOP. If that's for real, that would portend big Republican gains this Novmeber, with eleven weeks until Election Day. Print <br />

Another potentially vulnerable Senate Democrat cozied up to President Obama on Tuesday as the party leader prepares to visit her state. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said she was &quot;excited&quot; to have Obama visit the state later today, where he'll hold a fundraiser for the leading Democrat's campaign against Republican Dino Rossi. &quot;I'm really excited that the president is coming here,&quot; Murray told a local NBC affiliate. &quot;I think it's a great opportunity for me to talk to him about the economic challenges we have.&quot; Murray's kind words for Obama mark the second straight day in which a Democratic Senate incumbent facing a tough reelection challenge has sought to ally themselves with Obama, instead of distancing themselves from the Democratic president. Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) said on Monday that he had no hesitations about appearing with Obama, who was in Milwaukee to raise money for Democrats' gubernatorial candidate. Other SenateDemocrats have been more circumspect. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), for instance, said he'll &quot;have to see&quot; whether or not he wants Obama to come to Colorado to campaign for his reelection effort. Of course, Feingold and Murray come from two states that have voted reliably Democratic in presidential elections since 1986, when President Ronald Reagan won both Wisconsin and Washington in his reelection effort. Colorado, by contrast, has been more of a swing state, and often a bellwether state. <br />

Extending the VWP to a small and select group of countries would not compromise the ability of the U.S. government to protect the American homeland from terrorists and others who would do us harm. None of the roadmap countries harbor restive populations associated even indirectly with terrorism aimed at the United States. If security concerns center on Islamic extremists, most of the roadmap countries under current consideration are home to relatively small Muslim populations. According to the U.S. State Department's annual survey of religious freedom, South Korea, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and the three Baltic republics are home to a combined Muslim population of fewer than 100,000. In contrast, the number of Muslims living in the major visa waiver countries of Western Europe--Germany, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain--is more than 13 million.<table class="captionBox"><tr><td class="captionedImage"><img src="file:///C:%5CDOCUME~1%5CDEBATE~1%5CLOCALS~1%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_image001.gif" alt="Description: Anchor" title="Description: Anchor" style="height: 12px; width: 11px;" /></td></tr><tr><td class="imageCaption">Description: Anchor</td></tr></table><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10662#_edn10" rel="nofollow">__[10__</a>] If a major security worry is that Muslim extremists will be able to slip into the United States through a visa waiver country, the eight road map countries listed above are not a significant problem. <br />

 <br />
Our messed up business tax system is the real cause of US competitiveness loss to other nations—the 2007 conference on Global Competitiveness hosted by the US Treasury Department found that moving to a Business Activities Tax instead of our crazy patchwork system of tax breaks for random activities and investments in particular kinds of systems would unleash the market toward the economically best choices—resulting in increasing output by 2 to 2.5 percent. Our evidence says that business taxes are key to incentives and making U.S. business and workers as competitive as possible—solving all the case. <br />
<br />
And…we access the vital internal link to competitiveness: Differences in nations tax systems have become the key to competitiveness: <br />
Office of Tax Policy, 2007 (U.S. Department of the Treasury). December 20, 2007. “Approaches to Improve the Competitiveness of the U.S. Business Tax System for the 21st Century.” Accessed Sept. 12, 2010 at <br />

As barriers to cross-border movement of capital and goods have been reduced, differences in nations’ tax systems have become a greater factor in the success of global companies. Recognizing this, many nations have changed their business tax systems. During the past two decades, many of our major trading partners have lowered their corporate tax rates, some dramatically. The United States, which had a low corporate tax rate in the late 1980s as compared to other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), now has the second highest statutory corporate tax rate among OECD countries. Moreover, other OECD countries continue to reduce their corporate income tax rates leaving the United States further behind. As other nations modernize their business tax systems to recognize the realities of the global economy, U.S. companies increasingly suffer a competitive disadvantage. The U.S. business tax system imposes a burden on U.S. companies and U.S. workers by raising the cost of investment in the United States and burdening U.S. firms as they compete with other firms in foreign markets. Taxing business income discourages investment by raising the cost of capital. The higher the cost of capital, the greater the disincentive to invest. The relatively high U.S. tax rate, compared to our trading partners, places a higher cost on investment. Business taxes play a particularly key role in the economy because they influence the ii incentive to acquire and use capital – the plants, offices, equipment, and software that corporations employ to produce goods and services. In general, an economy with more capital is more productive and ultimately attains a higher standard of living than economies that have accumulated less capital. Workers gain when businesses have more capital and, correspondingly, workers stand to lose when the tax system leads businesses to invest less and have a smaller capital stock. <br />
Distinguished leaders and experts agree—business tax reform is the key to US competition in today’s global economic climate: <br />

In 2007, Secretary Paulson initiated a review of the nation’s system for taxing businesses. On July 26, 2007, the Secretary hosted a conference on Global Competitiveness and Business Tax Reform, at which distinguished leaders and experts discussed how the current business tax system can be improved to make U.S. businesses more competitive in today’s global economy. The conference highlighted the need for reform. The participants stressed that the business tax system has not kept pace with changes in the world economy. The United States has become increasingly linked to the world economy through trade and investment. Businesses operate more freely across borders and business location and investment decisions are more sensitive to tax considerations than in the past. Several countries have responded to the increasingly competitive environment by reforming their corporate incomes taxes and reducing corporate income tax rates. The conference participants expressed a conviction that in order forU.S. companies and U.S. workers to compete and thrive in today’s global economic climate, the U.S. business tax system also must adapt to these changes. <br />

Because a BAT reduces taxes on savings and investment—it unlocks more money into investment—unleashing broad economic benefits for the economy: <br />
Office of Tax Policy, 2007 (U.S. Department of the Treasury). December 20, 2007. “Approaches to Improve the Competitiveness of the U.S. Business Tax System for the 21st Century.” Accessed Sept. 12, 2010 at <br />

Economic gains from replacing business taxes with a broad-based BAT The economic gains have two primary sources. First, a BAT lowers the tax on the return to saving and investment. (Box 2.1 discusses the effect of a consumption tax on saving and investment.) Replacement of the existing tax on business income with a BAT would lower the effective marginal tax rate on investment from its current level of 17 percent to 8 percent overall, and from 25 percent to 15 percent in the business sector.22 The lower tax on saving and investment, which is likely to be quantitatively more important for producing economic gains than the more even taxation of economic activity, would increase capital formation, enhance labor productivity, and ultimately, increase living standards. Box 2.1: The Incentive to Save and Invest Under a Consumption Tax23 The key difference between an income tax and a consumption tax is that an income tax discourages savings while a consumption tax does not. Because a consumption tax imposes an equal tax on present and future consumption, it does not discourage saving for future consumption. In contrast, an income tax taxes the return to saving, thereby taxing consumption in the future more heavily than consumption today. 22 The effective marginal tax rate combines corporate tax rates, depreciation allowances, and other features of the tax system into a single measure of the share of an investment’s economic income needed to cover taxes over its lifetime. This measure of the “tax wedge” between the before-tax and after-tax returns on an investment is measured relative to the before-tax return. 23 For a detailed discussion, see Slemrod and Bakija (1996). 23 An income tax discourages saving for the future by reducing the after-tax rate of return received by the investor below the pre-tax rate of return produced by the investment. <br />

The counterplan bolsters technological innovation: <br />
Office of Tax Policy, 2007 (U.S. Department of the Treasury). December 20, 2007. “Approaches to Improve the Competitiveness of the U.S. Business Tax System for the 21st Century.” Accessed Sept. 12, 2010 at <br />

The current U.S. tax system clearly is not optimal and likely discourages investment in the United States. A more disturbing possibility is that the U.S. tax system may also slow the pace of technological innovation. The pace of innovation is a key determinant of economic growth, and innovation tends to take place where the investment climate is best. For example, new technologies are often “embedded” in new types of capital – a firm does not benefit from an increase in computer processing speed, for example, unless it purchases a new computer that incorporates the faster chip. Thus, firms do not reap the benefits of technological advances until new capital is brought into production. Similarly, higher investment can spur innovation by raising the demand for new technologies. Given this interplay between innovation and capital accumulation, allowing U.S. corporate taxes to become more burdensome relative to the rest of the world could result in a cumulative effect in which U.S. firms fall increasingly behind those in other nations. <br />

QUESTION: Hi, my name’s Tim DeVoogd. I’m a Jefferson Science Fellow in Western Hemisphere and a professor at Cornell University. And I want to make a plug for science diplomacy in particular. And more than saying nice words about it, of course, for the words to mean anything, it has to come with funding, which, in turn, means coordination between State and USAID to promote programs. And I was wondering if you could say anything about how the organization of USAID will develop to support new initiatives like this one. SECRETARY CLINTON: Well, I agree with you. And I thank you for taking time out and I love Cornell, so it’s wonderful you’re here working in the State Department. I think science diplomacy and science and technology cooperation between the United States and other countries is one of our most effective ways of influencing and assisting other nations and creating real bridges between the United States and counterparts. We do want to put some resources behind that. Certainly, as we’re negotiating some of the strategic partnership compacts that we’re involved in, we’ll be working with a number of countries. Science and technology is one of the highest priorities for the countries with whom we are dealing. And we just have to be more creative and more focused, and we need more partners. Nina Fedoroff went to Russia and helped to create a very positive partnership between our Academy of Sciences and the Russian Academy of Sciences. I mean, we helped to broker that, but we really look to see other partners as well as the United States Government as stepping up. <br />
Funding is key to adequate science diplomacy: <br />

Using science as a vehicle for international diplomacy has many clear attractions. Such is the case, for example, when it can be used to forge common approaches to international problems (such as climate change), or appears to offer a way around divisive political disagreements. But, as rapidly become clear in the opening session of the three-day meeting on science diplomacy being held at Wilton Park in Sussex, UK, putting the principle of such diplomacy into action presents many practical problems, some of which SciDev.Net aired last week (see Science diplomacy must be more ambitious). As several participants pointed out, this is particularly the case at a time when science budgets are under pressure, and scientists are being asked to justify their support from the public purse in terms of the practical contributions they make to national – rather than international – well-being. The dilemma was highlighted by the very first speaker at the meeting, Peter Fletcher, chair of panel that seeks to co-ordinate the international activities of Britain’s research councils. Fletcher outlined the many ways in which science can be effectively used as a diplomatic tool. He pointed out, for example, that scientific cooperation offered countries such as Britain an opportunity to establish good relations with the Muslim world in just the same way that it had helped them build bridges with China in the 1990s. “Science is a way of building relationships, sometimes even before politicians have agreed to talk.” Fletcher said. “Researchers are used to working across national boundaries. They understand people who are thinking about the same things as they are, and are used to working together in ways in which other people are not.” But he also pointed out that, with the UK having just announced a 25% reduction in its science budget, governments were increasingly requiring scientists to demonstrate the value of their work for those who paid for it. “How much are we prepared to commit to solving global challenges for mutual benefit [in this context]?” he asked. <br />

Pickering et al, 10 (THOMAS R. president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science “Science diplomacy aids conflict reduction” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/feb/20/science-diplomacy-aids-conflict-reduction/" rel="nofollow">http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/feb/20/science-diplomacy-aids-conflict-reduction/</a>) <br />
The U.S. government already has 43 bilateral umbrella science and technology agreements with nations worldwide, and the administration of President Barack Obama is elevating the profile of science engagement. In June, in Cairo , he promised a range of joint science and technology initiatives with Muslim-majority countries. In November, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appointed three science envoys to foster new partnerships and address common challenges, especially within Muslim-majority countries. <br />

In his inaugural address in January 2009, US President Barack Obama pledged to &quot;restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders&quot; to improve quality of health care and use &quot;the sun and the winds and the soil&quot; to fuel cars and run factories. In April, Obama named the members of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). The group will advise the president and vice-president and &quot;formulate policy in the areas where understanding of science, technology and innovation is key to strengthening our economy and forming policy that works for the American people&quot;.Obama's science team is of extremely high calibre and the head of the team, John Holdren, a respected professor of environmental policy at Harvard, is based in the president's executive officeitself. <br />

Clinton also emphasised the need to collaborate with the private sector, non-governmental organisations and, particularly, local groups. &quot;Although we won't have all the answers, we need to act on the best answers we can come up with. We can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. We also need to nurture organic and locally produced solutions.&quot; More specifically, Clinton said: &quot;We're exploring new mechanisms for promoting innovation such as prizes and competitions that encourage more people to put their own intellectual capital to work. And we're strengthening our bilateral partnerships through science diplomacy.&quot;Conference co-chair Alex Dehgan — science and technology advisor to USAID administrator Rajiv Shah — told SciDev.Net that the Obama administration was &quot;looking to address development challenges in completely new ways&quot;. <br />

<u>Extend our two pieces of Dickson evidence</u>—it is absurd to think that science diplomacy can solve underlying political problems like the AFF’s advantages—historic examples like specific projects in the Middle East prove that underlying political tensions will scuttle any effort to promote peace through science diplomacy and that political conflicts cannot easily be papered over—it is ridiculous to think that their terminal impacts can be wished away by nerds in lab coats getting along better. While the geeks swap cool microscope technology Netanyahu will still hate Ahmadinejad because he denied the Holocaust and Kim Jong Il will still want a bomb to protect himself against the US and South Korea. <br />

Science diplomacy can’t lead to effective diplomacy: <br />
David Dickson, 2010 (Director, SciDev.Net). June 28, 2010. “Science in diplomacy: “On tap but not on top”” Accessed Sept 11, 2010 at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/" rel="nofollow">__http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/__</a><br />
There’s a general consensus in both the scientific and political worlds that the principle of science diplomacy, at least in the somewhat restricted sense of the need to get more and better science into international negotiations, is a desirable objective. There is less agreement, however, on how far the concept can – or indeed should – be extended to embrace broader goals and objectives, in particular attempts to use science to achieve political or diplomatic goals at the international level. Science, despite its international characteristics, is no substitute for effective diplomacy. Any more than diplomatic initiatives necessarily lead to good science. <br />
Science diplomacy can’t achieve political ends—science is inherently apolitical: <br />
David Dickson, 2009 (Director, SciDev.Net ). June 4, 2009. “The limits of science diplomacy.” Accessed Sept. 11, 2010 at <br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/the-limits-of-science-diplomacy.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/the-limits-of-science-diplomacy.html__</a><br />
Worlds apart yet co-dependent The truth is that science and politics make an uneasy alliance. Both need the other. Politicians need science to achieve their goals, whether social, economic or — unfortunately — military; scientists need political support to fund their research. But they also occupy different universes. Politics is, at root, about exercising power by one means or another. Science is — or should be — about pursuing robust knowledge that can be put to useful purposes. A strategy for promoting science diplomacy that respects these differences deserves support. Particularly so if it focuses on ways to leverage political and financial backing for science's more humanitarian goals, such as tackling climate change or reducing world poverty. But a commitment to science diplomacy that ignores the differences —acting for example as if science can substitute politics (or perhaps more worryingly, vice versa), is dangerous. The Obama administration's commitment to &quot;soft power&quot; is already faltering. It faces challenges ranging from North Korea's nuclear weapons test to domestic opposition to limits on oil consumption. A taste of reality may be no bad thing. <br />
The failure of the Copenhagen conference proves: scientific diplomacy is inadequate to create political diplomacy: <br />
David Dickson, 2010 (Director, SciDev.Net). June 28, 2010. “Science in diplomacy: “On tap but not on top”” Accessed Sept 11, 2010 at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/" rel="nofollow">__http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/__</a><br />
The broadest gaps in understanding the potential of scientific diplomacy lay in the third category, namely the use of science as a channel of international diplomacy, either as a way of helping to forge consensus on contentious issues, or as a catalyst for peace in situations of conflict. On the first of these, some pointed to recent climate change negotiations, and in particular the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as a good example, of the way that the scientific community can provide a strong rationale for joint international action. But others referred to the failure of the Copenhagen climate summit last December to come up with a meaningful agreement on action as a demonstration of the limitations of this way of thinking. It was argued that this failure had been partly due to a misplaced belief that scientific consensus would be sufficient to generate a commitment to collective action, without taking into account the political impact that scientific ideas would have. <br />
<br />
<br />
Other countries will dismiss science diplomacy—there’s no reason it will change fundamental ideological differences: <br />
David Dickson, 2010 (Director, SciDev.Net). June 26, 2010. “Can science diplomacy help strengthen the Muslim world?” Accessed Sept. 12, 2010 at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/2010/06/26/can-science-diplomacy-unite-the-muslim-world/" rel="nofollow">http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/2010/06/26/can-science-diplomacy-unite-the-muslim-world/</a> <br />
A similar plea had come on the previous day from Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, secretary general of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), who described how the members of his organisation were committed to promoting science and technology to enhance the well-being of the Muslim world. Keen to challenge the idea that the transfer of scientific knowledge was primarily a West-to-East affair, he pointed out that, in the seventeenth century, the English scientist and philosopher Francis Bacon had acknowledged that many key inventions – such as printing, gunpowder and the compass – had come from the Muslim world. <br />
Ihsanoglu, a historian of science by profession, complained that Islamic contributions to science and knowledge were in danger of being overlooked as a result of campaigns of “Islamophobia” that sought to demonise the principles and values of Islamic culture. At the same time he reminded participants that, although science diplomacy had proved to be useful in forging partnerships in fields such as education and agriculture, they should not forget that its ultimate aim – like that of more conventional forms of diplomacy – was to further a country’s interests and wider political goals. Princess Sumaya issued a similar warning in slightly more colourful terms. “Soft power is a desirable tool for diplomacy, considering the other options available to all sides, but achieving one’s goals through co-option and attraction is only truly sustainable if we all want similar, sustainable outcomes. “The design and exercise of soft power by the West is, to a large extent, predetermined by cultural values, political institutions and even the demands of the electoral cycle,” she stressed. “If clear, universal goals are not agreed upon, then soft power too can seem antagonistic, to be dismissed by opposing ideologues as the velvet glove of international relations.” <br />
Science can’t provide the solutions for diplomatic initiatives: <br />
David Dickson, 2010 (Director, SciDev.Net). June 28, 2010. “Science in diplomacy: “On tap but not on top”” Accessed Sept 11, 2010 at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/" rel="nofollow">__http://scidevnet.wordpress.com/category/science-diplomacy-conference-2010/__</a><br />
“Science for diplomacy” therefore ended up with a highly mixed review. The consensus seemed to be that science can prepare the ground for diplomatic initiatives – and benefit from diplomatic agreements – but cannot provide the solutions to either. “On tap but not on top” seems as relevant in international settings as it does in purely national ones. With all the caution that even this formulation still requires. <br />
Science diplomacy fails to move nations in the direction of the intended countries’ interests: <br />

Conflicting ethos Perhaps the most contentious area discussed at the meeting was how science diplomacy can frame developed countries' efforts to help build scientific capacity in the developing world. There is little to quarrel with in collaborative efforts that are put forward with a genuine desire for partnership. Indeed, partnership — whether between individuals, institutions or countries — is the new buzzword in the &quot;science for development&quot; community. But true partnership requires transparent relations between partners who are prepared to meet as equals. And that goes against diplomats' implicit role: to promote and defend their own countries' interests. John Beddington, the British government's chief scientific adviser, may have been a bit harsh when he told the meeting that a diplomat is someone who is &quot;sent abroad to lie for his country&quot;. But he touched a raw nerve. <br />

All of this indicates an extremely dangerous situation, with many variables that are impossible to assess fully. But there is one comforting reality here: this will not become World War III. <u>Not long ago, wars in the Middle East always went to the brink very quickly, with the Americans and Soviets deeply involved on opposite sides, bristling their nuclear weapons at one another</u>. And for quite some time we lived on the brink of oblivion. <u>But that is over. World War III has been cancelled,</u> and I don't think we could pump it up again no matter how hard we tried. <u>The connections that once tied Middle Eastern confrontations to a global confrontation involving tens of thousands of nuclear weapons have all been undone</u>. The East-West Cold War is finished. The truly dangerous powers in the world today are the industrialized countries in general. We are the ones with the resources and the technology to churn out weapons of mass destruction like sausages. But the good news is: we are out of the business. <br />

Why are middle east experts so unfailingly wrong? The lesson of history is that men never learn from history, but middle east experts, like the rest of us, should at least learn from their past mistakes. Instead, they just keep repeating them. The first mistake is &quot;five minutes to midnight&quot; catastrophism. The late King Hussein of Jordan was the undisputed master of this genre.Wearing his gravest aspect, he would warn us that with patience finally exhausted the Arab-Israeli conflict was about to explode, that all past conflicts would be dwarfed by what was about to happen unless, unless… And then came the remedy—usually something rather tame when compared with the immense catastrophe predicted, such as resuming this or that stalled negotiation, or getting an American envoy to the scene to make the usual promises to the Palestinians and apply the usual pressures on Israel. We read versions of the standard King Hussein speech in countless newspaper columns, hear identical invocations in the grindingly repetitive radio and television appearances of the usual middle east experts, and are now faced with Hussein's son Abdullah periodically repeating his father's speech almost verbatim. What actually happens at each of these &quot;moments of truth&quot;—and we may be approaching another one—is nothing much; only the same old cyclical conflict which always restarts when peace is about to break out, and always dampens down when the violence becomes intense enough. The ease of filming andreporting out of safe and comfortable Israeli hotels inflates the media coverage of every minor affray. But humanitarians should note that the dead from Jewish-Palestinian fighting since 1921 amount to fewer than 100,000—about as many as are killed in a season of conflict in Darfur. <br />

Resource Wars Answers <br />

<u>This point of view is not limited to economists. A technologist writing on minerals</u><br />
<u>put it this way: &quot;In effect, technology keeps creating new resources.&quot; The major</u><br />
<u>constraint upon the human capacity to enjoy unlimited minerals, energy, and other raw</u><br />
<u>materials at acceptable prices is knowledge</u>. And the source of knowledge is the human mind. Ultimately, then, the key constraint is human imagination acting together with educated skills. <u>This is why an increase of human beings, along with causing an additional consumption of resources, constitutes a crucial addition to the stock of</u><br />
<u>natural resources.</u><br />
<br />
<em>Price solves: short term scarcity means people don’t use as much of a good—causing abundance of the resource:</em><br />

<u>There is no persuasive reason to believe that the relatively larger use of natural</u><br />
<u>resources that would occur with a larger population would have any special deleterious</u><br />
<u>effects upon the economy in the future</u>. For the foreseeable future, even if the extrapolation of past trends is badly in error, the cost of energy is not an important consideration in evaluating the impact of population growth. Other natural resources may be treated in a manner just like any other physical capital when considering the economic effect of different rates of population growth. <u>Depletion of mineral resources is not a special danger for the long run or the short run. Rather, the availability of mineral resources, as measured by their prices, may be expected to increase</u> - that is, costs may be expected to decrease - despite all notions about &quot;finiteness.&quot; <u>Sound appraisal of the impact of additional people upon the &quot;scarcity&quot;</u> (cost) <u>of a natural resource must take into account the feedback from increased demand to the discovery of new deposits, new ways of extracting the resource, and new substitutes for the resource. And we must take into account the relationship between demand now and supply in various future years, rather than considering only the effect on supply now of greater or lesser demand now. And the more people there are, the more minds that are working to discover new sources and increase productivity, with raw materials as with all other goods.</u><br />

Asian war is unlikely --- all potential conflicts are solved by regional stability initiatives throughout the region <br />
Bitzinger &amp; Desker, 08 – senior fellow and dean of S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies respectively (Richard A. Bitzinger, Barry Desker, “Why East Asian War is Unlikely,” Survival, December 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://pdfserve.informaworld.com-/678328_731200556_906256449.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://pdfserve.informaworld.com-/678328_731200556_906256449.pdf</a>) <br />
<u>The Asia-Pacific region can be regarded as a zone of both relative insecurity and strategic stability. It contains</u> <u>some of the world’s most significant flashpoints</u> – the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the Siachen Glacier – where tensions between nations could escalate to the point of major war. It is replete with unresolved border issues; is a breeding ground for transnationa terrorism and the site of many terrorist activities (the Bali bombings, the Manila superferry bombing); <u>and contains overlapping claims for maritime territories</u> (the Spratly Islands, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands) <u>with considerable actual or potential wealth in resources such as oil, gas and fisheries. Finally, the Asia-Pacific is an area of strategic significance with many key sea lines of communication and important chokepoints. Yet despite all these potential crucibles of conflict, the Asia-Pacific, if not an area of serenity and calm, is certainly more stable than one might expect</u>. To be sure, there are separatist movements and internal struggles, particularly with insurgencies, as in Thailand, the Philippines and Tibet. <u>Since the resolution of the East Timor crisis, however, the region has been relatively free of open armed warfare. Separatism remains a challenge, but the break-up of states is unlikely. Terrorism is a nuisance, but its impact is contained. The North Korean nuclear issue, while not fully resolved, is at least moving toward a conclusion with the likely denuclearisation of the peninsula. Tensions between China and Taiwan, while always just beneath the surface, seem unlikely to erupt in open conflict any time soon, especially given recent Kuomintang Party victories in Taiwan and efforts by Taiwan and China to re-open informal channels of consultation as well as institutional relationships between organisations responsible for cross-strait relations. And while in Asia there is no strong supranational political entity like the European Union, there are many multilateral organisations and international initiatives dedicated to enhancing peace and stability, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. In Southeast Asia, countries are united in a common eopolitical and economic organisation – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – which is dedicated to peaceful economic, social and cultural development, and to the promotion of regional peace and stability. ASEAN has played a key role in conceiving and establishing broader regional institutions such as the East Asian Summit,</u> ASEAN+3 (China, Japan and South Korea) <u>and the ASEAN Regional Forum. All this suggests that war in Asia – while not inconceivable – is unlikely.</u><br />

 War with China now is key – they’re using the relative peacefulness of relations as a cover to build a nanotech arsenal to wipe the US off the planet <br />
<u>Navrozov 2003</u> – News Max, interview with Lev -a journalist, author, and columnist—extensively studied superweapons and won the Albert Einstein Price for outstanding intellectual achievements, 9/26/03, “an interview on nanoweapons,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/9/25/210250.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2003/9/25/210250.shtml</a> <br />
<br />
RM: What countries are developing the post-nuclear superweapons involving nanotechnology? LN: <u>It is worthwhile to speak only of China</u>, Russia if dictatorship comes back to that country, and the United States if it awakens from its sleep, which may well be its last. To make the nanoweapons useful, a country must have the ability and the will to either world domination or to the defense against another country’s world domination. RM: What do you believe are the motives and goals of the countries that are developing the post-nuclear superweapons? LN: The national student movement of 1989, associated with Tiananmen Square, endangered the Chinese dictatorship more than any group in Soviet Russia endangered the Soviet dictatorship two years later. Yet the Soviet dictatorship fell. What a lesson for the Chinese dictators! We know authentic information about the Tiananmen Square movement from Zhang Liang’s publication &quot;The Tiananmen Papers,” a 514-page collection of Chinese government documents. It is clear that the dictators of China saw how absolutism was endangered in China and understood that the only way to prevent future Tiananmens was to annihilate or subjugate the source of subversion, viz., the West. RM: What do you believe are going to be China’s next steps in terms of acquiring territory? LN: In contrast to Hitler, who stupidly grabbed the rump of Czechoslovakia in 1939, <u>China has been very cautious in its territorial claims, since the position of China now is the best for the development of</u> &quot;Superweapon No. 3,” such as <u>the nano superweapon.</u> RM: Who does <u>China see</u> as allies and enemies? LN: <u>The worst enemy is the democratic West</u>, whose very existence produces Tiananmens able to destroy the Chinese dictatorship. The best ally is the democratic West, supplying China with everything necessary for the annihilation or subjugation of the democratic West. RM: Are the other post-nuclear weapons being researched to this day? If so, are they known? If not, can you enlighten us? LN: Since the nano &quot;Superweapon No. 3” is a hypothesis, and not an absolute certainty, the Chinese Project 863 has been engaged in genetic engineering and at least six or seven other fields. RM: If China has or is close to, molecular nanotechnology to be used in war, what is the purpose of having a large, advanced conventional army and &quot;traditional” nuclear weapons? LN: Eric Drexler, the Newton of nanotechnology, alive and enriching us with his wisdom, discusses the problem in his historic book of 1986 &quot;Engines of Creation.” My assistant Isak Baldwin says that, according to Drexler, &quot;<u>A nation armed with molecular nanotechnology-based weapons would not require nuclear weapons to annihilate a civilization.</u> In fact, it seems that a rather surgical system of seeking and destroying enemy human beings as cancerous polyps could be developed--leaving the nation’s infrastructure intact to be repopulated.” Nevertheless conventional weapons might be useful even on the &quot;D-day,” after nanotechnology has been successfully weaponized. Conventional non-nuclear weapons have been useful even after 1945. Please recall that two &quot;atom bombs” were delivered in 1945 by conventional U.S. bombers with conventional machine guns and all. RM: What beliefs or desires are motivating the rulers of China? The belief that Communism must triumph over Capitalism? LN: A New York taxi robber risks his life, life imprisonment, or death sentence to acquire the taxi driver’s $200. Hence the bulletproof partitions in taxis. The dictators of China defend not $200, but their power, which is worth trillions of dollars, apart from what cannot be expressed in terms of money (royal grandeur, cult, and glorification). Remember the French king who said, &quot;The state – it is me”? Many dictators have been saying and can always say: &quot;Communism/capitalism/democracy/freedom/socialism/national socialism/our great country/the meaning of life/the goal of history – it is me.&quot; RM: If the U.S. is the most technologically advanced country, does this mean we have been surpassed? LN: The &quot;most technologically advanced country” is an ambiguous generality. In the 1950s, Russia was still a technologically backward country, with most of its population deprived of running water, to say nothing of passenger cars. Yet it did not prevent Russia from outstripping the United States in space rocketry, when the Soviet space satellite was launched before its American counterpart. In its annual &quot;Soviet Military Power,” to which I subscribed, the Pentagon could not help praising certain Soviet weapons as second to none in the world. RM: What today is holding China back from becoming overtly aggressive and reshaping the geopolitical world? LN: The dictators of China are not insane! China’s government-controlled &quot;capitalist corporations” have been penetrating the entrails of the Western economies, absorbing the latest science and technology – or sometimes entire Western corporations, induced to operate in China on cheap local labor. To become &quot;overtly aggressive”? What for? To invade Taiwan? To perish, along with the West, in Mutually Assured Destruction? No, <u>the dictators of China are not insane! They are developing superweapons able to annihilate the Western means of nuclear retaliation.</u><br />

US beating China in nanotech now, delaying war means our dominance will collapse <br />
<u>Oregonian</u>, Feb 20<u>09</u>, “China chips away at our high-tech advantage” <br />
<br />
China no longer wants to be the world's factory for cheap products. Under pressure to create better-paying jobs and to clean up its environment, the nation is trying to snag blue chip companies by vowing to crack down on intellectual property theft and schooling a new class of managers. <u>The industries China craves</u> — high-tech and <u>nanotechnology</u> — employ tens of thousands in Oregon and are a cornerstone of the states future, albeit a fading one. China's scramble up the ladder will test a long-held assumption: that our competitive advantage — American ingenuity — can't be beat. China's high-stakes play raises a nagging question: If it succeeds, how will Oregon and the U.S. compete in the coming decades? &quot;That's a good question,&quot; says Jim McGregor, an analyst with In-Stat, an Arizona-based research firm. &quot;Everyone's trying to figure out what's the impact of the economic situation we're about to get through — and what's going to happen to China.&quot; Over the past 20 years, U.S. companies have all but thrown in the towel to Chinese competitors, moving factories for low-cost goods to tap the country's bargain prices. For the most part, the U.S. has managed to replace the assembly-line jobs shipped overseas with better, higher-skilled jobs at home. In 2008, high tech jobs employed 58,400 people in Oregon, paying an average of $93,400 a year. &quot;High-tech is extremely important in this state,&quot; says Tim McCabe, director of the Oregon Economic &amp; Community Development Department. &quot;But, like anything, we don't know what the future is going to be in high-tech.&quot; Now those better jobs could be getting boxed up too. <u>In an employment-squashing recession, some people worry that those positions, still cheaper in China, might not return to the U.S. when the economy rebounds</u>. <u>&quot;If we sit on our hands and believe that our lead in technology and innovation is unassailable, China or someone will eat our lunch eventually,&quot;</u> says Joseph Borich, president of the Washington State China Relations Council. &quot;There's still a large gap in their ability to make new technologies, but <u>they're gaining ground on us.&quot;</u><br />

This is the only existential risk – nothing else is even close <br />
Anissimov Aug 2 2007 <br />
Michael, a science/technology writer and consultant, “Existential Risks: Serious Business” <br />
<br />
This does seem true, and admonitions about global warming may be partially to blame, as well as terrorist fearmongering (some of which may also, in fact, be well-founded). Anthropogenic global warming is a reality, yes, but I don’t think it’s an existential risk, especially not in the next few decades. Bombardment with warnings on anthropogenic climate change, as well as terrorist attacks, is desensitizing the populace to warnings of existential risk. I’m not saying such warnings are a bad thing, just pointing out the fact that they’re desensitizing us. The fact that the most severe risks have to do with technologies just barely beginning to roll off the assembly lines — advanced AI and robotics, and synthetic biology — doesn’t help matters either. <br />
<br />
But, as always, you, the reader, can refuse to be a part of the problem. You can take existential risk seriously, and refuse to write off those who discuss these dangers, like Martin Rees and Stephen Hawking, as “Doomsayers”. For most of the past 10,000 years, catastrophic technological risk has been impossible. Even global thermonuclear war would be more likely to kill off 10% or 20% of the population rather than 99% or 100%. And if you care about the long-term future of humankind as a whole, killing a billion and killing everyone makes a hell of a lot of difference. <br />

<br />
Assuming the absence of mindless escalation to a general nuclear exchange, <u>a war between China and the United States would be constrained by limited military capacity and political objectives</u>. For openers, <u>neither China nor the United States is capable of invading and subjugating the other, and even if the United States had the ability to do so, avoidance of a land war on the Asian mainland has long been an injunction of American strategy. The objectives of a Sino-American war over Taiwan or freedom of navigation in the South China Sea would be limited—just as they were in the Sino-American war in Korea</u>. And since the outcome in either case would be decided by naval and air forces, with regular ground forces relegated to a distinctly secondary role, <u>a war over Taiwan or the South China Sea would also be limited in terms of the type of force employed. This was not the case in the Korean War, in which ground combat dominated.</u> (To be sure, the US position on the ground would have been untenable without air dominance.) <br />
War won't go nuclear - No first use <br />
<u>Zhenqiang</u> 20<u>05</u> (Pan; China Security (World Security Institute China Program); <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.irchina.org/en/news/view.asp?id=403" rel="nofollow">http://www.irchina.org/en/news/view.asp?id=403</a>) <br />
<br />
First, <u>NFU highlights China’s philosophical belief that nuclear weapons can only be used to serve one purpose, that of retaliation against a nuclear attack</u>, pending complete nuclear disarmament. Indeed, their extremely large destructive capabilities render nuclear weapons the only truly inhumane weapon of mass destruction and are of little other use to China. Faced with U.S. nuclear blackmail in the 1950s, China had no alternative to developing its own nuclear capability so as to address the real danger of being a target of a nuclear strike. But even so, Beijing vowed that having a nuclear capability would only serve this single purpose. <br />
From the very beginning of acquiring a nuclear capability, <u>Beijing announced that it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons under any conditions; it also pledged unconditionally not to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear weapon states</u>. <u>This claim is not merely rhetoric that cannot be verified</u>, as some Western pundits accused. On the contrary, China’s nuclear rationale has determined the defensive nature of its nuclear force, its posture, size and operational doctrine, which have been highly visible and have stood the test of time. <u>It is in this sense that China is NOT a nuclear weapon state in the Western sense</u>. Unlike all the other nuclear weapon states, for example, <u>China has never intended to use its nuclear capability to make up for the in efficiency of conventional capabilities vis-à-vis other world powers nor has China an interest in joining a nuclear arms race with other nuclear states.</u> And thanks to the insistence of this policy based on NFU, China succeeds in reducing the nuclear element to the minimum in its relations with other nuclear nations, avoiding a possible nuclear arms race, and contributing to the global strategic stability at large. If this policy serves well its core security interests, why should Beijing change it? <br />
China’s NFU checks nuclear escalation <br />
<u>Zhenqiang</u> 20<u>05</u> (Pan; China Security (World Security Institute China Program); <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.irchina.org/en/news/view.asp?id=403" rel="nofollow">http://www.irchina.org/en/news/view.asp?id=403</a>) <br />
<br />
The third reason is that a change in China’s NFU policy would deliver another crushing blow to the international efforts to maintain peace and stability through the arms control approach. The hostility by the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush towards any constraints involving international, legally binding documents, including arms control agreements, has mostly paralyzed these efforts. In contrast, <u>China firmly supports the reactivation of arms control efforts, advocating that all nuclear weapon states should honestly undertake their obligations of nuclear disarmamen</u>t as stipulated by the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). <u>China has consistently stressed that the first step should be the conclusion of a treaty by all nuclear weapon states not to be the first to use nuclear weapons</u>. Such an agreement would be a significant confidence-building measure among these states to put their subsequent actions on the right track. <u>But if China changes its position on NFU, it would be tantamount to reversing all of Beijing’s attitudes. China would no longer take interest in any nuclear disarmament measures in its desperate efforts for a nuclear build-up. Nor would Beijing be interested in developing a new international arms control mechanism, aimed at constraining the behavior of nuclear weapon states. In addition, nuclear proliferation could be further fuelled as non-nuclear weapon states would have one more exemplary argument that a nation can opt for nuclear weapons in the name of national interests.</u><br />

Primary Sino-American war starters seem to be Chinese aggression against Taiwan and in the South China Sea. Yet, <u>a US defense of Taiwan and of freedom of navigation in the western Pacific would play greatly to America’s traditional military strengths while at the same time exploit long-standing Chinese weaknesses.</u> Historically, <u>China’s sole strategically impressive war-fighting suit has been the quantity of its ground forces, which counts for little in the pursuit of offshore imperial ambitions</u>. <u>Asserting and maintaining dominance over Taiwan and the South China Sea require mastery of air and naval power—arenas in which the United States is peerless and likely to remain so for decades</u> (assuming no retreat to isolationism plus a determination to maintain both conventional military supremacy and a forward military presence in East Asia—neither to be taken for granted). Chinese naval and air forces are rudimentary by US standards, but perhaps an even greater deficiency is the absence of any modern combat experience. <u>China has not fought a major war since Korea</u> (where US airpower pummeled the PLA), whereas <u>the United States has had a virtual cornucopia of</u> such <u>experience since the end of the Cold War. Practice may not make perfect, but it is surely better than sitting on the military bench for almost half a century.</u> (China’s brief and highly restricted invasion of Vietnam in 1979 pitted masses of poorly armed and trained Chinese troops against better-equipped North Vietnamese combat veterans.) <br />

China’s nuclear force is atrocious- their ICBM’s are liquid fueled, unmated and unarmed. We would be able to first strike their facilities before they could get a shot off. The risk of nuclear war will always be greater in future conflict <br />
<br />

<br />
So, let's review: <u>China</u> deploys just 30 ICBMs, kept unfueled and without warheads, and another 50-100 MRBMs, sitting unarmed in their garrisons. Conventional wisdom suggests this <u>posture is vulnerable and invites preemptive attack during a crisis</u>. This minimal arsenal is clearly a matter of choice: China stopped fissile material production in 1990 and has long had the capacity to produce a much larger number of ballistic missiles. <u>The simplest explanation for this choice is that the Chinese leadership worries less about its vulnerability to a disarming first strike than the costs of an arms race or what some Second Artillery officer might do with a fully armed nuclear weapon</u>. In a strange way, <u>Beijing placed more faith in Washington and Moscow than in its own military officers.</u><br />
US attack would cause a regime change in China- that’s Ross- here’s more evidence <br />

<br />
Finally, a war with the United States could be economically and even politically catastrophic for the communist rulers in Beijing. Unlike the defunct Soviet Union, China has an enormous stake in the international capitalist trading order. Indeed, China’s whopping annual trade surpluses with the United States have been indispensable to sustaining China’s remarkable economic growth and have provided large amounts of hard currency with which to finance its selective military modernization. A war with the United States would destroy Sino-American commerce (as well as China’s lucrative trade with and investment from Taiwan). China’s attractiveness as a magnet for foreign capital would cease. The consequent effects of collapsed growth would not be just economic. Because the post-Marxist regime in Beijing has staked so much of its legitimacy on its ability to deliver higher living standards, a war-caused economic depression could topple the government itself. <br />
That would end the war <br />

Like the nations involved in World War I, and unlike the rogue states everyone has been concentrating on, the United States and China in the twenty-first century would have the capacity to keep fighting even if one or the other lost a big battle or a missile exchange. This has far-reaching implications. &quot;Ending a war with China,&quot; Vickers says, &quot;may mean effecting some form of regime change, because we don't want to leave some wounded, angry regime in place.&quot; Another analyst, this one inside the Pentagon, told me, &quot;Ending a war with China will force us to substantially reduce their military capacity, thus threatening their energy sources and the Communist Party's grip on power.

China’s ability to redress the nuclear imbalance is even more suspect. Much has been made of <u>China’s</u> ongoing defense modernization, but the country’s <u>strategic arsenal is growing at a glacial pace</u>. <u>China has only 18 ICBMs, a number that has remained essentially unchanged for more than a decade</u>.

Ext. - US-China War Inevit <br />
<br />
Pentagon studies prove war is inevitable by 2017 <br />
<u>Ergas</u>, Dec 5, <u>2006</u><br />
Zeki, visiting scholar for three years at the Institute of International Studies of the University of California, at Berkeley, and for four years at the at the African Studies Program of the School of Foreign Service, at Georgetown University, presently Secretary General of PEN International’s Swiss Romand Center and lives in Geneva, “Introduction: The Neo-con Project for a New American Century and its Implications” <br />
<br />
As its title indicates, according to the larger study, America’s ‘manifest destiny’ is to be the world’s supreme political and economic power: a kind of Roman Empire of the 21st century which will impose upon the world a Pax Americana based on freedom and prosperity. What distinguishes the neo-cons from liberals is that they believe that the United States should not shy from using force to achieve that overarching goal. More specifically the Pentagon document identifies China as an ‘emerging economic giant’ which will be America’s main rival in the near future. So for the neo-con intellectuals, it is not fundamentalist Islam and the international terrorists of Al Qaida that are America’s most serious future enemy but China. Furthermore<u>,</u> <u>the Pentagon document gives a precise date as to when China will become an unacceptable threat to the US. That date is the year of 2017</u>. Why 2017? And: What is the precise nature of that threat? <u>The Pentagon document is based on the findings of a massive computer study that has analysed a myriad of economic, demographic, technological and military data that have been fed into i</u>t. Its conclusion is that, <u>at the beginning of 2017, China</u> – which will have then the largest middle class of the world, perhaps 500 million people, or more – <u>will be consuming too much</u>: too many energetic and mineral resources, and too many consumer products, <u>and there simply will not be on the planet enough room for both China and the United States,</u>if China is to enjoy a standard of living comparable to that of the United States (or even to that of Western Europe). So that is the conclusion of the Pentagon document. In reality, the ‘situation’ is worse, far worse, in fact, because, owing to the neo-liberal globalisation that is spreading around the planet like a bushfire, China is not alone in that hungry quest for advanced consumerism. It is closely followed by India, Russia and Brazil (the other three ‘emerging’ economic giants; together these ‘big four’ are often referred to as the CRIB countries (C for China, R for Russia, and so on) which have a combined population of about 2,800 million, or more than forty per cent of the world’s total. And even the rise of the CRIB countries does not represent the whole ‘scramble’ for advanced consumerism, for behind them are important middle-sized countries -- like Turkey, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam, Venezuela, Argentina, Chile, and so on. In fact a fierce and worldwide competition for scarce energetic and mineral resources in which the US and China are playing the leading roles has already started. <u>The US invasion of Iraq was mainly motivated by a wish to control the energetic resources of the Middle East</u>, Iraq happens to be at the very heart of the Middle East, and a large military base there (now that the American military had to leave Saudi Arabia) is indispensable for that control<u>. China is very active buying energetic resources in Africa, Latin America, and even Asia</u> (its preferred method is long term contracts often covering the production of the next 25 years; it has already signed such contracts with Iran, Angola, Nigeria and Venezuela). It <u>is also heavily investing all over the world</u> (it has a treasure chest of about a trillion dollars). At the China-Africa economic summit of Beijing, in November 2006, contracts worth about $ 16 billion were signed between China and the heads of state or of government of the 43 African countries that participated. <br />

The Iraqi war has convinced the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership that some form of confrontation with the U.S. could come earlier than expected. Beijing has also begun to fine-tune its domestic and security policies to counter the perceived threat of U.S. &quot;neo-imperialism.&quot; As more emphasis is being put on boosting national strength and cohesiveness, a big blow could be dealt to both economic and political reform.

<br />
These developments have prompted China to change its long-standing geopolitical strategy, which still held true as late as the 16th CCP Congress last November. Until late last year, Beijing believed a confrontation with the U.S. could be delayed -- and China could through hewing to the late Deng Xiaoping's &quot;keep a low profile&quot; theory afford to concentrate almost exclusively on economic development. &quot;Now, many cadres and think-tank members think Beijing should adopt a more pro-active if not aggressive policy to thwart U.S. aggression,&quot; said a Chinese source close to the diplomatic establishment. He added hard-line elements in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had advocated providing weapons to North Korea to help Pyongyang defend itself against a possible U.S. missile strike at its nuclear facilities. Forestalling the challenge Hu was elected president of China by the NPC this month. Hu was elected president of China by the NPC this month. Even less hawkish experts are advocating beefing up the national security apparatus. Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) economist Yang Fan pointed out the recent global flare-ups had alerted China to the imperative of improving national security and cohesiveness. &quot;Equal weight should be given to economic development and national security,&quot; Yang said. &quot;As we become more prosperous, we must concentrate our forces [on safeguarding national safety].&quot; What is China doing to forestall the perceived U.S. challenge? Firstly, the CCP leadership is fostering nationalistic sentiments, a sure-fire way to promote much-needed cohesiveness.<br />

So a special context has been devised for dismissing inconvenient facts. This context is inculcated at graduate schools, think tanks and in government. The context for understanding international affairs must not admit the existence of a coordinated, secretive and dangerous combination of countries motivated to overthrow the United States</span>. In other words, the existence of a “communist bloc” cannot be admitted. And China’s role within this bloc – above all – must be rated as a “crackpot notion.” And yet, the existence of something identical to the old communist bloc – whatever we choose to call it – is indicated by actions across the board by Russia, the East European satellite countries, North Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and China. Some ideas fall from fashion. But truth is always true, fashion or not. <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">U.S. experts failed to connect the dots regarding China’s development of a long-range cruise missile, a new attack submarine, new ground-to-air missiles, a new anti-ship missile (for sinking U.S. aircraft carriers</span>) and more. <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">China is preparing for war against the U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates, specifically. As absurd as it sounds to the economic optimists who think trade with China guarantees peace, the U.S. and China are bound to collide. <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn’t have a sense of history</span>, doesn’t understand communist thinking or the overall policy Beijing has consistently followed since 1949. Communist countries periodically experiment with capitalism, they always seek trade with the West, and they always sink the money and technology they gain thereby into a military buildup. Ultimately,<span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">they don’t care about the prosperity of their people, the state of the national infrastructure, personal or press freedom. </span>Some believe that we mustn’t say that China is a threat. Such a statement would be akin to self-fulfilling prophecy. But an <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">honest appreciation of Chinese actions should not be disallowed by an appeasing diplomacy or wishful thinking</span>. The job of the analyst is not to guarantee good relations with countries that are preparing for destructive war. The job of the analyst is to see war preparations, diplomatic maneuvers and economic policies and draw a common sense conclusion about them. If world peace depends on hiding China’s military buildup, then world peace is like your fat uncle dressed in a Santa Claus suit. Saying it’s your fat uncle may ruin Christmas for your little sister, but Santa Claus isn’t a real person – and never will be. <br />
History is on our side – every nation that has ever come to global power has always done so through massive transition war; China will be no different, they are a threat, and they will always perceive us as THE enemy no matter how much you hippies don’t want them to. <br />
Kagan 5(Robert, Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “The Illusion of ‘Managing’ China,” Washington Post, Lexis) <br />
The history of rising powers, however, and their attempted &quot;management&quot; by established powers provides little reason for confidence or comfort. Rarely have rising powers risen without sparking a major war that reshaped the international system to reflect new realities of power. The most successful &quot;management&quot; of a rising power in the modern era was Britain's appeasement of the United States in the late 19th century, when the British effectively ceded the entire Western Hemisphere (except Canada) to the expansive Americans. The fact that both powers shared a common liberal, democratic ideology, and thus roughly consonant ideas of international order, greatly lessened the risk of accommodation from the British point of view. Other examples are less encouraging. Germany's rise after 1870, and Europe's reaction to it, eventually produced World War I. Even the masterly Bismarck, after a decade of successful German self-management, had a difficult time steering Europe away from collision. The British tried containment, appeasement and even offers of alliance, but never fully comprehended Kaiser Wilhelm's need to challenge the British supremacy he both admired and envied. Right up until the eve of war, highly regarded observers of the European scene believed commercial ties among the leading powers made war between them unlikely, if not impossible. Japan's rise after 1868 produced two rounds of warfare -- first with China and Russia at the turn of the century, and later with the United States and Britain in World War II. The initial Anglo-American response to Japan's growing power was actually quite accommodating. Meiji Japan had chosen the path of modernization and even Westernization, or so it seemed, and Americans welcomed its ascendancy over backward China and despotic Russia. Then, too, there was the paternalistic hope of assisting Japan's entry into the international system, which was to say the Western system. &quot;The Japs have played our game,&quot; Theodore Roosevelt believed, and only occasionally did he wonder whether &quot;the Japanese down at bottom did not lump Russians, English, Americans, Germans, all of us, simply as white devils inferior to themselves . . . and to be treated politely only so long as would enable the Japanese to take advantage of our national jealousies, and beat us in turn.&quot; Today we look back at those failures and ruminate on the mistakes made with the usual condescension that the present has for the past. But there is no reason to believe we are any smarter today than the policymakers who &quot;mismanaged&quot; the rise of Germany and Japan. The majority of today's policymakers and thinkers hold much the same general view of global affairs as their forebears: namely, that commercial ties between China and the other powers, especially with Japan and the United States, and also with Taiwan, will act as a buffer against aggressive impulses and ultimately ease China's &quot;integration&quot; into the international system without war. Once again we see an Asian power modernizing and believe this should be a force for peace. And we add to this the conviction, also common throughout history, that if we do nothing to provoke China, then it will be peaceful, without realizing that it may be the existing international system that the Chinese find provocative. The security structures of East Asia, the Western liberal values that so dominate our thinking, the &quot;liberal world order&quot; we favor -- this is the &quot;international system&quot; into which we would &quot;integrate&quot; China. But isn't it possible that China does not want to be integrated into a political and security system that it had no part in shaping and that conforms neither to its ambitions nor to its own autocratic and hierarchical principles of rule? Might not China, like all rising powers of the past, including the United States, want to reshape the international system to suit its own purposes, commensurate with its new power, and to make the world safe for its autocracy? Yes, the Chinese want the prosperity that comes from integration in the global economy, but might they believe, as the Japanese did a century ago, that the purpose of getting rich is not to join the international system but to change it? We may not know the answers to these questions. But we need to understand that the nature of China's rise will be determined largely by the Chinese and not by us. The Chinese leadership may already believe the United States is its enemy, for instance, and there is nothing we can do to change that. Partly this is due to our actions -- such as the strengthening of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance, which began during the Clinton administration, and our recent efforts to enhance strategic ties with India. Partly it is due to our different forms of government, since autocratic rulers naturally feel threatened by a democratic superpower and its democratic allies around their periphery. Partly it is due to the nature of the situation in East Asia. It used to be an article of faith among Sinologists that the Chinese did not want to drive the United States out of the region. Today many are not so sure. It would not be unusual if an increasingly powerful China wanted to become the dominant power in its own region, and dominant not just economically but in all other respects, as well. When one contemplates how to &quot;manage&quot; that, however, comforting notions of gradualness, predictability and time begin to fade. The obvious choices would seem to lie between ceding American predominance in the region and taking steps to contain China's understandable ambitions. Not many Americans favor the former course, and for sound political, moral and strategic reasons. But let's not kid ourselves. It will be hard to pursue the latter course without treating China as at least a prospective enemy, and not just 20 years from now, but now. Nor, if that is the choice, can Chinese leaders be expected to wait patiently while the web of containment is strengthened around them. More likely, they will periodically want to challenge both the United States and its allies in the region to back off. Crises could come sooner than expected, and without much warning, requiring difficult judgments about the risks and rewards of both action and inaction. That is likely what the future holds. The United States may not be able to avoid a policy of containing China; we are, in fact, already doing so. This is a sufficiently unsettling prospect, however, that we are doing all we can to avoid thinking about it. We conjure hopeful images of a modernizing China that seeks only economic growth and would do nothing to threaten commercial ties with us -- unless provoked -- even as we watch nervously the small but steady Chinese military buildup, the periodic eruptions of popular nationalism, the signs of Chinese confidence intermingled with <br />
feelings of historical injustice and the desire to right old wrongs. Which China is it? A 21st-century power that wants to be integrated into a liberal international order, which would mean both a transformation of its own polity and a limitation of its strategic ambitions? Or a 19th-century power that wants to preserve its rule at home and expand its reach abroad? It is a worthy subject for debate, because the answer will determine the future as much as or more than anything we do. But it is unlikely we will have a definitive answer in time to adjust, to &quot;manage&quot; China's &quot;rise,&quot; any more than our predecessors did. As in the past, we will have to peer into the fog and make prudent judgments, informed by the many tragic lessons of history. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if we change our perspective, China will still securitize us. <br />
Deng 1 (Yong, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the United States Naval Academy, “Hegemon on the Offensive,” Political Science Quarterly, Volume 116 Number 3,) <br />
The foregoing sampling of views suffices to demonstrate the diversity in strategic descriptions and prescriptions in the United States. Strategic debate is to be expected in a democracy that wields such overwhelming power as the sole superpower sitting atop of the world. While the United States gropes for a coherent strategy, Chinese analysts attribute to it a highly cohesive master plan designed to strengthen and <u>expand its global domination.</u> By the mid-1990s, emerging consensus on the preponderance of U.S. power allowed and compelled Chinese analysts to pay closer attention to U.S. global strategy than ever before. They took notice of the fact that the United States had experienced significant growth in its comprehensive national power in<u>economic, scientific, technological, and military arenas.</u> By contrast, throughout the 1990s, Japan, Russia, and to a lesser extend the European Union were mired in economic stagnation and had shown no determination to challenge the U.S. global position. This presents the United States with what Chinese analysts call a period of “strategic opportunity” to further enhance its international primacy. The Chinese commentators pointed to the continued increase in U.S. military spending, exceeding $305.4 billion in the 2001 fiscal year (FY), an increase of $16.5 billion over the previous year. In FY 19999, U.S. defense expenditure amounted to $276.2 billion, which was 1.67 times the combined military expenditures of the second-tier powers – Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Russia, and China. For Chinese observers, the U.S. intention in maintaining such a spectacularly high military expenditure was to ensure U.S. superiority over its potential competitors by a vast margin. <br />
From the Chinese perspective, the United States has taken advantage of this rare window of strategic opportunity “to step up its global strategic deployment,” “to complete a global strategic layout” before other powers are prepared to balance the U.S. power. In the words of one Chinese analyst, “The United States will contain, besiege, and even lunch preemptive military strike<u>s</u>against any country which dares to defy the U.S. world hegemony or which has constituted a latent challenge to the United States. Among its main targets are a number of countries in Eurasia, including Russia, Yugoslavia, Iraq, Iran, Libya, North Korea, and China.” Chinese analysts invariably see the NATO expansion and its air war in Kosovo as designed to weaken and encircle Russia. The Kosovo war was to defeat the defiant Milosevic regime, remove an obstacle for NATO enlargement, and further encroach upon Russia’s traditional sphere of influence. <u>On the Asian front, the Un</u>ited States <u>revitalized its security alliance with Japan, proceeded with</u> the Theater Missile Defense (<u>TMD</u>) program, and maintained large forwardly deployed troops in the west Pacific to keep an eye on China. <br />
Even if we stopped viewing China as a threat, they would still securitize against us. <br />

I would argue, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/bookclub/2007/jun/25/china_s_new_world_order" rel="nofollow">__counter to Naazneen Barma__</a>, that China has already become “more like us,” and that this is not necessarily a good thing. Beijing recognizes that the global economic sphere is a power game not a regime governed by rule of law. The United States complains of China not being a “responsible stakeholder,” but in fact China is simply taking a page from the U.S. book.Beijing protects its industries as assiduously as Washington protects farmers. Beijing helps Chinese companies abroad much as Washington has used export supports (and has invoked the “national security exception” in trade bills to subsidize U.S. arms sales overseas). What is so unusual about Beijing securing access to oil and natural resources – in Africa, in Latin America -- without regard to authoritarian dictators and human rights violations? The Politburo is simply following the advice of Henry Kissinger, placing national interest above abstract principles. Sure, Washington supported Pinochet, Karimov, Saddam (pre-1990), and a host of other dictators for reasons other than simply resource extraction. But oil, natural gas, and copper certainly played a part in the calculations. So, China can play balance of power games like the rest of us. It can ignore human rights violations like the rest of us. And it can intervene – while always spouting rhetoric about inviolate sovereignty – just like the rest of us. <br />
China perceives the United States as an enemy and no US action can reverse it <br />

A soft-line policy on China won’t solve the security dilemma – China strives to be a hegemon as realist theory predicts <br />
<br />
Mearsheimer 1 (John, professor at the University of Chicago, The Tragedy of Great Power Politics) <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, a policy of engagement is doomed to fail. <u>If China becomes an economic powerhouse it will</u> almost <u>certainly translate its economic might into military might and make a run atdominating Northeast Asia. Whether China is democratic</u> and deeply enmeshed in the global economy <u>or autocratic</u> and autarkic <u>will have little effect on its behavior, because democracies care about security</u> as much as non-democracies do, <u>and hegemony is the best way for any state to guarantee its own survival.</u> Of course, <u>neither its neighbors nor the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>would stand idly by while China gained increasing increments of power.</u> Instead, <u>they would seek to contain China</u>, probably by trying to form a balancing coalition. <u>The result would be an intense security competition between China and its rivals</u>, with the ever-present danger of great-power war hanging over them.

A. CCP collapse / instability is good- spurs a peaceful and stable elite-led transition to democracy <br />
Lui, UC Santa Barbara political science and Chinese political culture professor, 3-22-2008 <br />
[Alan P., University of California Santa Barbara political science professor emeritus specializing in contemporary Chinese political culture and development, China Review International, &quot;China's Democratic Future: How It Will Happen and Where It Will Lead,&quot; l/n] <br />
<br />
At the same time, Chinese society has been undergoing rapid changes because of increasing exposure to the West. New ideas about justice, individualism, democracy, and a feel for community have spread far and wide in the country. More and more Chinese have gone abroad as tourists, and they know how ridiculous the CCP system is. An increasing number of urban people are organizing into civil society-type groups, with the help of the media. These constitute facilitating conditions for a mass movement for democracy. A major crisis of any kind would galvanize these new forces and confront the CCP, in the styles of the People Power in the Philippines in 1986 or the Velvet Revolution in Eastern Europe in 1989. <br />
<br />
According to Gilley, when the moment comes for democracy, an insider--maybe a closet reformer in the CCP--would come forth to take the lead. This is the Russian path; someone like Gorbachev or Yeltsin would guide the Chinese push toward democracy. Gilley called this the &quot;extrication&quot; model. He is banking on the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) not wanting to repeat its bloody deeds in 1989; the PLA had learned the lesson (so Gilley believes). Then an interim regime will follow to open up the political system, hold elections, enact new legislation to establish rule of law, keep the bureaucracy together, and plan rationally for democratization. Finally, the new government would consolidate democracy by writing a new constitution, carrying out a national election based on proportionate representation, organizing a federalist political system, installing a government structure resembling Sun Yat-sen's five branches (adding &quot;special Chinese&quot; departments of anticorruption and civil service examination to the usual legislative-judiciary-executive model). <br />

Nuclear war doesn’t cause extinction <br />
Seitz ‘6 /Russell, Visiting Scholar in Harvard University's Center for International Affairs, “The' Nuclear Winter ' Meltdown,” December 20/ <br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://adamant.typepad.com/seitz/2006/12/preherein_honor.html" rel="nofollow">http://adamant.typepad.com/seitz/2006/12/preherein_honor.html</a> <br />
<br />
&quot;Apocalyptic predictions require, to be taken seriously,higher standards of evidence than do assertions on other matters where the stakes are not as great.&quot; wrote Sagan in Foreign Affairs , Winter 1983 -84. But that &quot;evidence&quot; was never forthcoming.'Nuclear Winter' never existed outside of a computer except as air-brushed animation commissioned by the a PR firm - Porter Novelli Inc. Yet Sagan predicted &quot;the extinction of the human species &quot; as temperatures plummeted 35 degrees C and the world froze in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. Last year, Sagan's cohort tried to reanimate the ghost in a machine anti-nuclear activists invoked in the depths of the Cold War, by re-running equally arbitrary scenarios on a modern interactive Global Circulation Model. But the Cold War is history in more ways than one. It is a credit to post-modern computer climate simulations that they do not reproduce the apocalyptic results of what Sagan oxymoronically termed &quot;a sophisticated one dimensional model.&quot;Twiggy <br />
<br />
The subzero 'baseline case' has melted down into a tepid 1.3 degrees of average cooling- grey skies do not a Ragnarok make . What remains is just not the stuff that End of the World myths are made of. <br />
<br />
It is hard to exaggerate how seriously &quot; nuclear winter &quot;was once taken by policy analysts who ought to have known better. Many were taken aback by the sheer force of Sagan's rhetoric <br />
Remarkably, Science's news coverage of the new results fails to graphically compare them with the old ones Editor Kennedy and other recent executives of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, once proudly co-authored and helped to publicize. <br />
<br />
You can't say they didn't try to reproduce this Cold War icon. Once again, soot from imaginaryPropaganda_penguin_1_1 software materializes in midair by the megaton , flying higher than Mount Everest . This is not physics, but a crude exercise in ' garbage in, gospel out' parameter forcing designed to maximize and extend the cooling an aeosol can generate, by sparing it from realistic attrition by rainout in the lower atmosphere. Despite decades of progress in modeling atmospheric chemistry , there is none in this computer simulation, and ignoring photochemistry further extends its impact. Fortunately , the history of science is as hard to erase as it is easy to ignore. Their past mastery of semantic agression cannot spare the authors of &quot;Nuclear Winter Lite &quot; direct comparison of their new results and their old. <br />
<br />
Dark smoke clouds in the lower atmosphere don't last long enough to spread across the globe. Cloud droplets and rainfall remove them. rapidly washing them out of the sky in a matter of days to weeks- not long enough to sustain a global pall. Real world weather brings down particles much as soot is scrubbed out of power plant smoke by the water sprays in smoke stack scrubbers Robock acknowledges this- not even a single degree of cooling results when soot is released at lower elevations in he models . The workaround is to inject the imaginary aerosol at truly Himalayan elevations - pressure altitudes of 300 millibar and higher , where the computer model's vertical transport function modules pass it off to their even higher neighbors in the stratosphere , where it does not rain and particles linger.. <br />
<br />
The new studies like the old suffer from the disconnect between a desire to paint the sky black and the vicissitudes of natural history. As with many exercise in worst case models both at invoke rare phenomena as commonplace, claiming it prudent to assume the worst. <br />
<br />
But the real world is subject to Murphy's lesser known second law- if everything must go wrong, don't bet on it. In 2006 as in 1983 firestorms and forest fires that send smoke into the stratosphere rise to alien prominence in the modelers re-imagined world , but i the real one remains a very different place, where though every month sees forest fires burning areas the size of cities - 2,500 hectares or larger , stratospheric smoke injections arise but once in a blue moon. So how come these neo-nuclear winter models feature so much smoke so far aloft for so long? <br />
<br />
The answer is simple- the modelers intervened. Turning off vertical transport algorithms may make Al Gore happy- he has bet on reviving the credibility Sagan's ersatz apocalypse , but there is no denying that in some of these scenarios human desire, not physical forces accounts for the vertical hoisting of millions of tons of mass ten vertical kilometers into the sky.to the level at which the models take over , with results at once predictable --and arbitrary. This is not physics, it is computer gamesmanship carried over to a new generation of X-Box. <br />

Irrelevant- Taiwan war will be far worse in the future <br />
<br />
O’Rourke 09 [Ronald, specialist in Naval Affairs for Congressional Research Service, “China Naval Modernization: Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities—Background and Issues for Congress”, July 17, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33153.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33153.pdf</a>] <br />
<br />
Not preparing for a potential conflict over Taiwan years from now could make <br />
such a conflict more likely by emboldening China to use military force to attempt <br />
to achieve its goals regarding Taiwan. It might also embolden China to use its <br />
naval forces more aggressively in asserting its maritime territorial claims and its <br />
interpretation of international laws relating freedom of navigation in exclusive <br />
economic zones (an interpretation at odds with the U.S. interpretation). <br />

China will attack Taiwan- but the US will end the war before it can escalate <br />

Roggio 05 [Bill, Managing Editor of The Long War Journal, the president of Public Multimedia Inc, an Adjunct Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Hoover Institute Media Fellow, and a contributor to the The Weekly Standard, “The China Syndrome”, March 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2005/03/the_china_syndr.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2005/03/the_china_syndr.php</a>] <br />
<br />
The axiom that “amateurs discuss tactics; professionals discuss logistics” hold true in any potential China-Taiwan conflict. With today’s modern satellite technology, a massive invasion force aimed at Taiwan is unlikely to go unnoticed. China does not possess either an offense oriented air force or a blue water navy capable of projecting power and would be unable to stave off American power in the Taiwan Straights, North and South China Sea and the Philippine Sea. While China can initiate an amphibious assault on Taiwan, and would even be likely to land significant forces, they would not be able to sustain them over any long period of time. American air and sea power would smash any logistical resupply attempts to the forces on the ground. <br />

China-Taiwan war causes Taiwan strikes on 3 Gorges Dam <br />

<br />
Newspapers took a line in a Pentagon report noting that if attacked, <u>Taiwan might consider retaliating against high-value Mainland targets like the Three Gorges Dam</u>, and turned it into a story that the United States had suggested attacking the dam.&quot; &quot;<u>Our government can't afford to ignore any American mistake on Taiwan because people will see it as acquiescence</u>. So the government spokesman has to respond,&quot; said a Beijing university professor. <br />
Collapse of the 3 gorges dam causes CCP collapse—that ends the war because government collapses <br />

<br />
In addition, two catastrophic scenarios hang heavy over the Three Gorges Dam. First, if silt continues to rapidly build up behind the dam, eventually the dam will not be able to contain a flood crest and will surely be breached. Second, the mass of water in the reservoir is so heavy that it may alter the pressure in the rocks below and induce an earthquake. With the dam itself built in the vicinity of several fault lines, this earthquake may, in turn, cause the dam to collapse. <u>Such a collapse would unleash the biggest fresh water-based tsunami ever witnessed. The death toll would run into the millions; the economic costs would run into the billions; and the political and social havoc that would likely ensue might even bring down the government, which insisted on building the project to begin with.</u><br />

No escalation- China would win decisively and quickly before the US could act <br />

With the two powers so implacably opposed, any shift in the military balance <u>across the Taiwan Strait</u> is a cause for concern throughout the Asia-Pacific region. That shift has now unambiguously taken place. David Shambaugh, an American expert on the Chinese military, says that following the aggressive upgrading of the People's Liberation Army's capabilities, <u>the balance of military power has tilted decidedly in China's favor.'</u> According to recent estimates by the Pentagon, China has more than seven hundred missiles near its southeast coast, facing Taiwan, and is accelerating the buildup by adding seventy to seventy-five mis-: siles a year, up from its previous annual increase of around fifty.' <u>Such a deployment, some U.S. and Taiwanese analysts say, could be consistent with intentions to launch a lightning &quot;decapitation&quot; strike against Taiwan, using accurate guided weapons to disable the government, disrupt communications, and force Taiwan to the negotiating table within hours —before the U.S. Navy has has had time to sail to Taipei's rescue.</u><br />

<u>In addition to the ground-based missile intercept of a Chinese satellite</u> in January 2007, <u>China is reported to be conducting research for other anti-satellite weapons,</u> such as a ground-based laser <u>capable of damaging and destroying satellites</u>.79 <u>Such a capability could paralyze U.S. civilian and military space systems that are crucially important for a variety of commercial and national security purposes</u>. Again, to <u>highlight the apparent Chinese focus on asymmetric capabilities to hold at risk U.S. space-based assets,</u> the loss of U.S. space-based satellites would have a dramatic effect on communications, whether for civilian or for military purposes. Wireless tele phones, pagers, and electronic mail would be disrupted. In addition, satellites that provide automated reconnais sance and mapping, aid weather prediction, track fleet and troop movements, give accurate positions of U.S. and enemy forces, and guide missiles and pilotless planes to their targets during military operations would have their services curtailed or terminated. <br />
Satellite warfare produces space debris which makes space unusable <br />

<br />
What if there was a Pearl Harbour-like, pre-emptive strike against orbiting satellites? What if our quarrels on the ground spill into space? This is no longer a storyline for the next sci-fi movie, early warning systems are currently being developed to defend satellites, low Earth orbit satellites are being quickly and accurately shot down by the US and China, plus satellite technology is becoming more and more valuable as a strategic target. Like all wars there is a losing side, but <u>in the event of a war in space, we'll all be losers.</u> Its one thing watching a space battle in a sci-fi movie, it's quite another to see it happen in reality. <u>The critical thing about blowing stuff up in space is it produces a lot of mess and will leave a nasty legacy for future generations. Space debris is becoming a serious problem and should there be some form of orbital war, the debris produced may render space impassable</u>. <br />
Extinction <br />

<br />
As he was awarded the most prestigious prize in science, British theoretical physicist Stephen <u>Hawking said that humans need to colonize outer space in order avoid extinction.</u>Hawking, who was presented Thursday with the Copley medal from Britain's Royal Society, told BBC Radio that humanity faces extinction if it confines itself to Earth. &quot;<u>The long-term survival of the human race is at risk as long as it is confined to a single planet,</u>&quot; Hawking said. &quot;<u>Sooner or later disasters such as an asteroid collision or a nuclear war could wipe us all out.</u> But once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe. Hawking said that improvements in technology could make space travel for feasible in the future. &quot;Science fiction has developed the idea of warp drive, which takes you instantly to your destination. Unfortunately, this would violate the scientific law which says that nothing can travel faster than light,&quot; he added &quot;but matter/antimatter annihilation&quot; could make it possible to travel at speeds just below the speed of light. &quot;My next goal is to go into space,&quot; he said. Hawking, who has long pushed for space exploration and has performed groundbreaking research on black holes and the origins of the universe, believes that we could have a permanent base on the moon in 20 years and a colony on Mars in the next 40 years. <u>&quot;Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster, such as sudden global warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers we have not yet thought of,</u>&quot; he said this summer at a news conference in Hong Kong. The Copley medal is the world's oldest award for scientific achievement. First awarded in 1731, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Louis Pasteur and Sir James Cook have been recipients the award. <br />

China will run us out of the pacific in the next 10 years – war now is the only way to ensure quick victory <br />
<u>Clausen 05</u> Lt., Air traffic Control Consultant, Former Military Ed. w/ Aviation Week &amp; Space Tech, 2005 (Perry, Thinking About China's Navy, Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute, 0041798X, May2005, Vol. 131, Issue 5)&quot;The United States is headed for a naval war…make all the difference&quot; <br />
<u>The United States is headed for a naval war with China. We are going to lose. The combination of inadequate shipbuilding</u> and procurement of the wrong types of ships <u>sets us up to be run out of the Western Pacific in five to ten years</u>. Of all of the shortsighted defense procurement decisions a government can make, the failure to fund steady, balanced shipbuilding is the worst of all. Feast and famine is the most expensive way to build ships.Unless it is a long, drawn-out affair-unlikely for a war at sea today-nations fight naval wars with what they have at the start. Reservists and the National Guard can beef up Army units and, to a lesser extent, the Air Force, but it takes forever to build, man, and train a ship into a fighting unit. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and his McNamara-style whiz kids would like us to believe fundamental changes obviate the need for an adequate force structure. They coo soothingly that the revolution in military affairs offers complete knowledge of the battle space, and that this allknowing perspective, combined with precision weapons, can provide the same combat power with fewer assets. The concept works against Afghanistan or Iraq, but it won't against a competitor in our league. The first thing a technologically sophisticated adversary with access to space-China, Europe, or India-will do is cut the cord on many of our high-tech command, control, and intelligence gadgets and we will be left with too few ships. The Pentagon civilians say they are preparing for the next war. In fact, they are getting ready to fight the last one. There may be a few more Iraqs in our future but <u>the next major challenge is a maritime war across the Pacific that will require large, sustainable, adequately manned, blue-water ships</u>. Inshore concepts like the Littoral Combat Ship are a waste of money for that kind of war. We need to push up CV-21, build DD(X)S in respectable numbers, and launch a lot more nuclear-powered submarines. <u>Some projections show our submarine fleet shrinking</u> to 30 ships, about one-third of what is needed. We have been here before. The parallels between the United States and Japan in 1931 and the United States and China today are chilling. Now, as then, professional naval officers on both sides know their nations' interests will clash<u>. As in 1931, one nation is building a navy adequate to the task while the other has its head in the sand. It is difficult to play shipbuilding catch-up after a war starts</u>. The United States went on a binge just before hostilities with Japan commenced, but fought the first two years of the war with the seven fleet carriers built in the 1920s and 1930s plus the USS Essex (CV-9) and the second Yorktown (CV-10). Japan, on the other hand, started the war with a superb navy. Only our ability to read their code and bad decisions by Japanese naval leaders averted disaster. Of course, the Washington Naval Treaty had restricted tonnage, which caused the Navy to design and build the smaller Wasp (CV-7) prior to the Treaty's expiration in 1938. The Hornet (CV-8) subsequently was built to the earlier Yorktown design and commissioned in October 1941, just prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Consider how history might have changed if the U.S. Fleet had been able to build and deploy four or five more Yorktown (CV-5)-class carriers by the start of the war. Japan could have been managed diplomatically or defeated quickly, and more resources devoted to the war in Europe, which might have ended much sooner-possibly averting the Cold War. On the other side of the line, Germany had only 57 U-boats in service including just thirty 500-/750-ton boats. Even with such meager forces, the Kriegsmarine, missed starving Britain into submission by only the narrowest of margins. Germany would have prevailed had it started with a fraction of the 781 U-boats later sunk by the Allies. Going back even farther, imagine how entertaining the Royal Navy would have found America in 1812 had we fielded 15 or 20 44-gun ships instead of three. <u>It isn't too late, but it is close. Building only six ships in Fiscal Year 2006 and dropping below a fleet total of 300 ships is a recipe for disaster. China will not be that parsimonious. If we fail to act, it will overtake us in naval power as early as 2010. A realistic sustained effort today can make all the difference.</u><br />
Naval power key to solve multiple scenarios for conflict <br />
<u>CONWAY</u> ET AL <u>07</u> [James T., General, U.S. Marine Corps, Gary Roughead, Admiral, U.S. Navy, Thad W. Allen, Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, “A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower,” October, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.navy.mil/maritime/MaritimeStrategy.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.navy.mil/maritime/MaritimeStrategy.pdf</a>)] <br />
<br />
We will employ the global reach, persistent presence, and operational flexibility inherent in U.S. seapower to accomplish six key tasks, or strategic imperatives. Where tensions are high or where we wish to demonstrate to our friends and allies our commitment to security and stability, U<u>.S. maritime forces will be characterized by regionally concentrated, forward-deployed task forces with the combat power to limit regional conflict, deter major power war, and should deterrence fail, win our Nation’s wars</u> as part of a joint or combined campaign. In addition, persistent, <u>mission-tailored maritime forces will be globally distributed in order to contribute to homeland defense-in-depth, foster and sustain cooperative relationships with an expanding set of international partners, and prevent or mitigate disruptions and crises.</u> <u>Credible combat power will be continuously postured in the Western Pacific</u> and the Arabian Gulf/Indian Ocean to protect our vital interests, <u>assure our friends and allies of our continuing commitment to regional security, and deter and dissuade potential adversaries and peer competitors</u>. This combat power can be selectively and rapidly repositioned to meet contingencies that may arise elsewhere. These forces will be sized and postured to fulfill the following strategic imperatives: Limit regional conflict with forward deployed, decisive maritime power. Today regional conflict has ramifications far beyond the area of conflict. Humanitarian crises, violence spreading across borders, pandemics, and the interruption of vital resources are all possible when regional crises erupt. While this strategy advocates a wide dispersal of networked maritime forces, we cannot be everywhere, and we cannot act to mitigate all regional conflict. <u>Where conflict threatens the global system and our national interests, maritime forces will be ready to respond alongside other elements of national and multi-national power, to give political leaders a range of options for deterrence, escalation and de-escalation</u>. Maritime forces that are persistently present and combat-ready provide the Nation’s primary forcible entry option in an era of declining access, even as they provide the means for this Nation to respond quickly to other crises. Whether over the horizon or powerfully arrayed in plain sight, <u>maritime forces can deter the ambitions of regional aggressors</u>, assure friends and allies, gain and maintain access, and protect our citizens while working to sustain the global order. Critical to this notion is the maintenance of a powerful fleet—ships, aircraft, <u>Marine forces, and shore-based fleet activities capable of selectively controlling the seas, projecting power ashore, and protecting friendly forces and civilian populations from attack.</u>
