 The Rational World Paradigm, a taught and highly systemized method of human communication and decision-making, needs to be reconsidered before making reforms to human trafficking based visa law. <br />
Fisher, Professor of Communication, University of Southern California<br />
(Walter, “Narration as a Human Communication Paradigm: The Case of Public Moral Argument”, Communication Monographs, Vol 51, 1984)<br />
This paradigm is very familiar, having been in existence since Aristotle's Organon … already been done on public argument are essays by Cox (1981), Goodnight (1980), Hynes, Jr. (1980), Lucaitas (1981), Pryor (1981). Sillars and Ganer (1982). and Zarefsky (1981).<br />
A human communication based on the conception of persons as homo narrans is preferable to the rational worlds paradigm. All meaningful communication is a form of storytelling; human beings experience and understand life as a chain of continuing narratives. <br />
Fisher, Professor of Communication, University of Southern California<br />
(Walter, “Narration as a Human Communication Paradigm: The Case of Public Moral Argument”, Communication Monographs, Vol 51, 1984) <br />
When I wrote &quot;Toward a Logic of Good Reasons&quot; (Fisher, 1978), I was …of social organization and/or concrete alternatives&quot; (p. 9; see also Alter, 1981; Scult, 1983). <br />
Law reform without narrative perpetuates victimization <br />
The law becomes an oppressor that marginalizes victims, forgetting their human rights over legal documentation status when the law was created to provide an umbrella of protection for undocumented victims of crime. The cycle of victimization never ends, and at its most extreme form of re-victimization by law officials, the law protects no one. The narratives of these victims must be heard and better reflected on during the law reform process.<br />

Resolved: the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its human trafficking-based visas.<br />
Advantage One: Modern-Day Slavery<br />
Trafficking occurs among those with temporary legal visas and undocumented immigrants. The problem in connecting the human-trafficking based visas to all those victims who should be eligible is the overemphasis on law enforcement and the prosecution of the traffickers. Shifting toward a “victim-assistance” model through the use of a narrative paradigm can challenge modern-day slavery and stop the suffering of those victims.<br />

To make moral progress, storytelling is a necessary supplement to the logical reasoning of the rational worlds paradigm. Without the inclusion of human narrative, moral progress is hindered.<br />
Huang, Professor of Philosophy, Kutztown University<br />
(Yong, “Rorty, pragmatism, and Confucianism: with responses by Richard Rorty”, SUNY Press, 2009)<br />
In Rorty’s view, to make moral progress, to expand … it relates things that happen to situations to make history (27).<br />

Observation One: Visas for Human Trafficking are short in number and long in restrictions.<br />
<br />
If there is the possibility of deportation for a victim while their U Visa eligibility is pending, then the law becomes an oppressor that marginalizes victims, forgetting their human rights over legal documentation status when the law was created to provide an umbrella of protection for undocumented victims of crime. The cycle of victimization never ends, and at its most extreme form of re-victimization by law officials, the law protects no one.<br />

<br />
PLAN<br />
Resolved, the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of, and substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for, its T and U visas by broadening the definition of “severe forms of trafficking,” removing the “mandatory cooperation requirement,” delinking visa provision from law enforcement targeting “terrorism,” and beginning with a doubling of the caps.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Modern-Day Slavery<br />
<br />
Trafficking occurs among those with temporary legal visas and undocumented immigrants. The problem in connecting the T visas to all those victims who should be eligible is the overemphasis on law enforcement and the prosecution of the traffickers. Shifting toward a “victim-assistance” model by removing the cooperation requirements can challenge modern-day slavery.<br />

Advantage Two: The Wrong War<br />
<br />
We have been fighting the War Against Terrorism through immigration policy for too long. Trying to fight the terrorists has no infringed on the ability of the victims of human trafficking to obtain visas. These eligibility restrictions are not helpful in fighting terrorism and they ignore the plight of the people subjected to human trafficking.<br />

The plan can address the confusion by expanding and re-asserting the broad eligibility of T and U visas, not to mention increasing their numbers. This will overcome the problems of the CLEAR Act.<br />
