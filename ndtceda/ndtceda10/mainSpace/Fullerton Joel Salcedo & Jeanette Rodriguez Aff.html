 <h3 id="toc2"><a name="x--My dad was born in tiajuana mexico on his way toward the US. He entered the US when he was one and got a green card that expired when I was 15. He was able to work but only for a low budget painting company that paid him under the table. My dad knew his residency card was going to expire so he applied for citizenship which was a painstaking process, that took time and money, something that was hard for a man who lives check to check to survive, but he did it and put his life on hold because he knew otherwise he’d risk being deported if he was ever pulled over by a cop. Something he couldn’t let happen because he knew that our future rested in his ability to make a good living. He asked my grandmother for his birth certificate which had to be sent from mexico into the US… he had never seen it before. This piece of paper that was suppose to know his life, claimed that he was born on a different day than we had been celebrating it for the past 15 years before that ….. and what was worse was that the officials who had his life hanging by a string put him down for his past, acting like they knew my father better than he knew himself. When he applied for his papers the officials at the immigration office brought up his file. He had some minor offenses from when he was young that the cops kept bringing him back up. They treated him like a criminal… Since my brothers and I were born he changed his ways and stopped drinking stopped going out , he and my mom divorced and he was a new man with a new wife with a new life. He couldn’t prove he was a good man, he had to rely on the objective exerts to analyze him and determine if he was a good man. His sense of worth and value in the hands of professionals. 1. People like my dad feel intimdated by state officials. The real issue that immigrants face is the colonial legacy that disempowers them during interactions in face-to-face encounters with state agents at the lowest level (cops, border agents, school officials, etc.). The constant fear at the sight of a police officer; hoping the cop doesn’t pull you over and ask for papers you don’t have; hoping you don’t get put in the back of the car in handcuffs because you’re existence is a criminal act. The anxiety of applying for legal residence and the fear of being rejected and denied because of things you did when you were young poor and desperate. Constantly feeling inferior when border patrol agents and lawyers remind you that your future and well being rests in their hands; they are in power, you must obey. Culture, power, and knowledge are all always interlinked. What we are taught in school is determined by power and what power thinks if valuable. Since I was young I never learned about Mexican culture, the history of people in Mexico or the reasons why people like my family migrated to the US.  People in power chose my curriculum, and what I was taught was cowboys and Indians where the domination of natives was divine and necessary. What I was taught was education that privileges a Anglo understanding of how things went down, it was powers ability to influence how knowledge is produced and allowed for the masked Eurocentric cultural understanding of history to be embedded into my elementary school textbooks as if it was neutral and objective, when it was really tied to the cultural knowledge production of the authors who wrote it. You see… [story of my dad being pulled over by a cop and the trauma involved with being seen as a criminal] I am exactly how my dad is, Its hard for me to be passionate and emotional and to feel… He has taught me to be tough. To survive harassment, rejection, being alone and feeling worthless….. its hard for me to convey the severity of my story but believe me, its shaped who I am today. 2. Our purpose is to speak to policy and theoretical issues from personal experience. The process is called auto-ethnography and it seeks to create knowledge from a different cultural perspective. One that doesn’t claim to be objective and neutral. This method can produce knowledge that is emancipatory; knowledge that claims neutrality entrenches oppression; one can not describe culture from an outside perspective as if they are disconnected from the phenomena. I’m going to read a quote now, not because I think it proves anything, but because it has an especially clear way of stating what autoethnography tries to do. Remember, we are ONLY trying to explain what we are TRYING to do, we’re not saying this proves that we do it. It is from Mariolga Reyes Cruz of Universidad de Puerto Rico and Christopher Sonn of Victoria University in Australia: “As Smith (1999) has indicated, this requires researchers and practitioners to examine the motivations and the basic assumptions that inform knowledge production within contexts of intergroup relations. The deconstruction opens the way to transformation as we recognize different ways of knowing and value the lived experiences and voices of the marginalized” (p. 207; Am J Community Psychology, vol. 47, 2011). Obviously, we want to know the topic in a different way. ANY interpretation of the topic is no more than the cultural expression of the person offering the interpretation. We believe the core issue of the topic is whether to expand opportunities for immigrants, we believe that we should, and we think the best way to do so is using the method of deconstruction."></a>My dad was born in tiajuana mexico on his way toward the US.

<span style="line-height: 200%;">The land of freedom</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The land of dreamers</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Has now become</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The land of aliens</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The land of slavery</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Our living nightmare</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">“Home”… is a truly magical word, offering a most needed relief from the world of the weird, the unsafe, even the real. Home is where the personal sometimes unexpectedly, sometimes inextricably meets the political. The home question can thus carry us from the confines of our own skin to the open space of a world inhabited by others like and unlike me. The notion of home carries us to a politics of location. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The United States is depicted as a welcoming home, a land of opportunity, where people come by choice to live out the “American Dream” and improve their life. The reality is very different for migrants, The VISA system within the United States was supposed to provide an equal opportunity for all people of the world to immigrate to the United States if they so wish. The reality behind this system is that it is one that is highly privileged and exclusive. The VISA system and immigration law create conditions that exclude the voices of migrants who are not only workers and are greatly exploited, but Anne Shea states that immigration and labor law work together to create a legal space which excludes the voices of guestworkers. Despite a well documented record of workplace abuses by farmworker advocates, no worker has ever registered a complaint with government regulators. Through the exclusion of the farmworkers’ narratives, the law becomes a univocal script written by lawmakers and employers, and serving their interests. Because labor and immigration laws make it difficult and dangerous for farmworkers to register complaints legal recourse against employers becomes merely a myth.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Shea goes on to explain how workers’ bodies are physically coerced through systems of control regulating their movement, in the fields, in the camps, and across borders. The state produces discourses that reduce, instrumentalize, and disassemble workers bodies leaving them in an optimal position for continued exploitation.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The United States is not a Home for many migrants </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We suffer attacks from all sides </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">There is no sense of belonging within this new land</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">There is no security</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Migrants’ lives are filled with the fear of being caught, “rounded up” the risk of deportation at every corner</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Unable to recognize their reflection in the mirror</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The mirror of their portrayal by the media </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The criminality associated with who they are</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">You are illegal always</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">being told there is a right way to do it </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Your existence is a criminal act</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">the day laborer trying to find work is constantly harassed because of the color of his or her skin</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The farmworker who’s disposability allows for their discrimination, humiliation and threats on behalf of their employers </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">This associated criminality makes them feel like they are guilty for living </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">unable to belong in this place they call home</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Families Alienated Separated from society</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Aware of the violence of your home</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Culturally inferior </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">This happens to Jeanette and I </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">the psychic injury we inhabit </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We are anchor babies</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We are not Mexican</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Not American</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We are the hyphen</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Not knowing which of the 2 worlds is a home</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Our homes are divided</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We confront a schizophrenic type of existence where we must selectively choose personalities and ways of being- in worlds….</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The belief in the artificial American Dream creates the distinction between the Good Immigrant and the Bad immigrant. where association with a Mexican ethnicity leads to the continued criminality of this particular migrant body </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Shea states that the absence of migrant voices poses no threat to the hegemonic narrative that casts all “legal” immigrants in a heroic climb from rags to riches, from oppression to liberty. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Law and order is violent and reproduces systemic violence through a naturalization of its narrative. By introducing personal experience we can expose the reality of systemic violence that bears down on the life of migrant workers; a counter hegemonic tactic that denaturalizes the dominant narrative. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">In order to survive and be able to deal with the harsh reality of “home” migrants become multiplicitous subjects, that is, to be</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">a self capable of occupying multiple personalities… of occupying a liminal, third space or of being a border crosser or world traveler . The migrant thus becomes the embodiment of the multiplicitious subject in search of a place to call ”home.” The home question for the multiplicitious subject is one that paradoxically shatters any illusion of there being a definite place of belonging, and at the same time, attempts to shatter the very multiplicity of ourselves by way of a feeling and a questioning- that feeling of wanting to come home and that question of whether there is a home for me- </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Multiplicitous subjectivity is complicated and fraught with moments of what Anzaldua describes as “intimate terrorism” </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">This multiple self with its ambiguities and contradictions can become an agent capable of political critique and social transformation </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Many workers reflect upon their interstitial position in a variety of ways, casting it both positively and negatively. For some, movement back and forth across the border permits them to maintain ties to family and community. Others, such as Algimiro Morales, reflect on the difficulty of living within multiple worlds: “As a migrant, you find yourself living in a different, uncomfortable world. Because of this, you suffer. In the community where you were born and where you own land you’re somebody. . When you leave home, you’re often mistreated. This is difficult, especially if you’re used to being treated with respect. There is so much rejection and hostility”</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">a multiple, socially constructed self constitutes a cohesive whole that is capable of shifting its social identities in different contexts and is capable of using ambiguity and contradiction to form a critical stance capable of being deployed for political activism. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Anne Shea writes about the experiences of Farmworkers in the United States and their want to feel a belonging. There is no sense in which one can fully belong. There are only different senses of belonging depending on which markers of identity are chosen. Full membership and belonging, the safe, the comfortable home so wholeheartedly desired by many, including multiplicitous selves, is indeed an imaginary space in need of demystification. Despite its many possibilities of providing nurture and inclusiveness,</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Home can easily become a space of exclusion and alienation.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Here at home, “Immigration law has been racially discriminatory… citizenship has been defined as white.”</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">when the stereotype of the Mexican illegal alien is used, the effects extend far beyond Mexican and Latino immigrants, and Chicano and Latino citizens, to all people of color within the United States.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Jeanette and I do not find a “home” in the communities we become involved in</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Whether it be our communal homes or the debate community</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We are subjected to </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Otherization</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We are singled out because of our skin </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Our language</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">We have bodily markers that criminalize our existence</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Debate is our home away from home, we migrate back and forth </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Constantly rejected rarely accepted</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Which is why we believe this debate should be about which team embraces the best hometactics to liberate ourselves from the oppressive conditions we find ourselves situated in.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Jeanette and I embrace the tactic of multiplicity and use it as a tool to survive the psychic restlessness we are faced with as we travel between worlds. Much like a migrants culture that nativists view as a threat to American values, our arguments too are seen as threats to the privilege and secured whiteness of the debate community. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Hometactics, as described by Ortega, allows us to go beyond the myth of home and move towards a de-centered praxis of home and belonging, one that gives up the possibility of full belonging and allows for the possibility of being without longing to be on one side or site of belonging.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Home tactics adds a layer which is many times overlooked as we emphasize the grander project of forging a politics of location capable of generating resistance to oppression. That layer is lived experience of selves that are being- in- worlds that find themselves constantly negotiating their multiple identities in light of both ambiguities and contradictions.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Migrants living within the United States use hometactics to resist and work through the oppression they find themselves situated in: </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The migrant who buys a Fake Green card to ensure employment</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The migrants who utilize Safe corners to find employment and not get deported in rule of law cities</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The migrant en route to the United States who hides behind a bush to not be seen by an ICE officer </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The migrant who sells roses or fuit on street dividers and freeway off ramps just to get by</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The Migrant that Digs through trash cans to collect recyclables</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The Migrant who warns other migrants of traffic and license checkpoints </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">The Migrants that attend organized outreach programs centered on education and resistance</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%;">Migrants explain these tactics to contest the narratives of immigration currently permissible within the public sphere. If the dominant narratives of immigration are structured by the tropes of upward mobility and equal opportunity in the absence of racial oppression and exploitation, our experiences tell a different story. Hegemonic migrant narratives posit the country of origin as a site of repression juxtaposed against the United States, represented as a space of personal liberation. Migrant stories of exploitation produce a reality that is denied by the hegemonic narrative that depicts the United States as a place of equality, liberation, and personal freedom.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Counter experiences enter into symbolic struggles over social position, identity and self-determination”</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Outside of legal discourse, worker experiences are a site where we can read not only the terms of reality as written by workers themselves but also how these workers analyze, interpret. and critique the narratives that seek to determine their lives. Gerald Lopez contends that workers</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 12pt;">must have a handle on their superiors. To achieve this “handle</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 12pt;">janitors. secretaries, and farm workers need to determine how their superiors make sense of the workplace where mandated terms and actual practice converge. They must devise and deploy provisional strategies that will enable them (at least to appear) to work within the stories their superiors are living.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 12pt;">These analytical and interpretive skills are missed by academics and professionals who emphasize “what those subordinated by political arid social life don’t know how to do ( 1 67). Experiences demonstrate how labourers interpret, negotiate, and contest concrete forms of power and legal “mechanisms of control” (Higginbotham qtd. in Barton 3). Individual experiences of workers are, to quote Lowe. “not merely representations disconnected from real political life” (Lowe 156). That is these narratives ought not to be pitted against the work of the union in a manner that reduces the experiences to an isolated realm of the personal while locating political agency solely within the union. Rather, personal experiences, as a cultural and political instrument, is the means through which individual subjects produce social meaning.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 12pt;">This is our voice, our space, our argument. In a Home that doesn’t want us. We have carved out a space for us to belong, a space we can call our own. </span>
