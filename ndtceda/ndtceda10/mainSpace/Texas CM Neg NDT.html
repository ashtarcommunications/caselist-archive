<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Part A.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>The “grammar of judgement”</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">George <strong>Pavolich</strong> Uses The Term “Grammar of Judgement” to describe a mode of critique dominating the status quo. It “enables diverse critical styles”—from policy research to postucturalist theory. But this “judgemental grammar” tends towards a three step method” </span><br />
<span class="Underline">George Pavlich <strong>2005</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">(Professor of Sociology University of Alberta Law and critique (2005) 16: 95-112) </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The development of critique is increasingly wedded to an…..prescribe or legislate courses of action. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Part B</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>How Should You Encounter the 1AC</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>The affirmative judge the plan against the criteria established by their advance. Should the negative endorse the status quo or a competing alternative? Their impact calculus gelled around “justifiable criteria” – Specifically, the imperative to _</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>They applied that criteria to status quo visa policy to justify their plan.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>This might seem obvious. After all, <em>What can be wrong with normative judgement against normalizing structures?</em></strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>But Perhaps You Should Ask a Different Question.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Why has critique as judgment swam “within [our] epistemological tides” like a fish in water? Why does Status quo Kritik Debate Formulate Itself As Criteria to Judge a Plan?</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>It is True The Affirmative Recognizes the Need to Use historically “forged criteria are used as historically founded ideals to ground critical judgement.”</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>But the Question of Critical Grammar is Especially Imperative When We Base our “judgements” upon “criteria different from those ‘judges’ whose normalizations” which preserve existing orders” Pavlich writes that “criticism of disciplinary society- even champions of revolution” replicated the “normalizing” judgements of “disciplinary truth regimes.”</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Is this a judgement about judgement? Perhaps, But We Do NOT Offer External Criteria Against Which to Judge the 1ac. We Instead Test the 1ac’s Coherence Discerning an Implicit Double Turn:</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>They deploy normative judgement against judgements of normativity.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Is Judgement the only alternative? Pavlich Writes in 2000 That critique’s etymology opens up to:</strong> </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Judging, but also deciding, crisis…………..oppression from emancipation. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>“Divide the 1AC into Two Piles.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Welcome the 1ac’s imperative to overcome status quo visa policys limitations on Migrant life. Set aside the 1ac impact calculus as justification doe the plan.”</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Migrants surging beyond the limits of the status quo are their own justification- we do not need the larger theoretical constructs they call impacts.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>We might have to make decisions. But we do not have to appeal to external criteria as pavolich writes in 2005 we</strong> </span><br />

<span class="Underline">95-112 </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Stands at the threshold of what is,….and incomplete—mastery. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Voting negative interrupts the assumption that judgement is the natural response. Radicalize 1ac possibilities by leaving aside elements disposing us towards the status quo</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>We Welcome 1AC Potential While discerning its limits</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Hospitality is not a mode of politics- But Instead an “allegorical foothold”</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>For This Debate- An Experience of Uncertain Negotiation Rather than a completed motion of judgment.</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Pavolich asks. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Must we ask the foreigner….different ways to be. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Hospitality—critique—debate these can completely escape their mastery- rhw reixk ia ro swcwlop dlwziblw opwnwaa ro rhw peoxwaa od nwforiRION</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Pavlich</strong> writes in <strong>2005</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">At stake here is not a future….and even enemies. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Part D. The standpoint: Risk Being Undone</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>Judgement Withour criteria encounters the 1ac with a passion of not knowing. Uncertainty will eventually yield to limited knowledge- but begin your encounter with a standpoint of wonder- unlearn the imperative of critique as judgement- welcome 1ac possibility that cannot be assimilated</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Rachel <strong>Jone 2009</strong> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">(“On the value of not knowing: Wonder, Beginning Again and letting Be,” Cambridge 29th, 2009, to accompany the exhibition ‘Material Intelligence,’ Kettle’s Yard, 16 May </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Thus described, wonder is the passion……..to appropriate or assimilate them…….and beginning anew. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Uncertainty hyper charges political commitment by refushing judgement as a shield against ethical…..to rethink what we understand by the term critique.</span><br />
