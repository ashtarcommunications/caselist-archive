<span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The discourse of trafficking is mired in political complexity. Humanitarian approaches become entrenched in the logic of security, engaging in strategies of prevention and profiling of victims. Process diverts the focus away from the structural conditions that result in oppressive and exploitative forms of migration, and locates causality within the victim </span></span><br />

The securitization of migration is a tool for the co-option of the political process and the consolidation of political power. The game of naming and blaming the enemy draws attention away from the structural and social inequalities and seeks only to preserve authority and its control over the discursive space.<br />

Berman has captured an interesting dichotomy………<span class="underline"> the elimination of other individuals</span>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This attempt to protect and secure a population coincides with a violent displacement of so-called “threatening” others to the periphery. The technological processes behind this action simultaneously and consequently ensure discriminatory atrocities, rendered invisible in the name of modernity’s ascent to virtue.<br />

Infused with the logic of security, trafficking discourse mobilizes violent instruments to eradicate the threat of the traffickers. The result is violent interventions targeted the trafficked migrants that leave the trafficking venues intact<br />

<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The plan is appeal to Universality. By leveling the differences within the category of trafficked peoples, the governmental appropriation and subversion of resistance is impossible, and the image of the enemy that is critical to security discourse is delegitimized. </span></span><br />

<span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">Similarly and consequently, the plan is concerned with Equality.

<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The other principle that gives content to politics is equality…… equality and universality have been formulated in this situation. </span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">The combination of these two principles is possible through recognizing the excessive, non-represented figure of the illegal migrant sex worker.

<span class="underline">Rather than thinking human trafficking as a complex security issue…….<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is through work that one can claim rights of residence and citizenship</span> </span><br />

Our argument is not merely a claim towards the acceptability of prostitution or a denunciation of the conservative and Victorian morals that might inform the humanitarian politics of pity. Rather through identifying and recognizing the migrant sex worker along with others in the category of trafficked, the particulars of all can emerge, free from the violent and oppressive articulations of the state. This is the only means by which the abuse and exploitative elements of trafficking can be humanely and ethically addressed<br />
