<strong><u>Schopenhauer</u></strong> --Embrace Extinction<br />
The affirmative’s attempt at changing the world is pointless and ensures that at best our lives are boring and at worst are never ending misery <br />
(Schopenhauer 1851 (Arthur, philosopher and lecturer at the University of Berlin, Essays of Schopenhauer, “The Emptiness of Existence,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/essays/chapter6.html" rel="nofollow">http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/essays/chapter6.html</a>) <br />
The scenes..existence, misery<br />
It’s a gateway issue—it’s their burden to justify that acting is good in the first place—vote neg on presumption until they prove doing the plan causes anything but suffering—There’s only a risk that giving up is better<br />
(Reginster 2008 (Bernard, PhD+ professor @Brown University, 08/08, “Knowledge and Selfishness: Schopenhauer and the Paradox of reflection,” <em>European journal of philosophy</em> I0966-8373, 16 (2) p.251)<br />
We are not…will-lessness<br />
And we have comparative evidence—we are the only animals that inflict pain just for the sake of it. The will to live is the root cause of war, suffering, and all their impacts because humans seek to ease their suffering by torturing others<br />
(Schopenhauer (restranslated in 2004, “On human nature” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/human/complete.html" rel="nofollow">http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/schopenhauer/arthur/human/complete.html</a>) <br />
Gobineau in his work…and charity<br />
Vote negative on the precautionary principle—it is always safer to presume someone will regret being brought into existence because no one suffers when someone is mistakenly not brought into existence<br />

But there are more…the greatest delight<br />
Humans are bred only to suffer meaninglessly. History shows that on average being born is worse than never existing at all. The aff advantages simply reflect the ongoing agony of existence. Giving birth is playing Russian roulette with your child’s future<br />
(Benatar in 2006 (David, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cape Town, Better Never to Have Been, pg 153-155_<br />
Such is the strength…their future offspring<br />
The assertion that “I am glad to be alive” is not equivalent to “It’s better I came into existence”—if you didn’t exisst,there’d be nobody to miss that gladness so the absence of it wouldn’t be bad<br />
(Benatar 97, , “Why is it better never to come into existence” <em>American Philosophical quarterly</em> 34.3 (1997) 345+ General One file)<br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>The simulation of nuclear war as a constant game of survival means we are constantly being obliterated in our hyper-real world over and over again. Security becomes our lives rather than for the protection of our lives. When we engage in the hyperreality created by the system then our reality is being security instead of being ourselves. The world becomes nothing but deterrence and wr and peace become indistinct. The inevitable result of this is endless nihilism and this means violence becomes a necessity in our mind because without violence the system would be unnecessary but the only reality we recognize is the system.</strong></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">This collapses the negative's whole world view—current science disproves cartesian dualism and organic materialism i.e. the idea that there is the world outside our body and then the world inside our mind which is contained in our body. Every-thing is an a-subjective current of consciousness—call for this evidence its warranted and definitive on the issue.</span><br />
