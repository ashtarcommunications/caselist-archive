In <u>Migration, Domestic Work, and Affect</u> by Encarnacion Gutierrez-Rodriguez, pg. 1. <br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Velma and Veronica have worked for years without recognition from their employers or from the citizens of their host countries. Their labor and their subjective contributions to our society have fallen on deaf ears. This is not for a lack of trying – communities of domestic migrant laborers actively assert their agency in the telling of their stories and in their everyday interactions even as normalized tropes of citizenship cause us to discriminate against their political claims on a daily basis.  </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">This refusal to be affected by their testimony is enabled by racialized and feminized colonial hierarchies which devalues domestic labor – it reduces these migrants to automatons who can instill our workplaces and homes with cleanliness and positive energy.  </span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The exploitation of labor has expanded beyond the field of physical output – now even the pulses of life and ability to affect others has been commodified. The inability to be recognized causes a social blind spot where domestic work is equated with the foul bowl of the toilet. This distances us from the value of the labor performed by domestic workers – rendering them invisible and devaluing our ability to make ethical connections with other people  </span></span></strong><br />

<span style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Against this refusal to recognize domestic labor, Derek and I approach the resolution.</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">Each year we encounter a resolution with our peers. It is meant to ground a debate into a set parameter and construct an ideal predictable, researchable set of arguments in order to create a stable debate. Each year debaters grapple with its meaning, never touching the surface of the entirety of the resolution. Most make it submit to our idea of how the story of a debate should be told by objective policy analysts. Against this tradition Derek and I bear witness to the un-speak-ability of the resolution:  </span></strong></span></span><br />
<span style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Resolved:</span></span></strong> <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for one or more of the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, human trafficking-based visas.</span></span></strong> </span><br />
<span style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Against the grain of the perfect set of language games we have been given, we assert the un-speak-ability of the resolution. Our affirmation is a bearing witness to those stories left out by a resolution which extends the differential valuation of migrants in its prescription of what forms of immigration are worth discussing. It is a respect for difference and alterity within the resolution and is a solidarity with the stories unable to be told by the immigrant survivors of exploitation and oppression. The affirmative is an encounter with affect, with the stories of domestic labor on a visceral level, that ties us to the very bodies of labor that have been left behind in the social story of America. </span></span></strong></span><br />

<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">“I know that it is difficult, but you can make changes. You know there are a lot of things to talk about, a lot of things to speak about. The same government tells you that you can’t go further. It forbids you a lot of things. I know that I have a lot of things against me…Here I can say a lot of things, but we need to release this fear. Life is risky, when you are out on the street you can be run over by a car. If we remain silent, we won’t change anything. Five hundred years we have been exploited and we will continue to be exploited, if we don’t speak up. Therefore, it is good that people come to this country; young people come to this country as they know what is going on.” </span></span></strong><br />

<strong>How do we deal with that which denies all description—the loss of a loved one, abuse, war, violence so shocking that it resists representation? How did we deal with the reality of September 11th, 2001? We sat transfixed to a screen, unable to speak. The rape and torture of Abner Louima produces this same result in the lives of privileged American citizens like Derek and I—we sit stunned when the significance of this event collides with the stories we tell ourselves about our way of life every day.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Trauma is the realization that the community to which we belong is founded on a lie…that to provide us with prosperity, our social order will go so far as to rape, torture, and murder. Yet this realization is not inevitable upon hearing Abner’s story: our notions of citizenship have become entangled with whiteness, and it is through our exclusive notion of national identity that we justify the inequality we see everyday.</strong><br />

<strong>The ability to pursue the so-called American Dream is built upon the ongoing exploitation of the 3rd World. Ironically, the conditions that enable this dream are responsible for migration to the United States. Against this influx of immigrants, many of us think of ourselves as victims, and of immigrants as those who would dare to ask to share the wealth. It is the willed dismissal of the narratives of the oppressed that justifies tighter restrictions on border crossing as well as the ongoing exploitation and oppression of the 3rd World for our economic benefit.</strong><br />

<strong>Abner’s testimony calls into question the civility of white privilege. Despite the transformative potential of his abuse, there are forces that structure the intelligibility of his suffering. Through trials his captors were cast as sick, isolated individuals – Justin Volpe was offered up as the sole responsible party. Through legal recourse, his trauma was depicted as something to be cured with a $9 million settlement.</strong><br />

<strong>Against this silencing gesture, Derek and I approach the resolution. Each year we encounter a resolution with our peers. It is meant to ground a debate into a set parameter and construct an ideal predictable, researchable set of arguments in order to create a stable debate. Each year debaters grapple with its meaning, never touching the surface of the entirety of the resolution. Some make it submit to our idea of how the story of a debate should be told by objective policy analysts. Against this tradition Derek and I affirm the trauma of the resolution and speak the betrayal of our very community:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Resolved: the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for one or more of the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, human trafficking-based visas.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Against the idea of a perfect set of language games to affirm the resolution we assert the un-speak-ability of the resolution. Our affirmation is a bearing witness to trauma and the inability to speak the reality of the world—it is a respect for difference and alterity within the resolution and is a solidarity with the stories unable to be told by the immigrant survivors of exploitation and oppression. This is our witnessing of Abner’s torture.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Systems of raced, classed, and gendered oppression inflict objectification on two levels: first, Abner was physically tortured and objectified. Second, his story was excluded from the symbolic realm of meaning and visibility. Systems of intelligibility tied to citizenship prevent people of privilege from seeing his suffering as part of a system of exploitation and from hearing the trauma of his objectification. It is this exclusion from the realm of meaning that prevents the oppressed from asserting their subjectivity by retelling their stories of objectification – this does not mean that Derek and I make the colonizing gesture of adopting their subject position – rather, we remain in our own, but open ourselves to the testimony of the oppressed.</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Derek and I speak from a position of privilege. We must account for our subject positions when creating strategies for confronting oppression – in the pedagogical setting of the classroom, an ethic of witnessing breaks down the mechanisms by which privilege denies the materiality of the suffering of others. We open ourselves up to Abner’s testimony – this openness creates the ethical conditions in which feelings of trauma and shame can be transformed into energy for praxis and responsibility.</strong><br />

The stories we tell ourselves shape our identity—the same is true of our nation. As subjects who fear contingency and flux, we attempt to maintain coherence through an adherence to a static national identity. Against the trauma that calls our social order into question, we seek ways to enframe and control its fragmentary effect: by enframing it, depoliticizing it, or dehumanizing its author altogether.<br />

In the psychoanalytic ...symbolic order.<br />
<br />
<br />
By bearing witness, we seek to constantly interpret the affects of others, even those who were once considered objects incapable of expression through their oppression. Abner’s story reveals the way in which oppression forecloses the subjectivity of its victims—yet by witnessing his testimony, we move beyond his objectification, we do not see his story ending with a static meaning that can be possessed and easily interpreted or accommodated. By conceiving of his testimony as living, we witness his subjectivity in his capacity to speak against the systems of violence that once attempted to silence him.<br />

In &quot;Theses ... unjustifiable.<br />
<br />
<br />
These cultural fantasies reveal the predominance of an exclusive national identity—one constructed on the myth of racial purity. These narratives of purity shape the material conditions of immigrants: citizenship becomes a way of differentiating access to privilege along racial lines. Immigrant bodies become terrifying and are violently subjected to white authority—Abner’s story reveals the way in which racial oppression is literally written upon the other’s body when it fails to meet our cultural ideal.<br />
Our belief in our community and the American Dream is shattered when we strip away its accepted meaning and reveal the violence beneath—to show our community of privilege as constituted through exploitation and intimidation of immigrant communities.<br />
