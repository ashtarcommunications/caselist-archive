<strong><em>&lt;shimizu is mistaken for a prostitute on a bus --- reading of her experience&gt;</em></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>the hail of the stranger riding on a bus interpellated celine shimizu as an inherently sexualized subject this is a scripted scene that many face in their everyday lives the orientalist gaze. the specific intersections of southeast asian gonzo pornography, sex tourism and trafficking law are cites of cultural production that we should carefully and critically address - for screening these videos does not merely depict scenes of victimization nor could they unproblematically be castigated as objectively obscene and of absolutely no productive value.</strong><br />
<strong>celine parrenas shimizu explains in 2010</strong>:<br />
(Screening sexual slavery: southeast asian gonzo porn and US anti-trafficking law)<br />
in popular film such as full metal jacket... and voice their experiences?<br />
<br />
<strong>One asks, <em>Can the subaltern speak?</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It is through this series of representations - and debate is always a series of representations – but as Gayatri Spivak argues, there are multiple ways to (re)present the resolution: either through representation (through plans and policy) or re-presentation (in the realm of art and philosophy)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In this round, we affirm this year’s topic though a (re)presentation of nexus of the Southeast Asian prostitute and the gonzo pornography of sex tourism – Spivak explains these different but integrally related affirmative strategies:</strong><br />

“An important point…subaltern must unfold”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The intersections of sex, pornography and southeast Asian women are captured perhaps best by the projects of two western filmmakers who document their gonzo adventures: Jean Marc Roc and Dennis O’Rourke…</strong><br />
<strong>Shimizu 01</strong> Celine Parreñas, UCSB, “Making Woman Asian: Racialized Sexuality on Screen and Scene,” PhD Dissertation at Stanford <br />
“Roc is different…anonymous and powerless.” <br />
“Roc also moves…she expresses pain.” <br />
“The assertion of … being, and performance” <br />
“Within such a … of her exterior.”<br />
<br />
<strong>investigates the intersection break down victimization expose complexity of trafficking</strong><br />
<strong>As professor Celine Parreñas Shimizu explains in 2010:</strong><br />
(Celine Parreñas Shimizu, University of California at Santa Barbara, Screening Sexual Slavery? Southeast Asian Gonzo Porn and US, Anti-Trafficking Law. Sexualities 2010 13: 161) <br />
“Speaking for Themselves? … their everyday lives.”<br />
<br />
&lt;the second scene is from Dennis O'Rourke's The Good Woman of Bangkok featuring Aoi&gt;<br />

<em><strong>2ac tricks, Add-ons:</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>-- &quot;the question for this debate is can the subaltern speak and will we listen?&quot; is their role of the ballot --- if you don't watch the videos in the 1ac they say you are ignoring the subaltern</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>-- they say they meet framework because they criticize the tvpa/ins --- less clear about this in cx of 1ac</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>-- read 3 cards on framework:</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Our affirmation is not a political endpoint but is an analyses of the intersections of racialized and sexualized processes that found immigration law. The attempts to remove laws and institute neutrality has historically been a mask that drives these processes of discrimination from being noticed. As subaltern scholars we must read these documents of the law against the grain in order to uncover the effects of decision-making processes.</em><br />

<strong>The capitalistic logic of the status quo has already commodified the videos that we play – our shimizu 2001 evidence makes very clear the destructive processes undertaken by o’rourke. Our Shimizu 2010 evidence notes the way that moralizing rhetoric of Christianity and liberalism has attached itself to anti-trafficking law as a way to maintain binaries of behavior and cease upon images of victimization. These movements ensnare themselves to capitalist accumulation that enables the ignoring of social conditions</strong><br />

<strong>They have missed the point of the 1AC our spivak evidence is a refusal of normative politcymaking in favor of analyses of art and philosophy in the context of the social conditions. It is a method to attend to the voices of the subaltern. This is a fundamental sequencing question to their argument – who listens to the subaltern? The voices of the 1AC are th voices of the alternative, they are the voices of the resistance to the domination of the status quo. Voting negative is a form of politics that divorces an understanding of the vast differences of exploitation the seek to address. Voting affirmative is a politics that attends to the similarities of both proposals</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Attending to the voice of the subaltern is a crucial aspect of a strategy to confront capitalist. Listening to the voices from the spaces of coloniality is a crucial starting point to realizing the limits of capitalism and civilization</strong><br />

<br />
Today, a world history or…and imposed by western epistemology<br />
<br />
<strong>The Universiality of their alternative covers over the differences of exploitation and conditions ov violence – the irony of their assessment that we are too abstract lies in the fact that their generic theory fails to connect with everyday struggles and resistance of situations like Asian gonzo pornography. This not only means the alt fails but that it is etnocidal as a form of thinking</strong><br />
