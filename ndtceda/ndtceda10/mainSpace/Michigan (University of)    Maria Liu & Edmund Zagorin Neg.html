Framing micropolitical networks as actants of power is crucial to understand how “political events” become historically constructed through the accumulation of “common sense” about what is and is not possible. These framing questions necessarily precede the evaluation of the 1AC cause-and-effect truth claims which can only be validated within the frames of dominant theories of international relations.<br />

Corporate finance breeds its own crises by creating the conditions of possibility for resistance through the de-territorialization of value and the creation of virtual anonymous networks of information that can be made responsive to collective action. There is no grand event of socialist utopia; “socialist” relations are constantly forming organically in peer-to-peer file-sharing communities that pirate corporate profits to create new commons and de-centralized virtual social networks of hacktivists capable of collective action on a vast scale. The plan is a rescue operations for the organizational form of corporate elites that you should refuse in order to affirm the crises of the corporate financial system to become spaces for dissent against the valuation of capital over our everyday lives. We must re-write the code of the global nervous system to be more pluralistically responsive to the value of the living in order to avoid extinction<br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt;">And, if it’s a question of tying our advocacy to reality it is the 1AC that is playing fantasy games – the illusion of market efficiency presupposes corporate entities as homogenous organic units acting in their own self-interests – in fact contemporary corporate entities are controlled by an elite who manufactures fictitious capital to justify cannabalizing as much of the material basis for their organization’s wealth as possible before their golden parachutes kick in – we’re on the side of truth</span><br />

 State secrecy means we cannot know the extent to the horrors of mass surveillance in advance – historical analysis demonstrate that surveillance profiles expose minority groups to the possibility of statist mass violence at the level of entire populations—today that regime has been mobilized at a global level creating demographic risk profiles and data-doubles to manufacture consent for mass violence – we must resist the surveillance regime at every turn<br />

 Mass surveillance risk profiling has reached unprecedented proportions – creating a literal global gulag of secret prisons that states maintain in repressive regimes to outsource the targets of selection – only by framing the impact of surveillance around the historical instances of its abuse can we imagine the monstrous capacity of the current system<br />

<strong>A third difference between expansion and downturn concerns the response of physical capital per worker. During a downturn investments do not respond as quickly to immigration as in expansion. This time the difference in response is close to being statistically significant within the two- and the four-year intervals. Since the economy has unused capacity during downturns, this may make firms reluctant to expand their productive capacity and/or to adopt the technologies (and pay the fixed cost) that would best take advantage of immigrant labor. However in the long run (seven- to ten-year intervals) no difference in adjustment is observed independently of the short-run effects.</strong><br />

 A. Interpretation –<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Beneficiaries are people who become qualified to apply for visas<br />

fundraising (Ilona, U.S. Immigration made easy, p. 560)<br />
Beneficiary. If your relative or ….to apply for a green card or visa.<br />
<br />
Eligibility refers to being approved for a visa petition – it is a separate process from<br />
admissibility<br />

Even if it made no sense to limit …..the scope of the Amendment. n20<br />
<br />
This means eligibility refers to the qualification of various categories of visas – not general<br />
admissions standards that apply to all foreign nationals, regardless of the visa they’re applying<br />

<br />
B. Violation<br />
<br />
The plan expands an admissibility standard, not an eligibility standard.<br />
<br />
C. Voting issue –<br />
<br />
1. limits – their interpretation devastates the topic – there are more than a dozen visa categories each with their<br />
own set of eligibility criteria now. The aff ADDS 8 broad categories of additional admissibility standards, each<br />
with its own subcategories, it makes being negative impossible.<br />
<br />
2. negative ground – there are few generics against eligibility standards in general other than politics, it avoids<br />
the core literature controversies surrounding visas, so you should prefer and extremely narrow interpretation<br />
of it.<br />
<br />
Immigration scholars are massively aff biased<br />

<br />
Topical affirmatives must expand eligibility to people who currently can’t apply for certain<br />
visas – it cannot affect requirements used to determine whether INS admits people<br />
after they have applied for visas. Aff’s that work to increase admissions are not topical<br />

Visas don’t guarantee entry – that requires a separate admissibility decision for everyone who<br />
already has a visa<br />

 <strong>Visas represent a disciplinary regime of autoconfession where migrants are asked to present their lives for bureaucratic inspection in order to be have their existence validated as worthy of mobility, sufficiently docile to enough to enter the United States as another drone in the swarm.
