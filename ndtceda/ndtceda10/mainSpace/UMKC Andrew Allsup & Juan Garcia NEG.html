The foundational violent expulsion and genocide of these indigenous peoples taints everything that happens throughout the territory known to us now as the United States.<br />

Antagonism in socio-political life is inevitable – in the context of immigration the move for inclusion by expanding the conditions under which people can become legal residents of the United States demands the production of an exterior opposite in the illegal immigrant or the foreign national against which violence becomes limitless. The solution is not in the elimination of exclusion through inclusion but in recognizing the fundamental exclusion at the heart of subjectivity. Your ethical role as the judge is to resituate antagonism such that we can retain the structure of the political but locate antagonism not from a position of an interior directed at a threatening outside but from an exterior position directed at ourselves.<br />

The modern conception of ethics presumes the existence of a universal human subject that understands the suffering of the world in terms of human rights and humanitarian intervention. This form of ethics seeks to define evil as injury and prohibition and the good as the avoidance of these negative impacts. Aligning yourself with this ethic requires the creation of the victim as biological existence that must be protected – the logic that allows the wholesale slaughter of population on the basis that they are less than human – in relation to the West as benefactor. This form of ethics is caught in stasis as a result as it necessitates these evils to exist in order for the good to exist. We must reconceputalize ethics around a different subject, that of the immortal being that exists outside of experience that must be defended. This is the only form of ethic that allows for anything to change in the status quo.<br />

The affirmatives approach towards immigration only reinforces the very systems of oppression that they reject. The notions of equality need to be upheld as an axiomatic principle that cannot be researched or justified but simply acted upon. This necessitates disengagement with traditional politics which merely seeks to mediate conflict of interest within the framework of capital. This practice exists to hide the fact that all of these problems are created against the backdrop of the erasure of the figure of the worker. We must begin to do away with the very lexicon of immigration and move towards a universalized mass movement to completely restructure the situation as that is the only truly political ethical act. Simple criticism of policies in the status quo or pragmatic inclusions within the situation only result in an ethical nihilism which is the root of the aff’s impacts.<br />

Citizenship is not a neutral right but a normative category of inclusion and exclusion based upon historical contingencies that shape the fabric of politics. Globalization has disturbed the traditional model of rights and national citizenry in favor of a global community of economic subjects that are moved around based upon their economic status. Only a re-conceptualized notion of what is means to be a member within a community can have the ability to move us away from this form of economic domination.<br />

Structural violence outweighs subjective violence- event based impacts are only valued because they are compared to a ‘normally’ functioning system. Structural violence proves that normalcy doesn’t exist.<br />

Arguments in support of globalization’s ability to end poverty and environmental destruction are wrong. The wealth of the North was created through the impoverishment of the South. Economic models ignore the cultural devastation brought about by neoliberalism. Instead, they blame environmental destuction on poverty and prescribe more growth, this effectively the same as prescribing the disease as the cure.<br />

We must reformulate the concept of producer and consumer within our capitalist society to posit the universalist struggles of social justice and equality as the center of democracy. Only by placing social antagonisms as the center for political action can we create a truly progressive notion of citizenship that seeks to do what is right for the Other as opposed to simply filling our needs according to market demands.<br />

The reliance on the informal economy is a band-aid solution to the neoliberal financial system – it relies on the same system of speculation and investment into sectors of the economy such as food and clean tech. This will simply repeat the same problems we had in 2008 while affecting more people at a global scale.<br />
