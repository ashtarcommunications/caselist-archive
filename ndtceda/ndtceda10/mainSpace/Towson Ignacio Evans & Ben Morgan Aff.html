<strong>this year’s topic of immgration call for us to quesrionhow can we,as a nation, accept ppl into this country by way reforming visa policy and citizenship</strong><br />
Jonathan <strong>Weinberg</strong>, Michigan Law Review, 20<strong>09</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>But the problem is that to be a citizen in the US is to be white and the maintence of this county , which is American Democracy, is what make racial oppression possible</strong> says Joel <strong>Olson</strong> in <strong>04</strong>- [olson- The Aboltion of white democracy- introduction ]<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">White supremacy has organized the world in terms of social, political, economic, and cultural realities of white and non-white bodies based on conceptions of hierarchized “human” difference ending in extermination</span></strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">Hence the plan:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 18pt;">The debate community should preformatively confront the political situtationess of the black body.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">W/ that being said the Framework for this debate is who best preformatively disrupts white citizenship enroot to the liberation of the oppressed as it pertain to the debate community and/or the resolution.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And <strong><span style="font-family: Syntax-Black; font-size: 12pt;">Joel Olson places our plan in a historically conscience social geo-political context that is central to grappling with immagrantion, race and democracy </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">SHANARA</span> <span style="font-size: 11.5pt;">REID-BRINKLEY depicts for us how</span></strong> Being forced to live as “amendments to legal and social realities of the white citizen whitens the <strong>preformatively colored body in white institutions like the debate community when she writes:</strong><br />

<strong>At this point we are in a civil war.The Debate community and the US. We must decide weather we are fighting to secure white privilege for marked global white cititzens or do we fight for a society absent of whiteness? Frank Wilderson choose for Towson’s Biggie when he write</strong><br />

The resolution creates a construction of the immigrant that can only revive the traditional notion of the successful assimilated immigrant versus the failure of Black people to assimilate. This narrative is deployed against Black people in such a way that it constructing debates that enforce the notions of Black criminality and cultural failure as the empirical truth. This anti-Black notion becomes trapped in current immigration policy, a trap we refuse to fall into <br />

L.J. 6-lexis</span><br />
<br />
<br />
This deletions of Black identity and call for assimilation represented by the resolution is mirrored in the debate community when Black and Brown debaters are performativley whitened<br />
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">THE DSRB</span></strong> 20<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">08</span></strong> [Dr. Shanara <strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Reid-Brinkley</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, &quot;THE HARSH REALITIES OF “ACTING BLACK”: HOW AFRICAN-AMERICAN POLICY DEBATERS NEGOTIATE REPRESENTATION THROUGH RACIAL PERFORMANCE AND STYLE&quot;page 68-9]</span><br />

<br />
Now - what connects the ignored history of American Black people in the immigrant discussion and the ‘whiting’ of Black debater is the fact that these two acts shows how Eurocentric History kills Black people with every interaction. Therefore the only conclusions that can be reached is that:<br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Controlling another people’s history leads to Genocide, class warfare, suicide and self hatred.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<br />
Thus-Ben and I affirm the performance of the 1ac as a <em>genealogical</em> integration of whiteness and Eurocentric History within the resolution and the debate community.<br />
This debate should be about who best rupture the white meta narrative of history. <br />
<br />
<br />
The 1 ac is a genealogical action that ruptures the violence of the white meta narrative of history<br />

<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />
We must redefine the world- any residue risks the reconstitution of white hegemony. <br />

<br />
<br />
Finally, Everything is performative, but not all performances are equal. The 1AC is a manifestation of us leveraging Black vernacular tradition to present he black body as a protest against oppressive structures. This performance disidentification provides the foundation for social and political empowerment<br />
