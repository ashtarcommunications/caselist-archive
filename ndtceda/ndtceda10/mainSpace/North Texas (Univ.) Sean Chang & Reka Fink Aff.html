<strong><u>Contention One</u>: Inherency</strong><br />
<strong>The US is losing its competitive edge – baby boom retirement and a failing education system will put the US behind many global competitors</strong><br />
<strong><u>Kirkegaard, 2008</u></strong> (Jacob, Peterson Institute for International Economics, “US High-Skilled Immigration Policy: A Self-Inflicted Wound”, PIIE, July 1st, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=972" rel="nofollow">http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=972</a>)<br />
<u>America rose to global economic prominence</u>...<u>shortages in the US economy over the next decade.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>And, Home countries as well as other rising powers are challenging the US – Current restrictions on H-1B visas are preventing highly skilled workers and graduates from coming to the US</strong><br />
<strong><u>Gower, 2010</u></strong> (Jeffrey, Asst. Adjunct Instructor at the State University of New York at Buffalo, “As Dumb As We Wanna Be: U.S. H1-B Visa Policy and the &quot;Brain Blocking&quot; of Asian High-Tech Professionals”, Selected Works of Jeffrey L Gower, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://works.bepress.com/jeffrey_gower/1/" rel="nofollow">http://works.bepress.com/jeffrey_gower/1/</a>)<br />
However, profit is often one way for protectionists...U.S. universities were awarded to foreign students.81<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Contention Two:</u> Competitiveness</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The H-1B visa cap kills competitiveness – it makes it impossible for graduates to get a job and remain in the US and disincentivizes further enrollment in US universities – we lose highly skilled workers and future innovation which is key</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cromwell, 2009</u></strong> (Courtney, B.A., Johns Hopkins University, 2003; J.D. candidate, Brooklyn Law School, 2010; “Friend or Foe of the U.S. Labor Market: Why Congress should Raise or Eliminate the H-1B Visa Cap”, Brooklyn Journal of Corporate, Financial &amp; Commercial Law, Spring, Lexis)<br />
<br />
In addition to the high demand for workers, proponents... <u>admission of foreign workers with new ideas</u>. <a name="r189"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2090/us/lnacademic/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1281075527521&amp;returnToKey=20_T9882961872&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.469474.8612023316#n189" rel="nofollow">n189</a><br />

<br />
<strong>Attracting the best students globally is critical to maintain competitiveness – we must reform restrictive visa policies</strong><br />

Intellectual innovation will become… difficult to obtain a visa to study here.<br />
<br />
<strong>Labor force will collapse inevitably – we don’t have to win there will be a workforce shortage just a skill shortage – the skill shortage makes it impossible to compete globally, widens the income gap and collapses leadership – only reforming Skilled Visa policy solves</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Studies Flow Aff – economists agree that foreign workers drive innovation and increase productivity due to complementary roles</strong><br />

<strong>No Jobs DA - The labor market is not fixed – foreign workers use resources and create new companies – both increase jobs</strong><br />

<u>Another key premise of immigration critics is only a fixed number of jobs exist</u> ...<u>from hiring high skilled foreign nationals</u>?<br />

<strong>Competitiveness is key to leadership</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Much of the foreign policy discussion… economic competitiveness and energy dependence.</span><br />
<strong>And, Competitiveness is key to benign leadership – Solves your impact turns</strong><br />
Richard <strong><u>Armitage</u></strong> (Former Deputy Secretary of State) <strong><u>and</u></strong> Joseph <strong><u>Nye</u></strong> (Professor of Political Science at Harvard) December 12 <strong><u>2007</u></strong> “Why So Angry, America?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IL12Df01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IL12Df01.html</a><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The world is dissatisfied… because of this integrated approach.</span><br />
<strong>US leadership solves all other impacts – collapse of primacy results in nuclear war</strong><br />

A remarkable fact about international politics today-… humanity's only practical hope of solving the world's ills<br />
<strong>Labor force will collapse inevitably – we don’t have to win there will be a workforce shortage just a skill shortage – the skill shortage makes it impossible to compete globally, widens the income gap and collapses leadership – only reforming Skilled Visa policy solves</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Figure 1.1 conveys at least two important… global skills-based economy.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Contention Three:</u> Science Diplomacy</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>H-1B visas are critical to foster scientific exchanges which promotes overall science diplomacy</strong><br />
<strong><u>Lord and Turekian, 2009</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Kristin, Vice president and director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, Vaughan, chief international officer for American Association for the Advancement of Science, “The Science of Diplomacy”, Brookings, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2009/05_diplomacy_lord.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2009/05_diplomacy_lord.aspx</a>)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As he recommits resources… warning of impending natural disasters.</span><br />
<strong>And, Now is the key time - More H1-B visas are critical to science diplomacy</strong><br />
<strong><u>Pickering and Agre, 2010</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Thomas, Undersecretary of State from 1997-2000 and Chair of the advisory council of the Civilian Research and Development Foundation; Peter, Nobel Laureate Physician and director of the Malaria Research Institute at John’s Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; “More opportunities needed for U.S. researchers to work with foreign counterparts”, Baltimore Sun, February 9th, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-02-09/news/bal-op.northkorea0209_1_science-and-technology-north-korea-scientists-and-engineers" rel="nofollow">http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-02-09/news/bal-op.northkorea0209_1_science-and-technology-north-korea-scientists-and-engineers</a>)</span><br />
In 1979, a science…<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> solutions that draw on science and technology.</span><br />
<strong>Visa applications are critical to bolster science diplomacy – perceptions of a crackdown on immigrants crushes US scientific cooperation</strong><br />
<strong><u>Ward et al. 2004</u></strong><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (David, American Council on Education President, Nils Hasselmo, President of the Association of American Universities, Alan Leshner, CEO American Association for the Advancement of Science, Bruce Alberts, President National Academy of Sciences, Peter Magrath, President National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, Wm.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">We strongly support the… international exchange and cooperation.</span><br />
<strong>Strong science diplomacy is the vital internal link to every impact- strengthening global relationships, preventing WMD proliferation, and winning the war on terror. It’s also vital to new technological advances that can prevent environmental and agricultural.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Fedoroff 8</u></strong> [Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State and the Administrator of USAID (Nina, Testimony Before the House Science Subcommittee on Research and Science Education, 4/2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.state.gov/g/oes/rls/rm/102996.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/g/oes/rls/rm/102996.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Science by its nature facilitates… partnerships, and create sustainability.<br />
<strong>Plan: The United States Federal Government should remove the cap on H-1B visas.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Contention Four:</u> Solvency</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Market forces provide the best check on H-1B visas – it would allow companies to fill uniquely skilled positions while maintaining a competitive US job market</strong><br />
<strong><u>Masters and Ruthizer, 2000</u></strong> (Suzette, attorney and former project fellow at the Open Society Institute in New York, Ted, partner and the head of the Immigration Law Group at the New York law firm of Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn &amp; Berman, LLP, “The H-1B Straitjacket: Why Congress Should Repeal the Cap on Foreign-Born Highly Skilled Workers”, CATO Institute, Trade Briefing Paper No. 7, March 3rd, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbp/tbp-007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbp/tbp-007.pdf</a>)<br />
<strong>Let the Market Decide H-1B Supply…</strong> <strong>determine the need for H-1B professionals.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The plan solves best – removing the cap allows graduates and foreign workers to remain in the US on a path to permanent residency while not displacing American jobs – the alternatives to the cap work better – empirically proven</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cromwell, 2009</u></strong> (Courtney, B.A., Johns Hopkins University, 2003; J.D. candidate, Brooklyn Law School, 2010; “Friend or Foe of the U.S. Labor Market: Why Congress should Raise or Eliminate the H-1B Visa Cap”, Brooklyn Journal of Corporate, Financial &amp; Commercial Law, Spring, Lexis)<br />
Since the H-1B program was… companies from moving offshore.<br />
<strong>Now is the key time – H-1B restrictions need to end so the US can maintain a base of highly skilled workers and the ability to compete globally</strong><br />
<strong><u>Kirkegaard, 2008</u></strong> (Jacob, Peterson Institute for International Economics, “US High-Skilled Immigration Policy: A Self-Inflicted Wound”, PIIE, July 1st, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=972" rel="nofollow">http://www.iie.com/publications/papers/paper.cfm?ResearchID=972</a>)<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">US</span> policymakers can only… thrive in the global marketplace.<br />
<br />
<strong>Err aff – neg studies are too narrowly focused – H-1Bs spill over to broader economic growth</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>The most qualified studies flow aff – models show that H-1B workers have no effect on native wages and they even spur job growth and they are usually paid the same if not more than native born professionals</strong><br />
