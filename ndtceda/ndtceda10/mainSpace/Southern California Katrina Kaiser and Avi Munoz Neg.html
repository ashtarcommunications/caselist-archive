<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">4 Conclusions: `I [we] need to wake-up' </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">The project of global climate crisis management</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">as outlined by Gore, <u><span style="background: aqua;">marks</span> one of the greatest <span style="background: aqua;">efforts to expand</span></u>, as Michel De Certeau claims, __&lt;span style=&quot;background: aqua;&quot;&gt;the empire of the evident in functionalist technocracy'' &lt;/span&gt;(__1988, page 203). Indeed, as this overview of the struggle for capitalism, democracy, and ecology in the 21st century has sought to demonstrate, Al Gore's __telling of `inconvenient truths' is being done in a manner that aspires &lt;span style=&quot;background: aqua;&quot;&gt;to **exert greater control over**&lt;/span&gt; **most &lt;span style=&quot;background: aqua;&quot;&gt;planetary places, processes, and practices in the state of emergency &lt;/span&gt;**threatened by worldwide climate changes. **More draconian complexities**__, however, also could **__await__** those who follow Gore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 6pt;&quot;&gt;Since only 1% of all cars and trucks registered in the USA are hybrids, only 5% of current light bulb sales are compact fluorescents, and only 2.3% of electricity generation comes from renewable sources of energy, voluntary changes motivated by ethical consumption thus far have not been, and in the future probably will not be, sufficient. The institutional problems of responding efficaciously to climate change, then, are immense. To cite one example, Joseph Romm, head of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the US Department of Energy under President Clinton, argues that global warming will change American life forever and end politics as we know it'' in our lifetimes (2007, page 230). That is a rather big bite to swallow in suburbia, and few will want to have their helping of it. In his view, it is now imperative that the nation and the world embrace an aggressive multidecade, government-led effort to use existing and near-term clean- energy technologies'' (Romm, 2007, page 230). This program would entail planning out a fifty-year-long energy-generation and energy-conservation campaign, which stresses radical action immediately. During the mobilization, the USA and other major industrial countries must act so that: 1. We replicate, nationally and globally, California's performance-based efficiency program and codes for homes and commercial buildings. From 1976 to 2005, electricity consumption per capita stayed flat in California, while it grew 60 percent in the rest of the nation. 2. We greatly increase the efficiency of industry and power generation and more than double the use of cogeneration (combined heat and power). The energy now lost as waste heat from U.S. power generation exceeds the energy used by Japan for all purposes. 3. We build 1 million large wind turbines (fifty times the current capacity) or the equivalent in other renewables, such as solar power. 4. We capture the carbon dioxide associated with 800 proposed large coal plants (four-fifths of all coal plants in the year 2000) and permanently store that CO2 underground. This is a flow of CO2 into the ground equal to the current flow of oil out of the ground. 5. We build 700 large nuclear power plants (double the current capacity) whilemaintaining the use of all existing nuclear plants. 6. As the number of cars and light trucks on the road more than triples to 2 billion, we increase their average fuel economy to 60 miles per gallon (triple the current U.S. average) with no increase in miles traveled per car. 7. We give these 2 billion cars advanced hybrid vehicle technology, so that they are capable of running on electricity for short distances before they revert to running on biofuels. We take one-twelfth of the world's cropland and use it to grow high- yield energy crops for biofuels. We build another half-million large wind turbines dedicated to providing the electricity for these advanced hybrids. 8. We stop all tropical deforestation, while doubling the rate of new tree planting'' (Romm, 2007, pages 22 ^ 23). Such foundational changes are not impossible, particularly if the world is truly facing the greatest emergency in human history, but they now surely seem improbable. Stratagems numbers (3) and (7) versus number (5), for example, have often been seen, at least in the USA, as politically antithetical, because windmills and nuclear plants have had different political supporters. It is not clear that stratagem number (1) is the best standard in the USA, much less the world, since standards other than those from California might be superior. Stratagem number (6) for cars and trucks is business as usual in current, sprawl-driven urbanization patterns; and, stratagem numbers (1) and (2) have been routinely dismissed for decades as cost ineffective in the USA and elsewhere, because many business groups oppose serious conservation. Finally, no one knows what will happen if stratagem number (4) is implemented, since this project must capture and sequester in gas and/or liquid forms massive quantities of CO2, or about 82 million barrels per day in 2004. This will require a massive new infrastructure, as elaborate and expensive as today's oil industry, to implement successfully, but without the same widely distributed demand for the product being processed as one finds for gasoline. Even so, Romm's truly radical plan also might be too little, too late. It openly aims at keeping global CO2 emissions higher than 2005 levels at 400 ppm, or the figures predicted for 2010, while anticipating they could very well increase to about 550 ppm. If the plan worked perfectly, global warming will continue steadily, and the Earth's overall degradation will become more evident to everyone. Therefore, while this vast economic and engineering effort unfolds, it also could very easily lose political support. Temperatures would rise 1 8C (1.88F) by 2015, they could rise another 1.5 8C (or 2.78F) by 2100, and much of Greenland's ice sheet would melt, increasing sea levels maybe by 20 ft (Romm, 2007, pages 22 ^ 24). At the same time, as Gore (2006a; 2006b) would affirm, even greater disasters could be avoided, and CO2 levels eventually might be brought back to 1990 levels of 356 ppm (Kolbert, 2006, page 202) early in the 22nd century with these interventions. However, <u>this r<span style="background: aqua;">eindustrialization</span> campaign <strong>would <span style="background: aqua;">require a sustained systemic policing of world </span></strong></u>greenhouse <strong><u><span style="background: aqua;">gassing, energy conservation, and land use </span></u></strong>for almost ninety years, three human generations, or more than twice as long as the Cold War, to name a recent global struggle on a lesser scale. As the GROCC consortium of transnational capital, environmental NGOs, and academic mandarins are anticipating, <u>Romm's plan is just one representative blueprint for administering <strong>sustainable degradation</strong></u>: <strong><u>it just needs a good solid business model</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Who will build more efficient power plants, manufacture hybrid vehicles, construct more nuclear generating capacity, sequester captured, stored, and piped CO2, stop deforestation, and build wind turbines? It is no surprise that ninety major global firms want to, as the CEO of Alcoa asserts, all grow and prosper in a greenhouse gas-constrained world.'' Romm's design requires only a more comprehensive consensus among business and government leaders about selling the goods and services needed by a world where CO2 concentrations increase, temperatures rise dramatically, much of the world's existing ice fields melt, sea levels rise at least 20 ft, thousands of square miles of settled ground is flooded, and this chaos goes on for decades, if not centuries. Whether it is called `ethical consumption', `corporate social purpose', `green steward- ship', or `cradle-to-cradle design', this is the reality of `sustainable degradation', namely, how to profit from ecological crisis. Like Romm, Gore and his Alliance for Climate Protection are hoping to develop, with the GROCC, as Alcoa's Belda states, a global plan of action on climate change in ways that create more economic opportunities than risks'' or the type of plan ``needed to extend the climate change issue from one of talk to one of action''. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">More <u><span style="background: aqua;">critical analyses</span>, such as this one, <strong>must <span style="background: aqua;">question the reduction of an entire planet to</span></strong></u> these <strong><u><span style="background: aqua;">national or</span></u></strong>, perhaps even, <strong><u><span style="background: aqua;">transnational policeable spaces</span></u></strong>. Oddly enough, many of <u>those who accept such efforts at global policing</u> pushed by authorities like Gore and the IPCC <u>are the same people</u> as those <u>who reject outright other efforts at global policing by figures like</u> President <u>Bush</u> (43) <u>or</u> Robert <u>Kagan</u>. <strong><u><span style="background: aqua;">There is </span>far <span style="background: aqua;">too much presumption of a power and knowledge not yet attained</span></u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">implied by Gore's na|« ve belief in `an Earth in Balance', reprocessed GIS images, and ecological moralizing PowerPoints as An Inconvenient Truth implies.

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Here, Shellenberger and Nordhaus (2004) perhaps start out on the right track. They observe that established </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">environmental movements <strong>rarely question “the most basic assumptions</strong>” about what does and does not get counted as “environmental</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">,” because these groups inherently define environmental problems “so narrowly” that almost all proposed solutions turn out to “be technical” </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(pp. 8-9). Yet, even as they pillory environmentalism for embracing technified tactics and/or accepting statist regulation, Shellenberger and Nordhaus take a major misstep. That is, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">they claim the only <strong>real escape</strong> from global warming</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">for example, as a severe “ecological surprise” (King, 1995) </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">is to follow </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">now the organizational lead blazed by “the successes” of right-wing political activists since the 1970s. This recommendation, in turn, entails riding </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">a new “third wave of environmentalism” that “will be framed around investment” in new public-private partnerships</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> “</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">like those America made in the railroads, the highways, the electronic industry, and the Internet” (Shellenberger &amp; Nordhaus, 2004, p. 28). </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Even though one can sympathize with their disappointments over the conventional ecomanagerialism </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">favored by the National Environmental Protection Acts since the 1970s, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">any clearheaded environmentalist must question solutions for global warming based on the putative models of America’s </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">railroads, interstate highway system, or electronics industry, using so-called </span><strong><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">public-private investments</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On one level, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">these big technological systems are <span style="background: aqua;">the <strong>embedded infrastructures that spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere</strong>, so they hardly provide ideal models for curbing global climate change</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On another level, Shellenberger and Nordhaus do not have a clear sense of how deeply </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">private interests burrow into larger public projects in the economy and environment </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Fischer, 1990) </span><strong><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">to pursue special agendas that derail the common good </span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">to seize personal benefits</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Admittedly, the railroads, the interstates, and electronic life both on and off the Net did change America. Nonetheless, it is unclear that such changes were positive, because these ambiguous transformations often served other narrower interests, like those of railroad tycoons, General Motors, Microsoft, or General Electric. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This miscomprehension can be connected to the stark distortions built into the “<strong>ecosubpolitical</strong>” realms of contemporary capital and its collective infrastructures </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Luke, 2005, pp. 202-206). </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It is in this realm that private interests and/or technical accreditation are pitted against truly collective public concerns.</span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As clusters of many different technologies, points of capital investment, and sites for reshaping the materiality of much industrial ecology within nature’s biophysical systems</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as Hoffman (2003) maintains, </span><strong><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">markets provide no real secure guarantees for better environmental outcomes</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Thus, Shellenberger and Nordhaus’s lament over </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the “death of environmentalism” cannot just pick markets over states, because this</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> simplistic decision <strong><span style="background: aqua;">fails </span></strong><span style="background: aqua;">to deal “not just with material considerations of the physical sciences but also with considerations of what motivates individual and organizational action found within the social sciences</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (Hoffman, 2003, p. 77). </span></span></span><br />

The biblical injunction that gave command of the living world to Adam and Noah was above all an expression of a <em>social</em> dispensation. Its idea of dominating nature – so essential to the view of the nonhuman world as an object of domination – can be overcome only through the creation of a society without those class and hierarchical structures that make for rule and obedience in private as well as public life, and the objectifications of reality as mere materials for exploitation. That this revolutionary dispensation would involve changes in attitudes and values should go without saying. But <u><span style="background: aqua;">new ecological attitudes and values will remain <strong>vaporous</strong> if they are not given substance </span>and solidity through real and objective institutions (the structures by which humans concretely interact with each other) and <span style="background: aqua;">through the tangible realities of everyday life </span>from childrearing to work and play. <span style="background: aqua;">Until human beings cease to live in societies that are structured around hierarchies as well as economic classes, <strong>we shall never</strong> be free of domination</span>, <strong>however much we try to dispel it</strong> with rituals, incantations, ecotheologies, and the adoption of seemingly &quot;natural&quot; lifeways.</u> </span></span><br />

<u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">The idea of mobility is,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"> as we have seen, <span style="background: aqua;">usually associated with the movement of capital more than of people</span>. In the Americas, some <span style="background: aqua;">twenty bilateral agreements have been signed since 1990</span></span></u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">that serve to liberalize trade and investment between South, Central, and North American countries. Here </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">the emphasis </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">is primarily <span style="background: aqua;">on the subordination of migration management to the needs of capital</span></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 6pt;">. In Europe, the significance of arrangements facilitating the mobility of capital within the region (primarily the completion of the [*82] Single Market and the flexibilization of labor markets) has overshadowed the number of initiatives which European capital developed in peripheral economies. Nevertheless, in the framework of increasing cooperation and economic aid, the European Union has signed a series of accession and association agreements with countries of central and eastern Europe, with the Mediterranean countries, and with the remaining states of the former Soviet Union. These agreements all have in common a number of regulations with respect to the freedom of movement of people insofar as this movement is connected to capital mobility. Freedom of establishment, freedom to migrate to set up businesses as self-employed individuals, and nondiscrimination (national treatment) of legally established firms, workers, and their families (cf. Niessen and Mochel 1999) are the key elements. n3 These rules about national treatment for investments and labor tend to have repercussions on labor markets, on industrial policies, and on judicial systems</span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">. The movement of capital requires some mobility of people as well, for labor market purposes, but also for access to land and to market</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">s. Especially relevant here is the movement of professionals and business people whose professions are related to trade in services. Their movement is encoded in bilateral or trilateral treaties, regional agreements (NAFTA, European Economic Area), and global agreements (General Agreement on Trade in Services [GATS]) (see Ghosh 1997; OECD Systeme d'observation permanente des migrations 1998). In addition to the formal arrangements the European states (east and west) have developed, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">there is a parallel system of informal consultations on migration issues, the so-called Budapest Group</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. n4 The origins of the Budapest Process go back to the events leading up to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">The primary objective </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">of the consultations <span style="background: aqua;">was to discuss measures for checking illegal migration </span></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">from and through central and eastern Europe. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Much emphasis was put on the need <span style="background: aqua;">to strengthen the surveillance of borders, the conclusion of readmission agreements, and the harmonization of visa policies</span></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 6pt;">Technological and financial aid was promised. During follow-up meetings, the themes that would dominate subsequent conferences became clear: criminalization of trafficking and improvement of police forces and border controls, imposition of carrier sanctions on airlines, exchange of information, conclusion of readmission agreements, and financial assistance to the central and east European countries (which were in reality the targets of these measures given their deficient or totally absent relevant legislation and policies). The statutory meeting of the Budapest Group (December 1993) reconfirmed these objectives and decided that the group would comprise senior officials from all participating states, making the Budapest Group into the only pan-European discussion forum for these issues. The issue of visa approximation was taken up at a special meeting in Portoroz (Slovenia) in September 1998. The harmonization of visa [*83] policies is to be achieved by the central and east European states aligning their policies with those of the European Union member states. In recent years, the Budapest Group has also set up an elaborate monitoring system to keep track of the progress with the implementation of agreed measures, thus acquiring a very real influence over national policy making. In the Americas, most of the regional integration processes ignore or sidetrack the question of the movement of people. This is the case with the Mercado Comun del Sur (Southern Cone Common Market), with NAFTA, and with the series of bilateral treaties on free trade in the region. Yet despite limited state regulations, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">labor migration represented a significant dimension of transborder economic activities, controlled mostly by the private sectors</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 6pt;">The Puebla Process, which started in 1996 under the name Regional Conference on Migration (RCM), marks a significant step in the regionalization trend in migration control. n5 Officially, the direct trigger of the RCM was the population conference in Cairo in 1994, but it was also linked to the plans for the Free Trade Area of the Americas, which is to extend the liberalization of national economies to Central and South America. The immediate initiative for the Puebla Process came from Mexico, a country facing important pressures from both its northern partners, particularly the United States, to control the flows of people crossing the border and from its southern neighbors in the form of transit migration. The RCM's plan of action, adopted in 1997 during its second annual meeting in Panama, focused on information gathering as well as on five areas of activities: (1) the formulation of migration policies (both emigration and immigration) that would respond to the commitments of the conference, (2) migration and development, (3) combating migrant trafficking, (4) collaboration for the return of extraregional migrants, and (5) human rights. Most of the work of the RCM has been devoted, since then, to the combating of migrant trafficking while the area of activity that received the least attention was the formulation of harmonized migration policies. Yet paradoxically, some form of coordination of these policies does take place, but indirectly, notably through the promotion by the RCM of transborder and labor market cooperation schemes. There is obviously a clear analogy between the Puebla Process and the Budapest Process in terms of which issues are central to their work. They share, in particular, emphases on the coordination of visa and migration policy, on the combating of illegal trafficking, and on the promotion of a system of readmission agreements.</span> <u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">These informal modes of governance</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"> fulfil very specific functions. They </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">first of <span style="background: aqua;">all </span></span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">serve as channels for communication between policy makers, experts, and interested third parties</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> This is especially important for those countries (e.g., several of the Commonwealth of Independent States countries) whose officials have little or no direct contact with their counterparts in the OECD world. Beyond that, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">they</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"> further serve to <span style="background: aqua;">socialize</span> </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">[*84] </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">the officials, experts, and policy makers of peripheral states into the existing epistemic communities in the migration field </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">within the OECD, <span style="background: aqua;">and</span> they help to <span style="background: aqua;">moor the policy reforms desired by the OECD partners </span>within the associated states: migration policies deemed desirable by the OECD partners are thus locked in within the dependent states</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 6pt;">Finally, in the case of the relationship between the European Union and a number of the central and east European states involved, the Budapest Process is clearly complementary to the ongoing accession process and prepares the ground, in the area of the regulation of people's mobility, for ultimate full membership of the European Union</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">These neoliberal forms of mobility controls will not disappear with political changes in countries at the receiving end</span></u></strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">. Because of their inclusion into regional frameworks of integration, <span style="background: aqua;">these mechanisms become locked in, and it would be extremely costly, both economically and politically, not to respect them</span></span></u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">(Gill 1998). </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Accordingly, states become more accountable to external than to internal forces. States are made responsible for maintaining the direction or the orientation taken by the regional system and to upholding the principles or social purpose of the agreements signed.</span></u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 6pt;">Both the Budapest Process and the Puebla Process have developed mechanisms to strengthen these tendencies and to monitor the compliance of the participating states. Particular emphasis is placed in both contexts on the selective criminalization of migration. In fact, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">the selective criminalization of specific forms of migration and the privileged treatment of other types of mobility is functional</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"> not only <span style="background: aqua;">in the context of proliferating neoliberal labor market reforms</span> but also in the context of redrawing the boundaries of the regions concerned</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. Both in the case of the Americas and in the case of Europe, we observe the restructuring of regional hierarchies. Certain countries or regions are gradually integrated into the OECD heartland (Mexico, Central Europe, and possibly in the long run, Turkey). These </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">countries are themselves becoming destination countries for migrants from the outer layers of the emerging new regional geohierarchies</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> (just as a decade ago the southern European countries made the transition from migrant-sending to migrant-receiving countries against the background of their integration into the hegemonic structures of the West). </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Other countries are recast in the role of dependent (semi-) peripheries, whose migrant workers are admitted to the heartland countries only on the strictest conditions</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">, and who are themselves <span style="background: aqua;">burdened with the task of policing their borders with the external world whose people can come in only as illegal migrants</span></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> (and in decreasing measure as asylum seekers) (cf. van Buuren 1999). n6 To summarize this section, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Neoliberal restructuring of the global economy involves both the deepening and the widening of market relations and the transformation of governance structures. Labor has a specific role in this process: because international labor migration is only [*85] one way in which global capital can access the emerging global labor market, <span style="background: aqua;">the emerging global regime for labor involves both the disciplining of labor and the selective freeing of the mobility of labor.</span></span></u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 6pt;">There is clearly a tension between regulating migration under the auspices of global neoliberalism on one hand and upholding the values of democratic governance on the other. When we turn to discuss the contours of a possible new comprehensive framework for the regulation of global migration in the next section, we shall therefore emphasize the importance of democratic multilateralism as a safeguard against downward harmonization through disciplinary neoliberal policy competition.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">Trafficking has been </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">nationally and internationally<span style="background: aqua;"> defined through the <strong>use of ethnocentric language and western assumptions.</strong> Scholars use &quot;trafficking&quot; interchangeably with</span> diverse concepts, such as: <span style="background: aqua;">illegal immigration</span>, modern <span style="background: aqua;">slavery, prostitution, and the sexual exploitation of women</span>. Trafficking <span style="background: aqua;">definitions</span> often <span style="background: aqua;">fail to distinguish </span>clearly <span style="background: aqua;">between trafficking and voluntary consensual migration</span>, often <span style="background: aqua;"><strong>combining women's migratory movement with trafficking</strong></span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Kapur, 2005). Furthermore, Piper (2005) asserts that trafficking has to be seen as part of the reality of migration patterns, mainly undocumented flows. Taking into account economic globalization, O'Neill (2001, p. 156) presents trafficking as &quot;the total commoditization of human beings traded across borders, as is the case with any other good.&quot; Definitions of trafficking are highly contested among scholars, National Government Organizations (NGOs), feminists, and governments, thus posing challenges in conducting research studies, reporting statistics and making generalizations. Historical Fears of Sexuality and Migration The issue of trafficking came up within the international human rights discourse and took on a moral framework. The document that set the standard for the United Nations (UN) to continue further resolutions on trafficking and prostitution was the 1949 UN Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and Exploitation of Prostitution of Others (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003), the first international instrument that dealt with trafficking as forced prostitution. Even though this was not ratified by all countries, it still served as a model for future legislation (Doezema, 2002a). The 1949 UN Convention represented an abolitionist notion of prostitution as exploitation and as being &quot;incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person&quot; (Ditmore &amp; Wijers, 2003; Saunders, 2005). </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Historical patterns in the levels of public concern in the U.S. over the trafficking of women and children are linked to periods of increased immigration</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003). The historical discourse on immigration and its links to trafficking is emphasized by Pattanaik (2002, p. 218) who states that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;the term which was used to describe the ensuing abuses in the process of migration was 'trafficking.'&quot; The <span style="background: aqua;">U.S. immigration policies </span>in the <strong>past</strong> <strong>are known for their racist, discriminatory, and exclusionary stances, out of fear for the &quot;other,</strong>&quot; the unwelcome foreigner.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Racism, as it relates to sex trafficking, is raised as an issue for analysis by various feminists who critique the dominant sex trafficking framework. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">In response to the fear of 'white slavery,' Congress passed the White Slave Traffic Act</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> in 1910,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also known as the Mann Act. This act prohibited unmarried women from crossing state lines for immoral purposes and it criminalized interracial couples (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003, pp. 3-18). Under the Mann Act, in 1914 more than 70% of the convictions of women were related to the voluntarily transportation of women for prostitution or other immoral purposes (Saunders, 2005). </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">Racist immigration laws </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">passed in the 1920s, Immigration Act of 1924 and the Temporary Quota Act of 1921, <span style="background: aqua;">led to strengthening U.S. borders and the restriction of migrants</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">from Eastern and Southern Europe and Asia. The period afterward did not see trafficking on the U.S. and international agenda to such an extent or urgency as it was seen to resurface again in the 1990s (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003). Doezema (1998, p. 44) describes how the 19th century sex slave was &quot;a white woman, victim of the animal lusts of the dark races&quot; and in the 21st century, the racism changed its focus to exaggerate the new sex slaves as &quot;passive, un-emancipated women from the developing world.&quot; In the 1800s Chinese women and other women of color were viewed as overly sexual, deviant and promiscuous, as were Mexican women at the turn of the century. It was at this time that migration was on the rise so the government felt the need to create a moral fear and panic over &quot;the other.' </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">A historical context</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> of socio-political, religious, and economic perspectives in the U.S. <span style="background: aqua;">situates the current U.S. policy within a racist, heterosexist, hegemonic framework that <strong>harms women through so-called 'protection'</strong> and continues to colonize</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The different feminist perspectives of prostitution throughout history have also influenced policy and public ideas about trafficking and the need to 'protect victims.' </span></span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The U.S. Congress enacted the TVPA of 2000 with the purpose of preventing human trafficking overseas, protecting victims of trafficking, and prosecuting traffickers. The title, alone, of this U.S. policy demonstrates how the government depicts women as 'victims' to be 'rescued' and 'protected</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.' Mohanty (1991) affirms </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that media images of third world women, in this case constructed by the U.S. government, perpetuate the stereotypes of <strong>third world women as being weak and needing to be cared for.</strong> </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Kempadoo &amp; Doezema (1998, p. 42) assert that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the construction of a victim &quot;perpetuates stereotypes of sex workers as passive and exploitative victims.&quot; </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The TVPA has been presented in the media as a policy that 'combats' sex trafficking. The use of the word 'combat' perpetuates a language of violence and war, bringing in the necessity of masculinity to &quot;save&quot; the innocent, female, childlike victims from &quot;the barbaric crime of trafficking,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; as stated by President George Bush in a keynote address at the First National Human Trafficking Conference in July of 2004 (U.S. Department of Justice, 2004). The use of the word 'barbaric' serves to construct the idea of the uncivilized, dark-skinned trafficker abroad who manipulates innocent women into sex trafficking. A definition of sex trafficking, as defined by the U.S., can be found in the annual &quot;Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000: Trafficking in Persons Report&quot; issued by the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. definition of &quot;severe forms of trafficking in persons&quot; is as follows: (a) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or (b) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery (U.S. Department of State, 2002). Although not identical in their wording, the unifying elements of both the TVPA and the UN Protocol definitions of trafficking involve the illegal transportation and the sexual slavery of persons by threat or use of force or coercion. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The distinction being made between 'voluntary versus forced' creates a dichotomous framework from which to look at trafficking that is limiting and simplistic.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For instance, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a woman may knowing agree to work in the sex industry, thus being defined as 'voluntary', but she may not know the extreme abuse she may be faced with, that may include 'forced' acts under abusive working conditions</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Binary oppositions perpetuate silent biases and assumptions, without looking at the complexity of the issue</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Mohanty (1991, p. 64) asserts that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">dualities are ineffective when &quot;designing strategies to combat oppressions</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Only 'severe forms&quot; of trafficking cause the enforcement provisions of the TVPA to be implemented, with &quot;victims&quot; bearing the burden of proof that they were coerced. Policy Links to U.S. Imperialism The TVPA of 2000 is composed of features that emphasize prevention, protection and prosecution. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One aspect of the TVPA's prevention component includes the U.S.'s demands on other countries to take preventative measures to end sex trafficking. The U.S. has written into policy its responsibility to make yearly assessments of other countries' anti-trafficking efforts and to rank each country according to the procedures a country takes in order to 'combat' trafficking. </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons with the State Department has a mandate from Congress to issue annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) reports that rates each country's progress on eliminating trafficking. Each country is judged on a 'Tier' system, and the U.S., along with a few other western European countries, has awarded itself Tier I status, which represents 'sufficient' efforts at combating trafficking. However, those countries that do not demonstrate adequate means and efforts to end trafficking, as judged appropriate by the U.S., are ranked on either Tier 2 or Tier 3. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Those countries judged as being on Tier 3 are then subject to sanctions by the U.S. </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(except for sanctions on humanitarian aid). </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Mezler</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (2005) </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">has called to attention the interesting parallel between those countries that are ranked as Tier 3 countries and their poor political relations with the U.S., such as Cuba, North Korea, and Venezuela. Venezuela's Tier 3 ranking may be more about the country's refusal to acknowledge the U.S. program than with its efforts to eliminate trafficking</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Mezler, 2005). </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not only does the Tier system reinforce imperialist and hegemonic relations between those in power and those not in power, but it also raises additional issues related to the U.S. role within the world. Additional countries that were placed in Tier 3 and defined as sanctionable by the U.S. State Department consisted of countries who oppose U.S. imperialism, such as Iran, and countries made up of Arab or Muslim populations</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Lebanon, Sudan, Qatar, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia (Kempadoo, 2005, p. xxi). Enloe (2000, p. xvi) highlights the unique position of the </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">U.S. as a nation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">offers itself up as &quot;a model to be emulated&quot; while playing the role of a term she coins as <strong>&quot;global policeman.&quot;</strong> </span></u></span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Visas demonstrate the sovereign’s ability to decide who should be included in the population and who belongs in the state of exception at the nation’s borders. </span></strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The border is a permanent “state of exception” </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">one may claim no rights but is still subject to the law. The law is always suspended at the border, because the decision of entrance to the territory and</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> correspondent </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">membership in the community is irreducible to force</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Schmitt argues, “</span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the essence of </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the state’s </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">sovereignty [is] </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">not the monopoly to coerce or rule, but </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the monopoly to decide</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” The decision to include/exclude is irreducible to the sovereign. Agamben’s account fails to understand the particular state of exception at the state border and the decision to include/exclude; it lacks a capacity for agency. IN this respect, Foucault’s confessionary complex provides the missing component in Agamben’s discussion of exceptional politics and explains the dynamics of both decision and agency. I turn to the question of agency below during the discussion of confession. </span></span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Through the passport, the sovereign who claims one’s allegiance asks for entry and protection on behalf of the possessor</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; thus </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">entry to the body politic is mediated through the administrative bodies of the sovereigns. Entry to a sovereign state in which one does not possess nationality is mediated through the visa process </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and identity papers (passport, refugee, or stateless travel documents). While the discussion of individual attachment or allegiance to the state/sovereign is usually understood as citizenship or nationality, I would argue in the face of material facts on the ground and ethical concerns prompted by the political consequences of those facts that we must widen our analytical scope to include a multiplicity of forms of membership in political communities. Jean Bodin defines this important boundary of the political community: “</span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The mutual obligation between subject and sovereign, by which, in return for the faith and obedience rendered to him the sovereign must do justice and give counsel, assistance, encouragement, and protection to the subject. He does not owe this to aliens</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” At this stage, it is important to note that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the sovereign decision of inclusion/expulsion is irreducible and </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the space of decision is also a space of exception. The bordering process constituted by the decision to include/exclude is a dialogue between body and body politic requiring the confession of all manner of </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">bodily, economic, and social </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">information</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Having established that the principal task set for biopolitical practitioners is to sort and adjudicate between the species, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">modern societies reveal a distinct biopolitical aporia</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (an irresolvable political dilemma) </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">in the sense that <span style="background: aqua;">making life live</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">– selecting out those ways of life that are fittest by design – </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">inevitably writes into that</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">very </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">script those lives that are retarded, backward, degenerate, wasteful and</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> ultimately <span style="background: aqua;">dangerous to the social order</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Bauman, 1991</span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">). <span style="background: aqua;">Racism</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> thus </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">appears</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> here </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">to be a</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">thoroughly </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">modern phenomenon</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Deleuze &amp; Guattari, 2002). This takes us to the heart of our concern with biopolitical rationalities. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When ‘life itself’ becomes the principal referent for political struggles, power necessarily concerns itself with those biological threats to human existence</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Palladino, 2008). That is to say, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">since life becomes the author of its own (un)making, <span style="background: aqua;">the biopolitical assay of life necessarily portrays a commitment to the supremacy of</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">certain species types: ‘</span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">a race that is portrayed as the one true race</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, the race </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that holds power <span style="background: aqua;">and</span> is entitled to <span style="background: aqua;">define the norm</span>, and <span style="background: aqua;">against those who deviate</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from that norm, against those </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">who pose a threat to the biological heritage’</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Foucault, 2003: 61). Evidently, what is at stake here is no mere sovereign affair. Epiphenomenal tensions aside, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">racial problems occupy a ‘permanent presence’ within the political order</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Foucault, 2003: 62). Biopolitically speaking, then, since </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it is precisely through the internalization of threat</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – the constitution of the threat that is now </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">from the dangerous ‘Others’ that exist within</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that societies reproduce</span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">at</span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the level of life</span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the ontological commitment to secure the subject</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, since everybody is now possibly dangerous and nobody can be exempt, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">for political modernity to function one</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">always </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">has to be capable of killing in order to go on living</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Wars</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; <span style="background: aqua;">entire populations are mobilized for</span> the purpose of <span style="background: aqua;">wholesale slaughter</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the name of life necessity; </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">massacres have become vital</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. . . . The principle underlying the tactics of battle – that one has to become capable of killing in order to go on living – has become the principle that defines the strategy of states (Foucault, 1990: 137). When Foucault refers to ‘</span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">killing</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">’, he </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">is not simply referring to the vicious act of taking another life</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: ‘When I say “killing”, I obviously do not mean simply murder as such, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">but also every form of indirect murder: the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> fact of </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">exposing someone to death, increasing the risk of death for some people, or, quite simply, political death, expulsion, rejection and so on</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">’ (Foucault, 2003: 256). </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Racism makes this process of elimination possible, for it is only through the discourse and practice of racial (dis)qualification that one is capable of introducing ‘a break in the domain of life that is under power’s control: the break between what must live and what must die’</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Foucault, 2003: 255). While killing does not need to be physically murderous, that is not to suggest that we should lose sight of the very real forms of political violence that do take place in the name of species improvement. As Deleuze (1999: 76) duly noted, when notions of security are invoked in order to preserve the destiny of a species, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">when <span style="background: aqua;">the defence of society gives sanction to</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">very real </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">acts of violence</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that are </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">justified in terms of species necessity</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, that is when <span style="background: aqua;">the capacity to legitimate murderous political actions </span>in all our names and for all our sakes <span style="background: aqua;">becomes</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> altogether </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">more <span style="background: aqua;">rational</span></span></u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">calculated, utilitarian</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, hence altogether more frightening: </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When a diagram of power</span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">abandons the model of sovereignty in favour of a disciplinary model</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">when it becomes <span style="background: aqua;">the</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ‘bio-power’ or ‘</span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">bio-politics’ of populations</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, controlling and administering life, it is</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> indeed </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">life that <span style="background: aqua;">emerges as the new object of power</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<br />
<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Behdad’s underlying argument is that the nationalist rhetoric of America as a land that has historically welcomed immigrants — or what he calls “the liberal myth of immigrant America”— has entailed an amnesia about “the actual history of immigration in the United States” as well as about the violence against Native Americans, African Americans, and Mexicans. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">The <strong>rhetoric of global inclusivity has been built on a reality of exclusionary violence within and on the borders</strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>.</strong> <span style="background: aqua;">This rhetoric disguises </span>the <span style="background: aqua;">economic issues of </span>domestic and global <span style="background: aqua;">labor that</span> have <span style="background: aqua;">shaped the forms of immigration</span>, as <span style="background: aqua;">it</span> also <span style="background: aqua;">disguises the work of race in shaping the lives of different generations and groups of immigrants</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To attend to the nuances of such rhetoric, then, is to make visible the violence, racism, and economic exploitation that underpin the making of a national myth of inclusivity. To this end, the opening chapter looks at how the terms “asylum and hospitality” and “sovereignty and suf- frage” were deployed in debate by Jefferson and Hamilton. According to Behdad, Hamil- ton’s forgetfulness about the pilgrims’ own immigration, which was necessary for him to cast the early colonists as true natives, “is emblematic and productive of a patriotic form of national identity in which the denial of one’s own ‘foreignness’ is the requisite for being an American” (29). Jefferson was also forgetful when it came to the brutality of the early colo- nists towards the indigenous population. Asking what we can learn from such forgetfulness on the part of the nation’s founding fathers, Behdad reminds us that, since its inception, “</span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the U</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">nited <span style="background: aqua;">S</span>tates <span style="background: aqua;">has embraced contradictory notions of community and has</span> incessantly <span style="background: aqua;">fluctuated between insecurity and confidence, vigilantism and hospitality</span>,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> xenophobia and xenophilia”(47) </span></span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">Hence Behdad’s aspiration </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>to bring an end to the state’s violence against immigrants would involve bringing an end to the state of emergency that licensed such violence.</strong> But</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> President Bush’s declaration </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">of a Global War on Terror has introduced a seemingly immovable obstacle to the termination of this condition. The “Global War on Terror” generalized the state of emergency into a global condition that turned every site on the planet into a U.S. border that the state was empowered to defend against terrorists</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> In the recent debates over the immigration practices at the nation’s borders, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">a framework was put into place that projected widespread anxieties over social, economic, and cultural changes precipitated by globalization onto the threat of an immigrant invasion. </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">Patrick Buchanan supplied this framework with a cohesive populist fantasy in State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America. Buchanan turned the state of emergency into a populist national fantasy when he observed that </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">“the state of emergency is not confined to the Southwest</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. Our State of Emergency is a national one. America is being invaded, and if this is not stopped, it will mean the end of the United States.” When he described the border as a “gateway for terrorists,” Buchanan erased any meaningful distinction between terrorists and Mexican migrants when he correlated the state’s declaration of a Global War on Terror to the citizenry’s collective participation in the protection of the nation’s borders. “Potentially the most dangerous aliens crossing our borders are OTM’s (‘Other than Mexicans’). Terrorists have boasted openly of entering the United States through Mexico and a growing number of OTM’s caught at the border now come from the Middle East.” The state of siege that Buchanan has represented as taking place at the national borders effectively domesticated the state of emergency that the Global War on Terror had rendered a permanent planetary condition. I earlier proposed that a change in immigration policy could not take place through the change in cultural habitus that Behdad hoped would transpire in the wake of his retrieval of the memories of violence directed against immigrants. And I claimed that such a change would instead require the representation of the state’s immigration policies as instances of injustice that warranted the change in immigration policies. However, I also observed that the “Global War on Terror” has inscribed the relationship between U.S. citizens and immigrants within the legalized illegalities that pertain during a state of emergency. So I need, by way of conclusion, to replace that claim with the following observation. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">The intolerable immigration practices that have emerged in the wake of 9/11 <strong>can only be changed</strong> when the</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> my</span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">theme</span></u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> “</span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Global War on Terror” is stripped of the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">juridico-political<span style="background: aqua;"> authority to enshroud the globe</span> within its fatal habitus.</span></u><br />

For many an illegal immigrant, this brutality begins at the border</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, where he or she first comes into contact with the Immigration and Naturalization Service through the United States Border Patrol. Beyond congressional legislation that dehumanizes immigrants within our [*518] borders, </span><u>the attempt to cross the United States' border itself leaves the immigrant exposed to criminal and grossly inhumane treatment</u>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Immigrant abuse at the border has been documented in large part by Human Rights Watch, an agency established in 1981 to monitor and promote internationally recognized human rights. The following stories come from interviews they have conducted with immigrants, and paint a horrifying picture of the cruel and senseless violence that so unnecessarily takes place at the border. In 1989, Francisco Ruiz Chavez and his wife, Evelyn, both Salvadoran nationals, attempted to illegally enter the United States west of San Ysidro, California. A Border Patrol agent spotted Evelyn, seven months pregnant at the time, and pulled her down to the ground by her hair and slammed her head against the ground. Francisco, worried about the safety of his wife, reached for a rock and called to the Border Patrol agent to arrest his wife if necessary but not hurt her. The agent placed his boot onto Evelyn's enlarged stomach, prompting Francisco to hurl the rock at the agent. The agent immediately fired at Francisco, shooting him in the stomach and left buttock. The two bullets were fired from the distances of seven and twenty feet respectively. At Francisco's trial for assaulting a federal agent, the agent fabricated a story about being struck in the eye by Francisco's rock, causing him to fire in self-defense. The jury found for Francisco; meanwhile neither the U.S. Attorney's office nor the San Diego District Attorney's office made any move to prosecute the agent. 95 On September 8, 1990, Victor Mandujano Navarro, a seventeen year-old Mexican was shot and killed by an out-of-uniform Border Patrol agent. Victor, his brother, and several friends had made it successfully over the border when an agent appeared, announced he was from the migra, or INS, and caused the group to disperse. Victor was climbing over the border cyclone fence when the agent knocked him down, hit him, and shot him twice in the stomach. An autopsy showed that one bullet had exploded in Victor's heart. The officer alleged that he had been engaged in a violent struggle with Victor during which Victor tried to wrestle the gun away from the agent. During this struggle, the agent shot twice in self-defense. Amazingly, the agent emerged unscathed from this &quot;violent struggle.&quot; Again, neither [*519] the U.S. Attorney's office nor the District Attorney prosecuted the agent. 96</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">While </span><u>the documented examples of brutality against immigrants at the border are endless</u>, <span style="font-size: 6pt;">the similarity among all of them is the clear human rights violations that occur at the border, and the impunity with which each agent often escapes. While the Immigration and Naturalization Service must exist to enforce immigration laws and curb immigration, it can accomplish its goal not only without murdering or abusing immigrants, but also while respecting each immigrant's human dignity. &quot;Undocumented migrants who enter or are living in the United States may be deportable or excludable, but their immigration status does not lessen their entitlement to respect for their basic human rights.&quot; 97</span> <u><span style="background: yellow;">The onus is upon each resident of the United States</span> to join Human Rights Watch <span style="background: yellow;">in calling upon the governmen</span>t &quot;to honor its legal obligation <span style="background: yellow;">to ensure that the human rights of everyone in its territory, including those who enter without authorization, are protected from abuse</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by the INS.&quot; 98 In addition to concerns about the inhumane treatment of immigrants at the border, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">the means employed and the ends reached by the United States in enforcing its immigration policy <strong>raise fundamental ethical questions</strong></span></u>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">In 1994, the Clinton administration implemented Operation Gatekeeper, &quot;an unprecedented buildup of law-enforcement manpower and technology in San Diego County [California] to stop illegal immigrants.&quot; 99 The purpose, says INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, is to &quot;secure the border.&quot; 100 &quot;By preventing the entry of undocumented immigrants, the jobs of U.S. workers, presumably, will be safeguarded.&quot; 101 Operation Gatekeeper is intended to prevent the criminal activities of illegal aliens by stepping up border security at the most popular crossing points and creating a stricter prosecution policy of criminal activities. The increase in border security entails: militarization of a 66 mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border - know as the San Diego sector - that runs eastward from the Pacific Ocean into desert and mountain areas. This has included erecting a wall, deploying intensified fortification and surveillance techniques, increasing the [*520] number of Border Patrol agents and inspection officers assigned to the border, and coordinating joint actions involving the Border Patrol with local, state and federal agencies, as well as the main branches of the U.S. military and the National Guard. 102 The intensified surveillance techniques include image enhancement vehicles, electronic ground sensors, infrared night scopes, sophisticated surveillance helicopters, low-level-light television cameras, and high-power stadium style lighting. 103 In light of this intense militarization of our border, the United States appears to be waging a war against an enemy of its own creation: illegal immigrants. The intended effect of this militarization appears to be to discourage immigrants from crossing such a secured border and to remain in their native countries. However, long-standing countervailing forces affecting immigrants, such as unsatisfactory economic and labor conditions in their native countries combined with the escalating demand for cheap labor in the United States, provide an even stronger incentive. As a result, the border crossings continue despite Operation Gatekeeper. 104 What Operation Gatekeeper has changed is how immigrants now cross the border. In order to avoid the extensive surveillance and border security sure to lead to arrest and criminal prosecution, immigrants are channeled eastward by the militarization to the desert and mountain areas where surveillance is disproportionately mild. Unlike crossing the border near San Diego, the journey across the border through desert and mountain areas is extremely dangerous. Immigrants, most of whom do not travel with adequate provisions, face a much longer and more perilous trek over the border, during which they must now withstand snake bites, freezing temperatures in winter, and mountain fires, extreme heat, and dehydration in summer. 105 In 1996, thirty-eight aliens are known to have died during border crossing attempts through the desert. Some froze to death in the winter, while others died of thirst in the heat of summer. 106 At [*521] least 100 illegal aliens lost their lives along the U.S.-Mexico border between January and August 1998. 107 While many women, children, and elderly have been discouraged by the harsh conditions from even attempting border crossings to the east, those that do try often perish in the attempt. In August 1998, seven decomposed corpses of illegal immigrants--four men, one woman, and a teenage boy--were found in a part of the southern California desert where summer temperatures can rise to 120 degrees. 108 The seven literally roasted to death in what must have been an agonizing end. They sought refuge under a tree and gradually removed articles of clothing in a desperate attempt to survive &quot;the blast-furnace heat.&quot; 109 In death, &quot;the lone woman, still wearing blue jeans and a halter top, had nestled herself against her male companion... [a] tragic image--and, for a Border Patrol desperate to stem the human tide, one that's all too common.&quot; 110 Similarly, Operation Gatekeeper has not significantly stemmed the work of coyotes, or alien smugglers, who continue to help illegal immigrants cross the border for pay. However, Operation Gatekeeper has caused coyotes to resort to desperate measures and risk their own lives as well as the lives of the immigrants they transport in their cars and vans in order to escape apprehension by the Border Patrol: On 13 June, 1996, a fleeing van carrying suspected illegal aliens crashed, killing one and injuring 12; on 26 April, 1996, a fleeing van carrying suspected illegal aliens crashed, killing 2 and injuring 19; on 6 April, 1996, a fleeing pick-up truck carrying suspected illegal aliens crashed, killing 8 and injuring 17; in September of 1995, a fleeing car carrying suspected illegal aliens crashed, leaving 1 dead and several others injured; on 19 April, 1995, a fleeing van carrying suspected illegal aliens smashed into a pick-up truck, leaving 3 dead and 16 injured. 111 While the scope of this paper cannot adequately address all the nuances of Operation Gatekeeper and its implications and effects on immigrants, this much is clear:</span> two <u>results of Operation Gatekeeper, whether intended or unintended, should raise [*522] <strong>fundamental ethical questions</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">about the United States government's implementation of this particular immigration policy. First,</span> <u>by militarizing the San Diego border to the extent reminiscent of a full-scale war, Operation Gatekeeper channels immigrants eastward to inevitable death</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">by freezing, dehydration, and other hazards of the treacherous terrain. A similar result is reached by Operation Gatekeeper's heightened prosecution record for border arrests. Both coyotes and immigrants take greater risks to escape apprehension and, in the process, lose their lives. The means used by Operation Gatekeeper to rid the United States of illegal immigrants -</span> <u><span style="background: yellow;">disproportionate militarization</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> against unarmed fathers, mothers, children, and the elderly - </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">and channelization of immigrants into harsh terrain, are <strong>unethical</strong></span>. Through disguised ends of controlling immigration, <span style="background: yellow;">the United States <strong>forces immigrants into inhumane alternatives</strong> which ultimately lead to <strong>torturous deaths</strong> of innocent human beings</span></u>. The <span style="font-size: 6pt;">now-commonplace deaths of illegal immigrants point to the inconsistent moral leadership of the United States: while American soldiers battle for Albanian refugees in Europe, refugees of a different type, with the help of our immigration policies, die in large numbers on our own soil. </span></span></span><br />

Importantly, however, Hage notes that </span><u>hope or ethics is not an'either/or'scenario, rather it is about unequal distribution</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(2003: 16). The unequal distribution of hope is a racialised process.

When the Supreme Court was faced, during Vietnam, with a suit by soldiers refusing to go, claiming that there had been no declaration of war by Congress, as the Constitution required, the soldiers could not get four Supreme Court justices to agree to even hear the case. When, during World War I, Congress ignored the First Amendment's right to free speech by passing legislation to prohibit criticism of the war, the imprisonment of dissenters under this law was upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, which included two presumably liberal and learned justices: Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis.</span> <u>It would be naive to depend on the Supreme Court to defend the rights of poor people, women, people of color, dissenters of all kinds.

The Supreme Court in 1883 had interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment so that nongovernmental institutions hotels, restaurants, etc.-could bar black people. But after the sit-ins and arrests of thousands of black people in the South in the early Sixties, the right to public accommodations was quietly given constitutional sanction in 1964 by the Court. It now interpreted the interstate commerce clause, whose wording had not changed since 1787, to mean that places of public accommodation could be regulated by Congressional action and be prohibited from discriminating. Soon this would include barbershops, and I suggest it takes an ingenious interpretation to include barbershops in interstate commerce.</span> <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 11pt;">The right of a woman to an abortion did not depend on the Supreme Court decision in Roe v.

<br />
<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Most analysts agree, however, that </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">the 1965 amendments made family reunification, rather than skill, the cornerstone of U.S. immigration policy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Borjas 1991: 4; Hing 2004: 104). Joppke (1999) argues that </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">the 1965 Act belies a transition to a more open and humanitarian immigration policy</span>, when in fact the opening was merely a consequence of an attempt to preserve an existing demographic balance</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. To legislators at the time, it seemed logical that a policy based on the family members of existing U.S. citizens would cause the least change (Joppke 1999). Hing draws a similar conclusion, arguing that </span><u>the emphasis on family stemmed only partly, from a logical presumption that the policy would <strong>most benefit those groups already in the country</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as in 1965, the Asian population in the U.S. was relatively small (2004: 104). Joppke also argues that </span><u>the 1965 Immigration Act was intended to rectify an “intra-European imbalance of immigrant stock.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” Preferred countries with large quotas (those matching the demographics found in the 1920 American census) were not meeting their quotas, while others with small quotas, like Greece or Italy, had huge backlogs (Joppke 1999: 26). Furthermore, by the early 1960s, Jews and Italians were “well-entrenched” in the Democratic Party and pushed for reform and for an end to discrimination against Southern Europeans. Another reason for the 1965 reform stemmed from a need to match “law and policy.” Two thirds of legal immigrants entered outside of the national origins “quota” through provisions introduced to mediate the displacement caused by WWII and the Cold War. Nevertheless, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">the passage of the legislation <strong>led to an influx of large numbers of Asian and Latino immigrants,</strong> as well as growing <strong>opposition on the part of established labour</strong>, fearful that these newcomers would drive down wages and <strong>take jobs away from the “real Americans</strong></span></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">”</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (who, as Hing points out, were older groups of immigrants). <strong><span style="background: yellow;">Hence, </span></strong></span><strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">a number of provisions arose in the 1970s</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: yellow;"> and 1980s geared towards stemming the influx of Mexican labour, in particular</span></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> </span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, a continuation of the family preference system was also attractive because the </span><u><span style="background: aqua;">pro-family rhetoric </span>that accompanied this discussion <span style="background: aqua;">would send a positive message to other nations and encourage <strong>desirable immigrants</strong> to join our national community</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Representative Luis Gutierrez (D-IL), for instance, justified the emphasis on family reunification with the following words: “</span><u><span style="background: aqua;">We send a clear signal that we value keeping family members united and together, that we value a policy of fairness</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> […], that we value the history and character of our Nation and </span><u>that the United States <strong>values inclusion</strong> and understanding and opportunity, rather than exclusion, blame, and fear</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” (United States Congress, House, March 20, 1996). Even though Gutierrez emphasized the historical significance of family values without making a direct reference to families’ economic importance, this comment also complements the neoliberal logic of speakers like Senator DeWine (R-OH). After all, </span><u><span style="background: aqua;">families who stay </span>“united and together” <span style="background: aqua;">are expected to support each other so that the government <strong>would not have to provide assistance</strong></span></u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> </span></span><br />

As an alternative to identity, Lee (in Collier et al., 2002, p. 275) offers the notion of ““itineraries of temporalized struggles””––a more fluid and historicized concept focusing on specific people in a specific time and place working together toward the accomplishment of specific goals. </span></span></span><br />

Although we do not know for sure, a number of concerns arise. First, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><u><strong><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 11pt;">like all family prefer ence immigrants, the affidavit of support system will shape the incorporation </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">and transformation<span style="background: yellow;"> of immigrant same-sex partners into citizens</span></span></strong></u></span><span style="background: yellow; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> As I have already described, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>the affidavit system involves a heteropatriarchal imaginary that materially structures the economic and cultural terms through which immigrants are supposed to become incorporated into U.S. society</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. Second, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>this imaginary maps onto the couple relationship</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> in particular ways. The citizen or resident partner is positioned as, on the one hand, the person responsible for properly integrating the immigrant partner into U.S. society, while the immigrant partner is positioned as junior, subaltern, and requiring tutelage. On the other hand, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>the citizen or legal resident must also subject him- or herself to surveillance by the state</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. Third, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><u><strong><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 11pt;">the couple </span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">as a couple <span style="background: yellow;">must </span>also <span style="background: yellow;">be willing to submit to examination and surveillance</span></span></strong></u></span><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> This is no small matter, especially as officials grapple with the question of what are appropriate terms on which to evaluate and surveil the same-sex couple. The Immigration Equality Web site, perhaps for strategic reasons, suggests that samesex couples can be evaluated on exactly the same basis as heterosexuals: Permanent partners, like married couples, would be required to prove emotional and financial commitment through documentation such as: jointly owned property; shared child custody; joint bank accounts; joint credit cards; shared insurance policies; evidence of a commitment ceremony; and photographs of shared vacations and holidays with extended family.62 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>This description projects a world where anti-LGQ discrimination has already ended</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> (rather than being the very issue struggled over by this campaign); because of anti-LGQ discrimination, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>many of these conditions are difficult to fulfill</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">.63 Fourth, since </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>same-sex couples cannot get married, their relationships are not simply subject to a higher degree of scrutiny but also carry the presumption of falsity or fraud within a heteronormative logic</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. A flood of discourses claims that allowing immigration access to same-sex couples will result in millions of cases of fraud. (Personally, I think that if nonqueers are willing to claim publicly that they are gay or lesbian, this may be a promising development.) Thus groups such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform oppose the UAFA on the grounds that “opening another fraud-ridden loophole to our already crippled immigration system is irresponsible given the size of the illegal alien population already living in the U.S.”64 When Representative Nick Lampson of Texas expressed support for the bill, his opponents charged him with “allowing homosexuals . . . a free bypass to our immigration laws by bringing over anyone they say is their ‘partner.’ ”65 Immigration Equality found it necessary to refute this imagined fear, address ing the question “If a permanent partnership is not a marriage, isn’t fraud more likely?” on its Web site. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>These <span style="background: yellow;">fears starkly reveal the heteronormative epistemology of immigration control, and the homophobic forms of paranoia it generates.</span></strong></u> </span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">The intersection of these heteronormative fears of fraud with discourses of vulnerability to terrorism is complex. As Jasbir Puar and Amit Rai have shown, homophobic and racializing discourses and practices shape dominant constructions of terrorism and strategies of antiterrorism.66 The impact of these developments for queer immigrants remains to be fully documented, but Human Rights Watch and Immigration Equality provide one example: “When border officials halted a Canadian same-sex married couple because they tried to use the same customs form,” Concerned Women for America issued a press statement that “U.S. Customs officials at Pearson International Airport in Toronto were able to stop the latest pair of ‘domestic terrorists.’ ”67 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>The issues of citizenship, subjectivity, normalization, and surveillance that I have discussed would arise for same-sex couples who have sufficient financial and cultural capital to be eligible for entry</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> under the UAFA. But, as indicated earlier, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>not all lesbian and gay couples are so materially privileged</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>multiple, crosscutting exclusions will continue to shape these couples’ possibilities for becoming legalized, as well as the specific forms that their racialized, gendered, and class-based incorporation assumes</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">.68 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>Lesbians and gay men who remain unable to legalize, but remain within the United States, will experience a very different form of incorporation</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. As Nicholas De Genova describes, for undocumented people in general, the contradiction between their physical and social presence versus their “negation as ‘illegals’ generates ‘spaces of nonexistence.’ ”69 Thus “</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><u><strong><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 11pt;">the social space of ‘illegality’</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> is an erasure of legal personhood — a space of forced invisibility, exclusion, subjugation, and repression that [materializes] . . . in the form of real effects ranging from hunger to unemployment </span></strong></u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">(or more typically, severe exploitation) </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>to violence to death</strong></u></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">.”70 Dimensions of nonexistence that stem from migrant illegality include “enforced clandestinity,” “the transformation of mundane activities — such as working, driving, or traveling — into illicit acts,” restricted mobility that signals a measure of social death, “enforced orientation to the present,” “the revocability of the promise of the future,” and the nullification of certain kinship ties.71 Therefore, contrary to dominant scholarship that understands undocumented status simply in negative terms, De Genova and othersconceive </span><u><strong><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">undocumented status as a specific “juridical status that entails a social relation to the state”; thus “migrant illegality is a pre-eminently political identity” that is constructed through relations of power and inequality, and results in dispossessed and disenfranchised modes of incorporation into the United States</span></span></strong></u>.72 <span style="background: yellow; font-size: 11pt;"><u><strong>Lesbians and gay men who cannot legalize or who lapse from legal to illegal status will, like other subalternized groups, be placed in this position</strong></u></span><span style="background: yellow; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As a non-gender-specific term, ““queer”” appears inclusive of all genders. However, such terminological breaks can be read as reactionary and potentially dangerous (Thomas, 2000). </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>Under <span style="background: yellow;">a non-gender specific um- brella</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>Jeffreys</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(1997) </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;"><strong><u>is concerned about the disappearance of the lesbian and denial of lesbian oppression under patriarchy and heteronormativity</u></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Simi- larly, Wolfe and Penelope (1993) contend that </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>destabilization of identity cate- gories</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a typical move in queer analysis, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>leads to lesbian erasure</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. They write, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>We [cannot] afford to allow privileged patriarchal discourse</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(of which poststructuralism is but a new variant) </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>to erase the collective identity Lesbians have only recently begun to establish.</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. . . For what has in fact resulted from the incorporation of deconstructive discourse, in academic ““feminist”” discourse at least, is that the word Lesbian has been placed in quotation marks, whether used or mentioned, and </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>the existence of real Lesbians has been denied</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, once again. (p. 3) Given the history that ““gay,”” as a label, came to signify male homosexuality in a number of contexts, the concern that ““queer”” might become a male generic is certainly not unwarranted. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;"><strong><u>Queer theory is also guilty of transgender erasure</u></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Namaste (2000), for ex- ample, argues that queer theory, with its focus on performativity, fails to take into account the context in which gender performances occur. She points out that Butler’’s drag queens perform in gay male cultural spaces and </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>reduces drag to something a person does on stage rather than a person who is.</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In addition, </span><strong><u><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;">queer theory ignores the material realities, the lived experiences and the subjectivities</span> of transgendered people</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Elliot and Roen (1998) call for the de- velopment and articulation of transgender theories, that is, ideas and assertions that inform and are informed by transgender political movements and articu- lated by transgenderists. </span></span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The aff reinforces the homo/heterosexual binary, normalizing and assimilating the gay subject. Instead of looking at the oppression queer people experience, we should challenge the discourses that construct sexuality and the way they organize society. Only then can we stop the violence against communities – this type of analysis is an ethical decision. </span></strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Initially coined by Teresa de Lauretis in 1990, queer theory is a relatively recent academic and cultural phenomenon (Halperin, 1995; Turner, 2000). Heavily influenced by poststructuralism, queer theory entered the acad- emy, through a variety of disciplines in the humanities (such as English, film studies, and cultural studies), education, and social sciences (such as sociology), in the 1990s (Dilley, 1999; Hennessy, 2000; Namaste, 2000; Seidman, 1996; Turner, 2000). According to de Lauretis, “</span><span class="underline"><strong><u>queer theory’’ con- veys a</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">double </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>emphasis––on</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the conceptual and speculative work involved in discourse production, and on the necessary critical work of </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>deconstructing our own discourses and their constructed silences</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”” (1991, p. iv, my emphasis). To put it another way, queer theory is guided by a significant deconstructive im- pulse. Originating from, developed in, and distancing itself from conventional les- bian and gay studies, queer theory and its predecessor have overlapping but dis- tinctively different theoretical and political goals, neither one of which is necessarily superior to or more inclusive than the other (Berlant &amp; Warner, 1995). Departing from the ““gay ‘‘ethnic’’ identity”” model of homosexuality (Ep- stein, 1990, p. 285) and inspired by the radical, confrontational, ““in-your-face”” queer politics of activist groups such as ACT UP and Queer Nation, queer the- ory is characterized by a transgressive agenda and a rebellious spirit. As such, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>queer theory challenges the assumption of the unified homosexual subject</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">un- dergirding much of Western homophobic and gay-affirmative theory (for a de- tailed account of this assumption, see Epstein, 1990; Seidman, 1996, 1997). </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;"><strong><u>A unified homosexual subject reproduces the homo/heterosexual binary</u></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as Seidman (1996) explains, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>Modern Western affirmative homosexual theory may naturalize or <span style="background: yellow;">nor- malize the gay subject or even register it as an agent of social liberation</span>, but it has the effect of consolidating heterosexuality and homosexuality as master categories of sexual and social identity; <span style="background: yellow;">it reinforces the mod- ern regime of sexuality</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (p. 12, my emphasis) As I argue throughout the essay, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>this regime of sexuality based on the homo/heterosexual binary becomes injurious and <span style="background: yellow;">violent to individuals and communities through the workings of heteronormativity.</span> Recognizing nor- malization as a site of violence</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Seidman (1996, pp. 12-13) points out that </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>Queer theory wishes to challenge the regime of sexuality itself</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, that is, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>the knowledges that construct the self as sexual and that assume hetero- sexuality and homosexuality as categories marking the truth of sexual selves</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. . . . </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>Queer theorists view heterosexuality and homosexuality not simply as identities</u></strong> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">or social statuses </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>but as categories of knowledge</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a language that frames what we know as bodies, desires, sexualities, iden- tities. This is a normative language as it shapes moral boundaries and po- litical hierarchies. In the process, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>queer theory calls for a dramatic <span style="background: yellow;">shift from</span> lesbian and gay <span style="background: yellow;">assimilationist politics to a politics of difference</span></u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Slagle, 1995). Seidman (1996) further explains, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>Queer theorists shift their focus from an exclusive preoccupation with the oppression and liberation of the homosexual subject to an analysis of the institutional practices and discourses producing sexual knowledges and the ways they organize social life</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, attending in particular to the way these knowledges and social practices repress differences. . . . [In short], queer theory aspires to transform homosexual theory into a general so- cial theory or one standpoint from which to analyze social dynamics. (p. 13, my emphasis) As such, queer theory does not aspire to attain theoretical hegemony or domi- nation in cultural politics. Rather, </span><span class="underline"><strong><u>queer theory provides another view, another discursive horizon, and another perspective from which social relations can be analyzed and examined</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span></span><br />

And when we do so, we should think much more than we currently do about the harms sustained by various subordinated groups, including women. All I want to add here in response to some of Halley's remarks is that harm- and </span><u><span style="background: yellow; font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 9pt;"><strong>law-focused inquiries</strong> </span></u><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 9pt;">with respect to gender or otherwise that come from such a focus <u><span style="background: yellow;">are</span> indeed <span style="background: yellow;">reformist projects</span>. They are projects about how law could do better, instrumentally</u>, what it claims to do, and what it does do some of the time, what it does not do at all well most of the time, and often does not do at all, period. However, <u><span style="background: yellow;">while it is important to get judge-made law to do better what it already does, it is <strong>even more important</strong></span></u><strong>.</strong> I think, <u><span style="background: yellow;"><strong>to put law in its place</strong></span></u>. <u>Law</u>--meaning here, adjudicative law--is (lo and behold) not politics. It <strong>c</strong><u><strong>annot do</strong> what politics might be able to do. It has been a tragic mistake,</u> I think, <u>of liberals, radicals,</u> identitarian theorists, critical legal scholars<u>, and progressives of all stripes involved in law, legal theory,</u> and legalism of the past half century, <u>to assert, and so repetitively and confidently, the contrary</u>. <u><span style="background: yellow;">The domain of adjudicative law</span> has <strong>its own ethics</strong>. It is for the most part <strong>deeply moored in conservative values</strong>. It has some redemptive potential and therefore some play for progressive gains, but really <strong>not much.</strong> More important, <span style="background: yellow;">it has the potential, all in the name of justice, <strong>to further aggravate the harms it manages to so successfully avoid</strong></span><strong>.</strong></u> </span><em><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 8pt;">Caring for Justice</span></em><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> was an attempt to expose the aggravation of harm done by law in the name of justice, exploit its redemptive potential, and argue that others should do this also. </span><span style="font-family: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; font-size: 6pt;">But completely aside from the arguments of that book, I think this is still a very important and very much under-examined question for progressive lawyers to ask: how much can be asked of adjudicative law? Again, my answer is &quot;not much.&quot; Others disagree. My current retrospective on the place of Catharine MacKinnon's jurisprudence in our law and letters, for example, argues that a part of the brilliance of her labors over the last thirty years has been her quite conscious embrace of law and legalism, rather than the domain of politics, culture, or education, to achieve evolutionary changes in our understanding of both sexual injury and sexual justice. </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=39680407fb828dfdd157d657f657a888&amp;docnum=53&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=51&amp;wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkAt&amp;_md5=4f80854bd4621b982f860148cd3f92b3&amp;focBudTerms=casey%20and%20foucault%20and%20abortion&amp;focBudSel=all#n97" rel="nofollow">**97**</a> She has been phenomenally successful in pushing law to become a <strong>[*48]</strong> vehicle for that evolutionary change.

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">Drawing on Derrida's deconstructive reading of the contradictions inherent in conditional hospitality, we can suggest that multiculturalist tolerance of minorities within the host nation-state is not for nothing. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Welcoming the other in the form of codified multiculturalist tolerance implies a conditional welcoming, as the hospitality offered remains <strong>limited within law and jurisdiction</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. But more importantly, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">this kind of tolerance <strong>does not result in a fundamental modification of the host subject's</strong> mode of inhabiting the territory</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"> that is deemed to be solely within his/her possession. <strong>Far from laying the grounds for an interruption of sovereign identity of the self,</strong> <span style="background: aqua;">multiculturalist respect and tolerance implies the conditional welcoming of the guest within the <strong>prescribed limits of the law</strong> and </span>hence <span style="background: aqua;"><strong>implies a reassertion of mastery over the national space</strong></span> as it enables the subject to appropriate a place for itself</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">--an empty and universal and therefore sovereign place--from which the other is welcomed. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Thus the place from which multiculturalist tolerance welcomes the particularity of the other,</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> fortified by codifications such as affirmative action and other legal measures, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">is what <span style="background: aqua;">precisely enables the disavowed and</span></span></u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">inverted self-referentiality of </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">racist hospitality which by emptying the host's position from any positive content <strong>asserts its superiority and sovereignty</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. The inherent paradox of multiculturalism's conditional and </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">lawful welcoming of the other as guest can be productively understood as conforming to &quot;the structure of exception</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">&quot; that Giorgio Agamben discusses in Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life. In discussing this, I want to refer to the German case where the paradox of the inclusion of minorities within the limits of law can be illustrated. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">All of the laws that regulate the conditions of arrival, presence, and departure of &quot;guest-workers&quot; in Germany reveal that the overriding concern is that of recruitment of a short-term labor force.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> For this reason, residence permits are conferred only as work permits. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Laws explicitly anticipate that the workers will leave Germany when the needs of capital are fulfilled</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. The fact that the workers' presence is regarded as temporary makes clear that </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">the new regulations are seen as an exception: a parenthesis to be opened and eventually closed</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">The logic underlying these laws is that the acceptance/welcoming of foreign labor is a conditional one,</span></u> <u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">as the workers' presence, which is expected to be temporary, is deemed to be an exception to the general rule</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> Tellingly, the term &quot;migrant&quot; is not typically used to name this group. As guests, these workers are accepted as an exception to the general rule of membership in the German polity. Their welcoming is not regulated within the framework of the general rule of law. In accordance with the persistent and widespread sentiment that declares that &quot;Germany is not a land of immigration,&quot; </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">the conditional welcoming </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">or the temporary hosting of foreign labor <span style="background: aqua;">appears</span> at first glance <span style="background: aqua;">to be set outside the purview of general law</span>. Hence these regulations are nothing but the name of an interim, an exception</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">. In offering hospitality that is conditional, </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">the German national self appropriates a place for himself/herself so as to be able to say welcome. <span style="background: aqua;">This entails</span> not only <span style="background: aqua;">maintaining the status of the </span>German <span style="background: aqua;">national self as master</span>, but more importantly <span style="background: aqua;">it institutes a welcoming in order to nourish the sovereignty of the</span> German <span style="background: aqua;">subject that was already in place</span>.</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;"> To understand the dynamic that is operating here, we can establish a link between Derrida's understanding of &quot;conditional hospitality&quot; and what Agamben calls &quot;inclusive exclusion.&quot; Though pushed outside, the provisional acceptance of the guest-workers enables the regeneration and nourishment of the German national self, which needs to reconstitute its sovereignty each time anew. Such a sovereign self maintains and nurtures itself not by pushing particular others to its exteriority or outside the purview of general law. On the contrary, it is their inclusive exclusion, which the conditional welcoming enables, that is indispensable for a reassertion of a sovereign German national self. The empty and universal position of the sovereign claim enabled by the general rule of law is capable of instituting conditional hospitality as an exception and this enables the means to codify respect and tolerance for the different and confer upon them rights in the form of law. </span><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">It is precisely at this point that <span style="background: aqua;">we need to be vigilant and to problematize this codification by asking what is being negated and foreclosed here</span>. Does this codification entail the opening of the space of politics or does it effectively signal the circumscription of what Zizek calls &quot;politics proper</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">&quot; or what Antonio Negri calls &quot;constituent power&quot;?</span><br />

Hence Mr. M’s desire to fix me as the Muslim woman with a tale to tell about Islam. Faced with a quandary as simple as a woman with a Muslim name who wasn’t Muslim and an atheist, he preferred to simply turn away. The legibility of the story that I, in his mind, ought to have presented – the abject Muslim woman who could be the authentic native informant on Islam – was now muddied and unclear. It may seem like a stretch, to use a random brief conversation to extrapolate a larger text about the left’s failure to fully engage with the politics of immigration. But </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">part of <span style="background: aqua;">the problem with</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Chicago politics in particular and </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">left politics </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">in general <span style="background: aqua;">is</span> that <span style="background: aqua;">its adherence to a sentimental and nostalgic view of the Other</span> is deeply <span style="background: aqua;">embedded in a politics of <strong>abjection and rescue</strong></span>. And this failure is manifested in the everyday encounters</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> like the one I describe above, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">even as marches, rallies, and anti-war events portray a strongly analytic anti-establishment “left</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are consequences to pay for this perception of what immigrants should be like. <span style="background: aqua;">Immigration rights activists</span> like myself <span style="background: aqua;">find themselves having to define themselves within preconceived narratives while struggling to craft alternatives paradigms for a truly progressive reform </span>agenda.

But <span style="background: aqua;">they <strong>disable our understanding of the economic crisis of neoliberalism,</strong> of which the battle over immigration is a symptom</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the context of the gay movement, immigration is overcast by the new reality of what it means to be “LGBT” today – to be defined by a class category rather than any sense of politics. Gay Marriage and “Gay” as a Class Identity In the United States, “Gay” has become a separate class identity. This is typical of a widespread feeling in the U.S., even among the most beleaguered workers, that they must distinguish themselves as professionals, separate from blue-collar workers. As an adjunct organizer at UIC (I was the Lecturer Representative), I once sent out an e-mail about unionization to which one person responded, “Are you trying to tell me that I’m the same as a truck driver?” (Answer: “Yes.”) This discomfort about being classified as workers is a problem that threatens unionizing more generally, in a social context where workers’ rights are seen as inimical to the “American Dream.” Such an attitude is aided in no small part by megacorporations like Wal-Mart that threaten workers with layoffs if they join unions. The “gay movement” of today strongly relies on the fiction and fantasy that gays are uniformly of the same class background and that they all desire one kind of life (bourgeois, happily married, and mysteriously and universally endowed with health care benefits). Some of the force behind the thrust towards gay marriage is based on emotion and sentiment, and those operate on the assumption that gays everywhere are the same in terms of class identity. In this fantasy land where every gay person automatically gets rights and benefits upon marriage, there are no layoffs or accidents at the workplace. In effect, to be gay in America is to be a separate class identity. But what of poorer gays and lesbians? Factions of the movement already have an answer to that. One local group writes triumphantly that poorer gays and lesbians would especially benefit from marriage rights because it would give them access to benefits. But that presupposes that there any benefits to share in the first, and that’s less likely in the lower wage workplace. And we ought to ask: how is promulgating marriage as a cure for economic insecurity any different from the Right demanding that women on welfare undergo marriage counseling and making it difficult for single mothers to get assistance? Why should marriage, of all athings be the savior of class-based economic woes? </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The problem here is that, in the shadow of neoliberalism, <span style="background: aqua;">identity</span> </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– gender, ethnicity, race, or sexuality – </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">has become separated from</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the pressing <span style="background: aqua;">workplace issues that define us as workers</span>. Under a neoliberal framework, <strong><span style="background: aqua;">your identity as part of a social and cultural group will be protected more readily than your rights as a worker</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If your co-worker calls you a derogatory name that insults your heritage/sexuality/gender/race, he/she will be punished swiftly and perhaps face a termination of employment. If you get injured on the job, or fired without notice, the chances of any retribution for the same are difficult to impossible. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This has far-reaching implications in terms of how we conceive of immigration rights, and the fact that <span style="background: aqua;">we prefer to think of immigrants as persons with stories </span>– <span style="background: aqua;">not as workers</span>. In the context of queer organizing over immigration, <span style="background: aqua;">the movement has been hijacked</span> by mainstream gay groups that define the agenda in very narrow terms, separating “queer” from “worker.”</span></u></span><br />

What is deployed through the rhetorics and the politics of borders and boundaries, what the media stages in the spectacle of the territorial security and perpetual danger, be it at a transnational or an urban scale, is a split or division at which &quot;human life&quot; is separated from the unrecognizable, the residual, life reduced to its &quot;merely biological&quot; status—&quot;bare life,&quot; to use Agamben's expression, which is in many ways identified with the diverse forms of poverty and indigence so deeply intensified in the neoliberal era. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">National or continental <span style="background: aqua;">borders are</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as we currently see both in Europe and the US, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">constantly redrawn, pushed further and further from the &quot;inside,&quot; to contain</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> the so-called</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [End Page 99] </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;flows&quot; or <span style="background: aqua;">&quot;waves&quot; of migrants</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.1 At the same time, urban landscapes throughout the planet are reshaped by rapidly changing maps of safety and risk, due to the &quot;sudden&quot; outbreaks of social violence and criminality and the reinforced claims for security and &quot;safety zones.&quot; </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">All these dislocations</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> of the maps of &quot;security&quot; and &quot;containment&quot; <span style="background: aqua;">show to what extent the distinction between inside/outside has become more</span> ambivalent, more <span style="background: aqua;">fractured</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and thus more defensive and paranoid. This ambivalence and this internal fracture, we want to suggest, has to do with the biopolitical dimension from which such dislocations originate. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">As the &quot;outside&quot; becomes more proximate and immediate, violence intensifies</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. At the same time, it forces a redrawing of the very boundaries of the political</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As Giorgio Agamben and Roberto Esposito have, in different manners, explained, the inscription of life in modern political regimes, and the very political recognition of life as &quot;human life&quot; takes place as an ambivalent split or division. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Agamben discusses the politicization of life in terms of <span style="background: aqua;">the <strong>&quot;inclusive exclusion&quot;</strong> of &quot;bare life</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; or zōē, that is, the &quot;mere life&quot; that has no human or socially recognized status. This &quot;merely biological&quot; life is the threshold of human life, at the same time exterior and interior, included as that which needs to be constantly separated, expelled, so that the &quot;form of life,&quot; or bios, can be recognized as &quot;human&quot; and be protected by the legal and the social order. In this ambivalent and violent threshold between bios and zōē, writes Agamben, &quot;the humanity of living man is decided&quot; [HS 8].2 Roberto Esposito, in turn, describes </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the politicization of life as</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> &quot;immunization&quot; or </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&quot;negative protection of life</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;: as power takes hold of the biological foundation of the species, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">it finds within life itself that which can threaten it.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Sovereignty thus takes place in the paradoxical movement of separating or dividing life from itself in order to protect it. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If politics is &quot;the possibility, or the instrument, to keep life alive</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [la possibilità, o lo strumento, per trattenere in vita la vita]&quot; [Esposito 42], </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">then immunity functions to segregate life</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> from that which threatens its perpetuation and its potency. The paroxysmal paradox of this dispositif is that, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">in trying to preserve life, immunity may eliminate life itself</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. In order <span style="background: aqua;">to protect &quot;the People,&quot; biopower can erase large sectors of the population</span>; in order to increase health, it can destroy the body</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this vertiginous ambivalence, argues Esposito, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">we need to understand some of the most dramatic paradoxes of our era that, under <span style="background: aqua;">the logic of security, can normalize and make acceptable any form of violence</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What these two approaches (which are far more complex and rich than we can elaborate here) have in common is </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">the paradoxical dynamic of the political inscription of life: a paradox by which the &quot;excluded&quot; reinscribes itself systematically in the &quot;included</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and the &quot;outside</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;—the residual zōē or the threats to life—</span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">breaks in and disrupts the &quot;inside.&quot;</span></u></span><br />

I believe that <u><span style="background: aqua;">the “immigrant” is basically a sublimated fetish object</span></u>. A fetish object, without which the populist politics of immigration, especially in countries such as Austria and Denmark, would not be able to exist. <u><span style="background: aqua;">Without the immigrant as the “other” against which “we” define ourselves, it is impossible to sustain the clean-cut definitions of</span></u> Danishness, Austrian <u><span style="background: aqua;">identity</span></u>, and so on. Then, obviously, the immigrant has a great function in this society. Hence <u>I don’t think that the real aim of the immigration debate is to integrate immigrants – simply because <span style="background: aqua;">if integration takes place</span></u>, that is, <u>if the “problem of the immigrant” disappears, <span style="background: aqua;">then the culturalist/communitarian definitions</span></u> of Danishness <u><span style="background: aqua;">cannot be sustained in their present form</span></u>. So, in fact, it is not the case that the immigrant is parasitic on “our identity” or “our way of life”; it is, rather, the case that <u><span style="background: aqua;">what we define as “our identity” is parasitic on the supplement called immigrant</span></u>. Thus it seems to me that <u><span style="background: aqua;">only through the fantasy about a consistent immigrant identity, “we” can today conceal a much more profound </span>reality, a much more profound <span style="background: aqua;">source of anxiety: which is</span></u> that in network <u><span style="background: aqua;">capitalism</span></u>, “society” itself, be it Danish or Austrian society, no longer exists. There are no longer borders for the flows of deterritorialized, global capital. If we are to sustain the illusion that borders remain, we cannot afford to “integrate” and forget the immigrant – which is, I believe, the “dirty secret” of politics of immigration and perhaps of much research in this field. <u><span style="background: aqua;">So, neither the “immigrant” nor the “society” exists. </span>What are we left with, then? What can we talk about? <span style="background: aqua;">We should </span><em><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">perhaps simply shut up; indeed, silence can be seductive, subversive and ethical,</span></em></u> at least sometimes. Yet, paradoxically, I am tempted to speak. Perhaps, doing immigration research is living with this paradox. In my presentation I want to look at how the topic of immigration might relate to what is called the “network society”, which is not a “society” in the sense of classical social theory. Rather, the “network society” consists of networks and flows that cannot be contained within “solid” national borders.1<br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">My argument has two main theoretical points. First, I suggest that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">humanitarianism, although driven by the moral and ethical imperative to relieve suffering, can have dis- criminatory and even violent consequences</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the absence of guiding political principles and practices. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These conse- quences are all the more striking because <span style="background: aqua;">they are unex- pectedly found at the very heart of the compassion that grounds humanitarian action</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Here, I engage in a debate about the </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">contemporary resurgence of discourses of moral- ism</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and how they </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">blur boundaries between legal, political, and ethical–moral orders</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I am particularly interested in the growing emphasis on the role of compassion, sympathy, and benevolence in political life—sentiments that play a crucial part in the discourses of what some call “global civil society.” NGOs ﬁghting in the name of human rights, environmental- ism, and cultural preservation, among many other causes, intervene on behalf of a moral order, each ﬁghting for a role in “the global meritocracy of suffering” (Bob 2002). One of the most prominent of these movements is hu- manitarianism, which grew in global importance and vis- ibility over the course of the 1990s. The massive prolifer- ation of humanitarian organizations, the awarding of the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize to M´ decins Sans Fronti` res (MSF, e e or Doctors Without Borders), and the entry of humanitarian- ism into common political discourse—illustrated by British Prime Minister Tony Blair’s government calling the bombing of Kosovo a “humanitarian bombing”—are just a few exam- ples of its growing presence.5 </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">There has been a concomitant focus on suffering, in the name of which humanitarianism intervenes</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6 As just one example, the diagnosis of posttrau- matic stress disorder (PTSD) has increased exponentially in recent years, giving public prominence to the suffering and trauma endured in a variety of contexts, from military in- terventions to domestic disputes.7 Yet </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">how does the recog- nition of suffering result in a political program for change</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Although the question of how moral demands translate into politics has a history as long as political philosophy itself, I am interested in its current manifestation precisely because </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">moral demands have increasingly ﬁlled the space of political actio</span></u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8pt;">n</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Whereas scholars such as Wendy Brown and Chantal Mouffe have argued that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the tendency to moralize has taken the place of political action</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I make my second but related point by suggesting that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">this moralism has created another type of politics, even while being labeled apolitical</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.8 I en- gage here in the contemporary debate about biopolitics and humanitarianism, which relies heavily on work done by philosopher Giorgio Agamben. Agamben, in turn, builds on the intersection of works by Michel Foucault and Hannah Arendt. Agamben (1998:133) suggests that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">humanitarian or- ganizations can only function by grasping human life as “bare life,”</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the Greek zoe, the fact of living common to all beings—life unqualiﬁed by the political and social commu- nities that distinguish humanity from other types of life. Bare life is life excluded from the polis, and insofar as hu- man beings are political or social beings, the polis marks the boundary between human and nonhuman. In fact, my research suggests that humanitarianism does not simply produce or reproduce bare life as separate from political life, even if the protection of bare or biological life is its goal; rather, it allows for the recombination of bare life and political life in new ways, such that the political dimension of human life is never lost. Political subjects can be found in the most “apolitical” of spaces. The political aspect of life, how- ever, is radically transformed—often in undesirable ways. In other words, the political choices allotted to sans papiers, although still choices, are composed of undesirable options: poverty, exploitation, exclusion, or illness. In this article, I ﬁrst discuss how humanitarianism has been transformed into a form of politics, functioning as a transnational system of governance tied to capital and la- bor even while purporting to be apolitical. To this end, I examine the distinction between human rights and human- itarianism, or between a juridical and a humanitarian logic, grounding my argument in the context of French immigra- tion policies. I then examine the illness clause as a practical example of the turn to a humanitarian politics. I focus in the second half of the article on the conse- quences of humanitarianism as politics. I ﬁll out my argu- ment that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the joining of ethics and politics actually limits rather than expands notions of humanity</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Thus, I describe new biopolitical practices and the unexpected diseased and disabled citizens that are produced by humanitarianism as a system of governance, and I end by discussing <span style="background: aqua;">how </span></span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">a lim- ited humanity is produced on the ground by a politics of compassion</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I show that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the humanity protected is one of suffering bodies</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and biological life <span style="background: aqua;">devoid of social and po- litical content</span>; yet <span style="background: aqua;">this </span>is a<span style="background: aqua;"> notion of humanity</span> that, even in its minimalism, <span style="background: aqua;">keeps intact racial and gender hierarchies</span>.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Indeed, the struggle to deﬁne citizenship and the borders of the nation-state is now also a struggle to deﬁne the threshold of humanity and of life itself. My intention in this article is not to call into question people’s illnesses or disabilities as somehow inauthentic but, rather, to understand the effects of a new “biosocial” space, and here I draw on Paul Rabinow’s (1996) concept not only to refer to a social community created by shared illness but also to indicate the way that biology is used as a ﬂexible social resource. For instance, once an undocumented immigrant is given papers for illness, he or she might choose to escape this biological community in favor of another political or cul- tural identity. Biosociality here becomes the socially framed choice to draw on one’s biology.9 I write, ﬁnally, with the recognition that in exposing the violence at the heart of this humanitarian practice, I may be helping to further undermine a key opening to legality that sans papiers have beneﬁted from. Yet I do so because </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the un- derlying regime of which it is a part is, ultimately, inherently destructive, not only reproducing a racially stratiﬁed soci- ety built on the colonial legacy but also <strong>maintaining certain people as less than human</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Moreover, the violence inher- ent in this particular French ethical conﬁguration has larger global echoes. Ultimately, my underlying question concerns the notion of humanity promoted by a politics based on humanitarianism—what is the image of the human that this politics projects?</span></span><br />

Although every culture is inherently utopian in its potentiality, the internal social dynamic through which its symbolic world-view is maintained as a sacred order has a tendency to transform it into a closed ideological universe (in Karl Mannheim's sense of the ideological; namely, a world-view that promises change while actually reinforcing the status quo) that tends to define human identity in terms advantageous to some and at the expense of others. <u>Historically the process of <span style="background: aqua;">dehumanization has </span>typically <span style="background: aqua;">begun by redefining the other as</span>,</u> by nature, <u><span style="background: aqua;">less than human</span>. <span style="background: aqua;">So</span> the Nazis did to the Jews, and <span style="background: aqua;">European Americans did to the Native Americans</span>,</u> men have done to women, and whites to blacks. By relegating these social definitions to the realm of nature they are removed from the realm of choice and ethical reflection. <u>Hence those in the superior categories need feel no responsibility toward those in the inferior categories.</u> It is simply a matter of recognizing reality. Those who are the objects of such definitions find themselves robbed of their humanity. They are defined by and confined to the present horizon of culture and their place in it, which seeks to rob them of their utopian capacity for theonomous self-transcending self-definition. <u>The cosmicization of social identities is inevitably legitimated by sacred narratives</u>, whether religious or secular-scientific (e.g., the Nazi biological myth of Aryan racial superiority), <u>which dehumanize not only the victims but also the victors.</u> For to create such a demonic social order the victors must deny not only the humanity of the other who is treated as totally alien but also their own humanity as well. That is, <u><span style="background: aqua;">to imprison the alien in his or her enforced subhuman identity</span></u> (an identity that attempts to deny the victim the possibility of self-transcendence) <u><span style="background: aqua;">the victor must imprison himself or herself in this same world </span>as it has been defined and deny his or her own self-transcendence as well.</u> The bureaucratic process that appears historically with the advent of urbanization increases the demonic potential of this process, especially the modern state bureaucracy organized around the use of the most efficient techniques to control every area of human activity<u><span style="background: aqua;">. The result is</span></u>, as Rubenstein reminds us, <u><span style="background: aqua;">the society of total domination in which</span> virtually <span style="background: aqua;">nothing is sacred, not even human life</span></u>.<br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This dimension of his analysis turns on the claim that the state’s immigration policies transformed the national border into an invisible mediator in the construction of the individual citizen’s differential form of cultural identity. More specifically, Behdad proposes that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the nation’s forgetfulness about the history of violence that the state had directed against immigrant populations was part of a pervasive form of historical amnesia</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. He includes </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the conquest of Native Americans, the exploitation of slaves, </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">and the annexations of French and Mexican territories</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> among the negated memories stored within this archive of forgetfulness. In Behdad’s view, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">s</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">uch <span style="background: aqua;">forgetfulness produced a sense of cultural innocence by repressing memories</span> of historic events while renewing a defensive form of patriotism</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Behdad proceeds to describe the state’s immigration policies as grounded in the ideology of Nativism. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nativism, the intense <strong>dislike of an internal minority</strong> on the basis of their foreignness, originated in the nineteenth century as a defensive nationalist movement </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">whose “Know-Nothing” members viewed America as a threatened utopia in need of an aggressive vigilante movement to protect it from alien invasion. This nationalist move ment has ordinarily been regarded by historians steeped in the myth of American exceptionalism as an aberration in the nation’s history of liberal tolerance. However, in Behdad’s contrapuntal reading of that history, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nativism played a crucial role in inciting the forgetfulness prerequisite to the state’s administering of a fully regulated cultural identity.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> According to Behdad, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">it was the <strong>myth of the nation’s hospitality</strong> to immigrants that <strong>performed the historical “negation” responsible for the disavowal of knowledge of Nativism</strong></span></u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The myth of Immigrant America was utterly incompatible with the fact that immigrants were forced to adhere to U.S. cultural norms and social values, and were routinely subjected to degrading practices of state surveillance. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">While the myth of Immigrant America shored up the national belief in U.S. liberal tolerance, government officials customarily invoked representations of the immigrant threat as warrant for the state’s xenophobic practices.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> These observations warranted Behdad’s allegation that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">Nativism did not contradict the myth of Immigrant America</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">; it codified the realities that the myth disavowed.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The incompatible stances conveyed by the nation’s xenophilic myth of political asylum and the state’s xenophobic immigration policies did not arise out of each other, nor did they transcend into a unity. At times, Behdad characterizes the relationship between these positions as an irresolvable antinomy that was governed by utterly incompatible regimes of knowledge and practice. But at other moments, he explains how </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the nation-state’s opposing attitudes of hostility and hospitality also <strong>reproduced and reinforced one another</strong></span></u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">U.S. citizens may <strong>not have been able to sustain their belief in the nation’s hospitality without the disavowal of the state’s hostility to immigrants</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But Behdad is also convinced that </span><strong><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the state’s hostility could not be continued without the cover story of national hospitality</span></u></strong><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Behdad uses the notion of equivocation as a way of accommodating the differences between competing notions of hospitality and hostility to the psychology of forgetfulness. According to Behdad, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">the genius of American democracy is</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> not that it has legitimated ambivalence but <span style="background: aqua;">that it has been able to manufacture a powerful form of cultural equivocation which can <strong>obscure differences by rhetorical practices that allow the citizenry to have it</strong></span> <strong><span style="background: aqua;">both ways</span>.</strong> The equivocation of the differences in the representation of America as an immigrant haven and anti-immigrant outpost is a function of what these opposing representations negate</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But the negation at the heart of a forgetful nation works by way of the equivocation of these antithetical representations. In functioning simultaneously as a populist national discourse and as a state practice, it was the ideology of Nativism that enabled these incompatible dimensions of the nation and the state to appear to reinforce one another’s provenance. Arthur Schlesinger famously invoked a cyclical model to explain historic shifts in the nation’s immigration policies. He attributed this vacillation in the orientation of U.S. immigration laws to the relative vitality of the nation’s economy, rendering those laws xenophobic when the nation-state was in an economic slump and hospitably inclined when labor was in short supply. Rather than corroborating it, Behdad describes this cyclical explanation as a symptom of the structure of forgetfulness inhabiting the national memory. Behdad observes that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">state officials routinely elaborated</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> these intractable antinomies of national <span style="background: aqua;">hospitality and state hostility into</span> equivocal <span style="background: aqua;">expressions of <strong>America’s superordinate hospitability</strong></span>.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> He further maintains that these equivocations were anchored to an intractably ambivalent national discourse that embraced both of these competing versions of national identification. And he concludes that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">what historians have called the “genius of American democracy” referenced the state’s capacity to manufacture a powerful form of cultural equivocation that included these contradictory attitudes of xenophilia and xenophobia</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Our organization was correct to appreciate the significance of these mobilizations and intervene whole-heartedly in them. However </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">we should not lose sight of the ways in which</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the bourgeois </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">politicians sought to control, manipulate and get political mileage out of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the spring 2006 </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">mobilizations</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Democratic Party hardly inititated the wave of protests. But </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">an array of often well financed, pro-democrat organizations <strong>quickly jumped all over the mass mobilization</strong></span></u><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">s</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and created the liberal “Somos America” coalition which welded together longstanding immigrant NGOs, democrats, and many union locals. Comrades will remember their slogan: “Today we march, tomorrow we vote,” </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">which was an attempt to <strong>channel the movement</strong> into electoral gains for Democrats</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And while a majority of working class protestors were and are clearly in favor of immediate legal status for all workers in the country, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">plenty of politicians and employers were content to try and use the mass mobilizations to <strong>put steam</strong> behind the guest worker legislation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Senator McCain’s quote in the Associated Press demonstrated this fairly clearly. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">McCain said that “turnouts in the hundreds of thousands -- particularly among Hispanics -- at recent rallies in Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington helped galvanize support for the bill</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” He was of course speaking of his McCain-Kennedy guest worker bill.

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">When, in our paper, we criticized the phantasma of “freely accessible identity positions,” it was directed at a concept of hybridity claiming to foreclose the identity with which it is coupled. In particular, we argued that radicalized identities are not essential; they are, rather, the modes of processing social contradictions. In order to reject any core essentialist conception of hybridity conceivable only as a potentized or mixed identity, we prioritized the “wager” through which one could access a “temporary departure” from identitarian interpellation. What we implied with the expression “temporary” deserves closer examination. “</span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">Hybrid” identities</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in large parts of the Western world, </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">are not only less problematic today than they were twenty</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, thirty, or forty <span style="background: aqua;">years ago</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(as only temporary sites of “political deployment,” which they remain to a lesser extent today); </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">they have </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">also <span style="background: aqua;">become a trademark of a reflexive modernity that has taken up the cause of its own heterogeneity and tolerance</span>—<span style="background: aqua;">and is</span> sometimes <strong><span style="background: aqua;">prepared to fight for it with bombs and threats</span></strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">This assumed discrepancy between a</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> liberal, <span style="background: aqua;">cosmopolitan, and capitalist modernity</span> on the one hand, <span style="background: aqua;">and a fundamentalist Other</span> that refuses intermixing on the other, <span style="background: aqua;">is</span> <strong>itself <span style="background: aqua;">a hegemonic gesture that must be rejected</span></strong></span></u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10pt;">Emancipatory language moves from Left to Right and back again, and finds its application in the governance of populations</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.

Numerous examples demonstrate that <span style="background: aqua;">the language of rights developed in Black, women’s, and migrants’ movements, and in the queer movement, have</span> now <strong><span style="background: aqua;">entered a right-wing, chauvinistic discourse and are used for the sealing of borders.</span></strong></span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This language has <span style="background: aqua;">developed into a military-imperial and anti-migration project</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For instance, <span style="background: aqua;">the discourse legitimizing the Iraq War articulated the need to bomb because of a lack of democracy</span>; in the case of Afghanistan, the lack of women’s rights, among other things, were used as justification. <span style="background: aqua;">Anti-racist discourses have begun to enter the policies of migration controls </span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(for instance, in the campaigns of the International Organization for Migration). </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Arguments against immigration to Europe are decorated with the pretention of tolerance for “cultural difference.” <span style="background: aqua;">Migrants</span> today <span style="background: aqua;">are </span><strong>no longer <span style="background: aqua;">attacked in the name of </span>unifying culture and nation, but rather of <span style="background: aqua;">emancipation and democracy</span></strong></span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong></span><br />

Yet at the same time, some 22,000 people have organised in networks to hide irregular migrants targeted by authorities for deportation.46 While a change of government in Australia in 2007 has seen some softening of the more brutal aspects of border policing (including the closure of offshore detention centres and the conversion of temporary protection visas to permanent status), asylum policy continues to be framed within a logic of deterrence.47 The largest detention centre for “unauthorised arrivals” remains “excised” from Australian territory. <u>In the US context, <strong><span style="background: aqua;">the militarisation of borders continues</span></strong></u> unabated<strong><u><span style="background: aqua;"> amidst a burgeoning social movement for migrant rights</span></u></strong><span style="background: aqua;">.</span> Everywhere, it seems, the fault lines of citizenship are very much unsettled. Under these conditions, it is unclear whether border policing can continue to act as a credible performance of territorial closure. For as long as the push and pull factors of irregular migration remain tied to global market forces, the contradictions of the neoliberal state will be brought into sharper relief. <u><span style="background: aqua;">Uncertainties generated by the simultaneous opening and closing of borders may well contribute to an intensified backlash and the <strong>worst forms of racialised violence.</strong></span> Yet they may also provide more progressive strategic possibilities.

[44] THOMA: In the conclusion of Mothers Without Citizenship, you point out that <u>under Homeland Security racial <span style="background: yellow;">profiling <strong>has shifted anti-immigration politics from exclusion to removal</strong></span></u><span style="background: yellow;">.</span> You also point out that <u>the &quot;foreign terrorist&quot; stereotype has replaced the &quot;reproducing immigrant woman&quot; stereotype in the post-9/11 era of antiterrorism politics</u>. While racial profiling has generated a certain amount of public controversy, the masculinist nature of anti-immigration political discourse seems to be less disturbing somehow. Women rarely appear in the discourse, except when racist paternalism is used to justify the war on terror through claims of supposedly &quot;saving&quot; Muslim women. [45] <u>I must admit to feeling some relief that women are no longer the targeted immigrant stereotype, <strong>but I <span style="background: yellow;">doubt I should be comforted at all</span></strong></u><strong><span style="background: yellow;">.</span></strong> What are we to make of the relative invisibility of women in discussion? <u><span style="background: yellow;">Does the &quot;disappearance&quot; of the immigrant woman from political discourse further enable her removal or her hyper-exclusion from citizenship</span></u><span style="background: yellow;">?</span> How is gender being used in current anti-immigration politics? You argue that a new citizenship politics in the U.S. must restore rights and belonging to all residents and re-assert the responsibility of the nation-state to treat all inhabitants fairly. To what extent is it necessary or useful to expose how contemporary discourse deploys gendered foreigner racialization and gendered citizenship? In this respect, where would you like to see feminist research focus its attention? [46] FUJIWARA: <u><span style="background: yellow;">While women immigrants <strong>may be less targeted in the political discourse</strong> </span>consumed with the &quot;terrorist immigrant,&quot; women immigrants are <span style="background: yellow;">not free from state intrusions, deportations, bodily violations, and the loss of human rights</span>.</u> I think you are quite right that the dominant masculinist construction has worked to invisibilize the gross abuses women immigrants face by state actors. I think the post-9/11 flurry of &quot;immigrant as terrorist&quot; was so racially profiled that it has invisibilized the gendered implications for both men and women who now reside with fewer and fewer legal protections. <u>We have heard of humiliating and violating detainment and bodily searches of non-citizen women in airport security centers, immigrant women detention centers that are inhumane and also do not recognize women's connection to their families</u>, many of which consist of citizen children, and the deportations of women immigrants who also fall under Homeland Security's newer forced removal mandates.<br />

<u>Michel <span style="background: yellow;">Foucault became a rock star of theory in the United States precisely because he demoted knowl­edge to a reflex of power</span>, merely the denominator of the couplet “power/knowledge,</u>” <u><span style="background: yellow;">yet his preoccupation was with the knowl­edge side, <strong>not actual social structures.</strong></span></u> His famous illustration of the power of “theory” was built on Jeremy Bentham’s design of an ideal prison, the Panopticon—a model never built.<span class="A21">3 </span>The “lin­guistic turn” in the social sciences turns out to be its own prison house, equipped with funhouse mirrors but no exit. When convenient, “theory” lays claim to objective truth, but in fact the chief criterion by which it ascended in status was aes­thetic, not empirical. <u>Flair matters more than explanatory power. At crucial junctures</u> <u><span style="background: yellow;">“theory” consists of flourishes, intellectual performance pieces: things are said to be so because the theorist says so,</span> and even if they are not, isn’t it interesting to pretend? But the problem with “theory” goes beyond opaque writing</u>—an often dazzling concoction of jargon, illogic, and preening. <u>If you overcome bedazzlement at the audacity and glamour of theory and penetrate the obscurity, you find circularity and self-justifica­tion</u>, often enough (and self-contradictorily) <u>larded with populist sentimentality about “the people” or “forces of resistance.”</u> <u><span style="background: yellow;">You see steadfast avoidance of tough questions</span></u>. Despite the selec­tive use of the still-prestigious rhetoric of science, <span style="background: yellow;">the world of “theory” makes only tangential contact with </span>the <span style="background: yellow;">social reality </span>that it disdains. Politically, it is useless. <u><span style="background: yellow;">It amounts to secession from the world where most people live.</span></u><span style="background: yellow;"> Yet the audacious adepts of “theory” </span>constitute themselves the equivalent of a vanguard party—laying out propositions to be admired for their audacity rather than their truth, defending themselves when necessary as victims of stodgy and parochial old-think<span style="background: yellow;">, <strong>priding themselves on their cosmopolitan majesty</strong>.</span> <u>“Theory” dresses critical thought in a language that, for all its im­penetrability, certifies that intellectuals are central and indispens­able to the ideological and political future. <span style="background: yellow;">The far right might be firmly in charge of Washington, but Foucault (and his rivals) rules the seminars</span>.</u> At a time of political rollback, intellectual flights feel like righteous and thrilling consolations.<br />

Moreover, the tension becomes more apparent when we find an opportunity, precisely in the case of migration, which itself embodies the contradiction: <u><span style="background: yellow;">we are dealing with the history of a non-unifiable subject</span>; and thus, more that of a movement</u>—the movement of migration<u>. <span style="background: yellow;">It is an opportunity that must first of all be recognized, </span>that subsumes and revitalizes the contradictions, <span style="background: yellow;">and can <strong>have the effect of countering the heroification and romanticization of migrants.</strong></span></u> In doing so, we bring closer the historical contingency of subjectivation within this process, and, therefore, the temporality of subjectivity. As a result of its location at the limits of social citizenship, <u>migration forms a movement in ways diametrically opposed to those of the classical workers’ movement</u>. The resources (of political subjectivity), we argued, are located in the collective forms by which people not only organize their lives and their everyday existences, but also attempt to hold their ground against exclusion and repression. The new underclass of migrant labor, for instance, transforms itself into a “toehold” for migration in a situation in which there are constraints on possibilities for immigration. A transformation is taking place today—particularly in those European countries that experienced intensive immigration since the Second World War—that is of particular importance to this. In conjunction with neoliberalism, the discourse around migration has led to an interlacing of the discourse of culture and the discourse around the social question: poverty and exclusion are, effectively, the product of cultural failure if individuals or entire groups are not able to subject themselves to the imperatives of education, disciplinarity, learning, and flexibility. This interface enables a quasi “rational” exclusion of underperformance or non-participation as unwillingness to perform, and allows for those belonging to the majority to identify as a collective of high performers. Thus, once one examines the integration and culture debate from the perspective of interlacing, and observes that this is not only contingent, but articulated and organized by social groups, then it becomes clear that <u><span style="background: yellow;">alternative approaches <strong>need to connect to a new social movement of migrants</strong>. </span>Such a movement must open a twofold possibility: firstly<span style="background: yellow;">, it must consider the social question anew, and in doing so problematize the economic and political conditions of democracy; secondly, it <strong>must make it equally possible for both migrants and non-migrants to transform and emancipate themselves</strong> from their current ascriptions and identities.</span></u><br />

Such <u>decisions will have to be based on political calculations of importance and possibility, but also on calculations about <strong>how best to mobilize people into the particular struggle and into a broader movement.</strong> Sometimes that will mean having to bear defeats in one place, in order to win a victory somewhere else</u>.<br />

<strong>The fractioning of Progressive power must end – any viable political strategy necessitates a movement beyond standpoint essentialism towards a redefinition of agency, not identity.</strong><br />

<br />
<u>The question</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><u>is whether a politics of identity can provide a sufficient ground to organize both opposition and alternatives to the contemporary conservative hegemony. <span style="background: yellow;">The Left </span>cannot ignore the issues of the differential structures of power that are inscribed upon the population, bur <strong>it <span style="background: yellow;">must refuse to begin by assuming that power can always be </span>adequately understood or <span style="background: yellow;">contested by simply acknowledging the suffering of the subordinate</span></strong></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It has to address the increasing segmentation of the various subordi¬nate groups. Groups which have been traditionally produced through and within a binary mechanism are increasingly deployed in complex and context-specific ways. The contemporary organiza¬tion of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may construct and enable particular structures of binary racism in one place, while fragmenting the binarism in another. It may refuse racism at particular sites, and at others, demand it. And it </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">may articulate <span style="background: yellow;">specific fractions of apparently subordinated groups</span> into real positions of power, or into positions in which <span style="background: yellow;">their &quot;real&quot; interests lead them into conservative positions within which they seem to embrace their subordination.</span></span> <u>Thus, <strong><span style="background: yellow;">it cannot be a simple question of Blacks or women </span>or differentially abled <span style="background: yellow;">organizing against </span>the <span style="background: yellow;">new conservatism</span></strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(since they are clearly not all in opposition), </span><u>but rather of constructing a movement which can strategically and effectively mobilize people against it</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It requires, in Deleuze and Guattari's terms, a politics of the minor. Oppositional struggle depends upon an analysis and identification of the agents and agencies, the historical forces (economic, cultural and political) which construct the configuration of everyday life, specific positions within it, and the relations between these and the larger social formation. The politics of identity is always a politics of resistance, operating at the local level, within the configurations of everyday life, since it refuses to transcend the specific identities and oppressions which are being contested. It allows only the extremes of political involvement: one can only act very locally or at very great distances. The Left, because it must allow any morally correct protest (and who is to decide except the victims), cannot strategically define its priorities. Too often, it trivializes itself in public struggles which focus on the most minor signs of subordinate identities, especially given the real problems facing not only minorities but also the world. </span><u>To develop a new conception of politics and alliance, <span style="background: yellow;">we must move beyond both essentialism and the assumption that identity is the major site of political struggle. </span>We have to define politics and the appropriate sites and forms of struggle by something other than the feelings of the oppressed.</u> <u><span style="background: yellow;">Racism,</span> for example, whether aimed at Blacks, Latinos, Jews, Arabs, Asians, or any other group, <span style="background: yellow;">is not merely a matter of the experience of the subordinate</span> although that experience—the pain and anger—is very real.</u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;"> But </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">it can only become a resource if it is articulated into a viable political strategy.</span> We need to confront all forms of racism, including the racisms of subordinate groups, in our society. And we need to confront as well the ways racism is deployed in specific hegemonic struggles. <span style="background: yellow;">This requires a politics of practice</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(e.g., a politics of antiracism) </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">built on agency rather than identity</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

<br />
Thus, rather than eviscerating the potentialities of left political activity, the decentering of class enables a multiplication and surplus of potentially transformative left political practices. For, not only are we able to recognize the radical character of transforming other-than-class aspects of social life, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;">we are also able to theorize the class dimensions of struggles over these ostensibly other-than-class issues</span></span><strong>.</strong> Marxists are thus able to highlight the class aspect of social life in new and compelling ways. For instance, Marxists may contribute to struggles over reproductive rights by showing the links between feminist concerns about gender subordination and the rights of women and Marxists' concerns with who does the work of childcare and under what conditions, or with who has access to reproductive technology and medical services and for what reasons. Or, in organizing to stop the spread of HIV, Marxists may highlight the class aspects of this crisis, emphasizing the links between joblessness and drug use or between the lack of economic development and prostitution, while also recognizing how the racialized, gendered, and sexualized aspects of the spread of HIV reinforce and help (re)produce these class aspects. &quot;The challenge for Marxists, then, is to develop the ways in which the loss of class as a universal or hegemonic project provides new areas of strength and vitality within Marxism, and opens new horizons for progressive political action.&quot;37 In general, <strong>by making &quot;class&quot; in any Marxian sense visible,</strong> <span class="underline">a project is constructed whose <span style="background: yellow;">political intentionality </span>is</span><strong>, in part, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;">to </span>&quot;</span>reveal&quot; and <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;">problematize exploitative class relations</span></span>.</strong> This is a subversive aspect of most Marxian traditions and this subversive aspect may be established in many different ways: via projects that pose class in hegemonic and universalizing terms, but also via projects that understand class in a local and contextual sense. Usually a particular ethical dimension is associated with this project whereby a Marxian class analysis is aimed at creating an understanding in which one of the &quot;rules&quot; of the discourse is that class exploitation is &quot;bad.&quot; Thus, in addition to theorizing or &quot;revealing&quot; the character of class relations, there is also often the more-or-less explicit project of eradicating class exploitation and of instituting communal forms of producing, appropriating, and distributing surplus labor. Yet, here we must confront a second major challenge presented by poststructuralist feminism, that of the construction of agency and subjectivity. For, <span class="underline">in recognizing the contextuality and openness of subjectivity, along with the partiality and discursive character of knowledge, <span style="background: yellow;">we face the challenge of emptying &quot;class&quot; of any a priori normative status in order to reconstruct a contextual postmodern class politics </span></span><strong><span style="background: yellow;">and/or ethics </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;">that does not have recourse to an extradiscursive &quot;standard</span>&quot;</span> by which to justify its political intentionalities, strategies, and projects.39</strong> In and of itself we cannot, therefore, conclude that class exploitation is &quot;bad.&quot; Rather, from a postmodern materialist perspective, political, social, and ethical intentionalities and projects depend upon the particular context within which we are situated. Therefore, <span class="underline">we must consider and theorize the constituent aspects of class processes in order to ground a class politics</span>. This perspective, therefore, does not mean that it is impossible to embrace a politics committed to furthering nonexploitative class processes or relations, but that <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow;">such a politics must be continually constructed and enabled, rather than presumed, imposed, or universalized.</span></span><br />

It is of course almost impossible to conclude. In any case I do not want to impose a false closure where we are just beginning to ask more and more challenging questions. From where I stand, feminist socio-legal scholarship faces two main tasks at the beginning of the 1990s. The first is to grasp the nettle that <u><span style="background: yellow;">law </span>is not simply law, by which I mean it<span style="background: yellow;"> is not a set of tools </span>or rules <span style="background: yellow;">which we can bend into a more favourable shape. Although we have known this for a long time, I am not sure we have done enough with this knowledge. The <strong>desire to be political has been confused with the desire to be practical</strong>, and thus law has continued to occupy a conceptual space in our thinking which encourages us to collude with the legalization of everyday life</span></u>. <br />

History illustrates that <u><span style="background: yellow;">law has <strong>generally acted to reinforce dominant gender, race and class patterns</strong>. In conjunction with other institutions of the state, it has aligned itself structurally with both capitalism and patriarchy, and played a key role in maintaining hegemony</span>, defined as &quot;the process(es) of generating the 'spontaneous consent' of the governed to the rule of a particular social group (class) through the development and promotion of ideologies that act as a social cement</u>.&quot;14 The documented struggles of working class people, people of colour and women throughout the 18th and 19th centuries illustrate the close connection between legal rule, in its administrative, civil, and criminal guises, and dominant classes, races and genders.15 Thus <u>the potential for using law to facilitate liberative struggle is real, but <strong><span style="background: yellow;">success is likely to be hard to come by</span></strong><span style="background: yellow;">—the struggle may </span><strong>fail</strong> or, worse, <strong><span style="background: yellow;">prove counterproductive over time.</span></strong></u><br />
<u><span style="background: yellow;">Feminist scholars have themselves pointed out the patriarchal nature of law in general, </span></u><u>the ways its form, language, and substance reflect and reinforce male or elite or racist views, <span style="background: yellow;">and have alluded to its <strong>tendency to boomerang against women</strong>.</span>21 Yet building strategies upon it is still the norm.</u>22<br />

Arendt provided some examples of how human rights could be defended by engaged-citizens, including Danish resistance to the Nazis in which ordinary citizens “asserted their dignity in the face of oppression and danger.” This example demonstrates how <u><span style="background: yellow;">the protection of rights is <strong>not derivative of state power</strong></span> but born from the actions of citizens who insist upon these rights and who are prepared to back up this insistence through political means.</u> Political theorist Jeffrey Isaacs explains that “such a politics runs against the principle of sovereignty is for Arendt one of its strengths…yet this can be viewed as the great virtue of <u>this kind of politics</u>—that it <u>challenges the status quo and calls attention to itself in ways which demand redress and incorporation. In other words, such forms of <strong>resistance invigorate formal politics</strong> and keep it true to the spirit of human dignity.

<br />
<u><span style="background: yellow;">The circulation of globalisation and neo-liberal discourses today is omnipresent, elevating their positions to ‘unquestionable truths’</span></u> and ‘immutable principles’ (Gallagher, 2005, p. 121). Despite their ability to reach hegemonic status around the world, this way of envisioning the world is by no means homogeneously applied across countries (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001, p. 20). These forces contribute less to a ‘monolithic, undifferentiated project’ (Tickell &amp; Peck, 2003, p. 2) than once thought, as their influences are politically negotiated and mediated locally. In this article, I explore this differentiation to illustrate how globalisation and neoliberalism influence policy in the Access to Professions and Trades area in Ontario, Canada. By exploring <u><span style="background: yellow;">the evolution from a ‘brain drain’ to a ‘skills shortage’ discourse,</span></u> I investigate how circulating discourses, as the historical, political and cultural context of policy production<span style="background: yellow;">, <u>shape policy processes</u></span><u>.</u> Building on Joshee and Johnson’s (2005) policy web, Ball’s (1998) notion of policy as discourse and Gale’s (1999) intertextuality, this article offers a new metaphor for policy analysis that conceives of policy as a discursive web. <u>The concept of <span style="background: aqua;">a <strong>discursive policy web</strong> facilitates a <strong>more fulsome understanding of policy processes</strong> by highlighting the way multiple discourses interact </span>a complex network of power. <span style="background: aqua;">Conceiving of policy as a discursive web can help us understand <strong>processes of resistance and contestation</strong></span> <strong>to globalisation and neo-liberalism by understanding how they are mediated by complex institutional and ideational forces</strong>.</u> My study also builds on Ozga’s (2005) examination of how ‘“travelling” policies are mediated by the “embedded” practices and cultures of different systems to produce particular “local” versions of policy’ (Ozga, 2005, p. 207). It begins to answer Hay and Rosamond’s (2001) call ‘for the need to consider the complex institutional and ideational mediations by which external economic imperatives are translated into domestic political and economic dynamics’ (p. 20). Globalisation and neo-liberalism Globalisation and neo-liberalism are widely used and highly contested concepts. They are often elided and entangled both historically and analytically (Tickell &amp; Peck, 2003). Tickell and Peck (2003) attempt to make sense of the confusion by understanding globalisation as a discourse or economic narrative and neo-liberalism as a political project or political script often referred to as ‘a utopian political ideology’ (Tickell &amp; Peck, 2003, p. 4). ‘According to Bourdieu, neo-liberalism is a political project for the reconstruction of society in accord with the demands of an unrestrained global capitalism’ (Fairclough, 2000, p. 147). As such, globalisation is typically linked with a neo-liberal economic logic that is used to justify a market-driven mentality. These <u><span style="background: yellow;">market conforming arguments call for deregulation or unrestrained neo-liberal policies couching everything in <strong>economic terms and competition</strong></span><strong>.</strong></u> Traditionally, globalisation has been studied as a material process and practice (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001). <u>New ways of <span style="background: yellow;">viewing globalisation as a discourse</span>, however, <span style="background: yellow;">can help further our understanding of how discourses of globalisation socially construct what is possible</span></u> (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001). I build on Hay and Rosamond’s (2001) view of globalisation as a discourse and examine how <u><span style="background: yellow;">globalisation discourses inform policy processes. The logic of neo-liberalism used to promote globalisation advances a view of the world that is certain and unquestionable, <strong>constructing a truth under which we are forced to operate</strong></span>. This logic is proposed as a common-sense view shared by all countries around the world. In this way, <span style="background: yellow;">neoliberalism has been <strong>uncritically</strong> adopted as inevitable</span>,</u> raising it to a level where TINA: ‘there is no alternative’ (Olssen, 2004). Presenting globalisation as a discourse recognises that it is a social construction, there is an alternative, it is not ‘an inexorable and fatalistic economic “logic of no alternative’’’ (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001, p. 5). One implication of this position is that we can develop counter-discourses as forms of resistance. My aim in recognising discourses as operating in a web is to provide a means for being more successful in this endeavour. This article attempts to contribute a more complete understanding of the policy process by highlighting how <span style="background: yellow;">p<u>olicies exist in complex discursive relationships: a discursive web.</u></span> I show how <u>the broad national and international discourses of globalisation and neo-liberalism set the discursive context of this interaction</u>. Similarities in contexts and policies across countries along with more recent examples of policy divergence warrant an examination of how local contexts mediate global factors. Studies of policy divergence highlight the important contribution of historical, cultural and discursive contexts to the policy process. Ball (1998) also indicates that <u><span style="background: yellow;">international, national and cultural discursive contexts influence how policy is received and interpreted at the local level</span>.</u> Globalisation and education policy Given the widespread nature of globalisation discourses, numerous studies have risen up to examine the normalisation of a market discourse across all realms of life (Chouliaraki &amp; Fairclough, 1999; Chiapello &amp; Fairclough, 2002). In education research specifically, these studies critique neo-liberalism highlighting its negative consequences for education (Olssen, 2004; Dale &amp; Robertson, 2005), higher education (Davies, 2005; Giroux, 2005) or the teaching profession specifically (Codd, 2005; Ozga, 2005). While these education studies have implications for policies, ‘policy is generally not their focal point’ (Johnson &amp; Joshee, in press, p. 4). <u><span style="background: aqua;">The few educational policy studies that do exist generally have taken <strong>a narrow view of policy</strong> </span><strong>as an outcome or a text <span style="background: aqua;">and endorse a state-centred </span>or linear <span style="background: aqua;">approach</span> to policy, <span style="background: aqua;">failing to account for the way policies are embedded in </span>local, historical, cultural and <span style="background: aqua;">political contexts that influence how they are taken up.</span></strong> This perspective has also been dominant in studies of</u> education policy and <u>globalisation</u> specifically (c.f. Sassen, 1996; Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001; Kamat et al., 2004; Olssen, 2004). While <u>these studies</u> are valuable, in most cases they f<u>ail to account for the way <strong>multiple players participate in the policy process and the way policies interact with other policies in a complex network of relationships</strong>.</u> According to Joshee (2005), <u>policies must be read within the context of the full range of policies addressing a problem, since ‘<span style="background: aqua;">most policies <strong>cannot get results at all save through such a web</strong></span></u><strong><span style="background: aqua;">’</span></strong> (Oquist, 2004, as cited in Joshee, 2005, p. 1). My approach is consistent with Joshee’s in that it recognises that <u>policy discourses must be understood in relation to other existing discourses since they interact with each other to have policy influences.</u><br />

<strong>State isn’t key</strong><br />

<strong><u>Pease 8</u></strong> [Donald, Avalon Foundation Professor of English at Dartmouth College, <em>boundary</em> 2 35:1, Spring] <br />
According to Behdad, <u>the <span style="background: aqua;">state’s immigration laws are <strong>not reducible to a juridico-political phenomenon</strong></span>. <span style="background: aqua;">They work on a micromechanical level as a set of concrete disciplinary measures</span> and procedures through which the state aspires <span style="background: aqua;">to maintain social order</span> and security through surveillance of the immigrant population. The aim of these laws is <span style="background: aqua;">to enable white citizens to sustain their political hegemony by regulating and controlling the everyday activities of various racialized groups as well as new immigrants</span>.</u> In Behdad’s view, the nation’s governance is shaped by the proliferation of these techniques of population management rather than the general principles of equality and liberty. <u>National governmentality is a <strong>dispersed form of authority</strong> that is effected through a disciplinary web comprised of micromechanical regulatory techniques</u>. <u><span style="background: aqua;">The dissemination of governmental power in this disciplinary network renders it more effective since its pluralized application is all encompassing and less visible because it tactically implicates those it governs as voluntary agents of governmental power</span></u>. The immigrant provides the differential other whose threatening presence facilitates the deployment of the state’s disciplinary apparatuses and surveillance. <u>The implementation of immigration policies at the site of this threat affirms the political sovereignty of the state, but it also supplies a model of cultural identification for the nation. <span style="background: aqua;">The image of the danger posed by immigrant</span>s there <span style="background: aqua;">enables the state to represent the border as involved in a permanent state of siege</span>. The state’s management of the perpetual crisis at the border stimulates a mobile and productive relation between consent and coercion <span style="background: aqua;">through which it rationalizes </span>the disciplinary powers that facilitate <span style="background: aqua;">a normalized sense of national identity</span>.</u> The perceived loss of border control precipitates a crisis in the national imaginary that widens the gap between the citizen who determines who can enter the “imagined community” and the alien who threatens to enter it illegally.

<u><span style="background: aqua;">Trafficking has been </span>nationally and internationally<span style="background: aqua;"> defined through the <strong>use of ethnocentric language and western assumptions.</strong> Scholars use &quot;trafficking&quot; interchangeably with</span> diverse concepts, such as: <span style="background: aqua;">illegal immigration</span>, modern <span style="background: aqua;">slavery, prostitution, and the sexual exploitation of women</span>. Trafficking <span style="background: aqua;">definitions</span> often <span style="background: aqua;">fail to distinguish </span>clearly <span style="background: aqua;">between trafficking and voluntary consensual migration</span>, often <strong><span style="background: aqua;">combining women's migratory movement with trafficking</span></strong></u> (Kapur, 2005). Furthermore, Piper (2005) asserts that trafficking has to be seen as part of the reality of migration patterns, mainly undocumented flows. Taking into account economic globalization, O'Neill (2001, p. 156) presents trafficking as &quot;the total commoditization of human beings traded across borders, as is the case with any other good.&quot; Definitions of trafficking are highly contested among scholars, National Government Organizations (NGOs), feminists, and governments, thus posing challenges in conducting research studies, reporting statistics and making generalizations. Historical Fears of Sexuality and Migration The issue of trafficking came up within the international human rights discourse and took on a moral framework. The document that set the standard for the United Nations (UN) to continue further resolutions on trafficking and prostitution was the 1949 UN Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and Exploitation of Prostitution of Others (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003), the first international instrument that dealt with trafficking as forced prostitution. Even though this was not ratified by all countries, it still served as a model for future legislation (Doezema, 2002a). The 1949 UN Convention represented an abolitionist notion of prostitution as exploitation and as being &quot;incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person&quot; (Ditmore &amp; Wijers, 2003; Saunders, 2005). <u>Historical patterns in the levels of public concern in the U.S. over the trafficking of women and children are linked to periods of increased immigration</u> (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003). The historical discourse on immigration and its links to trafficking is emphasized by Pattanaik (2002, p. 218) who states that <u>&quot;the term which was used to describe the ensuing abuses in the process of migration was 'trafficking.'&quot; The <span style="background: aqua;">U.S. immigration policies </span>in the <strong>past <span style="background: aqua;">are known for their racist, discriminatory, and exclusionary stances, out of fear for the &quot;other,</span></strong><span style="background: aqua;">&quot; </span>the unwelcome foreigner.</u> Racism, as it relates to sex trafficking, is raised as an issue for analysis by various feminists who critique the dominant sex trafficking framework. <u><span style="background: aqua;">In response to the fear of 'white slavery,' Congress passed the White Slave Traffic Act</span> in 1910,</u> also known as the Mann Act. This act prohibited unmarried women from crossing state lines for immoral purposes and it criminalized interracial couples (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003, pp. 3-18). Under the Mann Act, in 1914 more than 70% of the convictions of women were related to the voluntarily transportation of women for prostitution or other immoral purposes (Saunders, 2005). <u><span style="background: aqua;">Racist immigration laws </span>passed in the 1920s, Immigration Act of 1924 and the Temporary Quota Act of 1921, <span style="background: aqua;">led to strengthening U.S. borders and the restriction of migrants</span></u> from Eastern and Southern Europe and Asia. The period afterward did not see trafficking on the U.S. and international agenda to such an extent or urgency as it was seen to resurface again in the 1990s (Saunders &amp; Soderlund, 2003). Doezema (1998, p. 44) describes how the 19th century sex slave was &quot;a white woman, victim of the animal lusts of the dark races&quot; and in the 21st century, the racism changed its focus to exaggerate the new sex slaves as &quot;passive, un-emancipated women from the developing world.&quot; In the 1800s Chinese women and other women of color were viewed as overly sexual, deviant and promiscuous, as were Mexican women at the turn of the century. It was at this time that migration was on the rise so the government felt the need to create a moral fear and panic over &quot;the other.' <u><span style="background: aqua;">A historical context</span> of socio-political, religious, and economic perspectives in the U.S. <span style="background: aqua;">situates the current U.S. policy within a racist, heterosexist, hegemonic framework that <strong>harms women through so-called 'protection'</strong> and continues to colonize</span></u>. The different feminist perspectives of prostitution throughout history have also influenced policy and public ideas about trafficking and the need to 'protect victims.'<br />

<span class="underline">Krishna, however, judges the critical value of these texts by the extent to which they are “politically enabeling.” I wish he would define just what is—and what is the seemingly unquestionable value of---a “politically enabeling” text. <span style="background: aqua;">Krishna is all for subjectivity, yet it seems to be one devoid of agency</span>; <span style="background: aqua;">according to the logic of his argument, it is up to some other to enable the subject to act. This leads to the logic of victimhood</span></span>—<span class="underline"><span style="background: aqua;">a self-marginalization and self-ghettoization that only augments hegemonic power</span></span>. Power comes from the taking of it, not by others bestowing it. While this view claims a more circumscribed, and I believe more accurate, social role for intellectuals, it does not release them from an ethical responsibility. It just grants them more credibility than Krishna’s injunctions would. Ever eloquent, Cornel West said it best in a television interview: <span class="underline"><span style="background: aqua;">I understand the vocation of the intellectual as trying to turn easy answers into critical questions</span>, and <span style="background: aqua;">asking these critical questions to those with power</span>. Just as <span style="background: aqua;">troubling</span>—and symptomatic of a conceit in operation—<span style="background: aqua;">is how Krishna through selective quotation </span>and guilt by association <span style="background: aqua;">aligns aspects of postmodernist international theory with</span>, in his words, the <span style="background: aqua;">orientalism</span> and <span style="background: aqua;">racism </span>of Baudrillard<span style="background: aqua;">, the politics of forgetting </span>the Third World by Lyotard, <span style="background: aqua;">the neglect of imperialism </span>by Foucault. “Consider Baudrillard,” says Krishna, before he trashes him (or to maintain a slippery distinction, trashes his remarks) as “Orientalist” and “racist.” But does he not really desire to condemn or to deter those who have or might be inclined to read more than a quote or secondary account of Baudrillard? If not, is that not the effect? I must ask, because <span style="background: aqua;">Krishna’s call for </span></span>a subjectivity<span class="underline"> of “<span style="background: aqua;">strategic essentialism</span>” <span style="background: aqua;">meshes all-too-smoothly with those who would ask us to “consider Heidegger” or “consider De Man” only to reduce them to a single, damnable but wholly insufficient identity devoid of intellectual worth</span>. <span style="background: aqua;">These</span> tactics make <span style="background: aqua;">double dubious Krishna’s charge of postmodernism’s disasterous politics pitting groups that have the most in common</span> (<span style="background: aqua;">and the need to unite </span>on some basis to be effective) <span style="background: aqua;">against each other</span>” As evidence he cites Chaloupka’s criticism of the Nuclear Freeze movement and my criticism of the anti-war tactics of the Left during the Gulf War. Chaloupka can speak for himself, but I will take the collective offense at <span style="background: aqua;">the charge that we are engaged in blackmail because we offer only a choice “between total critique and ineffective partial critique.</span>” In my case, Krishna <span style="background: aqua;">bases</span> his claim <span style="background: aqua;">on a quotation </span>from the last chapter of Antidiplomacy, “cyberwar, videogames and the Gulf War Syndrome.” <span style="background: aqua;">Krishna reduces and</span> through reduction <span style="background: aqua;">distorts</span> the political message conveyed by the quote. He first does this <span style="background: aqua;">by removing the context </span>that appears in the chapter. My comments were in reaction to salvoes fired first by Todd Gitlin and then others at workshops and conferences who seemed to be more inclined to relive the successes of the last anti-war movement (Vietnam) than understand the failures of this one. <span style="background: aqua;">Krishna’s second reduction takes place in the quote itself; An alternative, late-modern tactic against total war was to war on totality itself, to deligitimize <em>all</em></span></span> sovereign truths based on class, nationalist or internationalist metanarratives…better strategically to play with apt critiques of the powerful new forces unleashed by cyberwar than to hold positions with antiquated tactics and nostalgic unities. What has been displaced by the blank space? Only an endorsement of the kind of activism that Krishna finds postmodernism disinterested in or incapable of (he vacillates on this) Let me once again put my cards on the table: this is the strategy of this chapter; as it was for the presentation that I made at teach-ins and conferences on the war. Contrary to the claims of some of the New Left, I found neither quietism nor conservatism but activism and imaginative criticism coming from deconstructionist, feminist, literary, and cultural critics with a bad (po-mo) attitude who organized and participated in anti-war events. To be sure, the attitude comes with a highly advertised side-effect: there is no absolute guarantee that a new pragmatic basis for justice and truth—rather than an infinite regress of language-games and textual free-play—will result from political encounters.

<br />
<u><span style="background: yellow;">Trafficking</span></u> in persons <u><span style="background: yellow;">presents a unique challenge to police due largely to the</span></u> complexity of trafficking cases and the <u><span style="background: yellow;">intense political pressure to <strong>secure convictions as an indicator of the success of national efforts</strong> to address trafficking</span>.</u> Following the identification of potential victims of trafficking, the formal apparatus of the criminal justice system is activated whereby police are responsible for undertaking investigations in order to determine whether there is a case, and then to decide which cases will be recommended for prosecution and which will be aban­doned. At this point in the progress of trafficking cases there are two processes operating concurrently: <u>the criminal justice investigation and the welfare process involving the provision of support to potential victims</u>. As this chapter will demonstrate, these two aspects of the policy response <u>are essentially two sides of the same coin: they are intimately connected and both are conducted primarily to enable and enhance the number of cases moving from investigation to prosecution.</u> For the purposes of exploring each aspect of this policy process, we examine each in turn. Therefore, this chapter is focused on the identification process in terms of its design and implementation as stipulated by authorities, and on the accounts offered by both those working outside the official processes and those subject to these processes, migrant women and victims of trafficking. <u>The investigation process determines whether women will be offered/granted the status of victim within the criminal justice system</u>. This chapter outlines the investigation process, focusing in particular on why and how the investigation of cases is undertaken and on the ways in which victims of trafficking are engaged in and impacted by this process. Here we attend to the processes involved in identifying legal victims of trafficking by police officers in Australia, Thailand and Serbia. We argue that <span style="background: yellow;">the <u>process of determining whether there is sufficient evidence for a case to proceed is a decision informed not only by the 'facts' of the case. Rather it is influenced by the extent to which the victim meets the expectations and understandings of victimisation held by the gatekeepers</u></span><u>.</u><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u><span style="background: yellow;">The desire to locate victims is <strong>clearly connected to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the necessity of producing numbers</span></strong> - a necessity' <strong>driven by</strong> administrative, political, financial and <strong>diplomatic concerns</strong></span></u><span style="background: yellow;">.</span> Importantly, <strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">this need for 'numbers' as tangible evidence of anti-trafficking efforts</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: yellow;"> operates at every level</span></u>, from the international arena to local, state and non-state actors seeking internal and external funding. These factors have important consequences for the resources and efforts dedicated towards finding victims of trafficking. In this first stage of intervention, <u>the process</u> in Serbia, Thailand and Australia, and in many other nations, <u>involves identifying potential victims and then allowing a specific period</u> (for example, 30 days in Australia) <u>for police to investigate the case further</u> during the second stage of the filtering process, during which time victims of trafficking are able to access specified welfare-oriented support services. This allows state actors to err on the side of caution when determining whether an individual is a potential victim of trafficking. For the state, particularly in the case of nations such as Australia that have rigorous border-control mechanisms, this process is precarious as there is a possibility of misidentifying non-victims in this first intervention stage who may in fact be illegal non-citizens or illegal sex workers. However, through the creation of a two-stage filtering process a number of priorities are achieved. First, <u><span style="background: yellow;">the process of rescuing and identifying potential victims can be undertaken <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">according to the rhetoric of benevolence</span> and protecting victims' rights. Yet, while this appears to be a generous gesture, it is in fact a highly controlled process</span> that allows further and more thorough investigation beyond the immediacy of the initial interview</u> - a process explored in later chapters. The bottom line is that <u><span style="background: yellow;">victims of trafficking, in providing</span></u><span style="background: yellow;"> evidence and <u>witness testimony</u>, are <strong>essential to <u>build</u>ing <u>a criminal case</u></strong>,</span> such that maximising the number of potential victims and witnesses in this first stage of identification is critical to increasing the number of cases successfully pursued through the criminal justice system: ... the victim is central to everything and we recognise this.

<strong>Even if they get rid of the requirement to testify in terms of getting a visa, their plan text still says “reasonable” cooperation which will always be redefined by the state according to its interests.

The use of the word 'barbaric' serves to construct the idea of the uncivilized, dark-skinned trafficker abroad who manipulates innocent women into sex trafficking. A definition of sex trafficking, as defined by the U.S., can be found in the annual &quot;Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000: Trafficking in Persons Report&quot; issued by the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. definition of &quot;severe forms of trafficking in persons&quot; is as follows: (a) sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age; or (b) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud or coercion for the purposes of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery (U.S. Department of State, 2002). Although not identical in their wording, the unifying elements of both the TVPA and the UN Protocol definitions of trafficking involve the illegal transportation and the sexual slavery of persons by threat or use of force or coercion</span>. <u>The distinction being made between 'voluntary versus forced' creates a dichotomous framework from which to look at trafficking that is limiting and simplistic.</u> For instance, <u>a woman may knowing agree to work in the sex industry, thus being defined as 'voluntary', but she may not know the extreme abuse she may be faced with, that may include 'forced' acts under abusive working conditions</u>. <u>Binary oppositions perpetuate silent biases and assumptions, without looking at the complexity of the issue</u>. Mohanty (1991, p. 64) asserts that <u>dualities are ineffective when &quot;designing strategies to combat oppressions</u>.&quot; <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Only 'severe forms&quot; of trafficking cause the enforcement provisions of the TVPA to be implemented, with &quot;victims&quot; bearing the burden of proof that they were coerced.

<br />
A security state is what every state would have to be if Hobbes were right that human relations are always on the verge of disorder and violence, if only an authoritarian government that brooks no division of power or dissent can keep the peace, and if maintaining peace and security is unambiguously the highest value. Democratic theory and practice, however, question each of these Hobbesian assumptions. Democrats agree that a major purpose of government is to keep peace and promote public safety, but we deny that unquestioning obedience to a unified sovereign is the only means to achieve this, and <u>we question whether values of freedom and autonomy must be traded against the value of security</u>. In a nonideal world of would-be aggressors and states having imperfect procedural justice, transparency, accountability, and lax rights enforcement, every state exhibits features of a security state to some extent. It seems to me, however, that, in recent months, <u>the United States has slipped</u> too far <u>down the authoritarian continuum. <span style="background: lime;">The logic of masculinist protection</span></u>, I suggest, <u><span style="background: lime;">provides a framework for understanding how</span> government <span style="background: lime;">leaders</span></u> who <u>expand arbitrary power and <span style="background: lime;">restrict democratic freedom</span></u> believe that they are doing the right thing and why citizens accept their actions. <u><span style="background: lime;">It</span></u> also <u><span style="background: lime;">helps explain this</span> state’s righteous <span style="background: lime;">rationale for aggressive war</span>.</u> A marauding gang of outsiders attacked buildings in New York and Washington with living bombs, killing thousands in barely an instant and terrifying large numbers of people in the country. Our government responded with a security alert, at home and abroad. Many were frightened, and the heads of state stepped up to offer us protection. Less than a week after the attacks, the Bush administration announced the creation of an Office of Homeland Security to centralize its protection efforts. “Our nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans” (George W. Bush speech, September 14, 2001 [quoted in Roth 2001]). The events of <u><span style="background: lime;">September 11</span></u>, 2001, <u><span style="background: lime;">are certainly a turning point for U.S. politics, for the relation of the government to its citizens and to the rest of the world</span></u>. Americans learned that “oceans no longer matter when it comes to making us safe” (Bush 2002a), that we are just as vulnerable as persons elsewhere who have long lived with the awareness that some people have the motive and means to kill and wound randomly. More than a year later, it appears that little has changed, either in the fear that some Americans say they have of another attack or in the material ability of law enforcement to predict or prevent one (Firestone 2002). Much has changed in the letter and application of the law in the United States, however, and in the environment of democracy. The <u><span style="background: lime;">Bush</span></u> administration has <u>repeatedly <span style="background: lime;">appealed to the primacy of its role as protector</span> of innocent citizens <span style="background: lime;">and liberator of women</span></u> and children <u><span style="background: yellow;">to justify consolidating and centralizing executive power at home and dominative war abroad</span></u><span style="background: yellow;">.</span><br />

As discussed further below, the <u>incarceration</u> <u>and deportation of the former and</u> the <u><span style="background: yellow;">prosecution</span> of the latter <span style="background: yellow;">become the most appropriate actions</span> the receiving country can take</u>, <strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">allowing it to reassert authority over the border and quell fears about immigrants and terrorists</span></u></strong><span style="background: yellow;">.</span> But women removed from the site of their transgression via incarceration and deportation are delinked from the position of agent, in which they would be able to testify against the actual criminals and act in the interest of the state.

This is because <u><span style="background: yellow;">criminalization has led to ‘‘increasingly restrictive immigration laws’’</span> that position trafficked women ‘‘as undesirable aliens’’, placing all women who seek to move in a</u> broadly <u>dubious position</u> (Wijers, 1998). In order to detect human trafficking, for example, <u>states have instituted stricter surveillance of international borders</u>, women travellers, the sex industry, foreign students and women on the move in general. European (and US) national anti-trafficking policy is most often under the jurisdiction of the police and organized crime units. As discussed below, <strong><u>states have created stricter restrictions on</u></strong> migrants’ passports, <strong><u>visas</u></strong>, and permits, <strong><u>endorsing incarceration ⁄ deportation of any ‘‘irregular’’ migrant, including those persons who may have been trafficked but do not wish to comply with</u></strong> (or fear) <strong><u>prosecutors’ requirements of cooperation</u></strong>. <u><span style="background: yellow;">Criminalization has</span></u>, in effect, reduced the complex circumstances that surround trafficking and other forms of gendered migration to instances of criminality. And this approach has <u><span style="background: yellow;">provided states with an occasion to implement stringent anti-immigrant procedures</span> to quell public panic about, and effect increased control over</u>, seemingly porous <u>borders in the name of citizen protections, fragile sovereignty and allegedly ‘‘imminent’’ security threats</u>. Any actual assistance to trafficked persons remains secondary or is assumed to occur through arresting traffickers. <u>Comprehensive assistance programmes</u> <u>to</u> actual <u>victims remain</u> either <u>optional for states to implement</u> (as in the UN protocol) <u>or conditional upon victims’ cooperation with authorities</u> (as in TVPA).11 Since the demand for workers in industrial sites continues unabated, however, <u><span style="background: yellow;">criminalization</span></u> itself may actually <u><span style="background: yellow;">contribute to the growth of human trafficking</span></u>. This is <span style="background: yellow;">because </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">anti-crime policies and severe immigration restrictions force women who wish to move to seek</span></u> <span style="background: yellow;">smugglers’</span> (who may turn out to be <u>traffickers)</u> <u>assistance to do so</u>.12 Thus, rather than hindering traffickers, heightened immigration restrictions and security measures have increased women’s reliance on them (Ward, 2004). <u><span style="background: yellow;">This</span></u><span style="background: yellow;"> in turn </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">drives trafficking further underground and increases the dangers faced by those who would seek to migrate</span>.</u><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In this process of selection these decisions may be informed by the victim herself and her ability to perform as a convincing and credible witness</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The above articulation of the decision-making process reflects the ability of legal actors to deflect the complexity of the issues at hand to draw upon a dualistic understanding of trafficked women as witness/not witness and victim/offender. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">During this stage of determining</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who may be a potential witness and </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">which cases should be pursued, <span style="background: yellow;">decisions are informed not only by the legal articulation of trafficking in persons but by <strong>gendered and racialised expectations</strong> and assumptions about 'who' can be seen as a victim of trafficking</span>, the circumstances of trafficking in which they are found and an ongoing assessment of their behaviour after the rescue. All of these factors impact on the extent to which individual women will meet the requirements of the legal process. Witnesses are required to 'perform' in a certain way, at different times and for different audiences. As cases progress through the criminal justice system, there is a specific performance that decision makers are seeking. The reliance on notions of the 'ideal' victim</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Christie 1986) </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">resurfaced</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in these interviews, as </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">a number of participants highlighted that stereotypes around 'ideal' victims inform decisions regarding potential witnesses</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: <span style="background: yellow;">[</span></span><u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 10pt;">Even] under international law, [you need the] most traumatised, most victimised, [victims] <strong>must fit [the] myth of the familiar</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. (Peter, UN agency advisor, regional Thailand) The society and the criminal justice system intersect: judges, prosecutors, and police officers are members of the society, thus stereotypes from the general public reflect in the criminal justice system. (Filip, law enforcement officer, Belgrade, Serbia) The interviews demonstrated that </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">application of gendered and racialised discretionary practices are not restricted</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">to the first stage of the identification process as discussed in Chapter 2, where state and non-state actors decide where to target their anti-trafficking efforts, who to rescue and who may be a potential victim. In determining who can be a potential witness for a case to be recommended for prosecution, assumptions about the differences between sex workers, trafficking victims and illegal non-citizens resurfaced in this study. For instance, as one Serbian participant highlighted, women's status as (in some cases illegal) sex workers can automatically undermine their potential credibil­ity in a court of law as a witness because they simultaneously occupy the status of offender: Prostitution is a misdemeanour and thus a woman who is forced to be a prostitute is less likely to be recognised as a victim because she is breaking the law. (Snezana, NGO, Belgrade, Serbia) It was common for the stories of the trafficked women we interviewed and the second-hand stories we were told by those working with trafficked women to reflect the complexity highlighted by the above quote</span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 10pt;">As sex workers, as illegal non-citizens or as migrants working in breach of visa conditions, there were very few stories of victimisation that fitted neatly within the 'ideal' mythical narrative of sexual slavery</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. For some crime types this would translate into very few cases progressing to the prosecution stage. Indeed, it was noted that narrow legal definitions and the broader implications of prejudice and stereotyping <span class="underline">do result in 'real' trafficking cases being 'screened out</span>' during the investigative process. </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">For police officers in all three nations one of the most significant challenges in their work was posed by this distinction between potential victim and witness. For a few of the police officers, it was clearly recognised that while they may sympathise with victims whose stories are of little use, </span><u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 10pt;">the police must remain focused on identifying credible, reliable witnesses whose cases fit within the legal narrative, even when these narratives demand victims' adherence to recognised stereotypes</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As one participant explained: To find them [victimsl is a problem and then to be able to capture what is happening in a format that is understandable to other people ... and is admissible to court ... that is the biggest challenge of our work and of course it's the challenge to the police as well.</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[*1427] Consequently, in the tumultuous decades since the 1970s and 80s, much of the impetus for the dismantlement of antidiscrimination legislation and precedent has come from the highest levels of the federal bench. Over time, this backlash campaign of redirection has generated an environment of obsessive attention to the roles, powers and actions of federal judicial appointees, which both informs mainstream public discourses and increasingly pervades legal culture. 46 Indeed, </span><u>&quot;constitutional theory</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [*1428] in the past several decades </span><u>has been obsessed with the question of how to constrain judges exercise of will.&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 47 From a backlash perspective, </span><u>the focus of the obsession is on constraining perceived or actual exercises of judicial power - whether willful or not - that may further the &quot;liberal&quot; social changes associated with New Deal</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and/or Civil Rights lawmaking, and accompanied with very little attention to exercises of will that accomplish their retrenchment. 48 But </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">backlashers' ab/use of the federal judicial power to de-legitimize social justice claims - in particular those grounded in New Deal and Civil Rights sources of law and policy - and the obsessive attention they have drawn to the notion of &quot;judicial legislation&quot;</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in turn </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">have drawn</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> increasingly sharp critiques of backlash jurisprudence, including serious questions about </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">a new wave of &quot;judicial activism&quot;</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the construction </span><u>of social and legal retrenchment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - a new wave that in conceptual, doctrinal and political terms </span><u>harkens back to tense times in the history of American law</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 49 Those times go back to the very origins - and eventual establishment in the late 1930s despite &quot;activist&quot; judicial opposition - of </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">the &quot;liberal&quot; legacy that backlashers strive now to roll back</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 50 </span><u>That confrontation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [*1429] </span><u>severely discredited the Court institutionally</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> before it finally allowed the New Deal to be legislated, after several landslide elections, thus </span><u>clearing the stage for</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the succeeding &quot;liberal&quot; era of executive and legislative social programs </span><u>that backlash jurisprudence currently strives to dismantle through the culture wars</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 51 Since 1937's &quot;switch in time,&quot; </span><u>that multi-year effort of willful judges in control of the Supreme Court's judicial review power to thwart state and federal New Deal initiatives in the name of the Constitution has become widely recognized as the paradigmatic example of &quot;judicial activism&quot; <span style="background: yellow;">and unprincipled constitutional adjudication</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - an example definitively disavowed by successive judges since then 52 but </span><u>that &quot;hovers like a spectre to be continually banished.&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 53 Nonetheless, </span><u>backlash jurisprudence</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> today </span><u>seems determined to engineer by law a resurrection of the pre-1937 ideology</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> advocated by those activist judges - at least in effect, if not by design. Not coincidentally, for example, the 1930s </span><u>activists had valorized the same kinds of federalism claims based on &quot;states' rights&quot; and property rights, and had demonized federal power</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to prevent local abuses of child laborers, consumers, women and other politically or economically vulnerable persons and groups, as do today's backlash activists 54 - a choice of &quot;values&quot; and interpretations that historically [*1430] [*1431] </span><u>and <span style="background: yellow;">consistently have undergirded neocolonial power hierarchies materially and socially in the United States since the ratification of the Constitution</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. 55 Thus, while the particulars between then and now [*1432] of course are varied, </span><u>in ultimate and practical terms today's backlashing judges seek to undo the historical, structural and substantive significance of the &quot;switch in time&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> - especially in the form of constitutional case law - and to bring about a restoration of legitimacy to the long-discredited assertions of the 1930s activists. 56 The backlash project of today is to bring back </span><u>a <span style="background: yellow;">return of the old deal</span> - the status quo that framed North American society before the lawmaking eras</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ushered by the New Deal in the mid-1930s and built upon since then during the Civil Rights period of the 1960s.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This project is made possible by a major and key difference between the activism of the judges during the first and second halves of the Twentieth Century - a difference, in fact, that helps to explain the success of today's activist judges despite their have taken up the same basic agenda and posture as their 1930s antecedents: </span><u>the judges of the 1930s sought to interject the federal judicial power to thwart the policymaking choices of contemporaneous legislative or political majorities, whereas <span style="background: yellow;">today's judges seek to deploy the same power to unravel the established policymaking choices and precedents of their legislative, executive and judicial predecessors. The</span> willfulness of the 1930s judges was checked by the historically contemporaneous reactions - and timely retaliation - of the Legislative and Executive branches, famously described as Franklin Roosevelt's &quot;court-packing&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [*1433] scheme. </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">No </span>such <span style="background: yellow;">check from the other branches exists today, as activist judges march in substantial lockstep with</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and in the service of, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">the cultural and political imperatives made dominant by backlash kulturkampf in all three branches</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the federal government. 57 [*1434] Coupled with concurrent efforts to control electoral politics and federal public resources, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">this focus on controlling the federal judicial power has helped to establish the principal contours of backlash kulturkampf</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u>The question</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><u>is whether a politics of identity can provide a sufficient ground to organize both opposition and alternatives to the contemporary conservative hegemony. <span style="background: yellow;">The Left </span>cannot ignore the issues of the differential structures of power that are inscribed upon the population, bur <strong>it <span style="background: yellow;">must refuse to begin by assuming that power can always be </span>adequately understood or <span style="background: yellow;">contested by simply acknowledging the suffering of the subordinate</span></strong></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It has to address the increasing segmentation of the various subordi¬nate groups. Groups which have been traditionally produced through and within a binary mechanism are increasingly deployed in complex and context-specific ways. The contemporary organiza¬tion of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may construct and enable particular structures of binary racism in one place, while fragmenting the binarism in another. It may refuse racism at particular sites, and at others, demand it. And it </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">may articulate <span style="background: yellow;">specific fractions of apparently subordinated groups</span> into real positions of power, or into positions in which <span style="background: yellow;">their &quot;real&quot; interests lead them into conservative positions within which they seem to embrace their subordination.</span></span> <u>Thus, <strong><span style="background: yellow;">it cannot be a simple question of Blacks or women </span>or differentially abled <span style="background: yellow;">organizing against </span>the <span style="background: yellow;">new conservatism</span></strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(since they are clearly not all in opposition), </span><u>but rather of constructing a movement which can strategically and effectively mobilize people against it</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It requires, in Deleuze and Guattari's terms, a politics of the minor. Oppositional struggle depends upon an analysis and identification of the agents and agencies, the historical forces (economic, cultural and political) which construct the configuration of everyday life, specific positions within it, and the relations between these and the larger social formation. The politics of identity is always a politics of resistance, operating at the local level, within the configurations of everyday life, since it refuses to transcend the specific identities and oppressions which are being contested. It allows only the extremes of political involvement: one can only act very locally or at very great distances. The Left, because it must allow any morally correct protest (and who is to decide except the victims), cannot strategically define its priorities. Too often, it trivializes itself in public struggles which focus on the most minor signs of subordinate identities, especially given the real problems facing not only minorities but also the world. </span><u>To develop a new conception of politics and alliance, <span style="background: yellow;">we must move beyond both essentialism and the assumption that identity is the major site of political struggle. </span>We have to define politics and the appropriate sites and forms of struggle by something other than the feelings of the oppressed.</u> <u><span style="background: yellow;">Racism,</span> for example, whether aimed at Blacks, Latinos, Jews, Arabs, Asians, or any other group, <span style="background: yellow;">is not merely a matter of the experience of the subordinate</span> although that experience—the pain and anger—is very real.</u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;"> But </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">it can only become a resource if it is articulated into a viable political strategy.</span> We need to confront all forms of racism, including the racisms of subordinate groups, in our society. And we need to confront as well the ways racism is deployed in specific hegemonic struggles. <span style="background: yellow;">This requires a politics of practice</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(e.g., a politics of antiracism) </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">built on agency rather than identity</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<strong>WE SHOULD NOT REDUCE POLITICS TO OUR OWN OPPRESSION. Voting negative doesn’t assume you have to check your identity at the door. But if this politics becomes the norm, it degenerates into arbitrary exclusions and comparisons of suffering groups.</strong><br />

Identity politics is an extension of feminists' argument that the personal (i.e., experience, determined by social difference) is politi¬cal. But it ignores the fact that <u>&quot;<span style="background: yellow;">the political cannot be reduced to the personal.&quot;</span> It assumes that politics is determined by identity</u> and consequently, ignores the most obvious lesson of contemporary political history: the politics of any social position is not guaranteed in advance, even if it appears to be stitched tightly in place. There is no necessary reason why anyone inhabiting a particular experien¬tial field or located in a particular social position has to adhere to particular political agendas and interests. The illusion can be maintained only by assuming that people who do not have the &quot;right&quot; politics must be suffering from false consciousness and they have yet to authentically experience their own lives. It is too easy to assume that abortion is &quot;a woman's issue&quot; and, further, that a woman who is against abortion is acting against her own experience and interests. More importantly, this often leads people to miss broader political possibilities (e.g., that Rust v. Sullivan limits free speech in any federally funded institution and overrides professional codes of re¬sponsibility and significantly strengthens both state courts and the Executive Branch). As June Jordan puts it, People have to begin to understand that just because somebody is a woman or somebody is black does not mean that he or she and I should have the same politics. We should try to measure each on the basis of what we do for each other rather than on the basis of who we are. <u><span style="background: yellow;">Political struggle is too easily replaced by the <strong>ongoing analysis of one's own oppression</strong> and experience</span> or, only slightly better, by a politics in which the only site of struggle is the local constitution of one's experience within a structure of difference. While the personal is most certainly political, it is often impossible to reach it other than through indirection, through struggles over and within the public sphere</u>. As a political practice, <u><span style="background: yellow;">identity politics has </span>(unintentionally) <span style="background: yellow;">played into </span>efforts by <span style="background: yellow;">the Right to marginalize many important struggles over both civil liberties and civil rights as &quot;special interests</span></u>.&quot; A politics of identity can easily lead one to assume that every activity of a subordinated social fraction is an authentic expression of its position and, as such, must be celebrated as some form of resistance (e.g., Black anti-Semitism or the Islamic treatment of women), creating complex and often impossible contradictions. And since subordination is only defined by its opposition to an imaginary abstract other always located in a dominant position (Black against white, street culture against &quot;legitimate culture,&quot; female against male, workers against capitalists), there is little room for any distinctions. <u>All struggles are apparently equal since every struggle has an equally credible case</u> for those implicated within the space of its specific identifications. The claim of every subordinated social group, and just about every social group is subordinated in some dimension, must be granted equal validity since <u>there is no way to measure oppression from <span style="background: yellow;">outside of the experience or position of the specific imagined community. There can be no measure of political immediacy</span></u>, importance and value, <u>no way of evaluating the reasons, forms, legitimacy <span style="background: yellow;">or at least pragmatic necessity</span> of particular moments of subordination. <span style="background: yellow;">All subordination is evil; </span>all subordinated groups are good</u>! Of course, in practice, particular forms of subordi¬nation are privileged, <u>and <span style="background: yellow;">politics can degenerate into comparative measurements of suffering</span>.</u><br />

 <strong>Their project of homogenizing the white body, black body, and red body fails to unify the oppressed and constitutes a type of reverse racism.</strong><br />
<u><strong>Cole</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, professor in education and equality at Bishop Grosseteste University College, </span><u><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">07</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Mike, 'Racism' is about more than colour, 11/23</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The problem with standard critical race theory is the narrowness of its remit, says Mike Cole. </span><u>One of the main tenets of critical race theory is that &quot;white supremacy&quot; is the norm in societies rather than merely the province of the racist right</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (the other major tenet is primacy of &quot;race&quot; over class). </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">There are a number of significant problems with this use of the term &quot;white supremacy&quot;. The first is that it <strong>homogenises all white people together</strong> in positions of power and privilege.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Writing about the US, critical race theorist Charles Mills acknowledges that not &quot;all whites are better off than all non-whites, but ... as a statistical generalisation, the objective life chances of whites are significantly better&quot;. While this is, of course, true</span><u>, we should not lose sight of the life chances of millions of working-class white people.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">To take poverty as one example, in the US, </span><u>while it is the case that the number of black people living below the poverty line is some three times that of whites, this still leaves <span style="background: yellow;">more than 16 million &quot;white but not Hispanic&quot; people living in poverty</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> there. In the UK, there are similar indicators of a society underpinned by rampant colour-coded racism, with black people twice as poor as whites, and those of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin more than three times as poor as whites. Once again, however, this still leaves some 12 million poor white people in the UK. That such statistics are indicative of racism, however, is beyond doubt, and to interpret them it is useful to employ the concept of &quot;racialisation&quot;. Given that there is widespread agreement among geneticists and social scientists that &quot;race&quot; is a meaningless concept, racialisation describes the process by which people are falsely categorised into distinct &quot;races&quot;. Statistics such as these are indicative of racialised capitalism rather than white supremacy. </span><u>A second problem with &quot;white supremacy&quot; is that <span style="background: yellow;">it is inherently unable to explain non-colour-coded racism</span>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In the UK, for example, this form of racism has been and is directed at the Irish and at gypsy/traveller communities. There is also a well-documented history of anti-Semitism, too. It is also important to underline the fact that Islamophobia is not necessarily triggered by skin colour. It is often sparked by one or more (perceived) symbols of the Muslim faith. Finally, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">a new form of non- colour-coded racism has manifested itself</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">recently in the UK. This has </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">all the hallmarks of traditional racism, but it is directed towards newly arrived groups of people</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It has been </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">described</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">by A. Sivanandan, director of the Institute of Race Relations, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">as &quot;xeno-racism</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;. It appears that there are some similarities in the xeno-racialisation of Eastern European migrant workers and the racialisation of Asian and black workers in the immediate postwar period, a point I address in my latest book. </span><u>&quot;<span style="background: yellow;">White supremacy&quot; is counterproductive as a political unifier and rallying point against racism.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> John Preston concluded an article in The Times Higher advocating critical race theory (&quot;All shades of a wide white world&quot;, October 19) by citing the US journal Race Traitor , which seeks the &quot;abolition of the racial category 'white'&quot;. Elsewhere, Preston has argued &quot;the abolition of whiteness is ... not just an optional extra in terms of defeating capitalism (nor something which will be necessarily abolished post-capitalism) but fundamental to the Marxist educational project as praxis&quot;. Indeed, for Preston, &quot;the abolition of capitalism and whiteness seem to be fundamentally connected in the current historical circumstances of Western capitalist development&quot;. From my Marxist perspective, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">coupling the &quot;abolition of whiteness&quot; to the &quot;abolition of capitalism&quot; is a worrying development</span> that, if it gained ground in Marxist theory, <strong>would most certainly further undermine the Marxist project.</strong></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am not questioning the sincerity of the protagonists of &quot;the abolition of whiteness&quot;, nor suggesting in any way that they are anti-white people but merely questioning its extreme vulnerability to misunderstanding. Anti-racists have made some progress in the UK at least in making anti- racism a mainstream rallying point, and this is reflected, in part, in legislation. Even if it were a good idea, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">the chances of making &quot;the abolition of whiteness&quot; a successful political unifier and rallying point against racism <strong>are virtually non-existent</strong>. </span></u><u><span style="background: yellow;">The usage of &quot;white supremacy&quot; should be restricted to its everyday meaning. To describe and analyse contemporary racism we need a wide- ranging and fluid conception of racism. Only then can we fully understand its multiple manifestations and work towards its eradication</span>.</u></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Historically speaking, examining class division must precede examining racism, since exploitation exists in many non-racist societies.</strong><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Revolutionary nationalism, both in theory and practice, is a far reaching variant on the traditional concept of black nationalism. Revolutionary nationalist, unlike cultural nationalists, recognize that </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">it is impossible to resolve the problems of black people under the structure of American Capitalism. </span>This has led Huey Newton to correctly point out that one <span style="background: yellow;">who adheres to the philosophy of revolutionary nationalism must of necessity be a socialist.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For revolutionary nationalists, by and large, take the position that in order to oppose capitalism it is mandatory that one adopt an outlook of international working class solidarity with particular emphasis on the struggles of Third World people against Imperialism. </span><u>Generally speaking, <span style="background: yellow;">cultural nationalists have a <strong>one-sided view of American society</strong>. <strong>The struggle for black liberation to them would be won if only white racism were eliminated.</strong></span> <strong>Such a view is absurd</strong>. Revolutionary nationalists have clearly seen that <span style="background: yellow;">white racism is only a convenient tool used by the corporate power structure to divide the working masses in America while maximizing profits.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Cultural nationalists also tend to identify only with the liberation struggles on the African continent rather than to see the need for a total world revolution. </span><u>Any number of examples throughout the world of</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">homogeneous national </span><u>populations who are not discriminated against because of race but are <strong>nonetheless poor and exploited</strong> could readily cited as proof of refuting cultural nationalism’s claim that white racism is the only problem black people must deal with.</u></span><br />
<br />
<strong>This means that their desire to exclude this discussion does violence to non-color coded narratives of oppression, covering over and conflating not only different instances of violence but also the motives behind those instances.</strong><br />

<strong>This is the double turn in cross examination – making racial gatekeeping a starting point ends up preventing them from talking about slave-like conditions in the context of labor.</strong><br />

 <strong>A. The Betrayal. It’s disconcerting that some individuals merely stand with the dispossessed. Do we really believe that people who are suffering want us to just observe their suffering? Or do they want us to strive towards actualizing their concerns?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The question we should be asking ourselves is “how can concern be sustained, actualized, and continued?” Anything less is betrayal.</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As I have noted, </span><u>world social categories and knowledge systems have changed so that they now see the colonized as human beings. The shifting in social categories, often by those who are the radicals and liberals of the privileged groups, created deep divisions between reality and its description. But this has <strong>not necessarily</strong> <strong>resulted in fundamental affirmative change</strong>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For those who were consigned to the role of slave, serf and oppressed by imperial Western nations, </span><u>it may be disconcerting</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but pleasantly surprising, </span><u>that some</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> leading international lawyers and </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">intellectuals <strong>stand with</strong> those movements that take their strength from the dispossessed, wretched and exploited,</span> whether in war or peace</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Even though these idealists are educated in Western and imperial categories of social reality, they have, nonetheless, taken as their task the reconstruction and transformation of international law as it is understood in the United States. The skeptical are permitted their doubts, however. After all, </span><u>what can those who represent the pain of others</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and only indirectly their own, </span><u>do to ameliorate the pain of misery</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> sanctioned by imperial law? </span><u>What do such a band of idealists dare to teach to those who suffer, especially when that suffering is often <strong>caused</strong>, directly or indirectly, by the choices made by the very class of which these Western intellectuals</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and lawyers</span> <u>are members? <strong><span style="background: yellow;">Why should the oppressed listen</span></strong><span style="background: yellow;"> to those educated in a language and thought-pattern which, beneath the honeyed words, are the egocentric and ethnocentric doctrines of the </span></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">[*524] </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">dominator?</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Certainly until decolonization, the abstract meaning of the words were employed as signifiers and killers of the culturally oppressed. The language of description and the mode of argument, the very words themselves, were instruments of the colonizer. Their very rules, laws, precedents and citations acted as a steel-belted noose to stifle the cries of the wretched. And yet, these were the very lessons the colonized needed to learn in order to stand up to the colonizer and survive. Not only did they survive, they pressed on to reform nineteenth and early twentieth century imperial law using the UN, and the International Court of Justice. Most importantly, they effected the consciousness of nations. Nevertheless, the wretched must wonder why, behind claims of universality and universal human rights, our actions and thoughts have an often indeterminate or contradictory effect. For Americans, the reason is a complex one. Americans seek identification with the victim in their dreams, but the reality for the American political and legal class is somewhere between carelessness and negligence of the oppressed worker, toleration for the destruction of other people's cultures for purposes of extraction and commodification, exploiter of their lands, and executioner in counter-revolutions which rain bombs of state and financial terror around the world. </span><u>So even when some in the United States <strong>stand with the victim,</strong> they must always wonder, &quot;Who are we that come forward with our notions that speak of human affirmation?</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Who are we to tell the colonized when independence is a drag on themselves and on others as well, possibly leading to war and internecine conflict?&quot; </span><u>And <span style="background: yellow;">the wretched can</span> go further and <span style="background: yellow;">say, &quot;You have <strong>recognized our struggle</strong>, taken away our language and substituted your words of understanding, but <strong>now what</strong></span>?</u> <u>How is freedom to be sustained? We, the formerly marginalized, the indigenous and the merely wretched, have come to recognize that what is presented by the West to humanity as conventional knowledge is a <strong>betrayal</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; </span><u>In truth, <span style="background: yellow;">it was <strong>a betrayal by intellectuals</strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and all those who dared to suggest that the twentieth century could be a time of liberation and freedom. </span><u>Education and knowledge as mediated through the colonizer's strainer has left humanity in <strong>worse shape</strong> than at the beginning of the twentieth century. For some, the god that really failed them was education/<strong><span style="background: yellow;">knowledg</span>e</strong>, which</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, through its institutions, </span><strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">set itself up as the emancipator</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">.</span></u> <u><span style="background: yellow;">This failure, </span>this sense of futility <span style="background: yellow;">where knowledge is an instrument of domination for the few, demands recognition.</span></u></span><br />

<strong>B. Kevin Carter</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We believe that the idea that we should just pay witness to suffering and not speak in defense of actualizing the concerns of the dispossessed is a little bit like a photo-journalist who tried real hard to capture the suffering of a young woman in southern Sudan.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>As a Sudanese woman was bowed over in weakness, a vulture perched itself on top of the woman, waiting to eat her. As the vulture readies itself for the kill, the photo-journalist waits for the perfect shot – the perfect representation of her suffering. Kevin Carter does not attempt to prevent the woman from being eaten, nor does he even lift her from the ground.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>What does he do next? This is not a trivial concern. If we are really concerned about an ethic which sustains itself, shouldn’t we do more than simply acknowledge another’s concerns? Is the photo every really enough?</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u>The child is hardly larger than an infant; she is naked; she appears bowed over in weakness and sickness, incapable, it would seem, of moving; she is unprotected. No mother, no family, no one is present to prevent her from being attacked by the vulture, or succumbing to starvation and then being eaten.</u> The image suggests that she has been abandoned. Why? The reader again is led to imagine various scenarios of suffering: she has been lost in the chaos of forced uprooting; her family has died; she has been deserted near death in order for her mother to hold on to more viable children. The image's great success is that it causes the reader to want to know more. Why is this innocent victim of civil war and famine unprotected? The vulture embodies danger and evil, but the greater dangers and real forces of evil are not in the &quot;natural world&quot;; they are in the political world, including those nearby in army uniforms or in government offices in Khartoum. Famine has become a political strategy in the Sudan.(8) The photograph has been reprinted many times, and it has been duplicated in advertisements for a number of nongovernmental aid agencies that are raising funds to provide food to refugees. This is a classic instance of the use of moral sentiment to mobilize support for social action. One cannot look at this picture without wanting to do something to protect the child and drive the vulture away. Or, as one aid agency puts it, to prevent other children from succumbing in the same heartlessly inhuman way by giving a donation. <u><span style="background: yellow;">The photograph calls for words to answer other questions. How did Carter allow the vulture to get so close without doing something to protect the child?</span></u> <u>What did he do <strong>after</strong> the picture was taken?</u> Was it in some sense posed? <u>Inasmuch as Kevin Carter chose to take the time, minutes that may have been critical at this point when she is near death, to compose an effective picture rather than to save the child, is he complicit?</u> Those moral questions particular to Carter's relationship (or nonrelationship) to the dying child were only intensified when, <u>on July 29, 1994, a few months after the Pulitzer Prize announcement, The New York Times ran an obituary for Kevin Carter, who had committed suicide at age thirty-three</u>. That shocking notice of his death, written by Bill Keller, the Times, Johannesburg correspondent, as well as a longer article by Scott Mac Leod in Time magazine on September 12, reported Carter's clarifications about how he took the photograph and what followed:(9) <u>...he wandered into the open bush. He heard a soft, high-pitched whimpering and saw a tiny girl trying to make her way to the feeding center. <span style="background: yellow;">As he crouched to photograph her, a vulture landed in view. Careful not to disturb the bird, he positioned himself for the best possible image</span>. He would later say he waited about 20 minutes, hoping the vulture would spread its wings. It did not, and <span style="background: yellow;">after he took his photographs, he chased the bird away and watched as the little girl resumed her struggle.</span> Afterwards he sat under a tree, lit a cigarette, talked to God and cried. He was depressed afterward....He kept saying he wanted to hug his daughter.(</u>10) The Times, obituary ends with a section entitled &quot;The Horror of the Work,&quot; in which <u>Jimmy Carter, Kevin's father, observes that his son &quot;Always carried around the horror of the work he did.&quot;</u> Keller implies that it was the burden of this &quot;horror&quot; that may have driven Carter to suicide. The article by Scott Mac Leod in Time shows that Kevin Carter had lived a very troubled life, with drug abuse, a messy divorce, deep financial problems, brushes with the police, and was a manic-depressive. We also learn that <u>he had spent much of his career photographing political repression and violence in South Africa</u>, and that he had been deeply affected by the shooting of his best friend and coworker, Ken Oosterbrock, for whom, he told friends, he &quot;should have taken the bullet.&quot;(11) <u>His suicide note, besides mentioning these other problems, comes back to the theme of the burden of horror: &quot;I am haunted by the vivid memories of killings and corpses and anger and pain...of starving or wounded children, of trigger-happy madmen, often police, of killer executioners....&quot;</u>(12) From Scott Mac Leod we also learn that Carter had been present at the execution of right-wing paramilitary men in Bophuthatswana; much to his annoyance he had missed the master image snapped by his colleagues of a white mercenary pleading for his life before being executed--a picture that also was reprinted by newspapers around the globe. The article in Time reports that Carter was painfully aware of the photojournalist's dilemma: </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u>Carter wrote:</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><u>I had to think visually</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; he said once, describing a shoot-out. </span><u>&quot;<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">I am zooming in on a tight shot of the dead guy and a splash of red.</span></span> Going into his khaki uniform in a pool of blood in the sand. The dead man's face is slightly grey. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">You are making a visual here. But inside something is screaming, `My God.' But it is time to work. Deal with the rest later....&quot;(</span></span>13)</u></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Time magazine's writer discovered that </span><u>some journalists questioned Carter's ethics: &quot;The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering...might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; Scott Mac Leod notes that </span><u>even some of Carter's friends &quot;wondered aloud why he had not helped the girl.&quot;(</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14) </span></span><br />
<u>THE KLEINMANS CONTINUE</u><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u>One message that comes across from viewing suffering from a distance is that for all the havoc in Western society, we are somehow better</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> than this African society. </span><u>We gain in moral status</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and some of our organizations gain financially and politically, </span><u>while those whom we represent, or appropriate, remain where they are, moribund, surrounded by vultures</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">This &quot;consumption&quot; of suffering in an era of so-called &quot;disordered capitalism&quot; is not so very different from the late nineteenth-century view that the savage barbarism in pagan lands justified the valuing of our own civilization at a higher level of development--a view that authorized colonial exploitation. Both are forms of cultural representation in which the moral, the commercial, and the political are deeply involved in each other. The point is that the image of the vulture and the child carries cultural entailments, including the brutal historical genealogy of colonialism as well as the dubious cultural baggage of the more recent programs of &quot;modernization&quot; and globalization (of markets and financing), that have too often worsened human problems in sub-Saharan Africa.(21)</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><u><span style="background: yellow;">Globalization requires that people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds will need to come to grips with radically new complexities </span>and complementarities <span style="background: yellow;">of the human experience. </span>Such awareness <span style="background: yellow;">will not be advanced by a pedagogy that emphasizes race and ethnic exclusivity</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Race</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has historically mandated awareness of distinctiveness, whether in a hegemonic or subordinate context. It </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">emphasizes dichotomy, conflict and negative historical encounters; often <strong>elevating those negative encounters into absolute constructs of human encounters</strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(i.e., black-white as absolute and incompatible), </span><u>thereby <strong>foreclosing possibilities of discovering and appreciating commonalities</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">Each of the phases in the human historical drama of black America---</span>Slavery, Emancipation, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, Civil Rights and Post-Civil Rights--- <span style="background: yellow;">represents <strong>complex historical dramas that engaged personalities from different racial background</strong></span></u><strong><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">s</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><u>each represents aspects of a complex global experience of encounters and interactions at different historical times and spaces.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> In all these historical epochs, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">an absolute and essentialist affirmation of race would <strong>foreclose the possibility of discovering and highlighting first, the complexity of the encounters, and second, the very artificiality of race itself as a defining construct</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Take slavery in the United States for example, undoubtedly one of the most racially configured in history, yet, </span><u>many whites were implicated in several efforts to undermine the institution. The same could be said of Jim Crow</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Although race again was the defining essence of Jim Crow, if the entire episode is viewed as part of a historical continuum, rather than an isolated phase, race becomes problematic as a distinguishing element. </span><u>Many <span style="background: yellow;">whites were involved in the struggle to end Jim Crow</span> in the United States. The same applies to the Civil rights movement</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The martyrdom of Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, and the efforts and sacrifices of several other white students in the freedom rides and marches underscore the problematic of an essentialist projection of race. Globalization undoubtedly has its problems. On a more general level, there is the openly expressed concern over, and at times violent reactions to, the economic implications of globalization; that is, the domineering status of wealthy nations, and multi-nationals, relative to the disadvantaged position of smaller and weaker nations. The specific issue, however, for the Afrocentrists is the perception of globalization as a vehicle for Eurocentric cultural hegemony. But there are those who see in the drama of ‘unequal encounters,’ and discoveries that globalization entails, positive elements that would facilitate understanding and appreciation of the cross cultural, and interactive nature of the human historical experience; resulting in the acquisition of better knowledge of each other, and greater appreciation for each other. </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">The adoption of a race-based pedagogy would only <strong>impose unnecessary limits</strong></span> <strong>on the possibility of participating actively</strong> in, and benefiting from, the expansive parameters of human encounters.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There is no doubt that </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">many</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">of the </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">atrocities</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and manifestations of ‘man’s inhumanity to man’ that currently inform human encounters, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">may </span>likely <span style="background: yellow;">be tampered by a global context that facilitates greater mutual appreciation and respect among humani</span></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">ty</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But </span><u>there is a problematic assumption running through much CRT scholarship to the effect that once our consciousness has been raised through narratives and stories, the correct</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> legal </span><u>decision will immediately become clear to us</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That is, judges and lawyers who genuinely understand the experiences of people of color will start making decisions that will benefit these &quot;out-groups.&quot; But is this a correct assumption? I think not, for the simple reason that </span><u>a <span style="background: yellow;">raised consciousness is no guarantee that a particular decision will be chosen</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This can be seen by the rise of African-American intellectuals who have experienced stinging acts of racism yet remain staunchly opposed to affirmative action and set-asides, on doctrinal grounds. The very existence of neoconservative black intellectuals like Stephen Carter and Shelby Steele (not to mention Justice Clarence Thomas and law professor Randall Kennedy) militates against the idea that the subjective experience of racism will automatically lead to some sort of psychological conversion in which judges and lawyers will know how to &quot;do the right thing.&quot; </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">CRT acts as a sort of <strong>disinfectant</strong> which dispels some widely-held misconceptions about people of color</span></u><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> assumptions which are often held unconsciously by judges and lawyers. A judge who has read the works of Patricia Williams and Derrick Bell may be less likely to hold stereotypical, denigrating views of black people, and while this may not affect every decision that she makes, it can have a certain salutary effect.

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The need for a distinct black pedagogy and epistemology seems justifiable within American society and polity, given historical and persistent distrust of mainstream education, and onslaughts on affirmative action, and the conviction of many that mainstream education does not adequately and accurately reflect and represent the experience of blacks. </span><u>In the global context</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, such </span><u>race-based pedagogy <strong>becomes constricting, limiting, and extremely problematic</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>If indeed, globalization is effecting de-territorialization, shrinkage and circumscription of the political authority of the nation state</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if national boundaries are becoming almost superfluous, as humans grow closer and are compelled to confront commonality and convergence, as opposed to distinctiveness and separatism, </span><u>then the adoption of race-based pedagogy itself becomes problematic. <span style="background: yellow;">What the adoption of race-based pedagogy does is <strong>replicate exactly the hegemonic model that blacks are criticizing and challenging</strong></span></u><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> one historically and traditionally based on race, and skewed culturally in favor of the white dominant class. Many critiques of Afrocentricity see it as the extreme opposite of the Eurocentric pedagogy that it purports to reject. Paulo </span><u>Freire describes a situation where <span style="background: yellow;">those struggling against oppression often end up adapting values and strategies of their oppressor, becoming themselves oppressors</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or sub-oppressors. Though they may be aware of being dominated, yet “their perception of themselves as opposites of their oppressor does not yet signify engagement in a struggle to overcome the contradiction; the one pole aspires not to liberation, but to identification with its opposite pole.” (Freire, 1992: 30). </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">In the case of black America</span>, there was a strong move to reject the epistemic logic of the oppressor</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>However, <span style="background: yellow;">the paradigm that evolves <strong>bears strong resemblance to the culturally and racially skewed epistemology of the oppressor</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Ibid). </span><u>This identification is a kind of curious and problematic one in that it is unintended and born of alienation from, <span style="background: yellow;">and an attempt to disown, the hegemonic ethos of the dominant academic system.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Consequently, </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">what emerges is a paradigm based on race, just as the dominant pedagogy of the oppressor was heavily dependent on race</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That is, </span><u>there emerges <strong>an equally hegemonic pedagogy</strong>; <span style="background: yellow;">one that asserts and affirms or <strong>essentializes particularistic ethos and culture</strong></span>, that are deemed in conflict with those of the dominant group<span style="background: yellow;">; and one which is often <strong>conferred superiority through claims of originality and preeminence.</strong></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Instead of developing a transcendence of the existentialist contradiction at which, “the reality of oppression has already been transformed,” resulting in a pedagogy that “ceases to belong to the oppressed and becomes a pedagogy for all men in the process of permanent liberation” (Ibid. 40). </span><u>the</u> <u>oppressed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (in this case blacks) </span><u>seek still a culturally skewed and equally hegemonic paradigm</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Instead of what Paulo Freire envisages, that is, the possibility of a pedagogy of liberation that <strong>unites both oppressor and oppressed on the basis of consensus</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on these ethos that are not racially and culturally skewed and hegemonic, </span><strong><u><span style="background: yellow;">what emerges is a segregationist paradigm</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: yellow;"> that recreates and repackages the myths “created and developed in the old order</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">Advocates of race-based pedagogy believe that the ole myths </span>have not been adequately expelled, but rather <span style="background: yellow;">have somehow been dispersed under different code words</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and euphemisms.

<br />
The call for pan-blackist cultural vigilance and unity, and <u>the projection of a monolithic African cultural world and identity,</u> therefore, <u>represent a response to the cultural implications of globalization</u>. In the Afrocentric worldview, culture is an arena of irreconcilable conflict and antagonism between blacks and whites. Blacks are expected to maintain a respectable distance from, and vigilance against, white cultural contacts. In Afrocentricity, the notion of “cultural citizenship” suggests distinct antagonistic cultural zones, in perpetual conflict, with no grounds for discourses, exchanges, encounters and influence. Instead of cultural understandings, <u><span style="background: yellow;">Afrocentric cultural worldview underlines a world of cultural isolation, suspicion and antagonism, one in which citizenship is defined not by cultural connectedness, or attempts to discover such connections, but by cultural disharmony and disengagement, <strong>foreclosing dialogue and communication across cultural spaces</strong></span></u><span style="background: yellow;">.</span> It becomes imperative, therefore, for Africans and blacks in Diaspora to maintain cultural vigilance. <u><span style="background: yellow;">This posture <strong>undermines intercultural communication and dialogue.</strong></span></u><span style="background: yellow;"> In the judgment of Afrocentric Scholars, globalization represents internationalization of the domestic American cultural war. The probability</span> of a global cultural citizenship deepens Afrocentric distrust of Eurocentric culture. Such citizenry is emblematic of European hegemony, and therefore, inimical to black interests. Afrocentricity is vehemently anti-globalization, preferring an isolationist posture for blacks. <u>Afrocentrism emphasizes race, ethnicity and <strong>a monolithic and homogenized black identity</strong></u>. Afrocentric response to globalization betrays paranoia and provincialism. <u>Afrocentric scholars <strong>are convinced that embracing globalization would jeopardize and compromise black cultural distinctiveness</strong></u>, luring blacks into a false sense of security, while subjecting them to European cultural hegemony. This is logical because, in the Afrocentric worldview, the global context is an expanded terrain of the racial/cultural war.20 Globalization is thus a euphemism for Eurocentric hegemony. As Asante contends in a recent publication, “We have come to the end of racist capitalism because the world now understands the numerous ways that globalization masquerades as a new philosophy when in reality it is the old trying to slide into our consciousness without our knowledge.”21 From its inception, Afrocentricity had relied for its appeal on the color line. Color occupies a central location in Afrocentric construction and analysis of the problems and challenges confronting blacks in Africa and the Diaspora. Afrocentric scholars advocate absolute adherence to the color line as the best guarantee of the physical and cultural survival of blacks in both a national and global contexts of white hegemony. In the last ten years, however, with the growth of globalization, and attendant shrinkage of traditional parameters of differentiation, Afrocentric scholars have become apprehensive of the cultural impact of globalization on the black experience. In opposition to inter-culturalism, they advocate racial distinctiveness; a distinctiveness preserved through a strict observance of the color line on a global scale, in which blacks, regardless of socio-political, and geographical location are drawn together to forge a strong global united front--gloracialization. <u><span style="background: yellow;">Gloracialization offers its advocates a paradigm for effectively chipping at the edifice of Eurocentric hegemony.</span> However, <strong>it is not clear if Afrocentric homogenization of the black experience can effectively undermine Eurocentric hegemony</strong></u>. Or, as some critics suggest, <u><span style="background: yellow;">Afrocentric gloracialization may yet become <strong>another level of racial essentialism</strong>, a countervailing ideology with its own racial domain of authenticity and empowerment.</span></u> Nonetheless, the development of gloracialized consciousness among black Americans underscores the imperative of racialized discourse.<br />

<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Science diplomacy is part of the larger US-led war for talent which treats foreign labor as a commodity to promote US competitiveness – nations appear increasingly welcoming to lure foreign talent into the country – this regime is driven by the Bill Gates’ of the world who seek to create a global labor market.</span></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Tannock 9</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [Stuart, Independent researcher who focuses on issues of education, work, labor and youth in the contemporary global economy, September, “White-collar imperialisms: the H-1B debate in America,” Social Semiotics, Vol. 19, No. 3, September 2009, 311-327]</span><br />
After a brief cooling-off period that followed the collapse of the Dot-Com bubble in 20002002, and the September 11 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center in 2001 (in the wake of which, all talk of immigration matters was put on hold in the United States), concern over the H-1B visa program heated up once more in 20062007 (see, for example, Thibodeau 2007). In this second round of the H-1B debate, however, the terms of the argument were subtly shifted. <u><span style="background: yellow;">No longer was the premise simply about opening doors on a throttled national labor market, but rather working to capture the full benefits of an already open and globalized labor market</span> and higher education system</u>. To understand this shift, we need to put the H1B debate in the context of two fundamental transformations in national and global political economy that have occurred since the H-1B was first created in the Immigration Act of 1990. First, <u><span style="background: yellow;">there was the dramatic internationalization of </span>higher education and <span style="background: yellow;">the high-skill labor market</span></u> in the United States, <u>especially <span style="background: yellow;">in</span></u> the fields of <u><span style="background: yellow;">science and engineering</span></u>: the proportion of foreign-born PhD recipients from US universities in science and engineering increased from 23% in 1966 to 39% in 2000 (Freeman 2005); by 2005, the foreign-born were earning over 63% of US engineering PhDs (Matthews 2007); among science, technology, engineering and mathematics post-doctoral scholars, the share of temporary residents rose from 37% in 1982 to 59% in 2002 (National Research Council 2005); the percentage of scientists and engineers with PhDs in the United States who were foreign-born increased from 24% in 1980 to 37% in 2000 (Wulf 2005). Nearly 60% of the growth in the US science and engineering workforce in the 1990s came from the foreignborn (Freeman 2005). <u>This internationalization was <span style="background: yellow;">driven</span></u>, in part, <u><span style="background: yellow;">by</span></u> a second fundamental shift over the course of the 1990s: <u><span style="background: yellow;">the rise of a global war for talent</span></u> (Kuptsch and Fong 2006). Nation-states around the world have increasingly opened their borders to highlyskilled immigrants, and have actively sought to recruit high-level professional and managerial workers and students from overseas (OECD 2006). <u>This war for talent is driven in large part by the United States<span style="background: yellow;">: US think-tanks and ideologues are at the forefront of trumpeting the benefits of liberalizing the global movement of high-skill labor</span>; <span style="background: yellow;">and</span></u> US immigration policy reforms such as the 1990 creation of <u><span style="background: yellow;">the H-1B visa </span></u>itself <u>have become models for other countries to imitate</u>. Further, the United States is the world’s number-one talent magnet: with just 5% of the world’s population, it attracts about one-half of the college-educated migrants who come to the rich OECD countries (its closest competitor, Canada, pulls in 13% of these immigrants) (Docquier and Marfouk 2005, 168). <u><span style="background: yellow;">To be economically competitive </span>in the global economy, <span style="background: yellow;">business and political elites now argue, it is imperative to recruit the world’s most talented individuals</span></u>, from wherever they come. <u>Since other nations are also competing for these same workers</u> (as well as for one’s own set of domestic skilled workers), <u><span style="background: yellow;">nations must continually adjust their immigration</span></u>, education, economic and social <u><span style="background: yellow;">policy to make themselves more welcoming and appealing to them.</span> The global war for talent puts into play <span style="background: yellow;">a game of perpetual one-upmanship</span>, in which political and business leaders of all nations insist they have no choice but to compete</u> (Florida 2005; Shachar 2006; Wooldridge 2006). Thus, when Compete America (a group that bills itself as a ‘‘coalition of corporations, educators, research institutions and trade associations committed to advancing public policies that enable US employers to hire and retain the world’s best talent’’; Compete America 2007) released a series of ads in 2007 calling for expansion of the H-1B and other skilled worker visa programs, the issue of labor shortage was hardly present at all. In one advert, Compete America raises the specter of losing out on the talents of foreign-born college students who had been trained in American universities, but would be forced to work for overseas competitors due to arbitrary caps on the H-1B visas that could be used to hire them in the United States (Figure 1). In another advert, the coalition warns that a new ‘‘Blue Card’’ to be introduced by the European Union for skilled immigrants will soon enable Europe to out-compete the United States ‘‘for the world’s brightest and most innovative minds’’ if Congress does not reform its inefficient and ‘‘outdated’’ employment-based ‘‘Green Card’’ program (Figure 2). <u><span style="background: yellow;">When</span> Microsoft’s <span style="background: yellow;">Bill Gates goes to Washington</span> to call on the nation’s leaders <span style="background: yellow;">for an overhaul of the </span>US <span style="background: yellow;">high-skilled immigration system, he talks not just of raising the annual cap on H-1B visas, but of removing the cap entirely</span></u>. ‘‘The theory behind the H-1B that too many smart people are coming to the US,’’ Gates said in a 2005 discussion at the Library of Congress, ‘‘that’s what’s questionable. It’s very dangerous. You can get this idea that the world is very scary; let’s cut back on travel . . . let’s cut back on visas’’ (quoted in McCullagh 2005). The big-tent vision on offer here is that of a global meritocracy, in which individuals from across the globe are to be recruited and hired solely on the basis of merit, regardless of where they come from or what passport they hold (Tannock 2009a; Wooldridge 2006).<br />

<span style="color: black;">Finally, Simon Dalby's concluding chapter works at the largest scale, the globe itself, arguing that the </span><u><span style="color: black;">contemporary languages of geopolitics are involved with the specification of the planet itself as apparently threatened and in need of securing and management.

The culture of consumption is taken for granted as the starting point for geopolitical specifications of danger to the culture of modernity. But inverting the logic of security by looking at the specific localities of the 'South' that are supposedly the cause of environmental insecurities subverts the normal direction of geopolitical gaze and turns it back on the culture of expertise that can know a planet in such a manner. By turning the analysis back on the producers of geopolitical texts he argues, in parallel with many of the critiques in earlier chapters, that </span><u><span style="background: yellow; color: black;">the attribution of blame</span><span style="color: black;"> for insecurity caused by, in this case, environmental degradation, to external Others, <strong><span style="background: yellow;">obscures</span></strong><span style="background: yellow;"> the role of the global political economy in <strong>causing insecurity</strong> in numerous places.</span></span></u><span style="color: black;"> Although not a formal conclusion to the volume in the conventional sense, this analysis of the 'Pogo Syndrome' which obscures political responsibilities, in part through the cartographic representations of contemporary geopolitics, reprises many of the themes from earlier chapters.</span><br />

<u><span style="background: yellow;">As long as we remain on the terrain of competitiveness, no effective challenge to capitalism is possible</span>. Whatever &quot;progressive&quot; face Third Way-ists try to place on it</u>--as with &quot;training&quot; or &quot;industrial strategies&quot;--<u>the goal of <span style="background: yellow;">competitiveness is, </span>to begin with, <span style="background: yellow;">morally indefensible: its underlying principle is </span>that <span style="background: yellow;">access to </span>employment for <span style="background: yellow;">one group of workers </span>essentially comes from undermining the standards--&gt;and taking the jobs--of others.</u> At best, it <span style="background: yellow;">promises permanent insecurity</span>, since even &quot;<span style="background: yellow;">winning&quot; is an inherently </span>temporary and <span style="background: yellow;">fragile circumstance</span>. And <span style="background: yellow;">competitiveness is ultimately destructive to building any kind of independent political capacity, because the alliances it invites are with &quot;our employers,&quot; while the enemy it identifies is other workers</span><u><span style="background: yellow;">.</span></u> Competitiveness is, of course, more than an ideological construct; it is a real-word constraint. <u>But there is a world of difference between acknowledging a constraint that we must deal with in the short run, as opposed to raising it to the status of a goal by talking about the oxymoron of &quot;progressive competitiveness.&quot;</u> The issue is how to cope with this constraint as we move to limit and eventually eradicate its dominance over our lives. <u>It is important to emphasize that to reject competitiveness is not to reject being &quot;productive.&quot; On the terrain of competitiveness, the removal of tools and equipment from a community may be rational; on the terrain of democratic capacities, it robs workers of their productive potentials. Competitiveness directs training towards teaching workers to adapt to technology; the focus on democratic capacities instead raises the issue of how to control technology. Competitiveness hoards knowledge; a focus on collective capacities looks to generalize and therefore democratize knowledge.</u> Any practical challenge to competitiveness necessarily implies challenging the freedom of capital to restructure production across firms, sectors and borders. The issue of limiting capital's freedom to ignore borders inherently involves a degree of &quot;protectionism,&quot; risking a corresponding national chauvinism<u>.

What <span style="background: yellow;">we are rejecting is not integration </span>into an international economy, <span style="background: yellow;">but a particular kind of integration: one that dominates, and thereby undermines, what we</span> <u>(again the international &quot;we&quot;)</u> <span style="background: yellow;">are struggling to build within each of our domestic spaces.</span><br />

<u><span style="background: yellow;">The circulation of globalisation and neo-liberal discourses today is omnipresent, elevating their positions to ‘unquestionable truths’</span></u> <span style="font-size: 80%;">and ‘immutable principles’ (Gallagher, 2005, p. 121). Despite their ability to reach hegemonic status around the world, this way of envisioning the world is by no means homogeneously applied across countries (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001, p. 20). These forces contribute less to a ‘monolithic, undifferentiated project’ (Tickell &amp; Peck, 2003, p. 2) than once thought, as their influences are politically negotiated and mediated locally. In this article, I explore this differentiation to illustrate how globalisation and neoliberalism influence policy in the Access to Professions and Trades area in Ontario, Canada. By exploring</span> <u><span style="background: yellow;">the evolution from a ‘brain drain’ to a ‘skills shortage’ discourse,</span></u> <span style="font-size: 80%;">I investigate how circulating discourses, as the historical, political and cultural context of policy production</span><span style="background: yellow;">, <u>shape policy processes</u></span><u>.</u> Building on Joshee and Johnson’s (2005) policy web, Ball’s (1998) notion of policy as discourse and Gale’s (1999) intertextuality, this article offers a new metaphor for policy analysis that conceives of policy as a discursive web. <u>The concept of <span style="background: yellow;">a <strong>discursive policy web</strong> facilitates a <strong>more fulsome understanding of policy processes</strong> by highlighting the way multiple discourses interact</span> a complex network of power. <span style="background: yellow;">Conceiving of policy as a discursive web can help us understand <strong>processes of resistance and contestation</strong></span> <strong>to globalisation and neo-liberalism by understanding how they are mediated by complex institutional and ideational forces</strong>.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">My study also builds on Ozga’s (2005) examination of how ‘“travelling” policies are mediated by the “embedded” practices and cultures of different systems to produce particular “local” versions of policy’ (Ozga, 2005, p. 207). It begins to answer Hay and Rosamond’s (2001) call ‘for the need to consider the complex institutional and ideational mediations by which external economic imperatives are translated into domestic political and economic dynamics’ (p. 20). Globalisation and neo-liberalism Globalisation and neo-liberalism are widely used and highly contested concepts. They are often elided and entangled both historically and analytically (Tickell &amp; Peck, 2003). Tickell and Peck (2003) attempt to make sense of the confusion by understanding globalisation as a discourse or economic narrative and neo-liberalism as a political project or political script often referred to as ‘a utopian political ideology’ (Tickell &amp; Peck, 2003, p. 4). ‘According to Bourdieu, neo-liberalism is a political project for the reconstruction of society in accord with the demands of an unrestrained global capitalism’ (Fairclough, 2000, p. 147). As such, globalisation is typically linked with a neo-liberal economic logic that is used to justify a market-driven mentality. These</span> <u><span style="background: yellow;">market conforming arguments call for deregulation or unrestrained neo-liberal policies couching everything in <strong>economic terms and competition</strong></span><strong>.</strong></u> Traditionally, globalisation has been studied as a material process and practice (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001). <u>New ways of <span style="background: yellow;">viewing globalisation as a discourse</span>, however, <span style="background: yellow;">can help further our understanding of how discourses of globalisation socially construct what is possible</span></u> (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001). I build on Hay and Rosamond’s (2001) view of globalisation as a discourse and examine how <u><span style="background: yellow;">globalisation discourses inform policy processes. The logic of neo-liberalism used to promote globalisation advances a view of the world that is certain and unquestionable, <strong>constructing a truth under which we are forced to operate</strong></span>. This logic is proposed as a common-sense view shared by all countries around the world. In this way, <span style="background: yellow;">neoliberalism has been <strong>uncritically</strong> adopted as inevitable</span>,</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">raising it to a level where TINA: ‘there is no alternative’ (Olssen, 2004). Presenting globalisation as a discourse recognises that it is a social construction, there is an alternative, it is not ‘an inexorable and fatalistic economic “logic of no alternative’’’ (Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001, p. 5). One implication of this position is that we can develop counter-discourses as forms of resistance. My aim in recognising discourses as operating in a web is to provide a means for being more successful in this endeavour. This article attempts to contribute a more complete understanding of the policy process by highlighting how</span> <span style="background: yellow;">p<u>olicies exist in complex discursive relationships: a discursive web.</u></span> I show how <u>the broad national and international discourses of globalisation and neo-liberalism set the discursive context of this interaction</u><span style="font-size: 6pt;">. Similarities in contexts and policies across countries along with more recent examples of policy divergence warrant an examination of how local contexts mediate global factors. Studies of policy divergence highlight the important contribution of historical, cultural and discursive contexts to the policy process. Ball (1998) also indicates that </span><u><span style="background: yellow;">international, national and cultural discursive contexts influence how policy is received and interpreted at the local level</span></u><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Globalisation and education policy Given the widespread nature of globalisation discourses, numerous studies have risen up to examine the normalisation of a market discourse across all realms of life (Chouliaraki &amp; Fairclough, 1999; Chiapello &amp; Fairclough, 2002). In education research specifically, these studies critique neo-liberalism highlighting its negative consequences for education (Olssen, 2004; Dale &amp; Robertson, 2005), higher education (Davies, 2005; Giroux, 2005) or the teaching profession specifically (Codd, 2005; Ozga, 2005). While these education studies have implications for policies, ‘policy is generally not their focal point’ (Johnson &amp; Joshee, in press, p. 4).</span> <u><span style="background: yellow;">The few educational policy studies that do exist generally have taken <strong>a narrow view of policy</strong></span> <strong>as an outcome or a text <span style="background: yellow;">and endorse a state-centred</span> or linear <span style="background: yellow;">approach</span> to policy, <span style="background: yellow;">failing to account for the way policies are embedded in</span> local, historical, cultural and <span style="background: yellow;">political contexts that influence how they are taken up.</span></strong> This perspective has also been dominant in studies of</u> education policy and <u>globalisation</u> specifically (c.f. Sassen, 1996; Hay &amp; Rosamond, 2001; Kamat et al., 2004; Olssen, 2004). While <u>these studies</u> are valuable, in most cases they f<u>ail to account for the way <strong>multiple players participate in the policy process and the way policies interact with other policies in a complex network of relationships</strong>.</u> According to Joshee (2005), <u>policies must be read within the context of the full range of policies addressing a problem, since ‘<span style="background: yellow;">most policies <strong>cannot get results at all save through such a web</strong></span></u><strong><span style="background: yellow;">’</span></strong> (Oquist, 2004, as cited in Joshee, 2005, p. 1). My approach is consistent with Joshee’s in that it recognises that <u>policy discourses must be understood in relation to other existing discourses since they interact with each other to have policy influences.</u><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;">The second category might be named, <u>The Too Big-Too Weak Paradox</u>. This <u>involves the twin ideas that corporations are so big and powerful that challenging their prerogatives is fruitless, and that market forces beyond corporate control leave corporations relatively helpless. <strong><span style="background: yellow;">The consequence of accepting</span></strong><span style="background: yellow;"> this paradox as true is to <strong>let corporations set the terrain of debate</strong></span><strong>, and confining reformers to the margins</strong></u>. Thus, conservation groups invest energy in collaborative projects with grain companies, in an attempt to reform the growing practices of soy, palm oil and other commodities growers — accepting as a given the expansion of plantation economics that is inherently unsustainable on a local or global basis. Accepting the paradox also leaves the United Auto Workers with no apparent choice but to accept concessionary contracts that will undermine the solidarity principle at the heart of the union cause. A third category is over-reliance on, and veneration of, The Market. <u>A decades-long ideological campaign has vectored U.S. and global policy debates to assume more corporatization (privatization),</u> more deregulation, and more and stronger property rights <u>are the solution to almost everything</u>. Thus, the Bad Samaritans, as Ha-Joon Chang calls the IMF, World Bank, WTO and <u>rich country advisers, continue to instruct developing countries to adopt market fundamentalist policies that have demonstrably failed the poor and that the rich countries themselves did not follow when they were poor</u>. Thus, an array of market-based healthcare reforms — some more venal than others — are proposed despite the inherent inability of private insurance to ensure quality healthcare for all.

In Kerala, as elsewhere, <u><span style="background: yellow;">transformations associated with globalization are</span> often <span style="background: yellow;">indexed by the expansion of the market economy and a consumerist ethos</span></u>, often <u>at the expense of state-centric formulations of politics and citizenship</u>. Debates about privatization usually revolve around two competing arguments. On the one hand, some herald privatization as the engine of economic growth and prosperity, relieving states and citizens of the draining effects of large state bureaucracies and inefficiencies. On the other hand, those who oppose privatization argue that the withdrawal of the state from social services and the concomitant rise of consumption and market ideology lead to increasing inequality. <u>What is often missed in these debates are the ways in which claims are made on the state</u> by both sides of this debate. Moreover, although both positions target consumerism, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 10pt;">little attention is paid to how discourses of consumption work to reconfigure politics, citizenship, and democracy</span></span>. This reconfiguration is the subject of this article. I examine the state-market nexus that structures the educational field in Kerala, tracking the persistent yet transformed understandings of the relationship between private and public through which the meanings and functions of education and citizenship are debated and struggled over. In particular, I pay attention to <u><span style="background: yellow;">discourses </span>about “politics”</u> that <u><span style="background: yellow;">pervade</span></u> college <u><span style="background: yellow;">life</span></u> in Kerala as a key site where <u><span style="background: yellow;">citizenship is being reformulated through discourses of consumerism</span>.</u> To track the relationship between privatization and citizenship, I examine the contemporary trajectory of a historically important masculinist “political public” in Kerala as it intersects with multiple understandings of the “private” in ways that demonstrate their mutual and changing entanglements.4 This entails unraveling the dense connections between Kerala’s postcolonial political and educational trajectories, given the centrality of educational spaces and students to the constitution of this political public. The <u>contemporary contestations that mark this political field</u> within Kerala <u>reveal a struggle over the meaning of democratic public <span style="background: yellow;">life</span></u> that opposes a political public, rooted in a tradition of anticolonial struggle and postcolonial nationalist politics, to that of a “civic public,” <u><span style="background: yellow;">rooted in notions of efficiency and freedom to consume</span> through the logic of privatization.</u> A contrast between the civic and the political has been given renewed salience associational life, while pointing to another domain, “political society,” in which other, nonelite practices of mobilization and participation in engagements with the state run counter to the norms of civil society. My discussion of a civic—as opposed to a political—public resonates with this distinction, which I find useful. However, I am less interested in a conception of political society that lies outside of the domain of civil society than in the ways in which <u>notions of the civic and the political confront each other within an already constituted public space of politics</u>. Drawing on extensivework on the public–private dichotomy in feminist scholarship, I suggest that the public that grounds the confrontation between the civic and the political is grounded in masculine forms of sociality and mobility. The tension between the freedom to occupy and traverse public spaces in the discourses of both a “civic public” and a “political public” is grounded, I argue, on competing masculinities that are class inflected. Further, <u>I mark this contemporary moment of neoliberalism by demonstrating how <span style="background: yellow;">this “civic public,”</span></u> which Chatterjee <u>links to the emergence of middle-class bourgeois nationalism during the colonial period, <span style="background: yellow;">articulates</span> with <span style="background: yellow;">discourses of consumption that are tied to</span> notions of the <span style="background: yellow;">freedom of the market</span></u>. <u>The “private consumer” lays claim to the state by trying to construct a civic public, based on notions of efficiency and orderliness</u>, in opposition to a political public, deemed to be unruly, disruptive, and sometimes violent, inways that are reconfiguring politics, democracy, and citizenship under conditions of globalization. Explicit discourses about “politics” (rashtriyam), its limits and characteristics, point to the ways in which self-conscious <u><span style="background: yellow;">political activity</span></u> among students <u><span style="background: yellow;">is situated within</span> a <span style="background: yellow;">wider</span> social field of</u> gender and generational <u><span style="background: yellow;">practices that structure this confrontation</span> between a civic and a political public</u>. In particular, <u><span style="background: yellow;">these discourses mark the ways in which notions of citizenship are tied to</span></u> anticolonial and <u>postcolonial <span style="background: yellow;">notions of politics and how they intersect with neoliberal</span> conceptions of <span style="background: yellow;">consumption</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">To comprehend the reconfiguration of politics and citizenship within this new moment of globalization, a focus on discourses of consumption is centrally important</span></span></u>.Within the Indian context, several formulations have marked the rise of consumption as a new terrain for the reconfiguration of citizenship in the globalizing 1990s, supplanting the national developmental citizen of the postindependence Nehruvian state (Breckenridge 1995; Deshpande 1993; Niranjana 1991, 1999). <u>The anthropology of globalization has also been marked by a focus on consumption</u> (Appadurai 1996; Ong 1999).6 <u>The centrality of consumption as a site for the exploration of globalization</u> dovetails with the growing influence of cultural studies (Hall and Jefferson 1976; Hebdige 1981; McRobbie 1991; Miller 1991) within anthropology that has also privileged consumption as an object of cultural analysis. Much work in the cultural studies and anthropology of consumption has been devoted to exploring this hitherto undervalued and neglected domain of social life, arguing its importance <u>for understanding identity formation under the intersecting frames of colonialism, nationalism, and capitalism</u> (Burke 1996; Hendrickson 1996; Tarlo 1996). <u><span style="background: yellow;">Rather than viewing consumption as a naturalized set of social practices </span>that needs to be examined and deciphered, <span style="background: yellow;">I would like to begin<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> by examining the space of consumption itself as something that needs to be actively produced through discourse</span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, practice, and imagination</span></u> (Appadurai 1996:42). As Beng-Huat Chua states for East Asia, much theorization and research on consumption focuses on identity politics and comes out of an argument about the importance of consumption vis-`a-vis debates about cultural distinction within the Euro-American context (2000:19). Although the politics of identity and cultural distinction are certainly at stake in consumer practices globally, especially for the cultural politics of youth, <u><span style="background: yellow;">the cultural-ideological context within </span>which that <span style="background: yellow;">politics is played out has distinct histories in different locations<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. A focus on discourses of consumption reveals the specificity of these contexts, particularly when the politics of identity and cultural distinction are linked to discourses of citizenship and politics</span></span></u>. Within the privatization debates in Kerala, <u><span style="background: yellow;">discourses of consumption insert themselves <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">into dense narratives of politics</span> </span>emerging out of the cultural and ideological terrain</u> of postcolonial states struggling with the legacy of colonialism and anticolonial nationalism as they intersect with a new global order. The terrain of consumption as “social practice” or “everyday life” operates in and through these political fields. Joan Vincent has recently remarked on a new engagement with questions of citizenship within anthropology (2002). <u>The framework of <span style="background: yellow;">citizenship has become a lens</span> through which <span style="background: yellow;">to explore the changing and dynamic processes of sovereignty, belonging, and politics at the interface between nation-states and transnational movements of capital, labor</span></u>, media, <u><span style="background: yellow;">and commodities</span></u> (Appadurai 2002). This approach has expanded the notion of what constitutes the proper domain of citizenship. Although a conventional legal definition of citizenship rests on political rights and obligations with respect to a sovereign state, <u>anthropologists have emphasized the ambiguities of citizenship as these are lived in the cultural politics of everyday life</u> (Holston and Appadurai 1999; Ong 1999). Although the expansion of citizenship beyond the boundaries of the officially political is a useful and salutary move in studies of citizenship, I have found it useful to track definitions of “the political”—more specifically, the how, what, when, and where of the political—to understand changing conceptions of citizenship (Appadurai 2002; Butler 1992; Comaroff and Comaroff 2000).7 I examine a self-conscious discourse of politics and its limits in and through various spaces of articulation focusing on the politics of privatization in a college institution established for lower-caste students.<br />

A century on and capitalist production has spread far beyond the factory walls. It has been argued, most famously by Hardt and Negri in Empire, <u>that the production of things</u> — material stuff that can be counted, weighed, measured — <u>is no longer hegemonic. <span style="background: yellow;">Capital has invaded every aspect of human lives and production is increasingly immaterial</span>, producing information, affects and percepts.</u> It is increasingly difficult to distinguish production from reproduction, the sphere inside capitalist production from that outside it, where labour-power is produced. When immaterial production is centre-stage, the skills, know-how and attitudes of workers are (re)produced by the relational practices learnt and re-learnt in the home, from uncles and aunts, sisters and brothers, mothers, fathers and lovers. <u><span style="background: yellow;">The immateriality of labour implies </span></u>an activity that emphasises and is self-aware of its cooperative nature, <u><span style="background: yellow;">a biopolitical activity that produces affects</span></u>3. <u>Hence cooperation is far more likely to be of a horizontal, rhizomatic nature, organised on the basis of networks</u>, informal workgroups, peer-to-peer relationships, and even social ties, <u>rather than directed by the boss standing at the apex of a hierarchy. <span style="background: yellow;">The value produced by this labour is</span> therefore</u> ‘beyond measure’, because the immaterial living labour producing value is identified with ‘general social activity’, <u>‘<span style="background: yellow;">a common power to act’ that cannot be disciplined</span></u>, regimented and structured by measuring devices such as clocks. In such circumstances, <u><span style="background: yellow;">exploitation still continues</span></u>, but not through the subjection of labour to capital’s measure. This exploitation continues ‘<u>outside any economic measure: its economic reality is fixed exclusively in political terms</u>’.4 In the context of what Hardt and Negri call Empire, <u>value can at most be indexed ‘on the basis of always contingent and purely conventional elements’ <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: yellow;">imposed by ‘the monopoly of nuclear arms</span></span>, the control of money, and the colonization of ether’</u>.5 Yet, we argue in this paper, the war over measure continues right there, at the point of immaterial, self-organised and cooperative production. <u><span style="background: yellow;">Capital</span> is</u> indeed <u>pervasive</u>, and its means of measurement often appear distant and elusive. But <u>they</u> nevertheless <u><span style="background: yellow;">contribute to the constitution of the norms and modes of production</span></u>, the how?, how much?, how long? and how many? that delimit our social doing. While thinkers such as Hardt and Negri are celebrating the impossibility of measuring immaterial production, the heirs of Frederick Taylor and Dickens’ Gradgrind are attempting just that. <u>An army of economists</u>, statisticians, management scientists and consultants, information specialists, accountants, bureaucrats, political strategists and others <u>is engaged in a struggle</u> to commensurate heterogeneous concrete human activities on the basis of equal quantities of human labour in the abstract, that is, <u>to link work and value</u>. Far from the law of value being redundant as Negri (and Hardt) have suggested, <u>it is increasingly assuming the form of a struggle over measure even on the realm of immaterial production</u>.<br />

In short, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">one of the major differences between ‘open societies’ and their (closed) counterparts behind the Iron Curtain was that the former encouraged the critical testing of the knowledge and decisions of the powerful and assessing them against liberal democratic principles</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">The latter tolerated criticism only on rare and limited occasions. For some, this represented the triumph of rational-scientific methods of inquiry and techniques of falsification. For others, especially since positivism and rationalism have lost much of their allure, it means that for society to become open and liberal, sectors of the population must be independent of the state and free to question its knowledge and power. One must be able to say ‘why’ to power and proclaim ‘no’ to power. Though we do not expect this position to be accepted by every reader, contributors to this book believe that critical dialogue is long overdue in Australia and needs to be listened to. For all its liberal democratic trappings, Australia’s </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">security community continues to invoke closed monological narratives on defense and security.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This book also questions the distinctions between policy practice and academic theory that informs conventional accounts of Australian security. One of its major concerns, particularly in chapters 1 and 2, is to illustrate how theory is integral to the practice of security analysis and policy prescription. </span><u><span style="background: lime; font-size: 10pt;">The book also calls on policy-makers</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, academics and students of defense and security <span style="background: lime;">to think critically about what they are</span> reading, <span style="background: lime;">writing and saying</span>; to begin to ask, of their work and study, difficult and searching questions raised in other disciplines; <span style="background: lime;">to recognize</span>, no matter how uncomfortable it feels, that what is involved in theory and practice is not the ability to identify a replacement for failed models, but a realization <span style="background: lime;">that terms and concepts </span>– state sovereignty, balance of power, security, and so on – <span style="background: lime;">are </span>contested and problematic, and that the world is <span style="background: lime;">indeterminate, always becoming what is written about it. Critical analysis which shows how particular kinds of theoretical presumptions can effectively exclude vital areas of political life from analysis has direct practical implications for policymakers</span>, academics and citizens who face the daunting task of steering Australia through some potentially choppy international waters over the next few years</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There is also much interest in the chapters for those struggling to give meaning to a world where so much that has long been taken for granted now demands imaginative, incisive reappraisal. The contributors, too, have struggled to find meaning, often despairing at the terrible human costs of international violence. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is why readers will find no single, fully formed panacea for the world’s ills in general</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, or Australia’s security in particular. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are none</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Ever chapter, however in its own way, offers something more than is found in orthodox literature, often by exposing ritualistic Cold War defense and security mind-sets that are dressed up as new thinking. Chapters 7 and 9, for example, present alternative ways of engaging in security and defense practice. Others (chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8) seek to alert policymakers, academics and students to alternative theoretical possibilities that might better serve an Australian community pursuing security and prosperity in an uncertain world.</span> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">All chapters confront the policy community and its counterparts in the academy with a deep awareness of the intellectual and material constraints imposed by dominant traditions of realism, but they avoid dismissive and exclusionary terms which often in the past characterized exchanges between policy-makers and their critics. This is because,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as noted earlier</span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, attention needs to be paid to the words and the thought process of those being criticized.</span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A close reading of this kind draws attention to underlying assumptions, showing they need to be recognized and questioned<span style="background: lime;">.

It also encompasses much of Australia’s academic defense and security community located primarily though not exclusively within the Australian National University and the University College of the University of New South Wales. These discursive processes are examined in detail in subsequent chapters as authors attempt to make sense of a politics of exclusion and closure which exercises disciplinary power over Australia’s security community. They also question the discourse of ‘regional security’, ‘security cooperation’, ‘peacekeeping’ and ‘alliance politics’ that are central to Australia’s official and academic security agenda in the 1990s.</span> <u><span style="background: lime; font-size: 10pt;">This is </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">seen as <span style="background: lime;">an important task especially when</span></span></u><span style="background: lime; font-size: 8pt;">,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> as it revealed, </span><u><span style="background: lime; font-size: 10pt;">the disciplines of <span style="border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">I</span></span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">nternational <span style="background: lime; border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">R</span>elations and Strategic Studies <span style="background: lime;">are under challenge from critical </span>and theoretical <span style="background: lime;">debates </span>ranging across the social sciences and humanities; <span style="background: lime;">debates that are nowhere to be found</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in Australian defense and security studies.

Or resistant to them, or choose not to understand them, and why? To summarize: a central concern of this book is to democratize the defense and security theory/practice process in Australia so that restrictions on debate can be understood and resisted. </span><u><span style="background: lime; font-size: 10pt;">This is a crucial enterprise in an </span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">analytical/ <span style="background: lime;">policy environment dominated by particularly rigid variants of realism which have become so powerful and unreflective that they are</span> no longer recognized simply as particular ways of constituting the world, but as <span style="background: lime; border-bottom: windowtext 1pt solid; border-left: windowtext 1pt solid; border-right: windowtext 1pt solid; border-top: windowtext 1pt solid; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">descriptions of the real-as reality itself</span>.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">The consequences of this (silenced) theory-as-practice may be viewed every day in the poignant, distressing monuments to analytical/policy metooism at the Australian (Imperial) War Memorial in Canberra and the many other monuments to young Australians in towns and cities around the country. </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">These are the flesh and blood installments of an insurance policy strategy which, tragically, remains integral to</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Australian realism, despite claims of a new mature independent identity in the 1990s. This is what unfortunately, </span><u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">continues to be at stake in the potentially deadly debates over defense and security revealed in this book. For this reason alone, it should be regarded as a positive and constructive contribution to debate by those who are the targets of its criticisms.</span></u></span></span><br />

But precisely because</span> <u>immigration affects the scale, geographical distribution, and skill composition of the labor force, it affects national, regional and local labor market conditions</u>. <span style="font-size: 80%;">Hence,</span> <u>organized labor can never ignore immigration trends<strong>.<span style="background: aqua;"> Immigration</span></strong> has in the past and <strong><span style="background: aqua;">continues to</span></strong> this day to <strong><span style="background: aqua;">affect</span> the developmental course of <span style="background: aqua;">American trade unionism</span></strong></u><span style="background: aqua;">. <strong><u>Labor's responses</u></strong></span><u>, in turn<strong>, <span style="background: aqua;">have</span> significantly <span style="background: aqua;">influenced</span> the actual public <span style="background: aqua;">policies that have shaped</span> the size and character of <span style="background: aqua;">immigrant entries</span></strong></u><strong><span style="background: aqua;">.</span></strong><span style="background: aqua;"> <u>If organized labor seeks restrictions on immigration</u> </span><u>levels as well as the active enforcement of prevailing laws, <span style="background: aqua;">it risks alienating itself from the immigrants and makes it difficult to organize </span>them.</u> O<span style="font-size: 80%;">n the other hand, if they welcome immigrants, endorse liberal admission policies, favor lax law enforcement and support amnesties for violators, selective segments of the labor supply are inflated and the ensuing market pressures make it more difficult for unions to win economic gains for their membership.</span> <u><span style="background: aqua;">The reason most</span> workers <span style="background: aqua;">join unions</span> in the United States <span style="background: aqua;">is</span>, after all, largely <span style="background: aqua;">because they believe unions can </span>improve and <span style="background: aqua;">protect their economic well-being. </span>It also means that organized<span style="background: aqua;"> labor's support for immigrant causes would be adverse to interests of</span> those <span style="background: aqua;">American workers who do not belong to unions and</span> who would <span style="background: aqua;">face increased competition for jobs</span> as well as wage suppres</u>s.<span style="font-size: 80%;"> On pressures. Hence,</span> <u><span style="background: aqua;">immigration has always been a &quot;no-win&quot; situation for American unions</span>.</u> <span style="font-size: 80%;">At every juncture and with no exception prior to the 1980s, the union movement either directly instigated or strongly supported every legislative initiative enacted by Congress to restrict immigration and to enforce its policy provisions.!</span> <u>Labor leaders intuitively sensed that <span style="background: aqua;">fluctuations in union membership were inversely related to</span></u> prevailing <u><span style="background: aqua;">immigration tends<strong>.

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">Less frequent within these current academic discussions, however, is either a conversation about the role that worsening conditions in the workplace have had in exacerbating political and economic inequality, or a more general interest in worker rights and workplace democracy. This silence is not because workplace democracy has become a reality since the time of Dahl’s writing; far from</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> it</span><strong><u>. <span style="background: aqua;">Democracy</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: aqua;"> i</span>n the workplace, <strong><span style="background: aqua;">as well as a broader set of rights</span>, securities, <span style="background: aqua;">and protections for workers, have</span> all <span style="background: aqua;">declined</span> in an economic and political climate that has</strong> empowered employers and <strong>disempowered labor unions</strong> and the individual rights of many workers</u>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">In this essay, I begin with a review of the findings presented in a recent publication by LawrenceMishel, Jared Bernstein, andHeidi Shierholz, The State of Working America, 2008/2009. In the book, the authors detail disturbing economic trends in the areas of family income, individual wages and benefits, employment patterns, and distribution of wealth. The statistics they provide are systematic and powerful reminders of what have become increasingly apparent trends in the modern American economy and society: rising inequality, a struggling middle class, a declining working class, and a continuing trend of significant economic disparities between races. Many of these statistics are familiar to political scientists, even those with a scant interest in inequality. But my broader purpose in discussing The State of Working America is to urge political scientists to return to the concerns expressed by Dahl and others about democracy in the workplace and its linkages to democracy in American society</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <u>Inequality in America is not just about increasing wage and capital differentials and policy retrenchments; to fully encompass an explanation of rising inequality and its impact on everyday society</u><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> we also need to engage with events and trends in the private sector, and particularly the increasing power differentials between employers and employees</span>. <strong><u>Inequality <span style="background: aqua;">in the workplace lays the foundations of</span> many of the <span style="background: aqua;">ills that befall democratic society</span></u></strong>—<u><span style="background: aqua;">a demobilized and insecure workforce and an increasingly powerful elite that with the benefit of resources and legality has operated outside the purview of democratic <strong>procedures and accountability</strong></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In part</span>, <strong><u><span style="background: aqua;">declining rights in the workplace are due to the declining relevance of American labor unions.</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">In the last few decades, labor unions have lost members in dramatic proportions—a result of many factors, including structural changes in the economy and intensified employer opposition, violence, and intimidation toward union organizing. 6 But inequality at work is not just about declining unions. White-collar workers—including those who work in the legal and technical professions and professors in academia—are working longer hours with less job security and fewer benefits.</span> <u>Rising numbers of <span style="background: aqua;">immigrant</span> worker<span style="background: aqua;">s have come to the U</span>nited <span style="background: aqua;">S</span>tates <span style="background: aqua;">with expectations</span> of job opportunities, <span style="background: aqua;">only to find themselves</span> increasingly <span style="background: aqua;">exploited with low wages and poor working conditions, and</span> by employers <span style="background: aqua;">taking advantage of unenforced labor laws and the threat of deportation</span></u>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Laws protecting employees from sexual and racial harassment and workplace discrimination have been narrowed and made more difficult to enforce by having subjected plaintiffs to higher standards of proof and employer intent</span><span style="color: #231f20;">.</span></span><br />
