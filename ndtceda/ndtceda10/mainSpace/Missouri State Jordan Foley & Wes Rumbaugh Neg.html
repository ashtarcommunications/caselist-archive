 Interpretation: The Aff's burden is to prove that a policy that follows within the confines of the resolution that challenges White Supremacy is better than the status quo and/or a competitive policy option.<br />
Role-playing is a form of defiant deliberative politics that reclaims the political sphere and leads to new epistemic standards for eveluation outside of the current racist worldview.<br />
Jessica Kulynych Polity, Winter 97, n2 p315(32)<br />
When we look at...diverse and participatory democracy.<br />
<br />
Policy debates ensure massive amounts of intensive research that produces knowledge of how the levers of power operate as well as ensuring success outside of debate<br />
Specie and Lyle 3 &quot;traditional policy debate: now more than ever&quot;<br />
policy debate is an excellent...part to their research skills (Parcher, 1996).<br />
<br />
This also spills over to political and social awareness spurring action and activism<br />

The impact is loss of clash and education in debate<br />
Speice and Lyle 3<br />
Reality is that this...fairness and competitive equity.<br />
<br />
1ac posits their advocacy in the realm of emancipatory rhetoric--the injection of this type of argumentation into competitive debates distorts and corrupts their project because not only are there structural impediments to productive discussions like speech structure and time constraints, but the strategic deployment of their project in order to win debates makes their aff counterproductive<br />
Brian McGee 2 &quot;Emancipatory Rhetoric in an Instrumental Milieu: Habermas and Academic Debate&quot; in 'Transforming Debate' p. 10-22<br />
What is the point of....and an instrumental rationale.<br />
<br />
This reduction of social change to counting wins and ballots fails to create progressive change. Winning debates is not a product of changing people minds but because of distortions in the communicative process that render your form of activism ineffective<br />
McGee 2<br />
I read Habermas as...norm governing such discourse.<br />
<br />
Methodological criticisms of our evidence base on the institutionalized nature of race does not warrant simply ignoring it<br />
Martyn Hammersley 93 British Journal of Sociology &quot;Research and 'anti-racism': the case of Peter Foster and his critics,&quot; 44.3, 11-93, Jstor<br />
Various sorts of criticism...others are blinded by ideology.<br />

Fairness is a prerequisite for their Aff- some restrictions are necessary for it to gain influence in debate<br />

Conceived as a dialogue,...competitive and ontological potential.<br />

Don't let them get away with playing the &quot;all your evidence is a product of racism&quot; card- you should hold their arguments to rigorous logical standards and not simply dismiss our evidence as 'just another link'<br />

What we are attempting in this article AND and the international differently.<br />

Policy implications are necessary to test theory—a legitimate alternative must describe<br />
