<h1 id="toc0"><a name="Act 1: The Set Up"></a>Act 1: The Set Up</h1>
 <br />
I am a prisoner, limbs shackled with the corrosive grip of metal and I am bound. Bound to one way of being. My word lays before me, edges extending to nothingness, flashes of brightness offer the promise of total illumination but in flits, my world exists in fragrments.<br />
<br />
I am offered nothing more.<br />
<br />
Unitl I am. <br />
<br />
First the binds are removed from my wrist. Muscle memory runs through me. Bodily discovery. Personal catastrophe. What I am? What can I do? How do I move- like the shadows across my wall- but I do not flit about randomly, i remain motionless until the desire for motion consumes me and I discover will- or at least I will it to be- I am free, rising from the shadows I seek the light, prepared to fight for what must be mine.<br />
<br />
But the sun leaves shadows I cannot eliminate, I discover my powerlessness and I am a prisoner. Limbs shackled with the knowledge imperative and I am bound. Bound to rationality. Self bound in a forced choice-<br />
<br />
I explore my choice.I can choose to continue to use the lables that trap me, demand a being forever beyond reach, or I can reach my own sort of freedom discover ways to play my relationship to the sun, I am one who can make my own illustrations, through configurations of my words, observe the sounds of my shadows. Listen:<br />
<br />
To the story of the Bakkai. Go back to Ancient Greece, to the city of Thebes, see Pentheus the young King, with his knowledge he strives to do right by his people, protecting his rule, he hears word of the impending visit of a foreign god, fog surrounds what he can expect, in an act of disrespect he wages war on the god, he instructs the mob to ignore any and every of the strangers wishes, those who wish to participate make their lives subject to a violent fate, there is no wait before constructing barriers, the foreign god shall not enter. But Dionysos cannot be contained by petty preparations, there is no station that can force such a force to stop, so does Pentheus stop his hopeless task?<br />
<br />
No. The child-king continues his foolish operation. Operating under delusions of omnipotent control, he seeks to control all that is Dionysos. such a crisis when the god appears before his face, a moment, and his confident grin erased, he is lead from his established location towards temptation to transgress what he knows, does he want to know the secrets of the Divine? How to exist beyond time? He cannot help but submit to the ultimate siren song, moving him along from the throne in his palace, through the lavish halls and into a changing room, changing his appearance to assume the costume of an honest worshiper, deceived and deceiver, he blindly falls into Dionysos”s trap.<br />
<br />
Entrapped in inevitable snares, King Pentheus, unaware, marches beyond the walls of the city-state, ready to have the mysteries of fate layed clean, the invisible made seen, but dream-god Dionysos delivers no such fact, in fact, acts swiftly and cruely, abandoning the king to a swarm of raging maenads, mad on divine ecstasy, releasing their rage on the limbs of the king, torn clean, into pieces, blood bathing the women in murderous rapture, taking their capture, now deceased back through the gates of Thebes. Agave, mother to the late King, leads the pack, proudly, with Pentheus”s head in her grasp, until the mood passes, and all realize what an transpired, fired with shame, the murderous family awaits the execution of what is to come.<br />
<br />
Dionysos comes into the realm where he had not been made welcome, welcomed now through obligation, shame and humiliation, all those who had kept him out were kicked out, exiled and sold into perpetual misery, such slavery was only attributable to their own fault, had they heeded the shouts of caution against the precautions they took, had they not looked away from the drive to always find, and make seen, total illumination obscene in its oblivating power, if only they could take back the hour when they had sealed their fate. Would they open the gates to all Dionysos? <br />
<br />
Listen:<br />
<br />
To the story of the immigrant. Go back to the United States, to the southern edge of Texas, see Maxiums, the border king, at least he might as well be, presiding over a given tract of land, his big guns his big plan to keep Dionysos out, word of his coming is out, through the words and images projected on screens, screaming at each soul to know and be prepared, or prepare to be desecrated, women and children violated, the same imperative to act, demands actions in a certain way, Maximus obeys. Tossing money to build walls destined to be scaled, failed measures contrasted with increased unity, but Dionysos cannot be contained by petty preparations, there is no stations that can force such a millioned multitude to stop, Does Maximus stop his hopeless task? <br />
<br />
Go back to the United States, to the eastern edge of New York, JFK airport, see Ellen, the border king, or at least she might as well be, presiding over a given domain, her tamed hair and strict skirt skirt the issues of her methods of enforcement, forcing her will out of those denied will in their choice of occupation, forcing designation of victimhood, or they head back to conditions from which they came, shame shines brightly from her applicants cheeks she is pleased with her position of power, but in a moment her mood can sour, and dionyosos is denied, such pressure to lie but for every victory a smarter enemy is brought into being. deceiving made insidious, in an attempt to avoid exodus, but dionysos cannot be contained by petty preparations, there is no station that can force her into a way of being. that can make him stop. Does Ellen stop her controlling games?<br />
<br />
Go back to the United States, to the western edge of California, to the capital buildings in downtown Sacremento, note Jeremy, the border king, or at least he might as well be, presiding over levers of power, at quiet hours money is passed to ensure bills passed that let the right workers in, keep the wrong workers out, work out so that we benefit everyone by some claims, or just ourselves by another, you discover such conflicting accounts of economics, each spout out their own truths, without establishing truth, not that it matters, do we come to profit or perish, can we share this analysis is any productive ways for in each justification , they presumed the cooperation of Dionysos as he arrives from another land, but she will not let herself fall into such a plan, good and bad, she is, he is not stopped, does Jermey stop his desperate manipulations?<br />
<br />
The situations play out, in laughable configurations, but only if we learn to laugh at what is and yet to pass, we can pass up the conditions that ensure our subjugation or must we tie ourselves to slavery advertised through perpetual misery, control is appealing but might we look somewhere else, to our selves, before looking out, proving we are out of the matrixed prison, we welcome out in, our strength within enough to bear it, sharing our strength through the act of benevolence . Out of reverence we extend the act of guest- friendship to every dionysos. Stanzione explains:  <br />

We affirm this interpretation though the offer to Dionysos. <br />

<h1 id="toc1"><a name="Act 2: The Confrontation"></a>Act 2: The Confrontation</h1>
 <br />
My stories, woven through words, emerge from a play with shadows; the way in which I position myself aligns with all around me so that we can be the results. An alteration of ideas, drawn from the chaotic ether, ephemeral until placed into a given form. What have I formed? My stories and self take on a particular meaning, leaning towards the tragic, as fate would have it, the borderland art. Douglass Smith explains <br />
<span class="Underline">tragedy “represents a fusion of the Apollonian and the Dionysian, a combination of the plastic art of sculpture with the formless art of music which produces a powerful visible representation of a spiritual state.”</span><span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2;">[[file:<em>/C:/Users/Steven/Downloads/1ac round 3.doc#_ftn2|[2]]]</span><span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This state is embodied in presentation, offered for affirmation, a permutation of two strands. First the Dionysian: all that is fluid, movement, drunkenness as release from inhibitions, regulations, celebration of life, roll the dice and affirm. What is existence if not absurd? You have heard how Pentheus aimed to deal with Dionysos, how the United States aims to deal with Dionysos, we reject this crisis and affirm, through the play in my words, and the images I paint with my tongue, he is come among us. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Lust for life is not limited to a singular affirmation, complication offers a source of enrichment, enriching our view, we affirm the Apollonian too. Included, through the use of structure, order, standardized states, mediating fate into forms available for process, pressed into a precarious balance, necessary, for remember the servants of Dionysos untempered, terrifying maenads intent on murderous rage, stages only to wreck destruction, no way to function, an impasse, passable through combination. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Should you desire further explanation, listen: </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">My voice pours forth from</span> my body, flow through my lips, words escaping from the binds of the subject, transformed into objects, transformed into a resource, birthing ideas into a force- exerting agency and affect beyond any single component, the creation of a given configuration, extending beyond this time, joining with the eternal chorus. Douglass Smith pulses through me and I speak “<span class="Underline">the chorus incarnates what he calls the 'metaphysical consolation' of tragedy, the reassuring insight that life itself remains fundamentally indestructible and pleasurable in spite of the suffering and death implied in individual existence”. </span><span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3;">[[file:</em>/C:/Users/Steven/Downloads/1ac round 3.doc#_ftn3|[3]]]</span><span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The words offer a barrier between the staged and the real, really offering the Dionysian to the Apollonian spectator, creator of balance and mediation. The confrontation calls into question the worth of separation, the methods of evaluating the text, debate, and immigration. We return synthesis through the chorus, affirming tragic as joyous.  </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />

<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<h1 id="toc2"><a name="Act 3: The Resolution"></a>Act 3: The Resolution</h1>
 <br />
The confrontation operates on various levels. <span class="Underline">Levelling first with the criticism aimed at the Bakkai, that Euripides shot too high in his desire for tragedy to make sense rationally, imposing the Socratic promise of knowledge, never knowing the ecstatic release of tragic mythic art, he departs with aggressive rationalism, rejecting pessimism, we return both with the chorus, affirming tragic as joyous. Creating balance. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">The second level operates in the world of the round, how the sound presents a mode for affirmation, consideration called for the tragic approach, approach this as a member of the chorus, your voice joins with us through the ballot, and forget the limited approach of Pentheus and the US, no longer suppress the inevitable force. Lend your force to our message: </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The United States Federal Government should extend visas to Dionysos. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">This brings us to the third level on which the presentation works, in the search for how to approach immigration, we offer the tragic method of affirmation. This approach moves away from the individual in embracing the collective, the chorus neither proves no disproves the Resolution. There is no way to resolve such a stance without regressing back in to the trance of the Socratic will to truth. Forget truth and look to the strength of our values. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Valuing beneficence flows naturally from the position, supports the supposition of the guest-friendship model, may our speech be modelled in the Greek tradition, creating new models necessary to the task of recreating our relationship to the Dionysian other. In the worlds of Allessand Von Burg “</span><u>the &quot;robust ignorance&quot; of ancient people prompted an imaginative effort through which they created wonderful and sublime concepts</u> … <u>imagination creates</u> (&quot;imagine a thing and at once believe it&quot;) a<u>nd that poetic wisdom originates in the senses and in the ability to imagine through metaphors</u> … <u>the world of nations is clearly a human creation; while all nations &quot;think they were the very first to invent the comforts of human life, and they preserve memories of their history from the beginning of the world,&quot; their time eventually …</u> <u>creations have logical appeal because imagination draws on our reservoir of knowledge and memories to shape new visions that become common sense, because we never really let go of what we already accept as valid</u> .”<br />
<br />
Our process of creation is particularly necessary with the history of immigration. For “<u>An understanding of citizenship as separated from nationality and tied to residency</u>, however, i<u>s revolutionary</u> and unorthodox. W<u>e don't have the proper language to describe it logically, and we compensate for this linguistic lack with vivid images that connect what we do not know with what we are familiar with. …New visions require new metaphors</u> t<u>hey are imagined first, but they are based on what we already know.”<span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn4;">[[file:<em>/C:/Users/Steven/Downloads/1ac round 3.doc#_ftn4|</u>[4]<u>]]</span></u> <br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">The Dionysian visa is a rhetorical and ontological intervention, a necessary invention to shape the way we integrate as immigrants. Following the footsteps of Joseph Stanzione we affirm the model of the Hellenic guide, guiding the other into the self, in an affirmation of self. Else we collapse into weakened wills we will beneficence to the other and not-other united through shared homelessness, our homes having collapsed since the death of god, we grow odd, estranged from any permanent location, we wander, pessimistic immigration, dissipating education, syncretic information through poetic thought- not relegated to an object of study but rather invigorating and changing how we approach study- studied through the chorus. Welcome Dionysos.  </span><br />
