We read one new Rodriquez card in our standard 1NC its at the bottom. Here is the full 1NC<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">The only ethical demand available to modern politics is that of the Slave and the Savage, the demand for the end of America itself. This cry, born out of the belly of slave ships and the churning vertigo of constitutive genocide, exposes the grammar of the Affirmative’s calls for larger institutional access as a fundamental fortification of White Settler and Slave Master civil society by its diversionary focus on the ethicality of the policies and practices of the United States as opposed to the <em>a priori</em> question its very existence. This silence of the Affirmative’s assumptive logic renders them unaccountable to the revolutionary political ontology of Redness and Blackness and thereby sets the stage for the various dramas of conflictual relationships i.e. class struggle, gender conflict, immigrants rights, etc. that are made possible by the antagonism between Settler and Savage, Master and Slave.<br />
Wilderson 2010 [Frank B., killed apartheid officials in South Africa, nuff said, <em>Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms</em>, pages 1-5]<br />
<br />
<br />
AND<br />
While the afterlife of slavery is far from an abstraction in the lived reality of blackness, recourse to the sociological empirics of suffering already codifies the category of “exploitation” as the base grammar of suffering, ignoring the gratuitousness of anti-black violence and enshrining the call for more public policy as the limit point of our revolutionary demands. This elides the way in which civil society is parasitic on The Middle Passage and thus how Humanity itself can only be constituted in opposition to the fundamentally anti-Human position of the slave. It is this libidinal economy of anti-blackness which exists as the condition of possibility for the violence of the world.<br />

Anti-blackness is the condition of possibility for anti-immigrant violence<br />

<br />
And this structure of wanton and gratuitous violence operates through the ritualistic seduction of fraudulent ethics represented by the Affirmative’s attempt to make civil society better. It is precisely this illusion that underwrites the ignorability of white supremacist violence, thereby ensuring its ongoing constitutive machinations.<br />

<strong>White racialized identity is the condition of possibility for US interventionism. The cultural paranoia and consensus building based off of this paranoia of whiteness is what fuels our messianism in other countries.</strong><br />

<br />
Thus we should focus our energies and points of attention on an unflinching paradigmatic analysis that calls for the end of America.<br />

The atrocities that spasmodically erupt across the globe at the behest of structures of U.S. hegemony result from the naturalization of ongoing domestic warfare whose instantiation of a living apocalypse takes place within the context of black, brown and indigenous extermination. <br />

They read the same 1NC as below. Their argument, or atleast they way it was explained, was that the visa system is rooted in whiteness (people who get EB visas rely on US universities which are ultimately funded by the military industrial complex, they made a link arg to answer nuke power by saying that uranium mining is oppressive, etc). Their main trick is that liberal policies like the plan are already occurring and failing, and that we need a more violent and radical solution that calls for the End of America. They say that radical solutions like the Black Panthers are more effective for change. They make some framework arguments that we don't have &quot;our hands on the lever&quot; so we can't actually produce real change.<br />
