The rhetorical strategy of the affirmative is being deployed to propel and justify police action, deportations, and an exclusionary worldview. Rhetoric and state action are deeply intertwined. <br />

). Their 1AC evidence, especially claims of solvency and emancipation for individual-visa holders, only serves as a mask on an oppressive structure. They assume piece-meal reform of immigration policy is possible and capable of magical salvation. 1AC Ratzanberger ev even states that the “plumbers, electricians, welders, carpenters…and other &quot;essentials&quot; are key! It is this mindset which directly attempt to manage and control populations. These people are defined as immigrants, then grouped into legal and illegal status, and then commodified in the form of commerce—an economic entity. Reject this form of identification.<br />

little b) Managing Entrance is a prelude to total Extermination. The separation of people into different worlds in the name of national unity, western democracy, or economic stability are all violations of the One world principle— The aff rigorously bolsters State mechanisms that magnify false ontological distinctions—between those who are allowed to belong to our ‘world’ and those who are not—as a way to hide this failure which paves the way for persecution, prohibition, and mass extermination.<br />

Why has what the politicians and the servile … bitter defence of the privileges of wealth and power.<br />
To justify their rhetorical bullying they articulate fearful “impacts” and “scenarios”. This is essentially a “bullying move”—a rhetorical threat of what might happen to us in the future if we do not accept the meaning of these violent predictions and representations.<br />

[Power relations play a crucial role in determining the direction in which this …natural selection and imitation. They might also due so through learning. <br />
Vote against their ontology of commodification. Commodification as an Ontology must be rejected on face, regardless of its own internal ethics and justifications for self-preservation. This means THEY CANNOT ACCES THEIR CASE IMPACTS and the commerce link arguments are voting issues.<br />

Because modern humanity's … ontology proceeds ethics.<br />
Managing entrance locks in oppressive state power. The implication is worse than bare-life because it is a mask of emancipation. <br />

INHERENCY<br />
No inherency—as of September 29th, six months after the start of the current application cycle, the cap hasn’t even been hit. The aff has nothing to solve.
