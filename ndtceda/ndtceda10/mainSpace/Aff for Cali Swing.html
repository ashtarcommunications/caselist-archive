<span style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">BANGALORE: </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">US protectionism is assuming a new, and perhaps a more insidious</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">and indirect, <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>form</u></span></strong>. <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>US consulates in the country are said to be rejecting many more business visas</u> </span></strong>(B1, L1, H1) <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>over these past few months than earlier and visa interviews are bordering on interrogations. Indian IT companies say there is also greater aggression among immigration personnel at US airports towards Indians who come to the US on valid business visas, with several professionals being even deported.</u></span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>The situation has reached such a pass that IT industry body Nasscom has been forced to intervene. Nasscom has written a letter to the US ambassador in India</u></span></strong>, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Timothy Roemer , raising the concerns. When contacted, Nasscom declined to give details, but said it had received complaints from member-companies and had taken the issue up “appropriately” with the US embassy in New Delhi. The letter is said to have pointed out that the firms affected are all “perfectly good companies” which have “met all guidelines”. Nasscom said it had also conveyed the matter to the Indian government . Whether it will come up in discussions with US President Barack Obama when he visits India later this week remains to be seen. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><br />
Almost <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>every major IT company, including some US MNCs in India, is said to have experienced one or more of these problems. But few wanted to come on record for fear of being victimized.</u> </span></strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">As one said, “We have not even appealed to the US consulate on visa harassment for fear we will put our entire pipeline of visas at risk.”<br />
Pratik Kumar, executive VP for HR in Wipro, said Nasscom represents the concerns of the industry and “hence what they are taking up with the authorities is an expression of concern that is prevailing across the industry”.<br />
<br />
A senior official in one of India’s biggest BPO companies, who did not want her name or her company’s name to be mentioned, narrated a nasty experience their employees went through. </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">In one instance , a group of about 5-6 employees that had landed in New York to undergo 6 weeks training at a new client’s location, was taken to a separate room and put through what she describes as “third-degree questioning</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">” .<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>“They were told they were lying, that all that was written in their documents was fake. They were told that if they signed a letter stating that the company had sent them on an illegal visa, they would be allowed to go without any adverse recording about them. Eventually, they all withdrew their application to enter the US and came back,” she said.<br />
<br />
The fact that the incident took place in a New York airport was of particular concern</u></span></strong>,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"> the official said. “New York and others like Los Angeles have been liberal airports, unlike Philadelphia, Chicago that have been conservative ports. But now it looks like the Philadelphia attitude is spreading to the other ports of entry,” she said. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>In another instance</u></span></strong> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">narrated by a major company, a </span><strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">group of its young employees who went together to the US embassy in Delhi for the visa interview were put in separate rooms and asked questions like “What is your company planning?” and threatening them with a “99-year ban” on travelling to the US. “They were all denied visas</span></u></span></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">,” </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">an official of the company said. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"> </span></span><br />

Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting or sending funds to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate officials try to limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived, corrupt, and reckless policies, they will introduce controls on foreign exchange. Foreign individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain American infrastructure assets, or trying to buy property and other assets on the cheap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be stymied by limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause spasms to ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global payment, settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of course, continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending. </span></span><br />

Airborne or satellite surveillance would be nonintrusive and could help both countries make their cases. Another possibility would be to expand the United Nation’s presence in South Asia to include monitoring the LOC. Currently, India opposes an expanded UN role, as noted above. </span></span><br />

For example, the United States detonated &quot;Little Boy&quot; weapon above Hiroshima at an altitude of 1,900 feet. At this height, the radioactive particles produced in the explosion were small and light enough to rise into the upper atmosphere, where they were carried by the prevailing winds. Days to weeks later, after the radioactive bomb debris became less &quot;hot,&quot; these tiny particles descended to earth as a measurable radioactive residue, but not at levels of contamination that would cause immediate radiation sickness or death. </span></span><br />

If the nuclear explosion takes place at or near the surface of the earth, the nuclear fireball would gouge out material and mix it with the radioactive bomb debris, producing heavier radioactive particles. These heavier particles would begin to drift back to earth within minutes or hours after the explosion, producing potentially lethal levels of nuclear fallout out to tens or hundreds of kilometers from the ground zero. The precise levels depend on the explosive yield of the weapon and the prevailing winds. </span></span><br />

We chose target cities throughout Pakistan and in northwestern India to take into account the limited range of Pakistani missiles or aircraft. The target cities, listed in the table below, include the capitals of Islamabad and New Dehli, and large cities, such as Karachi and Bombay. In this scenario, we assumed that a dozen, 25-kiloton warheads would be detonated as ground bursts in Pakistan and another dozen in India, producing substantial fallout. </span></span><br />

Polachek (1997) and Polachek andSeiglie (2006) argue that wars and disputes between geographically contiguous states involve substantial losses, as more efficient geographically proximate trade is displaced. Figure 2 shows that India-Pakistan official trade (as a proportion of Pakistan’s total international trade) steadily declined from nearly 20% in the early 1950s, plummetingto almost zero after their war in 1965, and has shown some signs of recovery in the 1990s. But it is still below the levels of the 1950s, which was shortly after the two nations separated.

Put simply, the idea is that established democracies do not go to war with each other, but cooperate instead. The intellectual basis for this argument is traced back to Immanuel Kant (1795) work on the Perpetual Peace, where a like mindedness referred to as cosmopolitanism would prevent outright war between republics; a tendency that could be reinforced by commercial interdependence. </span></span><br />

While all analysts agree that war impedes trade, the realist view is that countries may choose to disrupt their potential enemy’s gains from trade by ceasing trade with them, even if this means hostilities. Even if there are losses to the aggregate economy from war or diminished trade, some groups may gain, and these groups may be the more politically influential. For example, Kim and Rousseau (2005) find that conflict diminishes economic interdependence, but not the other way around, providing only partial support for the opportunity cost of trade liberal peace theory. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">WASHINGTON: <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background: yellow;">India has cautioned nations toying with protectionist measures in the wake of the global economic crisis that such a move would not only be counterproductive, but also deepen the recession and delay recovery.</span></u></span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>&quot;<span style="background: yellow;">Any kind of protectionism will not only be counterproductive, but deepen the recession and delay the recovery,</span></u></span></strong><span style="background: yellow;">&quot;</span> Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma told reporters no Thursday at the end of his three-day visit for talks with the US officials.<br />
<br />
&quot;In our opinion, protectionism is counterproductive for any country, because protectionism at a time when we are talking of kick starting the Doha development process would actually go against that spirit,&quot; he said when asked about protectionist trends in the US.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background: yellow;">Protectionism in any legal format would also subvert the multilateral processes and prolong the present economic recession and further delay any turnaround</span></u></span></strong>, he said.<br />
<br />
All nations do eventually take action and policy measures to uphold supreme national interest, he said, but <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background: yellow;">India is also committed to multilateralism. &quot;We are against protectionist measures.&quot; </span></u></span></strong><br />
<span style="background: yellow;"><br />
<strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u>In the US, there was a lack of comprehension and information, particularly about the services sector which forms a major component of Indian exports, he said. &quot;What is perhaps not fully appreciated is that the outflow of services is evenly matched by the inflow of services.&quot;</u></span></strong></span><br />
<br />
Noting that <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background: yellow;">of the Fortune 500 companies, 100 have their research and development hubs in India and another 220 are sourcing their software from it, Sharma said: &quot;Do not forget, if India is such a huge IT industry, where does the hardware come from. That is why any protectionist barrier is dangerous.</span></u></span></strong><span style="background: yellow;">&quot;</span><br />
<br />
Referring to a report he released Wednesday, Sharma said the <strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"><u><span style="background: yellow;">Indian industry brought in over $106 billion in economic activity to the US last year and created 300,000 jobs. Indian IT industry alone has created 250,000 jobs in America.</span></u> </span></strong><br />
<br />
&quot;It is reciprocity, which has to be acknowledged and appreciated,&quot; he said. </span></span>
