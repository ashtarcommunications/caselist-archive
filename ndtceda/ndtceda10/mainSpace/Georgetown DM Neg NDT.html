The United States Federal make first-preference access to the diversity visa available to all individuals that meet all T-visa requirements other than the requirement for co-operation with law enforcement and the requirement that an individual have undergone force, fraud or coercion. Recipients will be eligible for identical benefits covered under the T-visa. <br />

 <br />
The United States Federal Government should train Department of Homeland Security agents to assess eligibility for the T visa and put those agents in charge of making such eligibility determinations, specifically with regard to victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement. The United States Federal Government should provide a waiver for the cooperation requirement for T visas to individuals when cooperation will more likely than not result in severe harm to the individuals’ family members abroad. The United States Attorney General should grant Continue Presence status to temporary derivative family members of trafficking victims and assist in their relocation to the United States. The United States Federal Government should remove current numerical limits on T-visas and remove the requirement that an individual have undergone force, fraud or coercion in order to be eligible for a T-visa. Congress should amend the IRCA to impose sanctions on employers regardless of their actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, or reckless disregard of their employees' unauthorized status Congress should eliminate the term &quot;knowing&quot; in section 1324a and revise the statute as follows: “It is unlawful for a person or other entity ... to hire, or to recruit or refer for a fee, for employment in the United States an unauthorized alien regardless of the person or entity's knowledge that the alien is an unauthorized alien.”<br />

Nair 6/6/10<br />
Yasmin Nair is a Chicago-based writer, activist, academic, and commentator. Which mostly means that she struggles to pay rent while living the glamorous life of a freelance writer. Her work appears in Windy City Times, where she is a columnist, reporter, photographer, and book reviewer. Her work has also appeared and/or appears in venues like Discourse, GLQ, make/shift, Time Out Chicago, Bitch magazine and Maximum Rock'n'Roll. Her writing and organising address neoliberalism, inequality, and the politics of rescue and affect; the immigration crisis; queer politics and theory, and the contours of a ridiculous gay movement that pretends that the right to marry, the right to kill, and hate crimes legislation actually constitute some kind of leftist agenda.<br />
She is part of the editorial collective of Against Equality (www.againstequality.org) and a member of the Chicago grassroots organisation Gender JUST (Justice United for Societal Transformation).<br />

From 1994 to 1997 I worked on my Ph.D. thesis with the title &quot;Strangers, Ambivalence and Social Theory&quot;, followed by another research project focused on the sociology of mobility. During 1998-1999 I held an assistant professorship at Roskilde University, Department of Geography. I came to Lancaster in September 1999. My present research consists of two projects: &quot;Revolt, Revolution, Critique - The Paradox of Society&quot; and &quot;The Sociology of Terrorism&quot;. In general I work on social theory, political philosophy, urbanism, post-structuralism and ethnicity/immigration.<br />
