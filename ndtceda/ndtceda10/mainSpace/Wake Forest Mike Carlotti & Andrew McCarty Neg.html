Where weapons are expensive, free trade brings prosperity and freedom. Where weapons bring terror, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">free trade fosters harmony and encourages people to resolve disputes without violence</span></u><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Richard Cobden, a nineteenth century British industrialist and politician, often argued in favor of trade over armaments to discourage war. His recipe for peace remains as true today as it was more than 150 years ago: “The more any nation traffics abroad upon free and honest principles, the less it will be in danger of wars.” Free trade is indeed the wellspring of peace.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance </span></u><u>in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere</u>; until recently, <u>Europe; and</u> now, increasingly, <u>Central Asia.</u> This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. <u>Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is</u> also <u>engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia</u>, with <u>Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.</u> The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as “No. 1” and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system.

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Are the trends in the various measures of human well-being improving as globalization marches on? Have gaps in these measures between the rich and the poor countries widened and, if they have, is globalization responsible? Figure 1, based on cross-country data, shows that <u>various</u> <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">indicators of human wellbeing improve as countries become wealthier, with improvements coming most rapidly at the lowest levels of wealth</span></u><u>.</u> There are several possible explanations for this association. First, economic development indeed improves these indicators. Greater wealth translates into greater resources for researching and developing new technologies that directly or indirectly advance human well-being.19 It also means increased resources for advancing literacy and education, which, too, are generally conducive to greater technological innovation and diffusion. 20 Equally important, wealthier societies are better able to afford new as well as existing, but underused, technologies.21 For instance, <u>with respect to health</u>—captured in Figure 1 by both infant mortality and life expectancy— <u>these include</u> <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">“old” technologies such as water treatment to produce safe water, sanitation, basic hygiene, vaccinations</span></u><u>,</u> <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">antibiotics, insect and vector control, and pasteurizatio</span></u><u>n,22 as well as newer science-based technologies such as</u> <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">AIDS and oral rehydration therapies, organ transplants, mammograms, and other diagnostic tests.</span></u> <u>They also include agricultural technologies that increase crop yields, thereby increasing available food supplies and reducing hunger and malnourishment,</u> <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">which then reduces the toll of infectious and parasitic diseases</span></u><u>.</u> 23 4 Historically, reducing hunger and undernourishment has been among the first practical steps nations have taken to improve public health. That step has reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy.24 And if despite increased food production a country is still short of food, <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">greater wealth makes it possible, through trade, to purchase food security</span></u><u>.25</u> <u><span style="background: #00ffff;">Greater wealth also makes it more likely that a society will establish and sustain food programs for those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder</span></u>.26 Therefore, while “you can’t eat GDP,”27 the larger GDP is, the less likely you are to go hungry or be undernourished. As Figure 1 illustrates, greater wealth, through a multiplicity of mechanisms—higher literacy, greater food supplies, and greater access to safe water— leads to better health.28 effect, devoting what once was literally a lifetime to learning their trade. And having acquired expertise, those doctors and researchers are poised to contribute to technological innovation and diffusion in their chosen fields and to guide others along the same path. Thus better health helps raise human capital, which aids the creation and diffusion of technology and thereby further advances health and accelerates economic growth. Both wealth’s and health’s causes and effects probably reinforce each other in a set of interlinked cycles. One such cycle is the health-wealth cycle in which—as we have seen—wealth begets health and health, wealth. <u>Another cycle consists of food production, food access, education, and human capital, which also helps turn the health wealth</u>.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">The longstanding U.S. campaign for ever-freer global trade was a casualty of job-destroying recessions and widespread American suspicion that free trade means making it easier for China to steal American prosperity. But we may—emphasize may—look back on </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the past few weeks</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">as the moment when</span> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the trade tide turned</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span><u>Consider three noteworthy developments</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. One, President Barack </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Obama promised his Russian counterpart he'd push harder to bring it into the World Trade Organization</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. </span><u>Russia</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">agreed to resume imports of U.S. chickens</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. Hey, all trade politics is local: The U.S. sold $750 million a year in chicken parts to Russia until Moscow blocked them on Jan. 1, citing concerns over the chlorinated wash used to clean them. Two, Mr. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Obama suddenly revived a U.S.-South Korea free-trade pact</span></u><u>,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> aiming for a handshake deal when he visits Seoul in November while conveniently deferring any congressional vote until after this fall's U.S. elections. Three, leaders of the Group of 20, the de facto board of directors of the world economy, publicly acknowledged the obvious: The nine-year-old Doha round of world trade talks won't end in agreement this year. But privately, they had a candid conversation about what it would take to end the current stalemate. Economists argue that trade helps both exporters (yes, jobs) and importers (not only more, cheaper goods, but also competition from abroad that keeps domestic producers on their toes). Embracing that view, President Bill Clinton persuaded skeptical Democrats to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Uruguay Round and the admission of China into the world-trading system. Mr. Obama, who took office in an economy far worse and far more hostile to trade than the one Mr. Clinton inherited, appears less convinced of the virtues of free trade per se. He loves exports, easily sold as creating jobs. But he seems to view world trade like a basketball game: He wants to win, and doesn't like feeling that others are taking advantage of his team. He needles aides who worked in the Clinton administration that they let China into the WTO with a better hand than the one he has to play. Aides counter that China would be even more of a threat if not bound by WTO rules. He is unpersuaded. The attempt to revive the South Korea deal began several weeks ago in a late-afternoon conversation between the president and his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. The president was looking for ways to shore up U.S. backing for South Korea after North Korea's new aggressiveness, had promised to increase U.S. exports and wanted to reinforce US. economic ties to Asia. Mr. Emanuel saw the South Korea deal as addressing all three objectives. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Very quietly, the U.S. has moved to broaden its trade ties,</span></u> <u>with deals looking likely with Russia and South Korea</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">, says WSJ's David Wessel. Winning Democratic votes for any free-trade pact will be tough, but this one—unlike, say, the pending Panama agreement—is more than symbolic. South Korea is the 14th largest economy in the world now. As recently as 2003, the U.S. was its largest trading partner; last year it ranked fourth after China, the European Union and Japan. Mr. Obama will press Korea to dilute rules that limit imports of U.S. autos and beef in exchange for trying to get the pact through Congress. If he succeeds, he will be sure to boast that he got a better deal than the original one President George W. Bush struck with Korea. </span><u>The</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Doha stalemate was raised Sunday at a closed-door lunch for G-20 leaders</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">, with their sherpas listening from another room. One leader described a Doha deal as &quot;the cheapest form of stimulus.&quot; Mr. Obama, according to a person familiar with the talks, was blunt. He said the Doha offers on the table would benefit &quot;major emerging economies&quot;—an obvious reference to China, India and Brazil—and do little for the U.S. or for smaller developing countries, which still face tariffs on their exports in bigger emerging markets. He cited an estimate, by Washington's Peterson Institute for International Economics, that the current Doha deal would add only $6 billion a year to U.S. exports of goods—less than one day's worth. Which is why there's so little enthusiasm for it even among traditional business interests. His point: Any hope of U.S. backing—with the political pain that would inflict on Democrats—requires broadening the deal beyond manufactured goods and agriculture to the barriers that U.S. services companies still face in major emerging markets and on tough issues like protecting U.S. intellectual property. Britain's new Conservative prime minister, David Cameron, agreed. &quot;[I]t doesn't look like it's going to progress unless we do something different, and the discussion we had was...that we should look at enlarging the scale and ambitions of the [Doha] round, perhaps looking at bringing in some of the elements of services,&quot; he said in Toronto. (Mr. Cameron, it seems, has been boning up on a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: &quot;If a problem cannot be solved, enlarge it.&quot;) Mr. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Obama's trade strategy is becoming clearer.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">In international forums, as he did at the Copenhagen climate-change talks, he is arguing that China is posing as a developing country even though it has grown up and needs to be treated like the economic powerhouse it is. At home, he knows—no matter what his economists tell him—that neither voters nor Democrats in Congress will be convinced that free trade is good for them. So he is styling himself as a tough bargainer, who can beat other countries at their own game. We won't know for a year or so whether this is just talk or something more significant.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Okay, here’s a little pinprick of light in an otherwise dark sky: </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">wages are rising</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It’s because we’re working longer hours, and because deflation looms over the economy like a goblin, but, hey, a gain’s a gain these days.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">At least, that’s what the Department of Labor is saying. </span><u>“</u><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Real” wages</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as in earnings adjusted for inflation, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">in July were up 0.2% from June, as an increase in the workweek offset a decline in hourly wages. Average weekly earnings are up 2% from the recent low hit in October 2009</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>On the year,</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">hourly earnings are up 0.4% and weekly earnings are up 1.6%, </span></u><u>a function of the fact that we’re all working longer hours</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Consumer demand is rising now – key to growth.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Investors and the public have been closely watching signals about the economy and the Fed’s possible policy moves to address problems. While the United States has “a considerable way to go” for a full recovery</span><u>, “</u><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">rising demand from households and businesses should help sustain growth,</span></u><u>”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Mr. Bernanke said on Monday in a speech in Charleston, S.C. </span><u>“We are maintaining strong monetary policy support for the recovery</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” he said in response to an audience question, without discussing any further action the Fed could take to aid growth. The remarks signal that Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, when they meet in Washington next week, will stop short of making major changes in their policy statement or taking new steps to lower interest rates and reduce unemployment, said John Ryding, a former Fed researcher</span><u>.</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Consumer spending</span></u><u>, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy, “</u><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">seems likely to pick up in coming quarters from its recent modest pace,</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="background: #ffff00;">”</span> Mr. Bernanke said. “Further action still has a pretty high hurdle to get over,” said Mr. Ryding, chief economist and a founder at RDQ Economics in New York. “The status quo on policy remains.” Fed policy makers are now starting to consider how to bolster the recovery and reduce unemployment after a year of developing tools to remove record monetary stimulus. A report last week showed that the American economy, recovering from the worst recession since the 1930s, slowed to a 2.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter, less than forecast, as a scarcity of jobs eroded consumer spending. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The economy “is now expanding at a moderate pace</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Mr. Bernanke said at the Southern Legislative Conference, a group of lawmakers from 15 states. “To be sure, notable restraints on the recovery persist,” including housing, commercial real estate and the labor market, he said. A lesson from the Great Depression is that “</span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">we need to make sure that monetary policy continues to provide the support the economy needs</span></u> <u>until we begin to see sustained growth and particularly growth in jobs,”</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Mr. Bernanke said in response to a question. The Fed chief devoted most of the speech to current and long-term budget problems for state and local governments. States are cutting spending to close a combined $84 billion of budget deficits. The reductions are “weighing on economic activity,” Mr. Bernanke said. Mr. Bernanke and the Federal Open Market Committee will meet on Aug. 10 in Washington to discuss interest rates and the economy. Options outlined last month by Mr. Bernanke to aid growth and keep rates low include using communication to convey the path of borrowing costs, reduce the rate the Fed pays on excess reserves deposited with the central bank and expand the balance sheet through asset purchases. The Fed signaled in June that Europe’s debt crisis might harm American growth and repeated a pledge to keep interest rates near zero “for an extended period.” The central bank cut the benchmark interest rate almost to zero in December 2008 and turned to purchases of Treasury, housing-agency and mortgage-backed securities as the main tool of monetary policy. Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke’s predecessor as Fed chief from 1987 to 2006, said in an NBC interview on Sunday that the slowing recovery felt like a “quasi-recession” and the economy might contract again if home prices declined. Last week, James Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president, said that the central bank should resume purchases of Treasury securities if the economy slowed and prices fell rather than maintain a pledge to keep rates near zero. “The U.S. is closer to a Japanese-style outcome today than at any time in recent history,” Mr. Bullard said, warning about the possibility of deflation. At a speech on Monday, however, Mr. Geithner said that </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the economy was “healing” and was in no danger of confronting a deflationary threat</span></u> <u>like the challenges that have faced the Japanese economy.</u> </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Much of the important economic data of the last few weeks have pointed to slower growth in the U.S. and overseas</span></u><u>. That has been enough to spark another worldwide sell-off in stocks, though a modest one compared with what hit the markets in the spring</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">More striking has been the rush to buy the bonds of governments that investors believe will always find a way to pay their debts — the U.S. and Germany, for example.</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>The already low market interest rates on those bonds fell further this week as more buyers piled in, happy to accept ever-shrinking yields in exchange for a sense of security</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">With the annualized yield on 10-year Treasury notes at 2.68% on Friday, a 16-month low, &quot;</span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The bond market is telling you a very pessimistic story&quot; about the economy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, said Bill Strazzullo, market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Freehold, N.J.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In other words, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the fear pushing bond yields down isn't about whether the world is facing just a temporary economic slowdown.

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Worries about deflation </span></u><u>surged amid the credit crisis of 2008, then largely went away as the global economy rebounded last year.

But they may </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">hold the key to a consumer recovery</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Affluent shoppers are the most important segment of consumer spending, which in turn drives the national economy. The top 20 percent of the nation's households </span></u><u>-- with income of at least $150,000 --</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">account for 40 percent of all spending</span></u><u>, according to government data.

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A shock to wages will cause financial panic, collapsing the economy.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>The Economist</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, “The greater of two evils; Deflation in America,” 5/9/</span><strong>2009</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, lexis</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is something to both fears. But </span><u><strong>inflation is distant and containable, while deflation is at hand and pernicious</strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fears about deflation do not rest on the 0.4% decline in American consumer prices in the year to March. Although this is the first such annual decline since 1955, it is the transitory result of a plunge in energy prices. Excluding food and energy, core inflation is 1.8%. Rather, </span><u>the worry is of persistent price declines that characterise true deflation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>With unemployment nearing 9%, economic output is further below the economy's potential than at any time since 1982. This gap is likely to widen</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. House prices are not part of America's inflation index but their decline is forcing households to reduce debt, which could subdue economic growth for years. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">As workers compete for scarce jobs and firms underbid each other for sales, wages and prices will come under pressure</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">So far, expectations of inflation remain stable</span></u><u>: that sentiment is itself a welcome bulwark against deflation</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">But pay freezes and wage cuts may soon change people's minds</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In one poll, more than a third of respondents said they or someone in their household had suffered a cut in pay or hours. The employment-cost index rose by just 2.1% in the year to the first quarter, the least since records began in 1982. In 2003, during the last deflation scare, total pay grew by almost 4%.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Does this matter? If prices are falling because of advancing productivity, as at the end of the 19th century, it is a sign of progress, not economic collapse. Today, though, </span><u>deflation is more likely to resemble the malign 1930s sort than that earlier benign variety, because demand is weak and households and firms are burdened by debt</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>In deflation</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the nominal value of debts remains fixed even as nominal wages, prices and profits fall. Real debt burdens therefore rise, causing borrowers to cut spending to service their debts or to default. </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">That undermines the financial system and deepens the recession</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">From 1929 to 1933 prices fell by 27%. This time central banks are on the case. In America, Britain, Japan and Switzerland they have pushed short-term interest rates to, or close to, zero and vastly expanded their balance-sheets by buying debt. It helps, too, that the world has abandoned the monetary straitjacket of the gold standard it wore in the 1930s.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">Yet this anti-deflationary zeal is precisely what alarms people like Mr Meltzer. He worries that the price of seeing off deflation is that the Fed will be unable or unwilling to reverse itself in time to prevent a resurgence of inflation.</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Fair enough, but </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">inflation is easier to put right than deflation</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">A central bank can raise interest rates as high as it wants to suppress inflation, but it cannot cut nominal rates below zero</span></strong></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Deflation robs a central bank of its ability to stimulate spending using negative real interest rates. In the worst case, rising debts and defaults depress growth, poisoning the economy by deepening deflation </span></u><u>and pressing real interest rates higher. Central banks that have lowered rates to nearly zero are now using unconventional, quantitative tools, but their efficacy is unproven.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Given the choice, erring on the side of inflation would be less catastrophic than erring on the side of deflation.</span></span><br />

(SPEEA stands for Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.)</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>SPEEA</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Legislative Director Stan Sorscher </span><u>has been monitoring the H1-B visa debate since 2000</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">He points out that </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">in 1999, a labor shortage driven by the high-tech boom led to a bidding war for workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, affording such employees free concierge service, ping pong tables, permission to bring one's dog to work and so on.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The demand for well-educated workers is only growing, and the effect is cumulative. Powerful economic forces </span></u><u>such as the rise of brutal global competition and the spread of sophisticated information technologies</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">will continue to push employers to value better educated workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> who are comfortable working in teams, quick to adjust to new tasks, and well-schooled in the latest high-tech gear. At least that's one conclusion to draw from a recent paper by Anthony Carnavale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. He projects that </span><u>the economy will create 47 million job openings from 2008 to 2018</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, made up of 14 million new jobs and 33 million jobs replacing current workers who have retired, become disabled, or died.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The key finding: </span><u>Most of the jobs demand some postsecondary education, with about 30 million openings requiring at least some college education and 21 million an associate's, bachelor's, or graduate degree</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">If educated workers aren't readily available, companies will automate the tasks or find educated employees overseas. </span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">After all, with many developing economies devoting more resources to university education, America's share of the world's college-level workers has shrunk from some 30 percent to about 15 percent, according to Carnevale and two Georgetown University colleagues, Jeff Strohl and Nicole Smith.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">Sad to say, the ranks of poorly educated Americans are growing. The growth in high school graduation rates has slowed since the 1970s. The nation's four-year high school graduation rate hovers around 69 percent, according to the Alliance for Excellent Education, a Washington (D.C.) organization that advocates better high school performance. Some minority groups do even worse, with a 56 percent dropout rate for Hispanics and 54 percent for African Americans.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">Tougher Road for Dropouts</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">The Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University calculates that the average high school dropout will have a lifetime negative net fiscal contribution to society of some -$5,200. The average high school graduate generates a positive lifetime number of $287,384. The sharply lower figure for dropouts aged 18 to 64 reflects lower annual federal, state, and local tax payments, higher cash and in-kind transfers, and the costs of incarceration relative to a high school graduate. (The comparable figure for a college graduate with only a bachelor's degree is $793,079.)</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Following the Great Depression and World War II, it appeared that the U.S. and other major industrial nations had banished the well-known phenomenon of mass unemployment</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Most workers, including those who labored on a factory floor, lived a middle-class lifestyle, and the unemployment rate largely moved up and down with the business cycle.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">But the specter of mass unemployment once again haunts the U.S. The Great Recession is exposing the cumulative effect of a three-decade shift toward high-education jobs and a failing education system</span></u><u>.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The trend has always been morally wrong—and financially stressful for low-income households. But now </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">the swelling numbers of less educated unemployed-and-underemployed working-age adults is starting to call into question whether the U.S. can mount a sustained, robust economic recovery</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Years of subpar growth and high unemployment would be a bitter lesson for Americans, college-educated or not.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">While data on gross domestic product (GDP) suggest that the worse of the recession is probably over, the US labor market is still deeply depressed. Unemployment rates in the United States are at levels not experienced for two decades. Between January 2009 and January 2010 about 3.9 million jobs were lost.1 It is natural, therefore, to revisit questions about the impact of immigrants on the labor market and on the economy through the lens of the current economic situation. Are the shortrun effects of net immigration2 on native workers’ employment and income less beneficial (or more harmful) if immigrants enter the United States during a recession? Does the economy have the same capacity to “absorb” new workers when immigrants join the US economy in a recession? Do the longrun gains or losses to the US economy from immigration depend on the phase of the cycle during which immigrants enter the country? These questions have become particularly relevant in the last two years and the present report tries to address them. Most (though not all) economic research over the last decade has emphasized the potential gains that result from immigration to the United States. Immigration can boost the supply of skills different from and complementary to those of natives,3 increase the supply of low-cost services,4 contribute to innovation,5 and create incentives for investment and efficiency gains.6 Quantifying these gains is not easy, but steady progress has been made in identifying and measuring them. There is broad consensus that the long-run impact of immigration on the average income of Americans is small but positive.7 In particular, recent studies have identified measurable gains for the highly educated and small, often not significant, losses for less-educated workers. These </span><u>empirical analyses,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">however</span><u>, have focused on the “long run.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">”8</span> <u>But the present economic recession and its persistent labor market consequences</u> <u>make the long run</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> seem rather </span><u>distant</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and more pressing concerns about the short run have taken center stage.9 </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Immigration’s economic benefits</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> mostly </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">result from</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> its effect on immigrant and native </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">workers’ occupational</span></u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">choices</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">accompanied</span></u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">by</span></u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">employers’ investments</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and reorganization of the firm. For instance, immigrants are usually allocated to manual-intensive jobs, promoting competition and pushing natives to perform communication-intensive tasks more efficiently. This process, at the same time, reorganizes firms’ structure, producing efficiency gains and pushing natives towards cognitive and communication-intensive jobs that are better paid. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">These effects</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> may</span> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">take a few years to unfold </span></u><u>fully</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the meantime and before the adjustments take place, do immigrants crowd out natives from the labor market? How long does it take for firms to adjust their investments and organization in order to benefit from the new supply of skills? Are these processes easier and less costly during an economic expansion than in an economic downturn? </span><u>Until very recently no comprehensive analysis of the short-run effects of immigration on the US labor markets has been possible</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.10 The reason is that yearly representative data from the Current Population Survey, typically used to analyze production and labor markets, have contained information on the place of birth of individuals only since 1994 (as opposed to the decennial census that has always included that information). Hence, it is </span><u>only during the last few years</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that </span><u>sufficient data has accumulated in order to analyze the short-run</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (yearly) </span><u>impacts of</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> net </span><u>immigration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on labor market outcomes. Moreover, between 1994 and 2007, only the mild 2001 recession was observed, providing limited variation over the economic cycle. While several influential academic papers have emphasized how the short-run effects of immigration on wages and employment could be different from long-run effects, those differences were based on theoretical assumptions rather than on empirically estimated evidence. </span><u>Using empirical methods</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in line </span><u>with the best practice</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> used to analyze and quantify the long-run effects of immigration, this report will provide some evidence to inform these questions. It begins by analyzing the short-run impact of immigration on employment, income, and other factors that affect income, such as investments, hours worked, and productive efficiency, examining the speed with which the economy adjusts to accommodate new immigrants. It then extends this analysis to investigate how these shortrun effects, and possibly the medium-run effect (over four or five years), depend on the state of the economy when immigrants enter the labor market. Finally, it discusses the implications the results may have for immigration policy. The results suggest that in the long run, immigrants do not reduce native employment rates, but they do increase productivity and hence average income. This finding is consistent with the broad existing literature on the impact of immigration in the United States. A </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">new analysis of the short-run impacts</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of immigration, however, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">finds</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> some mild </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">negative effects</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">: </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">immigration may</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> slightly </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">reduce native employment</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at first, </span><u>because the economic adjustment process is not immediate</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Lower average income is also likely </span></u><u>in the short run</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">long-run gains</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to productivity and income </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">become significant after seven to ten years</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The results moreover suggest</u> <u>that the</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> short-run </span><u>impact</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of immigration </span><u>depends on the state of the economy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. When the economy is growing, new immigration creates jobs in sufficient numbers to leave native employment unharmed, even in the relatively short run. </span><u>During downturns</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, new immigrants are found to have a small negative impact on native employment in the short run (but not the long run). </span><u>The economy does not appear to respond as quickly to new immigrants in terms of new job creation and productivity boosts during recessions.</u> </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>A third difference</u> <u>between expansion and downturn concerns the response</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of physical capital per worker. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">During a downturn investments do not respond as quickly to immigration as in expansion</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="background: #ffff00;">.</span> This time the difference in response is close to being statistically significant within the two- and the four-year intervals. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Since the economy has unused capacity during downturns, this may make firms reluctant to expand their productive capacity</span></u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">and</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">/or to </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">adopt the technologies</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (and pay the fixed </span><u>cost)</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">that would best take advantage of immigrant labor</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

The H1B visa program is already majorly unpopular in technical circles even though technology employers insist that they need the program to remain competitive.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“<span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is clear that </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">oversight</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, including an auditing function, </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">are desperately needed to clean up the corruption</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” Hira said. “</span><u>But we shouldn’t forget that</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the major problems with the H-1B program are caused by massive loopholes that allow firms to legally pay below-market wages and displace and undercut American workers.

<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">The other trick used was to take out the costs associated with getting the H1B visa out of the employee’s wages; essentially the employee was paying for their own visa. That is also a violation of the program.</span><br />

Fraud like this diminishes the good that the program can do, and when used against local workers by artificially deflating wages or holding wages stagnate, that is where the real argument is going to come into play.</span></span><br />

Instead</span><u>, the central attraction of H-1Bs for employers is as a means of</u> <u><strong>reducing</strong></u> <u>labor costs.</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">To show the cheap-labor nature of H-1B hiring, it is first important to lay the foundation by citing the source of the H-1Bs’ exploitability. Part V.A will explain why most H-1Bs are </span></u></span><span style="font-family: NewBaskerville-Italic,serif;"><em><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">de facto </span></u></em></span><span style="font-family: NewBaskerville-Roman,serif;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">indentured servants</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It will then present a variety of quantitative looks at the use of H-1Bs as cheap labor, and then turn to comments from the industry itself. Finally, Part V.E will show how Type I savings may be demonstrated without any data at all, simply by appealing to fundamental economic principles. </span></span><span style="font-family: NewBaskerville-Italic,serif; font-size: 8pt;"><em>A. De Facto Indentured Servitude of the H-1Bs</em> </span><span style="font-family: NewBaskerville-Roman,serif;"><u>The industry lobbyists have argued that the H-1Bs are not exploited, on the grounds that if an H-1B worker were paid less than comparable Americans, he/she would simply move to another employe</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">r. For example, Stuart Anderson, the author of the ITAA report and later the architect of the H-1B expansion bills in 1998 and 2000,203 quoted an employer as saying, “You cannot pay foreignborn engineers less. These are smart people; if you try to fool with them, they will go someplace else.”204 </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The harsh reality</span></u><u>, though,</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">is that the H-1Bs typically cannot “go someplace else,” and are forced to stick with their exploitative employers</span></u><u>. Most H-1Bs hope to be sponsored by their employers for permanent residence, i.e. green cards.</u><u>205</u> <u>This is a multi-year process. Toward the end of the 1990s, the processing time for the two largest H-1B nationalities, Indian and Chinese, was approaching six years.</u><u>206</u> <u>During the time an H-1B’s green card application is being processed, he/she is essentially immobile; switching employers during this time would necessitate starting the green card process all over again, an unthinkable prospect for most.</u><u>207</u></span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>H-1B holders are undereducated and have much lower median wages.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">So, Robert's first premise, that the H-1B program is a bridge to immigration doesn't hold up. By citing the Masters and PhD degree statistics, Robert is implying that all or most H-1Bs are advanced degree holders and thus the best and brightest. Again, this is simply not supported by the government data. </span><u>About</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">half of the H-1B holders have just a bachelors degree, and more importantly H-1B wages tend to be very low.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> According to the latest government statistics, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the median wage for new H-1B holders in computer occupations was only $50,000.</span></u> <u>This is</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">far below the median wages for those occupations.</span></u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">And they are even below what a brand new graduate gets as a starting salary</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">H-1B workers are paid even below rank-and-file workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. So, his premise that the H-1B program is only used for the best and brightest is simply not supported by the facts. We need to have a discussion based on how the H-1B program operates in reality based on facts as a first step. Sensible solutions require good problem diagnosis, and Robert simply has his diagnosis wrong.</span></span><br />

The study also found that offshore outsourcing decreases wages for a broader category of workers, including IT managers, by 2% to 3%. The IT workers most likely to be affected by the downward pressure on wages are recent college graduates and people changing jobs, the researchers said. The authors of the study, Prasanna Tambe, an assistant professor at Stern, and Lorin Hitt, a professor at Wharton, said they used data from multiple sources, including a &quot;leading online job search site&quot; that they wouldn't identify. Tambe and Hitt said they combined the demographic and wage data of individual companies available at the job-search site with information on H-1B visas and outsourcing available through the government and other public sources. </span><u>The study was based on information compiled on 156,000 IT workers employed at nearly 7,500 publicly held U.S. firms,</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> Tambe and Hitt said. The data from the combined sources provided what they called a &quot;micro-data&quot; view of public companies that hire H-1B visa holders and offshore workers. T he goal of the study was to &quot;precisely look at how domestic workers are being affected by globalization,&quot; Tambe said. &quot;I'm not making a judgment on whether that is good or bad.&quot; In addition, the researchers wrote, &quot;</span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">we simply sought to dispel the myth that globalization generates no losers&quot; and to provide U.S. policymakers with data on how the H-1B program affects IT wages</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">.

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>It's bad enough that American workers are losing jobs to foreign labor imported via the broken H-1B visa system. Now there's even more evidence that unscrupulous companies are exploiting the hopes and labor of foreign workers who obtained those visas as they searched for better jobs and better lives</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. Two of those workers, an MBA student named Vimal Patel and an Indian software programmer Prasad Nair, were featured in an investigative story on the H-1B mess in the current issue of BusinessWeek. Their stories have a lot of complications, and Patel -- who wound up working at a gas station -- apparently committed a relatively minor violation of the law. But those young men and many others paid thousands of dollars to companies that promised them jobs that ultimately didn't materialize or turned out to be for significantly less money than they had been led to expect. Aside from humanitarian concerns, is there a reason why you should care about these guys? There is. </span><u>With layoffs continuing to decimate the technology industry</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> -- about 100,000 IT workers lost their jobs in the last 12 months -- </span><u>employers can still bring in</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> as many as 85,000 </span><u>H-1B workers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">, including 20,000 who hold advanced degrees from U.S. universities. And now some of the outsourcers are preparing to move jobs to Mexico if visa regulations get tighter. </span><u>The system works against U.S. workers, and it leaves plenty of room to exploit foreign workers. It's</u> <u>broken and needs to be fixed</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. Visa fraud rate of 20 percent The cases of Patel and Nair mirror a pattern of lawbreaking and exploitation by employers uncovered last year by </span><u>the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> (USCIS). Indeed, the agency </span><u>found evidence of fraud or other violations in 20 percent of H-1B visa petitions</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. The Justice Department took notice and brought suit against a number of companies, including Vision Systems Group, Cognizant Technology, and Patni Computer Systems. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) has been one of Washington's most outspoken critics of the H-1B visa. In a letter last week to USCIS director Alejandro Mayorkas, Grassley said the agency should be asking &quot;companies up front for evidence that H-1B visa holders actually have a job awaiting them in the U.S.,&quot; so they will not end up being &quot;benched,&quot; or unpaid until work is found. &quot;</span><u>Employers need to be held accountable so that foreign workers are not flooding the market, depressing wages, and taking jobs from qualified Americans.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"> Asking the right questions and requesting the necessary documents will go a long way in getting out the fraud in the H-1B program,&quot; Grassley wrote. </span><u>Talk of depressed wages is not just hot air. A recent study found H-1B visa use is reducing IT wages in some fields, including programming, by as much as 6 percent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;">. That comes from research by Prasanna Tambe, an assistant professor of information, operations, and management sciences at the New York University's Stern School of Business, and Lorin Hitt, a professor of operations and information management at Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. IT services to Mexico? It could happen It's worth remembering that the globalization of IT services (along with many other sectors) is very far down the road. Indian firms are reportedly laying the groundwork for a move of some services to Mexico and Canada should U.S. regulations become too strict. A report in DNAIndia quotes Apurva Shah, a Mumbai-based analyst: &quot;&quot;Companies such as TCS, Infosys, and others are setting up delivery and development centers in Mexico and Canada, which are close to U.S. This helps firms save on costs as well as serve U.S. customers from those locations, since people from Mexico and Canada do not need H-1B visas under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).&quot; I have no idea how reliable this report is, and there are many jobs that could not be done offsite. But moving at least some of the work now done in the United States by H-1B visa holders is certainly plausible, and I'll bet that Indian techies working in Mexico will be paid even less than now. As for Patel, he's facing deportation, and Cygate Software and Consulting, the company that brought him to New Jersey on allegedly false pretenses, is facing a criminal charge. H-1B: A solution in search of a problem When H-1B first became law in the 1990s, the premise was simple and made sense: The growing technology industry couldn't find enough skilled workers to fill key jobs. In response to lobbying by the industry, Congress permitted companies to hire foreign workers under a new provision of immigration law that established fairly liberal quotas for skilled workers. Fair enough -- but that's no longer the case. With thousands of highly skilled and experienced IT workers looking for jobs, it's hardly plausible to talk about a labor shortage. No doubt there are exceptions. But not 85,000, which is the total number of H-1B slots available this year and last. There needs to be a moratorium on H-1B entrants to the labor market. But before we point fingers at the foreign-born workers who come here to better their lives and support their families, we should condemn the companies that exploit them. </span></span><br />

In the past, he said, US companies relied on foreign workers with H-1B visas </span><span style="font-family: NewBaskerville-Roman,serif;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">to reduce costs. </span><u>“Now they are focusing on offshoring</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,” or sending the work overseas.261 Sun Microsystems, one of the firms which has most vigorously lobbied for expansion of the H-1B program, made the following complaints about the labor market for UNIX system administrators: Costs continue to rise . . . .

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Binding visa caps to the market cycle would make it vastly more responsive, maximizing the benefits of skilled immigration while minimizing the costs.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is broad consensus among economists that </span><u>immigration has a small but positive impact on the average income of Americans over the long term. But far less analysis has been done on the impact of immigrants on the labor market in the shorter term</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, particularly when viewed through the lens of the recession and its lingering labor market effects.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">In a new Migration Policy Institute report, The Impact of Immigrants in Recession and Economic Expansion, University of California, Davis economist Giovanni Peri finds that immigration unambiguously improves employment, productivity and income but that it also involves some short-term adjustments (such as worker retraining or adoption of new technology).</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">The paper was commissioned to inform the work of MPI’s Labor Markets Initiative, which is conducting a comprehensive, policy-focused review of the role of legal and illegal immigration in the labor market.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">The report, which examines short- and long-run impacts of immigration on average and over the business cycle of growth and contraction, finds that:</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">* </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Immigrants do not reduce native employment rates over the long run</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (10 years), </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">while increasing productivity and average income for native-born workers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Immigration to the United States over the 1990-2006 period can be credited with a 2.9 percent increase in real wages for the average U.S. worker.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">* </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">The adjustment process</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">is not immediate</span></strong></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">When immigration occurs during a downturn, the economy does not appear to respond as quickly as it would during economic expansions and there is evidence of modest negative impacts on employment and average income in the short run</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. These impacts dissipate over periods of up to seven years.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">* </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">During periods of economic growth</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, by contrast, </span><u>new</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">immigration creates jobs in sufficient numbers to leave native employment unharmed even in the short run</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This holds true even for less-educated workers. Immigration during economic expansions has no measurable, short-term negative effect on income per worker.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Adjustments to employment, productivity and income are more difficult during downturns,” Peri said. “This suggests that </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the United States would benefit most from an immigration system that better adjusts to economic conditions, allowing legal immigrant inflows to be more responsive to the economic cycle</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">In the report, Peri suggests allowing employers’ demand for work visas to play a stronger role in determining the number of visas issued annually, and that a share of the visas be allocated to less-skilled workers, particularly those who perform primarily manual jobs that native workers increasingly are much less interested in filling.</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“<u><span style="background: #ffff00;">This report offers further evidence yet of the need for the immigration system to become significantly more responsive to the U.S. economy’s constantly evolving labor market needs, so that the benefits of immigration can be captured more fully and any negative effects neutralized</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,’’ said MPI President Demetrios Papademetriou. “</span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Establishing an independent executive-branch agency </span></u><u>that would make regular recommendations to the president and Congress for adjusting employment-based immigration levels</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">would inject a greatly needed degree of flexibility into the current rigid immigration system</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">.”</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>In order for immigration to boost productivity and income per worker, the state economy must make some adjustments</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and this takes time. However, most of these gains are realized within seven years. The results suggest that </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">if</span></u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the gross inflow of new immigrants is allowed to vary with the strength of labor demand</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (downturns and expansions) </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">this would minimize the short-run economic costs of adjustment.</span></u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">New immigrants could be allowed to flow into the United States in larger numbers during an expansion when demand is stronger and firms are more willing to invest than during a recession when they would temporarily crowd a depressed labor market</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The details of such policy are not easy to implement and require consideration of a number of details about the current US visa system. Moreover the fact that the majority of new permanent residence permits is awarded based on family (and not employment) reasons make the current legal immigration system ill-suited to respond to economic incentives. Rather that spelling out the details of potential employment-based immigration policies let me simply indicate some general ideas and facts to be kept in mind when designing the policies.</span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nonetheless, </span><u>while decisions about immigration policy will inevitably transcend economic costs and benefits and touch upon deeper questions of how immigration defines us as a nation,</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">many issues </span></u><em><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">can</span></u></em><u><span style="background: #ffff00;"> be quantified</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The Standing Commission would </span></u><u>eventually</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">provide systematic, detailed, credible, and evidence-based analysis of </span></u><u>the costs, benefits, and economic impacts of all aspects of</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">immigration</span></u><u>—analysis</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">that we </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">currently lack</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The mandate</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of a Standing Commission </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">should</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> thus </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">be to analyze the labor market impacts of immigration and propose adjustments in employment-based immigration levels and requirements </span></u><em><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">that meet employers’ needs and promote America’s economic growth and competitiveness while minimizing job displacement and wage depression</span></u></em><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Judgments can be made about immigrants’ overall contributions, their progress in the labor market, and the impacts on native workers</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—including the locational and career paths of native workers who previously worked in industries now dominated by immigrants.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>The Standing Commission</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, therefore, </span><u>would have two primary tasks</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">:</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong>4. This arg just doesn’t assume our labor test – it is literally a numerical comparison between the average unemployment rate and occupational unemployment rates, which are done every year.

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Job growth in fields like computer systems design and Internet publishing has been slow in the last year. Employment in areas like data processing and software publishing has actually fallen. Additionally, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">computer scientists, systems analysts and computer programmers all had unemployment rates of around 6 percent</span></u> <u>in the second quarter of this year</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong>5. The Commission would draw cross-sectional and longitudinal data from multiple sources, making its analysis highly accurate.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">First, a </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">full analysis </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of which immigrants fare best (according to their socioeconomic characteristics, the work they perform, and the category through which they entered the country) </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">requires longitudinal data</span></u><u>. Building on the existing model of the New Immigrant Survey,</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">data on multiple cohorts of new immigrants</span></u><u>, with sufficient sample size to disaggregate analysis to regional, state, occupational, and industry levels,</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">would allow a greatly improved understanding of how immigrants assimilate into the US labor market</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The Standing Commission would also be expected to make use of all existing government data including the</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> US </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Current Population Survey</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (CPS), </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">American Community Survey</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (ACS), </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">and the Longitudinal Employment and Household Dynamics</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (LEHD), </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">which links employer data from unemployment records to Census Bureau data on households</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, current research on the impacts of immigration largely comes from the academy and nonprofit sectors. As noted earlier, many of the products of both types of institution are problematic and, in any event, do not amount to the systematic, wide-ranging, and “just-in-time” research results the government often requires. </span><u>A properly staffed body such as the Standing Commission could coordinate research</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (conducted in-house and commissioned from outside researchers) </span><u>in order to ensure that important policy questions are being answered as and when required</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">AT: Predictability/Uncertainty</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong>1. Doesn’t assume our mechanism – the counterplan is a relatively simple labor market tests; any business owner who is confused about the counterplan probably isn’t running a very successful business to begin with.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><strong>2. Flexibility and responsiveness are not mutually exclusive with predictability – the clear standards established by the counterplan solve predictability.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Cristina </span><strong>Rodriguez</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, prof. of law at NYU, “CONSTRAINT THROUGH DELEGATION: THE CASE OF EXECUTIVE CONTROL OVER IMMIGRATION POLICY,” </span><strong>2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Duke Law Journal, lexis</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The regime governing labor migration should be flexible</span></u> <u>and capable of evolving along with the country’s economic and demographic needs</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. At the same time, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the regime must be relatively stable and predictable, both to </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">allow employers and other economic actors to plan and manage their expectations</span></strong></u><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">, and to </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">build public confidence</span></strong></u> <u>in and acceptance of the system as a whole.</u> <u>These objectives of responsiveness and stability may be in tension with one another, but this tension can be softened</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">Responsiveness to facts on the ground</span></strong></u><u><span style="background: #ffff00;"> can help ensure predictability, and stability does not necessarily require that admissions numbers remain constant, only that they reflect evolving needs in a </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">nonarbitrary manner</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The salient point for the purposes of this Article is that the decisionmaking structure for immigration policymaking ought to be capable of balancing these objectives. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Creating a flexible system equipped to respond to changing circumstances will help promote efficiency and economic growth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and create capacity for preventing illegal immigration through nonenforcement-oriented means, </span><u>thereby helping to mitigate the negative effects of such immigration on U.S. workers and secure ongoing public confidence in the regime</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">To be flexible, the system must be capable of responding to facts on the ground. </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">The system should be able to adapt to fluctuations in the U.S. labor market</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as well as to changes in the economic and demographic circumstances outside the United States that help shape migratory flows, particularly in the American hemisphere. Determining the number and types of immigrants to admit does depend upon value judgments concerning who should become part of the polity, on what terms, and with what effects on existing residents—the so-called “membership decision.” But </span><u>the process also has a technical dimension that requires databased projections about market dynamics and future economic and social needs. Regulating immigration effectively, therefore, demands a system equipped to evolve in response to the sociology and economy of migration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">Predictability</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the other hand, </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">requires avoiding dramatic fluctuations in rules.</span></strong></u> <u>A predictable system will be somewhat insulated from day-to-day political pressures</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, whether in the form of interest group lobbying or the anti-immigrant, restrictionist shocks that occasionally arise from the electorate. </span><u>Predictability not only allows employers and workers to manage their expectations, but also helps facilitate a stable and orderly flow of migration</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which in turn helps secure public acceptance of immigration.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">Predictability and responsiveness need not be mutually exclusive.</span></strong></u> <u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">A regime that adjusts in response to changed circumstances can also be predictable</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if interested parties understand how the government anticipates and then adjusts to fluctuating conditions, or </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">if clear standards, set out in advance of the actual decisionmaking, guide changes to the numbers of visas available from year to year.</span></strong></u> <u>A goal of the decisionmaking structure</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, therefore, </span><u>should be to determine how much predictability affected parties require to make decisions about their futures, and to be transparent about the mechanisms used to identify changed circumstances</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<br />

If there's more flexibility in that cap, if there's a market escalator, that is helpful to companies that are on the cutting edge of technology.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Standing Commission would streamline data collection and provide accurate market analysis.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Demetrios G. </span><strong>Papademetriou</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, president of the Migration Policy Institute, </span><strong>et al.</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Doris Meissner, former Commissioner of the US Immigration and Naturalization Service, Marc Rosenblum, senior policy analyst at MPI, and Madeleine Sumption, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, “Harnessing the Advantages of Immigration for a 21st-Century Economy: A Standing Commission on Labor Markets, Economic Competitiveness, and Immigration,” May </span><strong>2009</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/StandingCommission_May09.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/StandingCommission_May09.pdf</a></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In other words, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">creating a Standing Commission </span></u><u>on Labor Markets, Economic Competitiveness, and Immigration</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">would establish a body charged with carrying out research and analysis that is not now available and that is </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">vital for informed policymaking</span></strong></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The Commission’s findings and recommendations </span></u><u>to the president and Congress</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">would facilitate regular reviews of labor market immigration levels and visa allocations and form the basis for making adjustments </span></u><u>as circumstances require</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In this way, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">greater flexibility could be introduced into the system with the numbers of </span></u><u>permanent employment</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">visas</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for example, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">being revised much more regularly</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> than the current two-to three-decade interval.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In contrast with previous one-time “blue-ribbon panels” like the Hesburgh and Jordan Commissions, </span><u>an expert commission would create a resource for ongoing reviews by Congress of labor market and all immigration.</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">By providing high-quality data and evidence-based recommendations specifically related to labor market immigration and its economic effects, a Standing Commission is also likely to raise the level of discourse and knowledge within Congress and the executive branch, </span></u><u>as well as among the range of stakeholders engaged in the immigration policy debate. Several other industrialized states have successfully done so with their labor immigration bodies</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (see Box 1).</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0.25in;"><strong>7. Competitiveness is high now – prefer our ev, it assumes trends.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">We find that </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the United States continues to lead the world in science and technology</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The United States grew faster in many measures of S&amp;T capability than did Japan and Europe, and developing nations such as China, India, and South Korea</span></u> <u>showed rapid growth in S&amp;T output measures, but they</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">are starting from a small base</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>8. Domestic innovation and competitiveness aren’t key to heg and competitors’ growth is unsustainable.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Reihan </span><strong>Salam</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Schwartz Fellow at the New American Foundation, “ROBERT PAPE IS OVERHEATED,” 1/21/</span><strong>2009</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theamericanscene.com/2009/01/21/robert-pape-is-overheated" rel="nofollow">http://www.theamericanscene.com/2009/01/21/robert-pape-is-overheated</a></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Pape spends a lot of time demonstrating that U.S. economic output represents a declining share of global output</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which is hardly a surprise. Yet as Pape surely understands, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the more relevant question is how much and how readily can economic output be translated into military power</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The European Union</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for example, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">has many state-like features, yet it doesn’t have the advantages of a traditional state</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> when it comes to raising an army. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The Indian economy is taxed in a highly uneven manner</span></u><u>, and much of the economy is black —</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the same is true across the developing world</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. As </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">for China</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">both the shape of the economy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as Yasheng Huang suggests, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">and its long frontiers</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as Andrew Nathan has long argued, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">pose serious barriers to translating potential power into effective power</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (Wohlforth and Brooks give Stephen Walt’s balance-of-threat its due.) So while this hardly obviates the broader point that relative American economic power is eroding — that was the whole idea of America’s postwar grand strategy — it is worth keeping in mind. </span><u>This is part of the reason why sclerotic, statist economies can punch above their weight militarily, at least for a time — they are “better” at marshaling resources.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Over the long run, the Singapores will beat the Soviets. But in the long run, we’re all dead. And given that this literature is rooted in the bogey of long-term coalition warfare, you can see why the unipolarity argument holds water.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">At the risk of sounding overly harsh, Pape’s understanding of “</span><u>innovativeness</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” — based on the number of patents filed, it seems — </span><u>is crude to say the least</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. I recommend Amar Bhidé‘s brilliant critique of Richard Freeman, which I’ll be talking about a lot. Pape cites Zakaria, who was relying on slightly shopworn ideas that Bhidé demolishes in The Venturesome Economy.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">The “global diffusion of technology”</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is real, and if anything it </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">magnifies U.S. economic power</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “Ah, but we’re talking about the prospect of coalition warfare!” </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The global diffusion of technology is indeed sharply raising the costs of military conquest</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as the United States discovered in Iraq. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The declining utility of military power means that a unipolar distribution of military power is more likely to persist.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And yes, it also means that unipolar military power is less valuable than it was in 1945. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">AT: China Impact</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>China can’t compete with the US, and they are economically dependent on the US.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">David </span><strong>Weinberger</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Heritage, “Why China is Not an Economic Threat to the United States,” 2/3/</span><strong>2010</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blog.heritage.org/2010/02/03/why-china-is-not-an-economic-threat-to-the-u-s/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.heritage.org/2010/02/03/why-china-is-not-an-economic-threat-to-the-u-s/</a></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Aside from the fact that China’s GDP numbers are illusory</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(largely </span><u>because of how the country calculates its GDP</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">), a significant portion of the growth China is experiencing is not creating wealth, it is merely taking it from other countries. In other words, </span><u>Chinese growth is partly the result of detraction from, not addition to, world GDP, which means much of its success is dependent upon others</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">This is because of the way China’s economy is set up. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">China relies on its trade surplus with the rest of the world as the lifeblood of its economy.</span></u> <u>It exports vastly more than it imports. Seen in this light, China sucks GDP from other countries</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in addition to creating its own. Therefore, while it may be leading the world in GDP growth, to a notable extent these GDP gains are the result of China using the world to boost itself higher.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">That does not mean, however, that China does not produce anything. To the contrary, over the last couple of decades, China has contributed to the world economy. While China’s production has historically met consumer demand to keep prices low around the globe, the world-wide recession is now causing China to oversupply due to weak global demand, which could lead to deflation. This is hardly an indication of a sound, robustly-growing economy. If China does not start developing more of its own domestic economy for its people, trouble looms.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">Further, China is not America’s banker, as many people believe. President Obama’s stimulus package was bad policy, but the notion that China is now funding our economy as a result is a fallacy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>America could get by without China funding its debt. What’s largely unknown is that China officially holds less than 7 percent of U.S. treasuries, and that Chinese bond purchases declined in 2009</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, to under $100 billion, while our deficit soared to an all-time high of $1.4 trillion.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Moreover, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">China does not buy our debt for our sake; it does so it because it depends on an economy as large and sound as ours for its own growth propelled through trade</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: The same set of rules that keep its currency undervalued means, by law, it can’t spend at home the huge pile of cash that it sits on.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In that respect, </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">China is more directly tied to us than we are to them</span></u><u>. If the United States were to discontinue trade with China, it would hurt them more than us.</u></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Finally,</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">China is not going to surpass the United States as the world economic leader any time soon</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffff00; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">We control about a fourth of the wealth in the world </span></u><u>– more than China, India, Japan and the rest of Asia combined. Other indicators are just as definitive.</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The average American earns close to fifteen times more than the average person in China</span></u><u>. If the United States keeps tax rates low, shows spending discipline, and brings the deficit down to promote solid economic growth, there is strong reason to believe that China will never surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">EXT – Competitiveness Not K2 Heg</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>The US benefits from innovation in other countries, and our educational model insures a competitive economy.</strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">John </span><strong>Kay</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Financial Times, “The east’s innovators are no threat to the west,” 12/2/</span><strong>2008</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bhide.net/venturesome_press/John_Kay_FT_Dec_3_08.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhide.net/venturesome_press/John_Kay_FT_Dec_3_08.pdf</a></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Such policies are described as “techno nationalism” in an important recent book called The Venturesome Economy by Amar Bhidé. </span><u>Techno nationalism is derived from the belief that economic growth depends on high technology and that we will benefit fully from it only if it is our own high technology.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Techno nationalism is as common in Europe, which believes it is falling behind, as in America, which fears it may be overtaken. But the fear that western economic prosperity is endangered by China’s flood of engineering graduates is not only exaggerated: it may be the reverse of the truth. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">The central fallacy of the New Economy bubble was that most of the benefits of new technologies would go to pioneering companies</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the repeated experience of economic history is that competition ensures that the larger part of the benefits of these technologies </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">accrue to users</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In an admittedly speculative calculation, the American economist Bill Nordhaus has suggested that </span><u>consumers get</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">more than </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">97 per cent</span></strong></u><u><span style="background: #ffff00;"> of the value </span></u><u>of innovations</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">What is true of companies is also true of states. The US has a world leading position in information technology but the products of that technology are available everywhere with minimal delay.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> And cheaply: the profits of Microsoft, though large in absolute terms, are less than 0.1 per cent of the national income of the US and Europe. </span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">That is why economist Paul Romer can observe that: “In 1985, I paid $1,000 per million transistors for memory in my computer. In 2005 I paid less than $10 per million and yet I did nothing to deserve or help pay for the windfall.” But Prof Bhidé is not so sure that Prof Romer did nothing to deserve it and nor am I. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>What distinguishes the US is not just its innovative technologists, but its innovative manufacturers, retailers and consumers. Discoveries are made in an environment that is responsive to ideas, ready to embrace change and always willing to try out something new.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> People who are likely to invent things want to be part of a culture that is open to novelty, and cultures that are open to novelty are those that will reward innovators best. That is why there are so many entrepreneurs of Chinese and Indian origin in the US – and Britain – even as more and more mundane jobs are outsourced to China and India. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>The</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">pesky American students </span></u><u>who are ready to challenge every assertion the instructor makes contrast with students from other cultures who believe their aim is to transcribe every authoritative statement that is delivered. These voluble business students are the bane of the MBA teacher’s life. They are also the people who</u> <u><span style="background: #ffff00;">make American business great</span></u><u>.</u> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">Commercial and economic success, even in technological industries, depends not on the quality of technology, but on the match between technology and the needs of its customers. That is why the growing technological capabilities of China and India create more commercial opportunities than threats for American and European businesses</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>The US still benefits from innovation elsewhere – trade and demand for complementary US innovation.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">A future in which a significant share of new technologies is invented elsewhere will </span></u><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">benefit</span></strong></u><u><span style="background: #ffff00;"> the United States as long as it maintains the capability to acquire and implement technologies</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> invented abroad. Technology is an essential factor of productivity, and </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">the use of new technology </span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(whether it was invented in the United States or elsewhere) </span><u><span style="background: #ffff00;">can result in greater efficiency, economic growth, and higher living standards. </span></u><u>The impact of globalization on U.S. innovative activity is less clear</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On the one hand, </span><u><strong><span style="background: #ffff00;">significant innovation and R&amp;D elsewhere may increase foreign and domestic demand for U.S. research and innovation</span></strong></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if the United States keeps its comparative advantage in R&amp;D. On the other hand, the rise of populous, low-income countries may threaten this comparative advantage in R&amp;D in certain areas if such countries develop the capacity and institutions necessary to apply new technologies and have a well-educated, low-wage S&amp;T labor force. </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">PICK A MEASURE, ANY MEASURE</span> <u>TO UNDERSTAND just how dominant the</u> United States <u>is</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> today, </span><u>one needs to look at</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> each of the standard </span><u>components of national power</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in succession. In the military arena, </span><u>the</u> United States <u>is poised to spend more on defense</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> in 2003 </span><u>than the next 15 -- 20 biggest spenders combined</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States has overwhelming nuclear superiority, the world's dominant air force, the only truly blue-water navy, and a unique capability to project power around the globe. And its military advantage is even more apparent in quality than in quantity. The United States leads the world in exploiting the military applications of advanced communications and information technology and it has demonstrated an unrivaled ability to coordinate and process information about the battlefield and destroy targets from afar with extraordinary precision. Washington is not making it easy for others to catch up, moreover, given the massive gap in spending on military research and development (R&amp;D), on which the United States spends three times more than the next six powers combined. Looked at another way, the United States currently spends more on military R&amp;D than Germany or the United Kingdom spends on defense in total. </span><u>No state in the</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> modern </span><u>history of international politics has come close to the military predominance these numbers suggest</u>. <u>And the</u> United States <u>purchases this preeminence with only 3.5 percent of</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> its </span><u>GDP</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">As historian Paul Kennedy notes, &quot;being Number One at great cost is one thing; being the world's single superpower on the cheap is astonishing.&quot; </span><u>America's economic dominance</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">meanwhile -- relative to either the next several richest powers or the rest of the world combined -- </span><u>surpasses</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that of </span><u>any great power in modern history</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">with the sole exception of its own position after 1945 (when World War II had temporarily laid waste every other major economy). </span><u>The U.S. economy</u> <u>is</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> currently </span><u>twice as large as its closest rival</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Japan. California's economy alone has risen to become the fifth largest in the world (using market exchange-rate estimates), ahead of France and just behind the United Kingdom. It is true that the long expansion of the 1990s has ebbed, but it would take an experience like Japan's in that decade -- that is, an extraordinarily deep and prolonged domestic recession juxtaposed with robust growth elsewhere -- for the United States just to fall back to the economic position it occupied in 1991. The odds against such relative decline are long, however, in part because the United States is the country in the best position to take advantage of globalization. Its status as the preferred destination for scientifically trained foreign workers solidified during the 1990s, and it is the most popular destination for foreign firms. In 1999 it attracted more than one-third of world inflows of foreign direct investment. </span><u>U.S. military and economic dominance</u>, finally, <u>is rooted in the country's position as the world's leading technological power</u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although measuring national R&amp;D spending is increasingly difficult in an era in which so many economic activities cross borders, efforts to do so indicate America's continuing lead. Figures from the late 1990s showed that </span><u>U.S. expenditures on R&amp;D nearly equaled those of the next seven richest countries combined</u>. <u>Measuring</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the degree of </span><u>American dominance in each category begins to place things in perspective</u>. <u>But what truly distinguishes the current international system is American dominance in</u> <u><strong>all of them simultaneously</strong></u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Previous leading states in the modern era were either great commercial and naval powers or great military powers on land, never both. The British Empire in its heyday and the United States during the Cold War, for example, each shared the world with other powers that matched or exceeded them in some areas. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the United Kingdom was clearly the world's leading commercial and naval power. But even at the height of the Pax Britannica, the United Kingdom was outspent, outmanned, and outgunned by both France and Russia. And its 24 percent share of GDP among the six leading powers in the early 1870s was matched by the United States, with Russia and Germany following close behind. Similarly, at the dawn of the Cold War the United States was clearly dominant economically as well as in air and naval capabilities. But the Soviet Union retained overall military parity, and thanks to geography and investment in land power it had a superior ability to seize territory in Eurasia. Today, in contrast, </span><u>the</u> United States <u>has no rival in any critical dimension of power</u>. <u>There has never been a system of sovereign states that contained one state with this degree of dominance</u>. <u>The recent tendency to equate unipolarity with the ability to achieve desired outcomes single-handedly on all issues only reinforces this point; in no previous international system would it ever have occurred to anyone to apply such a yardstick</u>.<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> CAN IT LAST? </span><u>MANY WHO ACKNOWLEDGE the extent of American power</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, however, </span><u>regard it as</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> necessarily </span><u>self-negating</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Other states traditionally band together to restrain potential hegemons, they say, and this time will be no different. As German political commentator Josef Joffe has put it, &quot;the history books say that Mr. Big always invites his own demise. Nos. 2, 3, 4 will gang up on him, form countervailing alliances and plot his downfall. That happened to Napoleon, as it happened to Louis XIV and the mighty Hapsburgs, to Hitler and to Stalin. Power begets superior counterpower; it's the oldest rule of world politics.&quot; </span><u>What such arguments fail to recognize are the features of America's</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> post -- Cold War </span><u>position that make it likely to buck the historical trend</u>. <u>Bounded by oceans</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to the east and west and weak, </span><u>friendly powers to the north and south, the</u> United States <u>is</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> both </span><u>less vulnerable</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> than previous aspiring hegemons and also less threatening to others. The main </span><u>potential challengers</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> to its unipolarity, </span><u>meanwhile</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> -- China, Russia, Japan, and Germany -- </span><u>are in the opposite position. They cannot augment their military capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> so as </span><u>to balance the</u> United States <u>without simultaneously becoming an immediate threat to their neighbors</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Politics, even international politics, is local. Although American power attracts a lot of attention globally, states are usually more concerned with their own neighborhoods than with the global equilibrium. </span><u>Were any</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> of </span>the <u>potential challengers to make a serious run at the</u> United States, <u><strong>regional balancing efforts would almost certainly</strong></u> help <u><strong>contain them</strong></u>, <u>as would the massive latent power capabilities of the</u> United States, <u>which could be mobilized</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> as necessary </span><u>to head off an emerging threat</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">may have reflected the administration’s honest judgment that such laws are repugnant and violate federal authority. But the lawsuit </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">also </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">in June </span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Latinos were increasingly disaffected from Obama and his policies</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, while the President’s favorability rating with Whites and Black was unchanged. From a high of 69% in January, Obama's rating with Latinos had fallen 12 points to 57%. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, the drop was even more precipitous: 25%. </span><br />
<u>According to Gallup, the slide was largely due to Obama’s failure to pursue</u><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But </span><br />
<u>thus far the Obama gambit isn’t working - and that spells trouble. According to the most recent polls,</u><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">– including immigration - leading up to 2012. And Republicans could also win a majority of the governorships and state legislatures which would allow them to dominate the upcoming federal redistricting process, influencing the composition of the House for at least another decade – perhaps two. </span><br />

<strong>D. Cap and trade collapses global trade.</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 12pt;">Nader and Heaps – 12/7/08</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(Ralph, consumer advocate and three-time presidential candidate, and Toby, coordinator of Option 13, a campaign to help broker a successor to the Kyoto Protocol, “Junk Cap-and-Trade,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/nader12052008.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterpunch.org/nader12052008.html</a>)</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">If President Barack Obama wants to stop the descent toward dangerous global climate change, and avoid the trade anarchy that current approaches to this problem will invite, he should take Al Gore's proposal for a carbon tax and make it global. </span><br />
<u>A tax on CO2 emissions -- not a cap-and-trade system -- offers the best prospect of meaningfully engaging China and the U.S., while avoiding the prospect of unhinged environmental protectionism.</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">China emphatically opposes a hard emissions cap on its economy. Yet </span><br />
<u>China must be part of any climate deal</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">or within 25 years, notes Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, its emissions of CO2 could amount to twice the combined emissions of the world's richest nations, including the United States, Japan and members of the European Union. According to the world authority on the subject, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it will cost $1.375 trillion per year to beat back climate change and keep global temperature increases to less than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). </span><br />
<u>Cap-and-traders assume</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, without much justification, </span><br />
<u>that one country can put a price on carbon emissions while another doesn't without affecting trade or investment decisions</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. This is a bad assumption, given false comfort by the Montreal Protocol treaty, which took this approach to successfully rein in ozone-depleting gases. Chlorofluorocarbons are not pervasive like greenhouse gases (GHGs); nor was the economy of 1987 hyperglobalized like ours today. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Good intentions to limit big polluters </span><br />
in some countries but not others will turn any meaningful cap into Swiss cheese. It can be avoided by relocating existing and new production of various kinds of CO2-emitting industries to jurisdictions with no or virtually no limits<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. This is known as carbon leakage, and </span><br />
<u>it</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">leads to <strong>trade anarchy</strong></span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. How? </span><br />
<u>The most advanced piece of</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">climate legislation </span><br />
at the moment, the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">contains provisions for retaliatory action to be taken against imports from carbon free-riding nations</span><br />
. Married with the current economic malaise, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the temptation to slide into a righteous but runaway environmental protectionism </span><br />
-- which Washington's K Street lobbyists would be only too happy to grease -- <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">would almost certainly lead to a <strong>collapse of the multilateral trading system</strong></span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">This scenario was presented to the world's trade ministers last December at the United Nations climate talks in Bali by David Runnalls of the International Institute for Sustainable Development. True, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">trade anarchy might reduce emissions via a <strong>massive global depression</strong></span><br />
. But there would be a lot of collateral damage<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Because of the sheer scale of the challenge and the state of the hyperglobalized economy, we will need the same price on carbon everywhere, or it won't work anywhere. President Obama can define his legacy in the first 100 days by laying the groundwork for a global tax on carbon dioxide emissions that is effective, efficient, equitable and enforceable. An effective, harmonized tax on C02 emissions must stabilize the growth of atmospheric concentrations of GHGs by no later than 2020. The tax must also be adjusted annually, by a global body, according to this objective. The IPCC has crunched the numbers and says this means a tax of about $50 levied on every metric ton of GHGs, or carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e to use their terminology). In the short-term, consumers would feel the pinch. But the tax would pave the way for cheaper, cleaner energy and ways of getting around. The most efficient way to apply a carbon tax is at a relatively small number of major carbon bottlenecks, which cover the lion's share of GHGs. The key points where flows of carbon are the most concentrated include: trunk pipelines for gas, refineries for oil, railroad heads for coal, liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals, cement, steel, aluminum and GHG-intensive chemical plants. Collecting and spending the bulk of revenues from a carbon tax must remain the sovereign right of participating nations. For instance, nations could decide to make the tax revenue-neutral by reducing taxes on income or helping finance industrial retooling for a green economy. However, we in the rich world must recognize our culpability for creating three-quarters of this global warming mess, as well as our greater capacity to finance industrial retooling. Thus, there could be a carrot for developing-world nations which commit to applying the phased-in carbon tax: Access to a portion of the carbon tax levies from rich countries to help preserve forests and to prepare for climate change through flood walls, improved irrigation, drought resistant crops, desalination facilities, and the like. This is no small change: 10% of $50/metric ton CO2e carbon tax levied in all rich countries would be $100 billion per year. The stick for carbon free-riding countries would come in the form of incrementally severe penalties, leading up to countervailing duties on carbon-intensive imports. A global carbon tax levied on a relatively small number of large sources can be monitored by satellite and checked against the annual surveillance of fiscal and economic polices already carried out by IMF staff. Thus, the accounting involved is much more precise and much less subject to the vagaries of corruption and conflict over which industries and companies get their free handouts of carbon credits -- carbon pork -- than in a cap-and-trade system. </span><br />
<u>There are three reasons why countries, such as</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">China and India</span><br />
, that <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">have traditionally resisted any notion of a common responsibility</span><br />
to make current polluters pay would do well to enlist in this effort.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">First, while </span><br />
<u>there is no limit on the downside for missing a hard cap</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, with a carbon tax you just pay as you go. </span><br />
<u>If a fast-growing country like China accepted an emissions cap and then overshot it, they would have to purchase carbon credits on the international market. If they missed their target by a lot, carbon credits would be scarce, and purchasing them would suck dry their foreign exchange reserves in one slurp</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. That's why a carbon tax is much easier to swallow and, anyway, through the power of the price signal, it would produce the same desired result as a hard cap. Second, </span><br />
<u>administering billions of dollars of carbon credits in a cap-and-trade system in an already chaotic regulatory environment would invite a civil war between interest groups seeking billions in carbon credit handouts and the regulator holding the kitty</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. By contrast, a uniform tax on CO2 emissions levied at a small number of large sites would be relatively clear-cut. During the Montreal Protocol talks in the 1980s, India smartly balked at a suggestion to phase out CFCs in certain products and not in others because of the chaos that would result from the ambiguity. Third, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">key people in China </span><br />
read our newspapers. They <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">see the ominous clouds of protectionism under the guise of environmentalism</span><br />
in bills like Lieberman-Warner<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">and they don't want to be harmed; neither should we, given the trillions of dollars of Treasury bills they hold. Showing compliance with a harmonized carbon tax at a small number of large bottleneck points would be child's play compared to the chaos of cap-and-trade.</span><br />
<strong>E. Global nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Copley News Service</strong><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, December 1, </span><br />
<strong>1999</strong><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, “Commentary”</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">For decades, many children in America and other countries went to bed fearing annihilation by nuclear war. The specter of nuclear winter freezing the life out of planet Earth seemed very real. Activists protesting the World Trade Organization's meeting in Seattle apparently have forgotten that threat. The truth is that </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">nations join together in </span><br />
<u>groups like</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the WTO not just to further their own prosperity, but also to forestall conflict with other nations</span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">In a way, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">our planet has traded in the threat of a worldwide nuclear war for the benefit of cooperative global economics</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Some Seattle protesters clearly fancy themselves to be in the mold of nuclear disarmament or anti-Vietnam War protesters of decades past. But they're not. They're special-interest activists, whether the cause is environmental, labor or paranoia about global government. Actually, most of the demonstrators in Seattle are very much unlike yesterday's peace activists, such as Beatle John Lennon or philosopher Bertrand Russell, the father of the nuclear disarmament movement, both of whom urged people and nations to work together rather than strive against each other. These and other war protesters would probably approve of 135 WTO nations sitting down peacefully to discuss economic issues that in the past might have been settled by bullets and bombs. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">As long as nations are trading peacefully, and their economies are built on exports to other countries, they have a major disincentive to wage war</span><br />
<u>.</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">That's why bringing China, a budding superpower, into the WTO is so important. As exports to the United States and the rest of the world feed Chinese prosperity, and that prosperity increases demand for the goods we produce, the threat of hostility diminishes. Many anti-trade protesters in Seattle claim that only multinational corporations benefit from global trade, and that it's the everyday wage earners who get hurt. That's just plain wrong. First of all, it's not the military-industrial complex benefiting. It's U.S. companies that make high-tech goods. And those companies provide a growing number of jobs for Americans. In San Diego, many people have good jobs at Qualcomm, Solar Turbines and other companies for whom overseas markets are essential. In Seattle, many of the 100,000 people who work at Boeing would lose their livelihoods without world trade. </span><br />
<u>Foreign trade</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">today </span><br />
<u>accounts for 30 percent of our gross domestic product.</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">That's a lot of jobs for everyday workers. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Growing global prosperity has helped counter the specter of nuclear winter.</span><br />
<u>Nations of the world are learning to live and work together</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, like the singers of anti-war songs once imagined. Those who care about world peace shouldn't be protesting world trade. They should be celebrating it.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. While the number of technical IT professionals from India, China and other developing countries with large pools of technologically skilled workers who apply for H-1B temporary visas to work in the United States has dropped sharply in recent years. One reason is the reduction in the available number of United States H-1B visas, which allow degreed professionals and specialty workers to work for a specific employer. </span><br />
<u>The maximum number of this type of visa has been reduced to 65,000 annually, and coupled with a more difficult renewal process, has spurred many IT professionals in the global work force to look elsewhere for well-paying jobs.</u><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">visa restrictions in the United States directly impacted his decision to leave his Connecticut employer for a position in Canada with Morgan Stanley</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;I wanted to be in control of my career in terms of which employer I work for and how long I work for that employer instead of being tied down to one place,&quot; said Amit, a foreign national and IT professional. &quot;</span><br />
<u>With American visa restrictions, you cannot change or find jobs easily and it adds an additional layer of disadvantage in an already difficult job market</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Although the job market in America is admittedly tough right now and it may be easier to get access to a visa by moving to Canada, Amit described why it might also be tough to find a job on Canadian soil through standard job-search methods and sites. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">He said in his experience, a typical Google search for IT positions in Canada doesn't bring as many return listings as a Google search for U.S. jobs because only a few job portals in the United States represent almost all of the jobs available in the current market, but Canadian searches are more localized, making the right fit more difficult and more time-consuming to find. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;The candidate needs to be a lot more persistent and intensive,&quot; Amit said. &quot;The Canada job market also has a tendency to put a disproportionate premium on the 'local experience' factor, which shouldn't really be a primary consideration in this particular business environment because most candidates are highly mobile across the globe.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">H-1B visa holders like Amit was able to make their job search easier through the use of a resource such as Kovasys Inc. (www.kovasys.com), a Canada-based headhunting and recruitment agency that helps place IT and technological professionals, which helped him find a job in Canada. Such recruitment companies should be helpful in combating the disadvantage of finding an actual placement, which seems to currently be the only downside for H-1B workers looking for employment in Canada. In the meanwhile, Amit said he finds the Canadian people welcoming and the country foreigner-friendly, and is looking forward to beginning his new job at the end of the month. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">While Amit's future is looking up, the outlook involving H-1B visas in the U.S. is not nearly as positive. </span><br />
<u>Although the American economy is slowly improving and should continue to show signs of recovery over the next few years, the H-1B</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">restrictions are not likely to be lifted or revised during that time. <strong>Until they are, foreign workers like Amit will continue to leave the United States for Canada in search of better prospects</strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">When it comes to metropolitan concentration, Bourne and Rose state that </span><br />
<u>there is a large capacity of immigrants entering the ‘gateway’ cities of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. This is due to the fact there are many economic expectations and opportunities in these larger cities. There have been increases in the construction and retailing industries, which is leading to a larger workforce. Population growth is linked to the decline in environmental conditions, such as land, water, and urban air pollution. </span><br />
<u>In Canada, immigration is key to population growth in the ‘gateway’ cities</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">According to Bourne and Rose, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">immigration is a main contributor to the Canadian labour force. “…close to 70 percent of labour force growth may be attributed to immigrants</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.” As for personal incomes it is said that it takes 10-15 years after landing, to reach the national level. After that, some immigrants reach over the national average. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Skilled workers earnings exceed the overall population of tax-filers within two years of landing in Canada.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">For example, Vancouver receives many immigrants that have funds that exceed the Canadian average. On the other hand, many classes of immigrants have a longer wait to the Canadian average. We must also look at the difficulties that immigrants face, in regards to poverty groups. According to Kazemipur and Halli “…immigrants are one of the groups most likely to be living in poverty in Canada (after Aboriginals and female-headed, single parent families.)” There has been much business failure that has been the outcome of the business immigrants whom have tried to join the economy. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Thus, we see that </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">immigration accounts for almost half of Canada’s population growth</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<u>This is becoming an important element of the political economy and cultural life of Canada</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Immigration plays a vital role in the sustainability of Canada’s economy</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">It would be hard to imagine many years down the road without immigration, as it would stunt the growing economy</span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">We, as other nations such as the United States and the European nations have begun to recruit the highest skilled workers from overseas. </span><br />
<u>Canada is likely to be a country of pronounced immigration and emigration. With the effects of both migration patterns it will be interesting to see the redistribution of Canada’s population</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. The most notable issues still remain unsettled. These include the articulation of immigrant communities and their diverse backgrounds. The relations between immigration and issues of citizenship and national identity are a hot topic. The meaning of Canadian citizenship is changing. Its unclear as to the way and the effect of this change will occur. </span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Current opinion polls in Quebec show that pro-independence forces are somewhat below the 50 percent margin that would trigger formal negotiations with the rest of Canada on the terms of separation</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. The current premier, Lucien Bouchard, is a crafty nationalist who will not put the question to another referendum unless he is convinced it will obtain a majority vote. My guess is that if Bouchard has doubts about reaching at least 50 percent in favor of independence, he will first call a provincial election and hope to increase the majority of his Parti Quebecois. That would give him more confidence about winning a referendum. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Canada will disintegrate shortly after Quebec separates </span><br />
via a Unilateral Declaration of Independence<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">[Bouchard threatened to do this on April 28th, 1996]. Quebec will become a socialist, somewhat aberrant and unpredictable state which will ultimately be refused entry to NAFTA by the US and Canada. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The Canadian provinces will </span><br />
seize more and more power from a weakened Federal government, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">become individual or regional &quot;mini-states&quot; themselves</span><br />
, and turn their eyes southward.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">BC and Alberta will withdraw into &quot;Cascadia&quot;, a union of those two provinces with California, Oregon, Washington State, Idaho and Alaska, forming a bloc with the ninth-largest economy in the world. BC and Alberta will apply for admission into the US, and be accepted immediately. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Manitoba will hook up with Minnesota around a Red River union. Saskatchewan will join with Montana, Colorado, and Wyoming in the Rocky Mountain Corridor. Manitoba and Saskatchewan would be given associate status with the US, depending - among other things - on how cooperative they are in facilitating the export of Canadian water to the United States. Ontario would sink into the embrace of the US Great Lakes states. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Canada's Atlantic Provinces would form an &quot;association&quot; with New England. </span><br />
<u>The US federal government</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, Lamont asserts, </span><br />
<u>will not be &quot;happy&quot; with this turn of events -</u><br />

multiply the difficulties in observing and fulfilling a wide range of current bi-lateral agreements and treaties<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, etc. But it will be &quot;persuaded&quot; by the addition of vast water resources, wood, immense mineral troves, multi-billion barrel oil and tar-sand reserves, etc, to America's economic base and strategic reserves. </span><br />

<u>For years, champions of high-stakes testing and mandatory curriculum standards have invoked a need to ratchet up the skills of future employees</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">and, by extension, the revenues of U.S. corporations. Now, though, opponents of such policies are using the identical argument. In recent months, two prominent critics of No Child Left Behind have argued in separate articles that the law’s effect on instruction isn’t consistent with what’s needed to produce successful workers. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">I’m sure they’re right. But just as we shouldn’t justify a wonderful curriculum by claiming it will raise standardized test scores – first, because such tests measure what matters least, and second, because claims of this sort serve to legitimate these tests – so we should hesitate to defend or criticize educational practices on economic grounds. </span><br />
<u>Various strands of evidence have converged to challenge the claim that the state of our economy is a function of how good our schools are at preparing tomorrow’s workers. For individual students, school achievement is only weakly related to subsequent workplace performance.</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">And for nations, there’s little correlation between average test scores and economic vigor. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Schools make a tempting scapegoat when a company’s financial results are disappointing or when the economy as a whole falters. But an employee’s educational background is only one of many factors that determine his or her productivity. </span><br />
<u>Worker productivity</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, in turn, </span><br />
<u>is only one of many factors that determine corporate profitability. And corporate profitability is only one of many factors that determine the state of the economy – particularly the employment picture</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Does anyone seriously believe, for example, that the main reason U.S. companies are shipping jobs by the millions to Mexico and Asia is because they believe those countries’ schools are better? </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But let’s talk about values, not just facts. Is the main mission of schools really to prepare children to be productive workers who will do their part to increase the profitability of their future employers? </span><br />
<u>Every time education is described as an “investment,” or schools are discussed in the context of the “global economy,” a loud alarm ought to go off, reminding us of the moral and practical implications of giving an answer in dollars to a question about schools</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. As Jonathan Kozol recently reminded us, good teachers “refuse to see their pupils as . . . pint-sized deficits or assets for America’s economy into whom they are expected to pump ‘added value.’” </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Lending an even more noxious twist to the habit of seeing education in purely economic terms is the use of the word “competitiveness,” which implies that our goals should be framed in terms of beating others</span><br />
rather than doing well. When the topic is globalization, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">it’s commonly assumed that competition is unavoidable</span><br />
: For one enterprise (or country) to succeed, another must fail. But even if this were true<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">– and economists Paul Krugman and the late David Gordon have separately argued it probably isn’t -- </span><br />
<u>why in the world would we accept the same zero-sum mentality with respect to learning?</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Consider the sport of ranking the U.S. against other nations on standardized tests. Once we’ve debunked the myth that test scores predict economic success, why would we worry about our country’s standing as measured by those scores? To say that our students are first, or tenth, on a list provides no useful information about how much they know or how good our schools are. If all the countries did reasonably well in absolute terms, there would be no shame in (and, perhaps, no statistical significance to) being at the bottom. If all the countries did poorly, there would be no glory in being at the top. Exclamatory headlines about how “our” schools are doing compared to “theirs” suggest that we’re less concerned with the quality of education than with whether we can chant, “We’re Number One!” </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">An essay published [in Education Week] last year reported that U.S. students are doing better in mathematics than earlier generations did. Was the author moved by this fact to express delight, or at least relief? On the contrary, he pronounced the current state of affairs “disturbing” because children in other countries are also doing well – and that, by definition, is considered bad news. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Likewise, the New York Times warned in the late 1990s that “American high school graduation rates, for generations the highest in the world, have slipped below those of most industrialized countries.” Actually, </span><br />
<u>on most measures, the U.S. is doing better than ever in terms of the proportion of our adults who finish school. But again we were invited to fret because progress had been made by other countries, too, meaning we were no longer king of the mountain</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<u>What if we just ignored the status of students in other countries? That wouldn’t be especially neighborly, but at least we wouldn’t be viewing the gains of children in other lands as a troubling development. Better yet,</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">rather than defending whatever policies will ostensibly help our graduates to “compete,” we could make decisions on the basis of what will help them collaborate effectively.</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Educators</span><br />
, too, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">might think in terms of working with – and learning from – their counterparts in other countries</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Even beyond the moral justification for transcending reflexive rivalry</span><br />
, Janet Swenson at Michigan State University points out that “ <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">we’ll all benefit from the best education we can provide to every child on the face of this planet. </span><br />
Do you care if it’s a child in Africa who finds a cure for cancer rather than a child in your country?<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">” she asks. </span><br />
<u>It took me awhile to realize that at the core of the current “tougher standards” movement is a worldview characterized by artificial scarcity -- along with the assumption that schooling is ultimately about economic outcomes.</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">A more reasonable and humane perspective is always hard to come by when we’re told that we’re in a race. <strong>The prospects for critical thought are particularly bleak if the race never ends</strong></span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Sadder still, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the same competitive mindset shows up as district is pitted against district,</span><br />
school against school, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">student against student</span><br />
. Several years ago, one superintendent in the Northeast vowed that his city’s test scores would “never be last again” in his state. Like so many others, he was confusing higher scores with better learning. But this appalling statement also implied that his students didn’t have to improve; as long as kids in another community fared even more poorly, he would be satisfied. <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Such a position is not only intellectually indefensible </span><br />
(because of its focus on relative performance) <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">but morally bankrupt </span><br />
(because of its indifference to the welfare of children in other places)<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">can be rationalized in the name of “competitiveness” by politicians and corporate executives, or by journalists whose imaginations are flatter than the world about which they write. </span><br />
But educators ought to aim higher. Our loyalty, after all, is not to corporations but to children. Our chief concern – our “bottom line,” if you must -- is not victory for some but learning for all<br />

<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The subject </span><br />
of the Earth's environment and the totality of human activity <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">is extremely large and complex</span><br />
. It cannot be properly addressed from the vantage point of a single branch of science or engineering, or by a single university, organization or national agency. <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">What is needed is a comprehensive, international effort</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Recognizing this, the former president of UT (The University of Tokyo), Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, MIT President Charles Vest, and the former president of ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology, Zurich) Jakob Nuesch signed an agreement under which their three universities would form an international cooperation research program called the Alliance for Global Sustainability (AGS) in 1996. (Chalmers University of Technology joined AGS in 2001.) Based on a partnership between these three universities, the AGS is designed to promote joint research projects that will result in realistic policy proposals for the development of a civilization that can be sustained within the limitations required to preserve the global environment. Specifically, the three universities aim to contribute to global society under a system of close cooperation among their departments created to carry out interdisciplinary projects in which scientific knowledge will be gathered, new technologies will be developed, and policy proposals will be made. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The goal is to promote the type of development that will make it possible to preserve human civilization, resources and ecosystems on Earth.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">AGS' unique contribution lies in breaking down the barriers between the natural sciences, engineering, and the social sciences to enable researchers in a wide range of disciplines to participate in the debate. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">A comprehensive approach which transcends geographic regions and academic disciplines is needed to develop solutions that will make it possible to permanently sustain human life on this planet</span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Established by University of Tokyo, MIT, ETH, and Chalmers, the AGS will seek the participation of those in business and government as well as academic institutions in North and South America, Africa, Asia, Europe and other regions. </span><br />
<u>The broadest possible cooperation</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">among these participants </span><br />
<u>will be sought to enable researchers to foster policy proposals and the development of new technologies that will make it possible to sustain civilization while preserving the natural environment. The cooperative relations for international research cooperation are conceived of in the broadest possible terms. Regional limitations on human activity are withering away, and environmental problems no longer can be confined within national or regional borders. This can only mean that</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">wide-ranging cooperation is absolutely necessary. If a broad global perspective is not adopted, mankind will not be able to plot a course for sustainable social development. </span><br />
We are determined to utilize the international academic cooperation like the AGS to create a future that will guarantee health, safety and prosperity for our descendants -- for the entire human race<br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">For nations, communities, and individual workers </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">global competition is about competing against every other nation, community, and worker in the world for a declining pool of jobs by courting corporate favor. It is not about creating new jobs, but rather about redistributing them to those that are willing to give up the most in terms of wages, subsidies, tax breaks, working conditions, and environmental standards</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">More fundamentally it is about shifting wealth from communities and working people to corporations and share holders</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The real issues behind economic globalization relate to power. Most so called trade agreements, such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), are really agreements securing the rights of global corporations to operate freely wherever they chose. These agreements advance the process of delinking global corporations from accountability to all interests save one-a global financial system that relentlessly demands ever increasing financial returns. </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Accountable to the narrow interests of only one stakeholder, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">managers have little choice but to use the corporate power at their command to drive competitors from the market or absorb them through acquisitions, shed workers, bid down local wages and standards, and obtain ever greater subsidies and tax breaks </span><br />
from those localities they in turn favor with jobs<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Those managers who do this successfully reap enormous financial rewards. Those who resist are cast out in favor of less principled replacements. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">It is quite disingenuous of those who sit at the pinnacles of corporate power to advise nations and communities to make themselves more globally competitive</span><br />
. The recommended measures do little to expand the total pool of jobs or increase average wages and the standards that make for healthy nations and communities. Rather they simply increase the public subsidies to those corporate managers and shareholders. The extreme inequality that is creating dangerous social and political instability throughout the world is an inherent consequence of an economic system in which people and communities are forced to compete for favor with giant corporations accountable only to the interests of global financial markets.<br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Correcting the massive dysfunction that economic globalization has created will not be easy</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">. <u>The starting point must be a clear recognition that this dysfunction is inherent in a globalized economic system.</u></span><br />
<u>We should also be clear that this system was put in place through intentional policy choices orchestrated by the powerful and well organized economic interests that have benefited from it. We can just as well put in place policies that result in a sharing of the benefits of technological change, and return both economic and political power to the local communities where people live and work.</u><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">This will require people and communities to recognize that their interests are better served by international cooperation than by global competition</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Through cooperation we can put in place policies that create a bias in favor of local rather than global capital and production systems, help us to move toward greater equity, protect the environment, nurture cultural diversity and exchange, raise living standards, and share experience, knowledge and technologies to the benefit of all people everywhere</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. If Messrs. Schwab and Smadja and their colleagues in the World Economic Forum truly wish to forestall the mounting backlash against the disruptive consequences of economic globalization, they should take the additional step of acknowledging that economic globalization is itself an inherently bad idea and join in this challenging endeavor. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The H-1B program has been corrupted by a large and growing share of firms that use it for cheap labor and to facilitate the outsourcing of jobs. Gaping loopholes make it very easy and legal to pay below-market wages</span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">In fact, </span><br />
<u>employers admitted to the Government Accountability Office, Congress’ watchdog agency, that they use the visas to hire less-expensive foreign workers.</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">And examples of approved H-1B applications show how the program undercuts American workers. In 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor rubber-stamped HCL America’s bid to import 75 computer software engineers at $11.88 per hour.</span><br />
<u>The problems don’t stop with cheap labor. The H-1B visa is so critical to the offshore outsourcing industry that India’s Commerce Minister has dubbed it the &quot;outsourcing visa.&quot;</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Seven of the top 10 H-1B employers are offshore outsourcing firms, </span><br />
none of whom hire many Americans, gobbling up tens of thousands of H-1B visas along the way<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Rather than preventing it, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the program speeds up the outsourcing of high-wage high-technology jobs</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">None of this should be surprising given the raison d’etre of modern corporations, maximizing profits. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Businesses do not exist to maximize their U.S. workforce or improve competitiveness in the U.S. If companies can lower costs by hiring cheaper foreign guest-workers, they will.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">If they can hire vendors who hire cheaper foreign guest-workers, they will. And who can blame them? If they don’t take advantage of blatant loopholes, their competitors surely will. </span><br />
<u>Cheap labor and outsourcing explain why the H-1B program is oversubscribed.</u><br />
<u>A sizable share of the U.S. high-tech workforce understands this logic, and justifiably views the H-1B program as a threat and a scam. That’s the real danger to U.S. competitiveness</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Young people considering a technology career see that industry prefers cheaper foreign guest-workers and that the government uses immigration policy to work against technology professionals.</span><br />
<strong>C. Wage deflation kills the economy – consumer demand and investment.</strong><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Patrick </span><br />
<strong>Belser</strong><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, Global Labour University, “Why we should care about wages,” 1/18/</span><br />
<strong>2010</strong><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://column.global-labour-university.org/2010/01/why-we-should-care-about-wages_3262.html" rel="nofollow">http://column.global-labour-university.org/2010/01/why-we-should-care-about-wages_3262.html</a></span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The second reason why we should care is that a </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">continued deterioration in wages is bad news for the economic recovery</span><br />
<u>.</u> <u>The pace of the recovery depends largely on the extent to which people are able to consume whatever the global economy produces. And</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">consumption</span><br />
, in turn, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">depends on</span><br />
the level of <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">wages</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. In fact, in some advanced economies, almost 80% of household income comes from wages and salaries. Although GDP figures in the course of 2009 provided indications of a possible economic rebound, </span><br />
<u>the trends in real wages observed during the past few quarters raise serious questions about the true extent of a global economic recovery and also highlight the risks of phasing out government rescue packages too early</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. As the experience of Japan during the past decade has cruelly shown, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">wage deflation deprives national economies of much needed demand and can result in <strong>lengthy periods of economic stagnation</strong></span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Finally, we should already be thinking about the post-crisis world. Before the crisis, in the period from 1995-2007, the share of wages in GDP had declined in a majority of countries for which data is available. This may have been due to a combination of weaker trade unions, labour-saving technology, openness to trade and the pressures arising from the financial of markets. Whatever the cause, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the imbalance between increasing profits and stagnating wages has contributed to the crisis by creating an explosive mixture of high liquidity on financial markets, low rates of interest, and huge household debts</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. A system of bonuses which distorted incentives towards short-term risk provided the additional dynamite. For a more stable future, </span><br />
<u>we should identify policies which ensure that productivity growth</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">- when it is back - </span><br />
<u>translates into adequate increases in wages for a majority, and not just higher bonuses for a few. Only this way can advanced economies achieve more sustainable patterns of consumption and investment</u><br />

<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Prior to the final economic collapse, the stress on nations will have increased the intensity and number of</span><br />

<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">conflicts, to the point where the arsenals of weapons of mass destruction</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(WMD) now possessed by some 25 nations, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">are almost certain to be released</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. As an example, </span><br />
<u>suppose a starving North Korea launches nuclear weapons upon Japan and South Korea,</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">including U.S. forces there, in a spasmodic suicidal response. </span><br />
<u>Or suppose a desperate China</u><br />

<u>attacks Taiwan</u><u>.</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">In addition to immediate responses, </span><br />
<u>the mutual treaties involved in such scenarios will quickly draw other nations into the conflict</u><u>,</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">escalating it significantly. Strategic nuclear studies have shown for decades that, under such extreme stress conditions, once a few nukes are launched, adversaries and potential adversaries are then compelled to launch on perception of preparations by one's adversary. The real legacy of the MAD concept is this side of the MAD coin that is almost never discussed. Without effective defense, the only chance a nation has to survive at all is to launch immediate full-bore pre-emptive strikes and try to take out its perceived foes as rapidly and massively as possible. As the studies showed, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">rapid escalation to full WMD exchange occurs</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Today, a great percent of the WMD arsenals that will be unleashed, are already on site within the United States itself. </span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The resulting great Armageddon will destroy civilization as we know it</span><br />

The retroactive grant of parole may also alleviate those who are subject to the three or ten year bars since INA § 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) defines “unlawful presence” as someone who is here “without being admitted or paroled.” <br />
<span style="background: lime;">Parole</span>, therefore, <span style="background: lime;">eliminates the accrual of unlawful presence</span><br />
. While parole does not constitute an admission, one conceptual difficulty is whether parole can be granted to an individual who is already admitted on a nonimmigrant visa but has overstayed. <br />
Since parole is not considered admission, <span style="background: lime;">it can be granted more readily to one who entered without inspection</span><br />
. On the other hand, <br />
<span style="background: lime;">it is possible for the Executive to rescind the grant of admission</span><br />
under INA §212(d)(5), <br />
<span style="background: lime;">and</span><br />
instead, <br />
<span style="background: lime;">replace it with the grant parole</span>. As an example, an individual who was admitted in B-2 status <br />

<u>In a global economy, investments will flow to the areas where they can earn the highest returns</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Many factors-such as labor supply, resource availability, and legal structure-influence the return on investments. In particular, </span><br />
<u>taxing returns on investment discourages investment, holding all else constant</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">According to a recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) working paper, of the three taxes (income, corporate, and consumption), </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">corporate taxes are </span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">harmful to economic growth</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.[3] </span><br />
<u>Other countries are aware of this and have steadily reduced their corporate tax rates. The U.S. has been the exception</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Chart 1 shows how </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">most other countries in the global economy have undercut U.S. competitiveness in corporate tax rates</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">If Congress repealed the corporate income tax, investments would flow into the country</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Multinational and international companies would be encouraged to operate in the United States, bringing <strong>jobs and new technology</strong> to meet today's economic challenges.</span><br />
<u>Owners of corporations-those who earn the profits-would have more resources to invest in things that create value for others</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Eliminating the corporate tax would also encourage owners to <strong>hire and train people</strong> and to <strong>invest in their workforces</strong> because a more competitive tax structure would give corporations a greater incentive to domicile in the U.S.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Further, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">higher levels of investment would <strong>require new skills</strong> of employees</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Under this approach </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the corporate income tax</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">as well as the existing individual income taxes collected from pass-through entities (partnerships, sole proprietorships, and S corporations) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">would be replaced with a BAT</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<u>While business income taxes would be repealed and replaced by a BAT, the individual income tax</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">that includes investor-level taxes on dividends </span><br />
<u>and capital gains would be retained</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, and the tax treatment of interest received by individuals would be conformed to that for dividends and capital gains (i.e., taxed at the lower rates currently available for dividends and capital gains). For two reasons, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">this approach is estimated to improve economic performance, ultimately increasing the size of the economy by roughly 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">First, </span><br />
<u>because a BAT does not tax the normal return to saving or investment</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">,14 </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">it is likely to stimulate additional saving and investment</span><br />
. Greater investment means businesses would have more capital, which increases workers’ productivity, and ultimately improves living standards<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Second, it would likely reduce a variety of tax distortions that arise under the current tax system due to the uneven treatment of investment and other economic activity.15</span><br />
<u>Because this approach entails repeal of the corporate income tax but retains the individual income tax, it could create incentives for individuals to accumulate passive investment income in the corporate form</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">to defer or avoid paying individual investorlevel taxes on such income. It also could create incentives for business owners to minimize payments for their own labor services, which would not be deductible, to avoid income and payroll taxes. These issues could be addressed through special rules, which could create additional complexity. Other distortions may arise because a BAT base is unlikely to cover all consumer goods and services. For example, taxing consumer financial services under a BAT is difficult in practice and small businesses are often exempt from consumption taxes in other countries for administrative reasons.</span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">That’s especially true with many companies now having second thoughts about the economic recovery. </span><br />
<u>Until a few months ago, corporations seemed increasingly confident that the economy was at least slowly headed in the right direction. Then it veered off course, taking hopes for a stronger labor market along with it</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Corporate America is taking a step back that could weigh heavily on the economy, <strong>especially job growth</strong></span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The turn began with Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and new worries about credit markets, which slammed stock prices. Questions about future tax policy, new regulations and health care reform added more uncertainty to growth prospects, along with fears that Washington had already spent most of its policy ammunition with little to show for it. Concerns that the federal deficit had handcuffed policy, as Congress allowed funding for unemployment benefits and state aid to expire, also clouded the outlook.</span><br />
<u>The August employment report from the Labor Deptartment buoyed hopes that businesses were not pulling back so sharply as to drag the economy back into a recession, but the numbers continued to show very cautious hiring patterns</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Overall, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">payrolls shrank by 54,000 workers last month</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, as more temporary Census jobs drew to a close, but private-sector payrolls showed a gain of 67,000, a bit better than expected. </span><br />
<u>Monthly private-sector increases over the past four months have averaged only 72,000, but earlier this year companies had shown enough confidence in future demand to lift their payrolls by 158,000 workers</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">in March, followed by 241,000 new hires in April. The recent pace of job growth suggests modest gains, at best, in consumer incomes and spending.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 12pt;">these proposals arise in response to the longtime claim by</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Intel and other large </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 12pt;">technology companies that an insufficient number of U.S. students pursue graduate study in tech fields. This,</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">say Intel <em>et al.</em>, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 12pt;">is why they hire a number of H-1Bs from U.S. university graduate programs</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Critics respond that this is just a pretext for hiring cheap, &quot;indentured&quot; foreign workers. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ilw.com/articles/2006,0531-matloff.shtm#4" rel="nofollow">[4</a>]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 12pt;">The &quot;free green card&quot; proposals also comprise a response to the academic lobby, as U.S. universities have seen their foreign applicant pools for graduate programs shrink</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">in recent years. </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 12pt;">, as is the salary premium paid to PhDs in industry</span><br />

<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span class="MinimizedTextChar"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Ever since Sept. 11, 2001, Americans have had to live with the knowledge that the next time the terrorists strike, it could be not with airplanes capable of killing thousands but atomic bombs capable of killing hundreds of thousands. The prospect has created a sense of profound vulnerability. It has shaped our view of government policies aimed at combating terrorism (filtered through Jack Bauer). It helped mobilize support for the Iraq war. Why are we worried? Bomb designs can be found on the Internet. Fissile material may be smuggled out of Russia. Iran, a longtime sponsor of terrorist groups, is trying to acquire nuclear weapons. A layperson may figure it's only a matter of time before the unimaginable comes to pass. Harvard's Graham Allison, in his book Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, concludes, &quot;On the current course, nuclear terrorism is inevitable.&quot; But remember: After Sept. 11, 2001, we all thought more attacks were a certainty. Yet Al Qaeda and its ideological kin have proved unable to mount a second strike.

Most research on migration assumes that workers are employed in activities that correspond to their skill level. In practice workers may be employed in sectors characterised by skill requirements different from their educational or training background<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, </span><br />
<strong><span style="background: yellow;">migrants may be overqualified for the work they do</span></strong><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. As Mattoo et al. (2005) show, </span><br />
this is the case for Mexicans, Central Americans and Andean university-educated migrants working in the US<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<strong><span style="background: yellow;">Despite their tertiary degrees, these groups rarely hold highly skilled jobs</span></strong><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="background: yellow;">Worse, they may even be at the <strong>lower rungs of the skill ladder</strong></span>; 44% of tertiary-educated Mexicans migrants in the US are working in unskilled jobs. <strong><span style="background: yellow;">This equilibrium represents a lose-lose-lose situation</span></strong><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="background: yellow;">The home country loses human capital</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(brain drain), </span><br />
<span style="background: yellow;">the host country and the migrant </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">him/herself </span><br />
<span style="background: yellow;">are not fully employed </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(brain waste), </span><br />
<span style="background: yellow;">and the</span> low skilled <span style="background: yellow;">workers in host countries </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(both earlier migrants and natives) </span><br />
<span style="background: yellow;">can be pushed out of the market</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(given that they compete with these higher-educated workers for jobs).</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">To illustrate this phenomenon for South-South flows, we follow OECD (2007) and compare the education level (primary, secondary and tertiary) of migrants in Argentina, Costa Rica and Venezuela with their category of job qualification (low, intermediate and high skilled). Figure 3 shows the share of over-qualified migrants and native workers, residing in different countries, and the comparison between foreign-born and natives.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Over-qualification rates vary sharply among countries, ranging from 5% in Costa Rica and Venezuela to 14% in Argentina. While lower than in the US, Canada and Spain where the over-qualification rates are above 15%, these results point to a high degree of over-qualification among immigrants compared to the native-born in Latin American countries. </span><br />
While there are possible omitted variables, it is likely that some part of the brain waste observed is because of the non-recognition of foreign qualifications or excessive requalification requirements for foreigners<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<strong>3. Immigrants aren’t key – giving the US labor market the time to produce more skilled workers solves innovation.</strong><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. In the April 15, 2007, edition of the New York Times, Indian Commerce Minister Kamal Nath called H-1B the &quot;outsourcing visa.&quot;</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">This program also undermines national security, as 200,000 U.S. science and engineering jobs have already been lost to communist China.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">In the late 1980s, </span><br />
<u>bureaucrats at the National Science Foundation found that they could increase the supply of technical professionals by importing them</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">— offering foreign nationals the prospect of remaining in the United States.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">This increase in supply depresses wages </span><br />
— an important policy objective<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">One measure showing that this government intervention was successful (at least from the employers' perspective) is that a typical postdoctoral research or teaching position in a STEM field (requiring 12 years of education after high school) offers pay and benefits comparable to what a high school graduate earns managing a fast-food restaurant.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Administration officials are scrambling to add substance to President Barack Obama’s new Middle Eastern science diplomacy initiatives, mentioned Thursday in his speech in Cairo. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The President promised new “science envoys,”</span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">centers of excellence, and a “technological development” fund</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">for the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. The State Department and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) were working today to bring those words into focus. “Details of these initiatives will be crafted in discussion with officials in the nations where they will be based,” said OSTP spokesman Rick Weiss. Nina V. </span><br />
<u>Fedoroff</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, science adviser to the Secretary of State and the Agency for International Development, </span><br />
<u>said that</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">proposals for centers of excellence “have been bubbling up from several different directions</span><br />
” with emphasis on issues such as agriculture and public health.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">A State Department <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ottawa.usembassy.gov/content/embconsul/pdfs/obama070_factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">fact sheet</a> explained that </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the United States “will work with educational institutions, NGOs and foreign governments” to decide the focus and location of such centers. The new “science envoys” program </span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">could follow the lines of a bill sponsored by Sen. Lugar (R–IN) and approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">would deploy prominent scientists on missions of goodwill and collaboration</span><br />
.<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Fedoroff said </span><br />
<u>such efforts would dovetail with evolving State Department science diplomacy programs</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Obama also announced a new regional fund to support technological development in Muslim-majority countries. The fact sheet said the fund would help pay for “S&amp;T collaboration, capacity development” and innovations with commercial potential.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-indent: 0.25in;"><strong>2. No spillover – even if the US caps the number of H-1Bs, other countries would still want our help on scientific endeavors.</strong></span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But — as emerged from a meeting entitled New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy, held in London this week (1–2 June) — </span><br />
<u>using science for diplomatic purposes is not as straightforward as it seems</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Some scientific collaboration clearly demonstrates what countries can achieve by working together. For example, a new synchrotron under construction in Jordan is rapidly becoming a symbol of the potential for teamwork in the Middle East.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">whether scientific cooperation can become a precursor for political collaboration is less evident</span><br />
. For example, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">despite hopes that the Middle East synchrotron would help bring peace to the region, several countries have been reluctant to support it until the Palestine problem is resolved</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Indeed, one speaker at the London meeting (organised by the UK's Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science) even suggested that the changes scientific innovations bring inevitably lead to turbulence and upheaval. In such a context, viewing science as a driver for peace may be wishful thinking.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Conflicting ethos</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Perhaps the most contentious area discussed at the meeting was how science diplomacy can frame developed countries' efforts to help build scientific capacity in the developing world</span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">There is little to quarrel with in collaborative efforts that are put forward with a genuine desire for partnership. Indeed, partnership — whether between individuals, institutions or countries — is the new buzzword in the &quot;science for development&quot; community.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">true partnership requires transparent relations between partners who are prepared to meet as equals. And that goes against diplomats' implicit role: to promote and defend their own countries' interests</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">John Beddington, the British government's chief scientific adviser, may have been a bit harsh when he told the meeting that a diplomat is someone who is &quot;sent abroad to lie for his country&quot;. But he touched a raw nerve.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Worlds apart yet co-dependent</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The truth is that science and politics make an uneasy alliance. Both need the other. Politicians need science to achieve their goals, whether social, economic or — unfortunately — military; scientists need political support to fund their research.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But they also occupy different universes. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Politics is</span><br />
, at root, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">about exercising power by one means or another. Science is</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">— or should be — </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">about pursuing robust knowledge that can be put to useful purposes.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">A strategy for promoting science diplomacy that respects these differences deserves support. Particularly so if it focuses on ways to leverage political and financial backing for science's more humanitarian goals, such as tackling climate change or reducing world poverty.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But </span><br />
<u>a commitment to science diplomacy that ignores the differences — acting for example as if science can substitute politics</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(</span><br />

<u>The release of a KPMG study on international business location ranking the United States near the bottom of the pack highlights the need to lower the federal corporate tax rate</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, according to a Tax Foundation report.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">KPMG's &quot;2010 Competitive Alternatives&quot; study, the firm's guide to international business location, ranks the U.S. eighth out of 10 countries, ahead of only Germany and Japan. U.S. border nations Mexico and Canada rank first and second, respectively, with the lowest overall costs of doing business.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">U.S. lawmakers who are worried about the economy's slow recovery and weak job growth should take special note of America's low ranking among countries that are cost-effective </span><br />
places to do business<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; said Tax Foundation President Scott Hodge, who authored Tax Foundation Fiscal Fact, No. 221, &quot;New KPMG International Location Study: U.S. Is Falling Behind; Taxes Are a Major Fault.&quot; The Fiscal Fact is available online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/26187.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/26187.html</a>.</span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Cutting the federal corporate tax rate would immediately improve U.S. competitiveness while setting the stage for long-term economic growth</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; Hodge said.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The KPMG study compares the business-cost competitiveness of 112 cities in 10 countries, including 15 in Canada and 60 in the U.S. Considering every factor, the most cost-effective city was Monterrey, Mexico, while Montreal was the top-rated Canadian city and Tampa the top-ranked American city.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">On the tax side, KPMG considers corporate income taxes, capital taxes, sales taxes, property taxes and local business taxes. KPMG compares both statutory corporate tax rates as well as effective corporate tax rates after accounting for various credits and deductions that each country in its corporate tax code.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">On top of the 34% average federal rate faced by U.S. firms, state and local corporate income taxes are factored in as well. Of the sample U.S. cities selected by KPMG, effective corporate income tax rates ranged from 26.49% in Seattle to 37.8% in Honolulu. By contrast, St. John's, Canada, has an effective corporate come tax rate of 9.62%.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;Many of the cost components measured by KPMG are beyond the control of lawmakers or can't be quickly improved with policy solutions,&quot; Hodge said. &quot;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">One policy change</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">can stimulate both the economy in the short-run and enhance efficiency in the long-run: repeal of the corporate income tax</span><br />
,<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">which collects up to 35% of the difference between revenues and costs of incorporated businesses.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">From the efficiency perspective, </span><br />
<u>the corporate income tax has never been sensible policy</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Economic theory holds that an efficient tax system should not tax capital income, since this distorts the incentives to save and invest. Even if the tax base includes capital income, corporate income taxation is overkill. All income earned by corporations accrues to households as dividends or capital gains, and this income is then taxed by the personal income tax system.</span><br />
<u>Proponents argue that the corporate income tax makes sense because high-income taxpayers own corporations at a disproportionate rate</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. This desire to redistribute income can still be achieved using the personal tax system. That approach is better targeted than taxing corporate income, since many low and moderate income households own corporations via their pensions and 401(k)s. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The true burden of corporation taxation falls not just on stockholders, but on employees through lower wages and on consumers through higher prices</span><br />
. Thus corporate taxation hits taxpayers across the income spectrum<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Corporate income taxation has other negatives. </span><br />
<u>It requires a complicated set of rules and regulations, over and above the personal income tax system, generating compliance costs</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Special interests ensure that corporate tax systems favor specific industries or activities, further distorting private investment decisions. Along those lines, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">corporation taxation reduces financial transparency, making it harder for investors to monitor corporate behavior.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">So </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">repeal of the corporate income tax is good policy independent of the state of the economy and would provide short-run stimulus</span><br />

<u>Repeal means higher stock prices and improved cash flow. Corporations would respond to this change by investing in plant and equipment, and by hiring additional workers</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. These investments would be more productive than the ones funded by stimulus projects, since corporations respond to market forces, not to political influence. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Since corporations could more easily invest out of retained earnings, repeal would also circumvent many banks' reluctance to lend</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The budgetary impact of a corporate income tax repeal—roughly $300-350 billion per year—might seem daunting, but this amount falls well short of the Obama fiscal package. The long-run impact will be less than what is implied by current revenues, since </span><br />
<u>repeal will expand economic activity and therefore increase other kinds of tax revenue</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The stimulus impact of a corporate income tax repeal is likely to be substantial</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Recent estimates by Christina Romer, the head of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, suggest that </span><br />
<strong><u>tax</u></strong><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">cuts have a multiplier of three, meaning that repeal would increase GDP by roughly $1 trillion</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. By comparison, the administration's assumption that the government spending multiplier is about 1.5 suggests that the $500 billion in the Obama stimulus package would increase GDP by about $750 billion. </span><br />
<u>Elimination of the corporate income tax is a no-brainer. It benefits the economy in both the short-run and the long-run, with modest implications on the government budget</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The broader lesson here is that policymakers should attempt to improve the economy by eliminating currently existing bad policies, not just by adding new layers of government. </span><br />
<u>By focusing equally on efficiency and stimulus, policymakers can set the stage for a sustained and healthy recovery</u><br />

<u>Corporate taxes have long been deemed to have a negative effect on investment and capital formation</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.[17] However, several recent studies indicate the extent to which corporate taxes harm capital formation and economic growth.[18] One study in 2008 examined tax data across 85 countries and determined that raising the effective corporate tax rate by 10 percentage points reduces the investment rate by 2.2 percentage points. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Investment and capital formation is essential to enduring economic growth.</span><br />
Tax policies that inhibit such activity necessarily impede growth, which the study also finds<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The OECD also has recently released several studies that effectively sort tax structures according to their respective economic effects. According to the OECD, </span><br />
<u>&quot;</u><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">corporate income taxes have the most negative effect on GDP per capita</span><br />
,&quot;[19] which is consistent with previous findings that the corporate tax reduces investment and, therefore, economic growth. The OECD found that <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">reducing the statutory corporate tax</span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">increases the ratio of investment to capital </span><br />
by approximately 1.9 percent <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">over the long term</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">In order to understand how the corporate income tax discourages investment in U.S. automobile production, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">consider an investment that will occur in either the United States or Asia</span><br />
. The investment might be in the production of a new fuel efficient automobile to be sold in Europe. <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">If the cars are produced in the United States</span><br />
, whether by U.S.- or foreign-based corporations, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">U.S. corporate tax is imposed</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">on the income that arises in the United States. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">If</span><br />
, however, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">those cars are produced in Asia by non-U.S. corporations, no U.S. corporate taxes are imposed on that income</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. The only taxes collected on the income from the production of those vehicles will be the taxes imposed by the country of origin. </span><br />
<u>Thus, if the U.S. corporate tax rate exceeds the corporate tax rate in the alternative Asian jurisdiction, then the U.S. corporate income tax will reduce the return from investing in the United States relative to the return from making the same investment in Asia</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<u>That</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, in turn, </span><br />
<u>will increase the hurdle rate for such investments in the United States relative to the rate for investments in Asia</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Therefore, </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">if the corporate income tax rate in the United States is higher than the rate in Asia, then the U.S. corporate income tax will discourage investments in the United States in favor of investment in Asia</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Although the investment dampening effect of the corporate income tax is easiest to see when the output is sold in a third jurisdiction, the same logic applies when the output is sold in the United States or in the country of origin. In such cases, long-standing income tax principles call for the division of total income into the income from production and the income from sale.38 Because the income from sale arises in the importing jurisdiction, it is only the income from production that arises where production occurs. Thus, </span><br />
<u>the U.S. corporate income tax by raising the hurdle rate for investment in the United States drives capital investment toward other jurisdictions. Hence, the second way that the U.S. corporate income tax harms the competitiveness of U.S. industries is by discouraging investment in productive activities in the United States in favor of investment elsewhere</u><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">as a &quot;partial factor tax&quot;--an additional tax on the return to capital invested in the corporate sector--in the context of an economy closed to international flows of goods and capital.[1] Even when viewed from this narrow perspective, the tax has many flaws.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">introduces significant distortions in the behavior of firms, including reducing the incentive to organize business activity </span><br />

<u>The U.S. faces considerable fiscal and economic challenges</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Recent and likely federal expenditures underscore the imperative for the federal government to have a robust and efficient revenue collection system. </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. However, these imperatives should not preclude improving this mechanism. Indeed, </span><br />
<u>there are better and worse ways to tax</u><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Less than one-fifth of federal revenue is collected by </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. While other nations are competing for scarce capital by lowering rates, the U.S. entertains potentially anti-growth corporate reforms. </span><br />

What difference does it make if that foreign worker is sitting in Bangladesh with that American's job or sitting in Alabama? It's the same lost job, same cheap labor and the only difference is physical location <br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">corporations want these Visas simply because many jobs, especially in the high skills area require training (often done by the American to be fired) before the job can be offshore outsourced</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">He points out that </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">in 1999, a labor shortage driven by the high-tech boom led to a bidding war for workers</span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The demand for well-educated workers is only growing, and the effect is cumulative. Powerful economic forces </span><br />
such as the rise of brutal global competition and the spread of sophisticated information technologies <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">will continue to push employers to value better educated workers</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">who are comfortable working in teams, quick to adjust to new tasks, and well-schooled in the latest high-tech gear. At least that's one conclusion to draw from a recent paper by Anthony Carnavale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. He projects that </span><br />
the economy will create 47 million job openings from 2008 to 2018 <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, made up of 14 million new jobs and 33 million jobs replacing current workers who have retired, become disabled, or died. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The key finding: </span><br />
Most of the jobs demand some postsecondary education, with about 30 million openings requiring at least some college education and 21 million an associate's, bachelor's, or graduate degree <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;"><strong>If educated workers aren't readily available, companies will automate the tasks or find educated employees overseas.</strong></span><span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;"><u>After all, with many developing economies devoting more resources to university education, America's share of the world's college-level workers has shrunk from some 30 percent to about 15 percent, according to Carnevale and two Georgetown University colleagues, Jeff Strohl and Nicole Smith.</u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Sad to say, the ranks of poorly educated Americans are growing. The growth in high school graduation rates has slowed since the 1970s. The nation's four-year high school graduation rate hovers around 69 percent, according to the Alliance for Excellent Education, a Washington (D.C.) organization that advocates better high school performance. Some minority groups do even worse, with a 56 percent dropout rate for Hispanics and 54 percent for African Americans. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Tougher Road for Dropouts </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University calculates that the average high school dropout will have a lifetime negative net fiscal contribution to society of some -$5,200. The average high school graduate generates a positive lifetime number of $287,384. The sharply lower figure for dropouts aged 18 to 64 reflects lower annual federal, state, and local tax payments, higher cash and in-kind transfers, and the costs of incarceration relative to a high school graduate. (The comparable figure for a college graduate with only a bachelor's degree is $793,079.) </span><br />
Following the Great Depression and World War II, it appeared that the U.S. and other major industrial nations had banished the well-known phenomenon of mass unemployment <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Most workers, including those who labored on a factory floor, lived a middle-class lifestyle, and the unemployment rate largely moved up and down with the business cycle. </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">But the specter of mass unemployment once again haunts the U.S. The Great Recession is exposing the cumulative effect of a three-decade shift toward high-education jobs and a failing education system</span><br />
. <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The trend has always been morally wrong—and financially stressful for low-income households. But now </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;"><strong>the swelling numbers of less educated unemployed-and-underemployed working-age adults is starting to call into question whether the U.S. can mount a sustained, robust economic recovery</strong></span><span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;"><u>.

Giovanni Peri is an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of California, Davis and a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He has done research on human capital, growth, and technological innovation. More recently he has focused and published extensively on the impact of international migration on labor markets and on productivity and on the determinants of international migration.

<br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">While data on gross domestic product (GDP) suggest that the worse of the recession is probably over, the US labor market is still deeply depressed. Unemployment rates in the United States are at levels not experienced for two decades. Between January 2009 and January 2010 about 3.9 million jobs were lost.1 It is natural, therefore, to revisit questions about the impact of immigrants on the labor market and on the economy through the lens of the current economic situation. Are the shortrun effects of net immigration2 on native workers’ employment and income less beneficial (or more harmful) if immigrants enter the United States during a recession? Does the economy have the same capacity to “absorb” new workers when immigrants join the US economy in a recession? Do the longrun gains or losses to the US economy from immigration depend on the phase of the cycle during which immigrants enter the country? These questions have become particularly relevant in the last two years and the present report tries to address them. Most (though not all) economic research over the last decade has emphasized the potential gains that result from immigration to the United States. Immigration can boost the supply of skills different from and complementary to those of natives,3 increase the supply of low-cost services,4 contribute to innovation,5 and create incentives for investment and efficiency gains.6 Quantifying these gains is not easy, but steady progress has been made in identifying and measuring them. There is broad consensus that the long-run impact of immigration on the average income of Americans is small but positive.7 In particular, recent studies have identified measurable gains for the highly educated and small, often not significant, losses for less-educated workers. These </span><br />
empirical analyses, <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">however</span><br />
, have focused on the “long run. <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">”8</span><br />
But the present economic recession and its persistent labor market consequences make the long run <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">seem rather </span><br />
distant <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, and more pressing concerns about the short run have taken center stage.9 </span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">and reorganization of the firm.

This process, at the same time, reorganizes firms’ structure, producing efficiency gains and pushing natives towards cognitive and communication-intensive jobs that are better paid. </span><br />

fully <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. In the meantime and before the adjustments take place, do immigrants crowd out natives from the labor market? How long does it take for firms to adjust their investments and organization in order to benefit from the new supply of skills? Are these processes easier and less costly during an economic expansion than in an economic downturn? </span><br />
Until very recently no comprehensive analysis of the short-run effects of immigration on the US labor markets has been possible <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.10 The reason is that yearly representative data from the Current Population Survey, typically used to analyze production and labor markets, have contained information on the place of birth of individuals only since 1994 (as opposed to the decennial census that has always included that information). Hence, it is </span><br />
only during the last few years <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">that </span><br />
sufficient data has accumulated in order to analyze the short-run <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(yearly) </span><br />
impacts of <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">net </span><br />
immigration <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">on labor market outcomes. Moreover, between 1994 and 2007, only the mild 2001 recession was observed, providing limited variation over the economic cycle. While several influential academic papers have emphasized how the short-run effects of immigration on wages and employment could be different from long-run effects, those differences were based on theoretical assumptions rather than on empirically estimated evidence. </span><br />
Using empirical methods <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">in line </span><br />
with the best practice <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">used to analyze and quantify the long-run effects of immigration, this report will provide some evidence to inform these questions. It begins by analyzing the short-run impact of immigration on employment, income, and other factors that affect income, such as investments, hours worked, and productive efficiency, examining the speed with which the economy adjusts to accommodate new immigrants. It then extends this analysis to investigate how these shortrun effects, and possibly the medium-run effect (over four or five years), depend on the state of the economy when immigrants enter the labor market. Finally, it discusses the implications the results may have for immigration policy. The results suggest that in the long run, immigrants do not reduce native employment rates, but they do increase productivity and hence average income. This finding is consistent with the broad existing literature on the impact of immigration in the United States. A </span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">at first, </span><br />
because the economic adjustment process is not immediate <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Lower average income is also likely </span><br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
The results moreover suggest that the <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">short-run </span><br />
impact <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">of immigration </span><br />
depends on the state of the economy <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. When the economy is growing, new immigration creates jobs in sufficient numbers to leave native employment unharmed, even in the relatively short run. </span><br />
During downturns <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, however, new immigrants are found to have a small negative impact on native employment in the short run (but not the long run). </span><br />
The economy does not appear to respond as quickly to new immigrants in terms of new job creation and productivity boosts during recessions.<br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Since the economy has unused capacity during downturns, this may make firms reluctant to expand their productive capacity and</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. However in the long run (seven- to ten-year intervals) no difference in adjustment is observed independently of the short-run effects. It is worth emphasizing that the results imply that net immigration during expansionary periods may have positive short- and long-run effects on native jobs and hours worked. However, </span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">have actually <em>increased</em> job opportunities</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">for American programmers and engineers, by working on new products which lead to job creation, and also via entrepreneurship </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The first claim is an obvious fallacy</span><br />
. <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The employers could fill those positions with Americans</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(U.S. citizens and permanent residents) </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">instead of H-1Bs and still get the job-generating effect.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">But the second claim, though also misleading, is more subtle. The industry lobbyists cite a 1999 study by a UC Berkeley urban planning professor, AnnaLee Saxenian, showing data on Asian immigrant entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley.305 However, </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Saxenian’s data show that the rate of immigrant entrepreneurship is no higher than, and in fact is likely less than, immigrant representation in the workforce</span><br />
. <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">She finds that the Asian immigrants comprised 21 percent of the scientists and engineers in the technical workforce in 1990, but founded only 19 percent of new businesses during 1985–1989. By the year 2000, the Asianimmigrant proportion of the technical workforce had grown to 37 percent,306 while their proportion of new business lagged behind at 29 percent, according to Saxenian’s data. It must also be pointed out that </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">these firms may not employ many programmers and engineers anyway.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">For instance, according to Saxenian, </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">36% of the Chinese-owned firms are in the business of “Computer Wholesaling,” meaning that they are simply assemblers of commodity PCs, with no engineering or programming work being done</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">.307 Moreover, as Saxenian notes, the situation is even worse because the </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">immigrant</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">entrepreneurs—and for that matter, immigrant managers in non-immigrant—founded firms—tend to </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">hire only from their own immigrant ethnic groups</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Those jobs are largely not open to the general workforce. This can be seen quantitatively from, for instance, the study by B. Lindsay Lowell of Georgetown University, who found that “ . . . a study of the top 100 companies employing H-1Bs in 1998 shows that 60 percent of their CEOs had South Asian surnames.”308 Another researcher found that at Cadence Design Systems, a prominent computer-aided design (CAD) software firm, “foreign-born Chinese-American engineers may represent as many as 80 percent of the technical staff.”309 The San Jose Mercury News ran an in-depth analysis of the situation, finding that: . . . even among engineering professionals, subtle ethnic division is part of the valley’s culture. A half-dozen university researchers studying the valley’s workplaces say the segregation patterns are disturbing.310 “You’re seeing more and more firms that are homogenous ethnically, from the entrepreneur all the way down to the production worker,” said Edward Park, a University of Southern California sociologist who has visited dozens of Silicon Valley firms over the past decade . . . Workers say the tension is especially pronounced between engineers from India and mainland China. The Indian engineers coming on temporary H-1B work visas now outnumber the Chinese by 5–1 . . . . . . one Intel engineer who emigrated from mainland China [said] “Many Chinese think that Congress has a policy of favoritism toward India.” He asked that his name not be used, saying it would hurt him in his largely Indian work group. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although it is true that</span> labour<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> will always find work so long as the means to employ it is available, this does not in itself mean that real wage rates will rise. </span>If the labour supply rises faster than the means of employment, i.e., the supply of capital goods, then real wage rates must fall<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> if full unemployment is to be maintained. A situation of full employment being one where there are always jobs for those who are willing and able to work). </span>This brings us back to the fallacious view that immigrants are doing jobs that Americans do not want.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> But this is not the real situation at all. </span><span style="background: yellow;">The reason why Americans won't do these jobs is because they get higher wages in alternative lines of work</span>. In other words, <span style="background: yellow;">low paying jobs are in those areas that cannot compete for sufficient labour. Therefore, what these employers and their supporters are really saying is that they cannot pay market wage rates.</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">When capital accumulation grows at a faster rate than the workforce real wage rates rise. Reverse the situation and real wage rates will fall. So when the rate of capital accumulation exceeds the growth in the labour force certain labour intensive activities become less profitable because they can no longer compete for labour at the going rate. This means that labour ‘shortages' appear in the low-paid areas of the economy. As every economist and economic commentator is supposed to know, these labour shortages will be particularly felt by marginal producers. </span>Another — and very important — way of viewing this problem is to see it as an inability of marginal producers to raise labour productivity by an amount that would enable them to pay competitive wage rates. Unable to pay the market rate these producers have tried to resolve their problem by using large-scale immigration to cut real wages by increasing the supply of labour.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> These employers and their supporters argue that without immigrant workers they will have to abandon their businesses. Two points need to be raised here. The obvious one is that changes in economic conditions are always forcing businesses to close while new ones open. This process is most marked in technology. For example, should canal owners have been protected against railways and railways against the cars? The less obvious point is that the </span><span style="background: yellow;">use of immigrant labour in these circumstances damages the economy by keeping open suboptimal firms</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In the absence of cheap labour many of these economic activities would have to cease, meaning that </span>the land and capital they use would be employed in more profitable activities where wages are higher<span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It will be argued that the products of these activities would have to be imported. This situation would be beneficial for foreign exporters — particularly in poor countries — and American consumers. The former because they now have another market, and the latter because their purchasing power has risen. This reveals another economic fact: as countries become more capital intensive their more labour intensive activities in the tradable area will tend to move to more labour intensive countries. This is why Taiwan's shoe industry is gradually moving overseas. Putting it in a nutshell, </span><span style="background: yellow;">using immigrant labour to expand the supply of labour will exert a downward pressure on real wage rates</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, starting with the unskilled and semiskilled. However, situations can emerge where capital accumulation has exceeded the size of the workforce to such an extent that increasing the labour supply will actually raise real wages. This is not the case in America or Australia. As an aside, it was suggested to me that highly qualified women with children are able to resume their careers by hiring cheap nannies. This results in a net benefit to the economy. But this is the fallacy of composition. Just because a very well-off families can benefit from cheap labour that does not mean that the families of unskilled workers will also benefit — quite the opposite. </span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">The number of Mexicans departing from Mexico has declined substantially over the past two years</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
In the third quarter (July to September) of 2009 <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, </span><br />
about 142,000 Mexicans departed for abroad <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">, according to the Mexican government's National Survey of Occupations and Employment (ENOE), a monthly household survey. </span><br />
This was 8 percent lower than the number who departed in the third quarter of 200 <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">8 (155,000), </span><br />
39 percent lower than in 2007 <br />

and 47 percent less than in 2006 <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(266,000) (see Figure 1). </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Moreover, </span><br />
the number of migrants departing from Mexico has historically peaked in the summer months, but this trend disappeared in 2009 <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. This lack of seasonal migration appears to be particularly pronounced in Mexico's small towns with 2,500 residents or less where the springtime (April to June) emigration rate declined from 25.4 emigrants per 1,000 residents in 2006 to 19.0 in 2007, 17.0 in 2008, and 8.8 in 2009. </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">By the same token, xenophilic demagoguery also serves no useful purpose for public discussions of immigration reforms. Immigration is, as mentioned earlier, fundamentally an economic issue in terms of its societal impacts. Exaggerated and uncritical assertions that proclaim the merits of more immigrants while ignoring their fiscal and opportunity costs on the receiving countries does little to further public debate. </span><br />
The mere existence of labor shortages <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">—locally, regionally or nationally—</span><br />
does not mean that more immigration is necessary or desirable as a policy response <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Tight labor markets can provide opportunities to <strong>direct public attention</strong> to the inadequacies of </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Furthermore, </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;"><strong>such efforts at human-resource development can reduce the tendency of expanded immigration to “brain-drain” skilled labor from developing nations where such supplies are always chronically short</strong></span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Calderon </span><br />
not only <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">faces pressure </span><br />
for change from the immigration bill, but also <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">from domestic malcontents in Mexico</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Fortunately, the U.S. immigration bill, with its combination of workplace enforcement and border vigilance, if passed, would provide Calderon with the opportunity to implement significant economic and social changes. Furthermore, Supporters of Manuel Lopez Obrador-of the left-leaning PRD party-who lost the disputed presidential election to Calderon in 2006 and is an admirer of Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez, have been gearing up and are prepared to rally for change if the current administration does not take immediate action on its own to address poverty, unemployment and social inequalities. Lopez Obrador’s supporters comprise more than 30 percent of the electorate and are raising the left-wing flag of challenge that is spreading throughout Latin America: they are not a force that can be ignored. Regardless of the outcome of the proposed U.S. immigration bill, </span><br />
it has drawn attention to Mexico’s perilous economic situation and Calderon realizes he needs to implement concrete changes or face an angry and restless populace as his term winds on <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">For Mexico to reach its full economic potential and to help create better job opportunities for the majority of its citizens, Calderon must take on the powerful monopolies (both public and private), and the politically protected and favored business groups inherited from the era of the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) rule. The latter is the political party that dominated Mexican politics for over seven decades and was renowned for using fraud and bribery to retain its hold on power. The palpable influence of the PRI on Mexican politics is a hurdle for any reformer to overcome and despite the semi-democratic government; this influence is still a roadblock to the achievement of economic justice, resulting in severe income inequality. Furthermore, the monopolistic entities that perhaps could be defended during the first ten years of NAFTA as providing some protection from U.S. competition are no longer essential, and are, in fact, hurting the economy by hindering constructive and fair competition (as opposed to unfair competition), limiting innovation and contributing to the “brain drain.” </span><br />
Although the Mexican education system was somewhat improved under the leadership of President Fox, <br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">a disproportionate number of the educated individuals have opted to study abroad or are being recruited by entities in other countries. <strong>The loss of intellectual capital threatens Mexico’s potential for economic development as society becomes encapsulated in a cycle of ineffectual education often followed by mass migration, leaving Mexico unable to benefit from the intellectual human capital it so painfully has developed</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. The prominence of monopolies in such sectors as electricity, television and banking, as well as the failure of the government to foster greater competition in the marketplace have resulted in highly restricted opportunities for professionals seeking jobs within the Mexican productive system, as became evident in 2005 and 2006. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">Recommendations </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">Calderon needs to embrace the opportunity </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">presented by the current U.S. immigration debate, as well as look upon the five years that remain of his term as an </span><br />
opportunity<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">to create a new and modernized Mexican economy based on the premise of mobilizing new high and medium paid jobs to <strong>keep his best trained workers and professionals at home</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. Calderon needs to confront the root problems of unemployment and poverty, which have been manifested in the form of immigration and involvement in drug cartels. </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;"><strong>The growing Mexican economy cannot afford to lose its intellectual capital to foreign countries nor can it afford to have to withstand a <span style="border: windowtext 1pt solid; padding: 0in;">social uprising</span> as a result of the continued maintenance of a very unsatisfactory status quo</strong></span><span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;"><u>.</u></span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">The Mexican possibility may seem less likely, but the government, its politicians, police, and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels.

Any descent by the Mexico into chaos would demand an American response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone <br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">the “rapid collapse” of Mexico would change everything with respect to the global security environment.

, as<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">immigration should never be permitted to undercut the wage and benefit levels that are needed to provide incentives to persons to invest in their own human-capital</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">preparation and for communities to expend the tax revenues to provide such learning opportunities. But, </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">in those occupations in which the adult unemployment rates are significantly below the national unemployment rates for all adult workers, immigration can play a <strong>supportive role</strong> to augment the need for a greater skilled labor supply</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">In the process, the productivity of the labor force is enhanced and economic growth for society is encouraged</span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. But, </span><br />
inviting skilled immigrants to gain permanent residence and citizenship is not the preferred route to augmenting the skill levels of the labor force.<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">It should always be considered a supplemental route to be used only when real labor shortages can be demonstrated</span><br />
. “Brain-draining” other countries of their highly skilled human resources should never be seen as a reliable or socially useful long-term strategy <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">should not warrant a conclusion that the existing cap is too low</span><br />
. <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">A cap is a cap. </span><br />
A shortage in the short run should not mean automatically that more skilled immigrants be admitted.<br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">First recourse should always be to allow market forces to signal the domestic education and training system to respond</span><br />
. If over time it is clear that these systems cannot provide more graduates or that demographic shifts such as an aging population or declining fertility rates will adversely affect future skill availability, the numbers <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">(that is, the cap) for skilled immigrants </span><br />
can be raised.<br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">There is a strong need for some fresh, new thinking on a number of interconnected issues: on gauging the labor markets needs of employers, on testing the labor market to identify qualified US workers, in devising an enforcement mechanism that provides real incentives to hire such qualified workers, and in designing an efficient process that allows employers to hire foreign workers when no US workers are available</span><br />
. <br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 8pt;">It is universally conceded that the present system of the labor market test, i.e. the labor certification process, is too cumbersome, is ineffective in protecting the US interests of US workers, and does not meet the legitimate needs of employers seeking to hire foreign workers. However, as we move toward new and expanded temporary worker programs, the following are some ideas to consider as we develop a framework for protecting US workers. </span><br />
<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; display: block;">There must be numerical limits on the number of temporary workers who are admitted to the US each year.
