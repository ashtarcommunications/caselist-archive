The whiteness that allows for the exclusion of quare bodies has permeated into this year’s debate community. The resolution only allows for us to focus on legal migration, forcing participants of the activity to prioritize bodies that are already deemed worthy to enter. This forces the question of the quare body out of the resolution. The resolution forces judges to play the role of the Immigration Services and the debaters borders security, policing ourselves and making sure we include the “good” policy debater that talks about the resolution, and forcing those “quare” debaters that aren’t topical out of the discussion. <br />

<br />
Chas and I know something about whiteness: <br />
<br />
Welcome to Liberty University, our school has been known for its attempts to suppress and control the quare bodies, those that are different. The founder of Liberty Jerry Falwell once stated &quot;I do not believe the homosexual community deserves minority status. One's misbehavior does not qualify him or her for minority status. Blacks, Hispanics, women, etc., are God-ordained minorities who do indeed deserve minority status,&quot; this logic is perpetuated today on the campuses where individuals that do not meet the Liberty Way of living are socially constructed as less important and marginalized. This is the same logic as whiteness it regulates our action and produces institutions and procedures that perpetuate inequality and violence against the quare body. You see Chas and I are the quare body in this debate round and outside of it on our campus, we are the illegal immigrants that the resolution leaves out and allows for our neutralization within the community  <br />

And simply calling for change where we disprove of policy will not be enough to change them. The initial recognition of and criticism of White Privilege in our White Supremacist society is essential to reconstruct power on a broader base. <br />

And not only is the broader political, cultural and socio-economic context in which we interact White Supremacist, but also the debate community.

The Anti-Immigration rhetoric used by Americans on a daily basis is veiled racism that props up whiteness and permeates into institutional racism. This institutional racism detrimates Healthcare and continues to produce the systematic impacts we see today. We need more agents of change<br />

<u>It seems like a … get past it.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
Healthcare is in a unique position that agents of change are able to work within to help solve for the entrenched intuitional racism – that allows for continual white privilege to occur. Cultural competence must be used in order to alleviate this impact.<br />
