Deadsies<br />
<br />
<strong>An ellipsis of the sign, an eclipse of meaning: an, illusion. The mortal distraction that a single sign can cause instantaneously. Consider the story of the soldier who meets Death at a crossing in the marketplace, and believes he saw him make a menacing gesture in his direction. He rushes to the king's palace and asks the king for his best horse in order that he might flee during the night far from Death, as far as Samarkand. Upon which the king summons Death to the palace and reproaches him for having frightened one of his best servants. ; But Death, astonished, replies: &quot;I didn't mean to frighten him . It was just that I was surprised to see this soldier here, when we had a rendez-vous tomorrow in Samarkand. &quot;</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>There is a problem with the way that we see death today; for us, death is something we try to ascribe a meaning to, that we fear, that we run from. Especially in debate; every argument impacts back to preventing death, and it goes as an unwritten rule that death is something we want to avoid at all costs, regardless of the argument we are reading. Death is the end, and nothing comes after it; death is the objective destiny that haunts each of us. However, death is more of a rendezvous encounter; it has no strategy, no aim, and no meaning. It is precisely this meaninglessness that is what educes us the most about death.</strong><br />
<br />
Yes, one runs towards one's fate all the more surely by seeking to escape it . Yes, everyone seeks his own death, and the failed acts are the most successful . Yes, signs follow an unconscious course. But all this concerns the truth of the rendez-vous in Samarkand; it does not account for the seduction of the story, which is in no way an apologue of truth...........................meaning or &quot;seduced,&quot; that the story itself is seductive. It is when signs are seduced that they become seductive<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Picture this; when someone does die, we immediately ship them off to god knows where so that they can be cut open, drained out, wired shut, mouth clamped into a smile, embalmed and the spray tanned; ready to go for the funeral. We put them in nice cute little coffins; we hide them underground, where we can’t smell their rotting putrid flesh. At best, we give them flowers once a year (if we can remember), but for the most part, the dead to us have nothing to offer, nothing to exchange, and no longer represent anything of interest to us. Simultaneously, we increasingly obsess over the prospect of a catastrophic death; car crashes, terrorist attacks, horrible slasher movies, assassination's, genocide, murder, accidents…we cant get enough. This obsession is part and parcel with a system that works to exclude death, and leaves us searching for a way to re-inscribe death as a social phenomena.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Baudrillard 93</strong><br />
<br />
Why is it that today there are no expected and foreseen deaths from old age, a death in the family, the only death that had full meaning for the traditional collectivity,...............................for death as for everything else: no longer willing to give or receive it, death encircles us in the biological simulacrum of our own body.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>As evidenced by the rituals we have that engage with the dead, we are severely lacking in ways to exchange with our dead. We either shut them up underground, or we abject them. Other cultures, however, don’t celebrate death the same way that we do. Death is more than a process of mourning, and it is an inclusion of rituals and rites that include the deceased as part of the social body.</strong><br />

You can change your name, your address. Change continents, change your face, your identity. But there's no fooling Yamaraj, the Lord of Death. Unerringly and with a practiced eye he finds you when it's your turn......................................with the immersion of the ashes, says Kamat: &quot;That whole river becomes a memorial. You can go to any part of the Ganges and say, the ashes of my ancestor were scattered here, so their spirit is there&quot;<br />

<strong>There is a marked distinction between two different relationships with death in the status quo; the affirmative chooses the strategy of the latter, and pursues a relation with the dead that doesn’t foreclose on an inclusion of death within the realm of social exchanges. Therefore, we affirm;</strong><br />
<strong>the United States Federal Government should substantially expand beneficiary eligibility of H-1B visas by exempting non-immigrant temporary workers from re-entry restrictions required by the advance parole travel document for purposes of symbolic exchange and death rituals.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The solvency mechanism of the aff is these social rituals themselves; we wont prescribe definite ways to go about exchanging with the dead, but we will criticize the biases that impede these. Instead of seeing death and life as unilateral states of nature, we should see them as reversible symbolic</strong><br />

<br />
Savages have no biological concept of death. Or, rather, the biological fact, that is, death, birth or disease, everything that comes from nature and that we accord the privilege of necessity and objectivity, .............................................life, like everything else, is a crime if it survives unilaterally, if it is not seized and destroyed, given and returned, 'returned' to death. Initiation effaces this crime by resolving the separate, event of life and death in one and the same social act of exchange.<br />

<strong><u>we advocate the following plan</u>: The United States Federal Government should remove all stipulations that would prevent employment-based visas from being issued to the dead.</strong><br />
The argument of the aff is that we should radically change the way we relate to death and the dead; the first place we draw this argument from is the death in Samarkand card; the argument is that it is the random, meaningless gestures of death that we find seductive and unavoidable. Rather than always running from death, always trying to avoid death, we should embrace death as a chance encounter.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Yes</span><span style="background-attachment: scroll; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: none; background-origin: initial; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: repeat repeat;">, one runs</span>…they become seductive<br />
The way we go about trying to resolve our issues with death is either to shut the dead out, bury them, incinerate them. The fascination with the chance, accidental death is our best attempt to reinscribe death back into the realism of social relations. However, there is a better way to go about doing this.<br />

Why is it that…own body within<br />
The next piece of Baudrillard evidence indicates that life is a crime if it survives unilaterally, if we prioritize life at the expense of death. Life and death aren’t inseparable, but symbolic counter-parts, or reversible. Esoteric societies see life and death in this manner, and they have constructed rituals in which death is socially articulated by the group in terms of a symbolic life and death are given and exchanged. Insofar as H-1B visas exist solely for the purpose of guaranteeing productivity from those who immigrate here, they are part and parcel with a system that looks to maximize productivity and life at the expense of its absence; death. Visas represent the symbolic life of the immigrant in the US. Giving visas to the dead is a symbolic gesture that brings them into the fold of symbolic exchange of life and death, and it is a preferable way to conceptualize the way we approach death.<br />

Our aff is three fold; the first argument we make is that debate boils down to the exchange of a bunch of meaningless signs; that all the politics scenarios, disads, cp;s, etc. are just meaningful within a paradigm that gives these signs some sort of meaning.<br />
<span class="cite">Baudrillard 99</span> [<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">dead guy who continues to write books, impossible exchange, p.3-5</span>]<br />
<span class="underline">Everything starts…</span> <strong>of impossible exchange</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; margin-left: 0in;">The second argument is that we should take up the role of the virologist. W<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-weight: normal;">e have reached the point in debate where the activity has become a virus to itself</span></span>. The virology of debate is the point at which we see the crystallization of the logic of debate, and is the point at which we show through the debate. </span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;">No where else do we see this self replication of arguments and arbitrary meanings than with the radical exclusion of death, But despite all our efforts to normalize the dead into our exchange system, the death function cannot be reprogrammed and it is through a vantage point of death that we position ourselves to show through pure idiocy of what we try to preserve in debate.</span></span></span><br />
