These four <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">themes of the positive, …. exploitation of &quot;real&quot; Americans.</span></span><br />
Our affirmative rejects the approach which treats immigrants as “Soylent Brown,” chewed up and used as fuel for some national project. <br />

One can think of our AFF like this: stop asking what immigrants have to <em>give</em> to America, and embrace a different myth of the immigrant as a democratic <em>taker</em>.<br />

The framework argument that we should focus only on official state-based reforms ignores the way in which the official US public sphere has been violently produced via the very process of defining citizenship- you should prioritize our critique of the tropes concerning the foreigner which produces this strategy of exclusion.<br />

A foundational assumption of the argument that we should focus on USFG action is that <em>WE</em> are potential future policymakers, and need to become informed <em>CITIZENS</em> by role-playing as the Rawlsian conscientious legislator. This “we should” attitude is rooted in the nationalist understanding of democracy which we critique. <br />

Methodological bracketing out of our discussion is structurally biased in favor of those that benefit from the current order. Such frameworks smuggle in value commitments and ideological assumptions which are anything but fair and neutral.<br />
