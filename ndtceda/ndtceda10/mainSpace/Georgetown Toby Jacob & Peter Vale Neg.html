Justification and Immigration in the Network Society– A New Ambivalence?*<br />
Reader in Sociology at Lancaster University, I did my first degree in urban planning in Denmark (The Aarhus School of Architecture). From 1994 to 1997 I worked on my Ph.D. thesis with the title &quot;Strangers, Ambivalence and Social Theory&quot;, followed by another research project focused on the sociology of mobility. During 1998-1999 I held an assistant professorship at Roskilde University, Department of Geography. I came to Lancaster in September 1999. My present research consists of two projects: &quot;Revolt, Revolution, Critique - The Paradox of Society&quot; and &quot;The Sociology of Terrorism&quot;. In general I work on social theory, political philosophy, urbanism, post-structuralism and ethnicity/immigration.<br />

Nair 6/6/10 <br />
Yasmin Nair is a Chicago-based writer, activist, academic, and commentator. Which mostly means that she struggles to pay rent while living the glamorous life of a freelance writer. Her work appears in Windy City Times, where she is a columnist, reporter, photographer, and book reviewer. Her work has also appeared and/or appears in venues like Discourse, GLQ, make/shift, Time Out Chicago, Bitch magazine and Maximum Rock'n'Roll. Her writing and organising address neoliberalism, inequality, and the politics of rescue and affect; the immigration crisis; queer politics and theory, and the contours of a ridiculous gay movement that pretends that the right to marry, the right to kill, and hate crimes legislation actually constitute some kind of leftist agenda.<br />
She is part of the editorial collective of Against Equality (www.againstequality.org) and a member of the Chicago grassroots organisation Gender JUST (Justice United for Societal Transformation).<br />
