Plan text: the debate community should confront black rage. <br />
Black rage consists of the following:<br />
It is based on righteous indignation, or anger at injustice and suffering<br />
It is composed of 4 specific components:<br />
<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">1) Deliberate challenge to white supremacy en-route to producing anti-white supremacist scholarship.</span><br />
<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">2) The use of some counter-hegemonic aesthetic (which includes music, poetry, visuals, etc…)</span><br />
<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">3) Advancing the subject hood of people of color.</span><br />
<span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">4) Must perform one’s spirituality enroute to liberating the oppress that is rooted in ourstory</span><br />
