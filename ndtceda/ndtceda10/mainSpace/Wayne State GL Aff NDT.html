 The United States Federal Government should eliminate all beneficiary eligibility restrictions and numerical restrictions on family visas. <br />
We can clarify.<br />

<h3 id="toc3"><a name="NDT Round 4-Aff v Whitman HZ-1AC"></a>1AC</h3>
 To begin with, we as the affirmative team recognize the fact that a debate is all about story-telling—telling a story about the world, telling stories comparing virtual worlds, telling stories about suffering and about life. <br />
We will be telling you the story of Nomad-politics—a short aphorism—a little decoding machine that sits in your mind and becomes a line of flight out of repression. We call our speech—this decoding apparatus—a nomadic war machine, but you might call it a 1AC: using the Resolution to tell a story about why all of life is joyous and should be affirmed. <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Deleuze 2004</span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"> (Gilles. <em>Desert Islands and other texts</em>. p. 252-260 mrl)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12pt;">We are familiar with ... who are today's Nietzscheans? </span><br />
Scenario 1 is the Master Signifier:<br />
The parent-child image of the family is the dominant master signifier of our patriarchal-capitalist social structure—restricts, distorts, and deforms access to the commons. It is a core institution of bourgeois subjectivity that must be destroyed.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hardt and Negri 2009 </span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">(Michael Hardt, Professor of Literature at Duke and Antonio Negri, taught at Université de Vincennes with K all-stars Foucault, Deleuze and Derrida. Commonwealth. 2009. p. 160-2.) </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">The three most significant social institutions... constantly denies and corrupts.</span><br />
Violence is constituted by our language, discourse, and symbols—master-signifiers quilt together our world by violently imposing themselves on communicative space.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Žižek 2008</span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"> /Slavoj, Violence: big ideas small books, page 47-49/</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">The Muslim crowds did not react to ...distinguish between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; violence:</span><br />
More and more every day we are captured by exclusionary ideas, models, and ways of being. We must escape from this black hole of existential contraction.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Pindar and Sutton 2000</span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"> (Ian and Paul, Introduction to The Three Ecologies, p. 8-13 mrl)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">There are many refrains in our own lives ...as a medium for accident and chance.'15</span><br />
And voting affirmative throws us into becoming revolutionary.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Deleuze and Guattari 1980 </span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">(A Thousand Plateaus. p292.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">A woman has to become-woman... to the advances of the imperceptible.</span><br />
Scenario 2 is the Ego:<br />
Life exists in the margins; there is no key core to our life, only relations in between various desiring machines—by releasing oneself from the Oedipal family and the Ego, co-existence with the forces of life is possible. Our affirmative asks you to destroy the western notion of the family in order to de-code our everyday identities—to become Schizo so that we might find beauty everywhere. <br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Deleuze and Guattari ’72 (Anti-Oedipus, 330-39)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12pt;">But it seems that things are becoming ... being swallowed up-a question of regime. </span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">AND—rejecting the little bits of fascism inside our minds is an ethical art of living.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Foucault 1972 Preface to Anti-Oedipus (p. xiii-iv.) [Edited for correct underlined sentence structure -MRL]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"> Last but not least... or guide to everyday life:</span><br />
Life is slow dying. Attempts for control only accelerate the inherent violence of the world and breed micro-fascism, appropriating war and peace as the theatre of conflict in an endless cycle. However a nomadic war-machine of language can use open multiplicity to replace the fascist form of order and control. We must affirm Nietzsche's Eternal Return—this rhizomatic process of affirming ALL of life might be painful but its the only way to really EVER BE ALIVE. <br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Rahel </span><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aima</span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">, Columbia University, “In the beginning was the language, and the language was gravity,” 4-13-</span><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2009</span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">, </span><span style="color: blue; font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://killingdenouement.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/in-the-beginning-was-the-language-and-the-language-was-gravity" rel="nofollow">http://killingdenouement.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/in-the-beginning-was-the-language-and-the-language-was-gravity</a></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">*morpheme: the smallest linguistic unit that has semantic meaning </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">In the beginning was the language... eternal return to the pre-primordial violence. </span><br />
Vote affirmative to embrace the Dicethrow: affirming a singular throw of the dice and accepting the infinite possibilities of its outcome in the eternal return is necessary to affirm life.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Deleuze 1983</span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"> (Gilles, Prof of Philosophy @ U of Lyon, Paris, and Lycees, Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 25-27)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"> The game has two moments which are those of a dicethrow... the fatally obtained number. 23</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 3 is Borderlands<br />
We must move beyond the stranglehold of the family and borders. We affirm instead a politics of continuation – of constantly seeking new subjectivities and investigating their potential. We are against restriction—and call endlessly for its elimination, facilitating the withering away of all borders. That makes affirming this year's resolution an easy yes. Affirm the resolution to break the border around the nation and break the border around the family and take hold of a rhizomatic connection to affirming life itself. <br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">Verea Andermatt </span><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Conley, 2006</span></span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">, prof of lit @ Harvard, “Borderlines; Deleuze and the Contemporary world,” p 95-100</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;"> In their dialogues and collaborations... all identity is undone.</span><br />

 They have no internal link – Aima indicates when we use place responsibility in the state to prevent war it allows it to fixate the masses gaze upon a constructed danger as well as appropriating our revolutionary force into pre-existing forms – we must fight against our love of power because the question is why our methodological thought structures allow violence, that’s Foucault. Prefer our analysis – violence flows up from micro-trends.<br />

Death is good – In accepting death and renouncing the ego one gains an immanent connection to life itself—merging with the sea of life—entering a primordial pact with the schizoid current of life. This cannot be done without freeing life from the prohibition on thought that imprisons it in the body. Vote Aff to free yourself.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mark ‘98 </span></span>(John, Gilles Deleuze: Vitalism and Multiplicity, p. 29-33)</span><br />

This collapses the negative's whole world view—current science disproves cartesian dualism and organic materialism i.e. the idea that there is the world outside our body and then the world inside our mind which is contained in our body. Every-thing is an a-subjective current of consciousness—call for this evidence its warranted and definitive on the issue.<br />

The neg’s depiction of death as merely the end of life isa coping technique used to smother ontological anxiety<br />

If we think of death exclusively as the terminal point of life<br />
AND<br />
Nor are we wholly present like an object at hand.<br />
This response to ontological anxiety detaches us from being, prevents authentic existence and makes life pointless<br />

If we do not use our ontological anxiety<br />
AND<br />
In tune with our Existential Predicament.<br />
<br />
<br />
that outweighs extinction, prefer our comparative evidence<br />

Only unconditional surrender can relieve us of ontological anxiety<br />

Existential Freedom is not an arbitrary or accidental<br />
AND<br />
Our whole being without reservation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their impacts are part of the calculative ontologies that allow ongoing standing reserve and destruction of the earth and being – we need to rethink through a different ontology – folks are already dead in technology. They’ll say extinction outweighs but that’s the type of impact calculus that we need to rethink and question—human will is not the master of being. Attempting to gain that kind of technological control over the world only enframes us in death. This is ontologically prior to nuclear war in multiple ways:<br />
James M. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Demske</span></span>, “Being, Man, and Death,” <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1970</span></span>, p 135-6<br />
A new trend in Heidegger’s thinking about death<br />

Essence-a ‘[human]’ without the essence of man.<br />

<br />
DA: Role of the ballot: best pol option that is relationship b/w living and dying. Death is good - frees biological life. Vote aff to renounce ego and body. Denial of schizo existence risks tying ourselves to body. Cartesian dualism is correct - science experiments prove.<br />
Neg's depiction of death is bad - causes more anxiety. <br />
Not finished just because we die. Their depiction of death makes life pointless.<br />
This outweighs extinction.<br />
Only uncondo surrender works.
