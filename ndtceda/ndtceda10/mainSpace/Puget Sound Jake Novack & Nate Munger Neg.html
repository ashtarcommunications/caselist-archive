Their claims at resistance represent nostalgia for premodern modernity, this only results in reifing the neo-colonialism they kritik. <br />

Towson’s approach to debate as a space of liberation repeats the errors of the Warren Court.  By transforming debate into a place for judging the inclusion of blackness into polity they implicitly turn whiteness into a constant narrative of enlightenment from bigotry to moral visibility.  The consequence of this stance not only legitimizes prior acts of hatred and violence by making them a necessary part of white enlightenment, but guarantees that each step forward for us comes at the cost of someone else getting pushed back.<br />

As one illustration, upon Warren's death on July ... subject's relationship to Japanese Californians.<br />

The call for the judge space to become politically active is far from neutral.  Towson’s advocacy turns it into a site for racial redemption.  This process occurs in three steps: judges are given the option to publicly declare their distance from structures of white supremacy, the question of personal and historical embeddedness is buried in superficial and quick references to a reality outside of debate, and the legitimation of innocent whiteness occurs.  This process makes the signature of the ballot a mere token for a clean slate, which not only devastates their movement by giving judges the opportunity to treat Towson like tokens, but guarantees future acts of outright aggression.  Consider this argument our “judge space disad.” The fight for a radically open polity shouldn’t be played like slots. <br />

My experience of coming from ethnically Jewish backgrounds also complicates the picture of this debate.  The erasure of this history in lumping our practice into the standard of “white oppression in debate” ignores a unique moment of historical struggle.  Jews have been the oft pawned figure in American imaginary that enables Jews to be included in political orders only insofar as they stand outside of normative racial binaries.  The unique movement of Jews to subvert this act of separation by enginag in TRADITIONALLY WHITE EVENTS uniquely interrogates racial Manicheanism.  Their approach violently erases a unique history.<br />
Andrea Levine, “The (Jewish) White Negro: Norman Mailer’s racial bodies.” MELUS, 28, 2003, asked via questia<br />
My rereading of what is arguably the most famous twentieth-century academic example of the white appropriation … considers the nature of the &quot;roots&quot; that the &quot;white Negro&quot; is quite literally able to cast off.<br />
<br />
Denying American Jews a forum to speak about their violent suppression is old hat tactics of the civil rights movement.  Norman Mailer and Ralph Jones prove our argument.  Speaking to marginal suffering in public discourse constitutes a UNIQUE reversal of historical legacies of anti-Judaism.  Effacing this element of our debate is similar to the removal of Jewish experience from discussions of the Holocaust during civil rights.<br />
Andrea Levine, “The (Jewish) White Negro: Norman Mailer’s racial bodies.” MELUS, 28, 2003, asked via questia<br />
As opposed to the ruthlessly interrogated Jewish voice, always subject to scrutiny … suggests the macabre limits of the strategy of invisibility Mailer employs to protect the body.<br />

Towson’s project misses a crucial insight into the operation of racialized domination.  Race is, fundamentally, linked to the power of visibility and the act of marking and rendering bodily images that then are solidified or encoded by other distinctly cultural signs (all of which are seen as linked to a centrally pictured identity).  The problem then is one of making racialized domination also visible and contestable.  However, race doesn’t work like many theorists of power believe, it isn’t exclusively a product of historical circumstance or power, but also a product of discursive functioning.  Whiteness here stands as a master-signifier that in a sense sets the agenda for idealization. The attempt to place another set of signifiers to stand in for whiteness doesn’t disrupt or contest the structure of domination, but rather places a different antagonism at the core of this conflict.  Fighting for inclusion becomes about organizing essentialism and reifies violence through associations of guilt, involvement and despair.  Only refusing race as a method of looking resolves this.  The 1817 slave revolt of Savannah proves our argument. <br />
Kalpana Seshadri-Crooks, professor of English at Boston College, Desiring Whiteness: A Lacanian Analysis of Race, 2000, pg. 35-38<br />
The above view of the ego and the body image raises the question of the … logic of anti-Semitism not as a “racist” aberration of difference, but as the kernel of all racial practice as a mode of looking. 14<br />
<br />
Towson’s explanation of racial politics makes two errors: 1) It begins in the middle and 2) it presumes race to be historically bound.  The concept of Whiteness as a hegemonic signifier originates internal to the European contintent as a method of differentiating people with white skin by calling them “non-white” and “non-pure,” the Black Irish are the penultimate example.  Historicist attempts to challenge whiteness by situating it within practice and negotiation and to vitalize black spaces by producing new aesthetics and languages only reproduce Whiteness as the Master-signifier by introducing new splits.  Their advocacy leads to a worse form of neoracism and silently solidifies anatomical discrimination.  We must think outside of this paradigm to solve.<br />
Kalpana Seshadri-Crooks, professor of English at Boston College, Desiring Whiteness: A Lacanian Analysis of Race, 2000, pg. 49-56<br />
The relation of Whiteness as the master signifier … as anatomy, when that anatomy does not exist as such.
