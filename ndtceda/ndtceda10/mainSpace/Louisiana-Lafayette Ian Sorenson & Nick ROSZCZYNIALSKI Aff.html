Counter-plans. We usually run a perm and then talk about how your counterplan is stupid.<br />
The Net Benefit to your Counter-plan. 4 minutes of non-uniques and link turns.<br />
Your K. We say, gee whiz, in some instances the State is good...like the time when the State comes in and stops your husband from beating you to death. I know there is no Value to Life when the State does anything, but getting the shit kicked out of you hurts like hell, and should be prevented.<br />
Then, in a pinch, we lift 2AC blocks and answers from Wake, Emory, Cal-Berkeley, Northwestern, Harvard and Whitman off of the Wiki to answer the stuff you also stole from Wake, Emory, Cal-Berekely, Northwestern, Harvard and Whitman from the wiki-caselist.<br />
Oh, and we run a condo bad block we stole from Whitman. Its pretty good. Not like anyone really votes for it, but it does require the other team to read their condo-good block that they stole from the Mean Green highschool camp, circa 2001. Their answers are longer, so we get a 15 second time trade off in this useless exchange of incomprensible tag-line reading.<br />
<br />
Negative Strategies <br />
We say H1B's suck and that visas as a general concept suck. If you plan is so damn good, why not just let everyone into the country, why waste time with a stupid stamp program? Then we run a really bad courts or XO counter-plans and a bad poltics disad with with horrible internal links. If they go critical, we will run framework or a K. Then, in a pinch, we read Wake Forest, Northwestern, Cal-Berkeley or Harvard blocks. I think that pretty much covers our negative strategy on this topic as well as 80% of the teams in the nation's negative strategies.<br />
<br />
The Aff we ran at GSU, West Georgia, Vanderbilt, and will probably run a version of it all the way at CEDA Nats.<br />

Plan: The United States federal government should substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for special family visas by expanding self-petition status to persons subject to domestic abuse regardless of marital status, immigration status, or domestic partner’s immigration status. Normal means. Affirmative Speeches will clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Domestic Abuse <br />
1. Undocumented persons subject to domestic abuse must be viewed from an intersectional approach that incorporates their class, race, gender,immigration, victimage and autonmy.

Multiple barriers hamper immigrant women's ability to achieve economic … and immigrant rights' advocates; without their united efforts this vulnerable population cannot be fully served. <br />

2. This reconceptualization of victim and autonomy is the best method for proactive policymaking. Schnieder 2003. [38 N.Y.L. Sch. L. Rev. 387 ARTICLE: FEMINISM AND THE FALSE DICHOTOMY OF VICTIMIZATION AND AGENCY Elizabeth M. SchneiderProfessor of Law, Brooklyn Law School. ]<br />
This new victim-agent identity of battered women can be a powerful policy tool. Policymakers can identify those decision-and action-junctures they deem as critical to stopping or reducing the domestic violence. They then can rely on the rationality and agency of battered women by using both positive support and negative consequences to steer women into using these identified opportunities towards desirable outcomes. Positive support should include genuinely helpful social services that work towards long- <a name="PAGE_1261_8056"></a> [*1261] term solutions, such as useful job training and permanent housing options. Negative consequences can range from suspension of certain privileges at shelters to modification of visitation or custody rights. <br />
It is critical, though, that such policies not operate in … opportunities to move towards desirable outcomes. <br />

3. Immigrant women are uniquely vulnerable to domestic abuse. Shaw 09 [Spring, 200915 Cardozo J.L. &amp; Gender 663NOTE: BARRIERS TO FREEDOM: CONTINUED FAILURE OF U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS TO OFFEREQUAL PROTECTION TO IMMIGRANT BATTERED WOMEN] <br />
Domestic violence victims constitute a significant proportion of crime … of immigrant women are abused by their spouses than women in the general population in the United States. <br />
4. Immigration dependency on a spouse locks women into a cycle of long term violence and domination. Shaw 2009 [Spring, 200915 Cardozo J.L. &amp; Gender 663NOTE: BARRIERS TO FREEDOM: CONTINUED FAILURE OF U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS TO OFFEREQUAL PROTECTION TO IMMIGRANT BATTERED WOMEN] <br />
Immigrant women are a particularly vulnerable group … abuse among immigrant women is much higher than that among other victims of domestic abuse. n16 <br />
5. Failure to escape abusive relationships result in death. Domestic Violence causes Murder. SW 2006 [ Silent Witness, June 29, 2006, “ Statistics on Domestic Violence” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.silentwitness.net/sub/violences.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.silentwitness.net/sub/violences.htm</a>] <br />
By the mid 1990's, at least fifteen hundred women each year were murder victimes from domestic violence. … two-thirds of reported domestic violence incidents are classified as &quot;simple assaults,&quot; which is a misdemeanor rather than a felony. But up to 50 percent of these &quot;simple assaults&quot; result in physical injuries that are as, or more, serious than 90 percent of all rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Victims of violence are trapped within the sphere of the unreal where certain lives are not considered lives at all. This gives rise to inevitable violence against those who are not recognized as real Butler 2004 <br />
[Judith Butler, 2004, “Undoing Gender” , pgs.24-25] <br />
<br />
What are the cultural contours of the notion of the human at work here? And how do the … has been no sundering of that commonality. None of this takes place on the order of the event. None of this takes place. How many lives have been lost from AIDS in Africa in the last few years? Where are the media representations of this loss, the discursive elaborations of what these losses mean for communities there? <br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Child Abuse <br />
1. ) There is a direct link between Domestic Violence and Child Abuse. These children have no choice in the matter. AHA 1994 [ American Humane Association- Child Division, September 1994, “ The Link Between Child Abuse and Domestic Violence” yesican.org] <br />
A growing body of research points to a definite link between adult domestic …violence experience increased problems themselves. <br />
2.) Children are victimized by just witnessing domestic violence. They often become what they see which perpetuates domestic violence. AHA 1994 [ American Humane Association- Child Division, September 1994, “ The Link Between Child Abuse and Domestic Violence” yesican.org] <br />
Even in households in which children are not themselves physically abused … witnesses of domestic violence may also display an inability to control and express emotion, or to delay gratification. <br />
<br />
<br />
3.) The Result is neglect, child death, and continuation of the cycle of violence. Carter 2005[ Janet Carter, March 15 2005, “Domestic Violence, Child Abuse, and Youth Violence: Strategies for Prevention and Early Intervention” Family Violence Prevention Fund.] <br />
Domestic violence and child abuse take a devastating toll on children and society at large. …. Clearly, domestic violence and child abuse are spawning grounds for the next generation of abusers, as well as for violent juveniles. <br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 1 Solvency <br />
1. Inherency and Solvency. VAWA is effective at protecting battered U.S. women, however undocumented battered immigrant women are excluded from those same rights. Only by expanding U.S. immigration visa eligibility can these goals of VAWA be achieved. Wood, 2004 [VAWA'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS: THE IMMIGRANT WOMEN WHO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKSDr. Sarah Wood, Ph.D. from Harvard and a Law Degree from Duke, writes in the Duke Journal of Gender Law and Policy, 2004.] <br />
<br />
VAWA 2000 went a long way toward closing the gaps in protection for … deportation for reporting the crimes committed against them. <br />
<br />
2. The Violence Against Women Act is effective because it allows abused immigrants to file for assistance without their abuser’s cooperation. Orloff in 2001 [Leslye Orloff is the Director of the Immigrant Women Program, National Organization for Women (NOW) Legal Defense and Education Fund. ; Spring, 2001; Lifesaving Welfare Safety Net Access for Battered Immigrant Women and Children: Accomplishments and Next Steps; The College of William and Mary, William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law] <br />
In VAWA, Congress included immigration provisions … applications without the cooperation of the abusive spouse or parent. n12 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. The Violence Against Women Act is needed to allow battered immigrants to escape further abuse and regain their autonomy. Orloff in 2001 [Leslye Orloff is the Director of the Immigrant Women Program, National Organization for Women (NOW) Legal Defense and Education Fund. ; Spring, 2001; Lifesaving Welfare Safety Net Access for Battered Immigrant Women and Children: Accomplishments and Next Steps; The College of William and Mary, William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law] <br />
Battered women escaping violence must be able to locate safe, secure …, federally funded public or assisted housing is crucial. <br />
6. When victims of domestic abuse have access to public benefits, they can regain their autonomy and escape abusive relationships. Orloff, 2001 [Leslye Orloff is the Director of the Immigrant Women Program, National Organization for Women (NOW) Legal Defense and Education Fund. She was formerly the director of the National Policy Project at Ayuda Inc., a legal services program for immigrant and refugee women., Lifesaving Welfare Safety Net Access for Battered Immigrant Women and Children: Accomplishments and Next Steps; William and Mary Journal of Women and the Law] <br />
On the other hand, when battered immigrants receive public benefits… enable them to obtain secure, safe housing, food and clothing for themselves and their children. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Plan re-engages politics for social change. Merely critiquing the status quo and language does nothing to actual solve their “ism,” creates atrocity, and cedes politics to the Evil they critique. Boggs ’97 (CARL BOGGS – Professor and Ph.D. Political Science, National University, Los Angeles -- Theory and Society 26: 741-780) <br />
The false sense of empowerment that comes with such mesmerizing impulses … might help further rationalize the existing power structure. In either case, the state would likely become what Hobbes anticipated: the embodiment of those universal, collec-tive interests that had vanished from civil society.75 <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2 <br />
<a name="x=-Framework-A._Our_interpretation_is_th"></a>A. Our interpretation is that plan focus is good. <br />
<a name="x=-Framework-B._Prefer_our_interpretatio"></a>B. Prefer our interpretation – <br />
<a name="x=-Framework-1._Aff_Choice_–_If_we’re_fa"></a>1. Aff Choice – If we’re resolutionally based, there should be a presumption for the affirmative, otherwise they can moot 9 minutes of the 1AC. <br />
<a name="x=-Framework-2._Ground_–_plan_focus_prov"></a>2. Negative Ground – plan focus provides a stable locus for negative links – solves all their offense, they can still read critiques of plan action. <br />
<a name="x=-Framework-3._Topic_Specific_Education"></a>3. Topic Specific Education – We ought to answer the question in the resolution. – disincentivizing topic specific research kills education. <br />
<a name="x=-Framework-4._Alternative_Frameworks_a"></a>4. Alternative Frameworks aren’t responsive – The assumptions of the 1AC are predicated on the framework that we think the resolution demands. If they sever us out of our framework, it should also sever assumptions based on it. <br />
<a name="x=-Framework-C._If_we_win_our_framework,"></a>C. If we win our framework, Reject representation based link arguments and non-policy alternatives. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3. Defense Wins Championships. <br />
<br />
1. The Plan will not increase fraud or immigration. These women and children are already in the United States. Shaw 2009 [Spring, 200915 Cardozo J.L. &amp; Gender 663NOTE: BARRIERS TO FREEDOM: CONTINUED FAILURE OF U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS TO OFFEREQUAL PROTECTION TO IMMIGRANT BATTERED WOMEN] <br />
Extending VAWA benefits to undocumented immigrant battered women … cross the border. n188 She should not have to suffer physical battery or risk death merely because she is undocumented. <br />
2. Your disads are terminally non-unique. Historically, VAWA changes for immigrant women have received bipartisan support., VAWA has been in existence since 1995. Shetty, 2002 [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=384" rel="nofollow">http://new.vawnet.org/category/Main_Doc.php?docid=384</a>; Sudha Shetty, J.D.<br />
Director, Access to Justice Institute Seattle University School of Law] <br />
There was further bi-partisan recognition that immigration laws were … contained provisions that limit the ability of the abuser to use immigration laws to threaten and control his immigrant spouse or child. <br />
3. Your Politics Disad is Not Unique. Obama has rejected bipartisanship. He does not want it and he does not expect it. Weigant, September 8, 2010. [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-bipartisan-obsessi_b_709880.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-weigant/obamas-bipartisan-obsessi_b_709880.html</a>] <br />
President Barack Obama gave a wowser of a speech today… and appeared much more like the &quot;Candidate Obama&quot; that so many of his supporters have been missing for so long. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Your generic immigration politics links are Non-Unique. Obama Administration is doing mass dismissals of deportations and suits to prevent enforcement of immigration laws. Bargeman August 26, 2010 [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldnewsheardnow.com/ice-dropping-immigration-cases-backdoor-amnesty/2008/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldnewsheardnow.com/ice-dropping-immigration-cases-backdoor-amnesty/2008/</a>] <br />
Immigration and Customs Enforcement is dropping cases against … be more interested in enforcing current immigration laws.
