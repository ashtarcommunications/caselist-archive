The history of United States immigration is marked by racial, economic, and sexual exclusion that reflect the larger logics of US empire; visas were distributed in such a way as to maintain the dominant social order, but always masked in the language of policymaking and inclusion; this discourse has disguised the fact that the immigration system is actually a site of exclusion based on the attempt to let in only the most desirable, which translates to the perception of the ideal immigrant as the one who is most malleable into being shaped into a representation of the good white, heterosexual, capitalist citizen – all those outside these boundaries are marked and rejected because of their alterity<br />

Policing at the border and attempts to incorporate the new immigrant into the “mainstream” of the nation are meant to dichotomize between the good immigrant, who can be transformed into the good American, and the bad immigrant who becomes the terrorist, the security threat, the danger from within – this enemy construction is a foundational project of imperial nation-building – empire perpetuates the closing off of different ways of being and leads to the systematic destruction of the Other in the name of security<br />

The rhetoric of inclusion surrounding the immigration system simply serves to mask an exclusionary war on noncitizens, an invisible internal war that holds the motivations of a hateful racial war, but disguises its motives in the language of immigration – we pretend that immigration is somehow inclusive, a way to bring others into the fold, but this view ignores the multitude of ways in which immigration is exclusionary, and displaces our societal anger onto the body of the Other<br />

Racist dichotomies, whether blatant or masked in the language of immigration, create otherization that normalizes us to violence – a perpetual, biopolitical war emerges on all levels of society<br />

Queerness has long been marked by the Western world for destruction – from Sodom to concentration camps, whatever is queer is eradicable – the queer is seen as a decadent threat to civilization, who eagerly envisions a time “after the homosexual” – the attempt to eradicate the queer body cannot be achieved without targeting the entire species, resulting in omnicide<br />

Migration is feared because it is perceived as a lack of control over immigrant movement – this is what creates focus on border control<br />

The 1AC is a performative act that queers dominant understandings of the US immigration system and the legal/illegal dichotomy it perpetuates in order to break down oppressive systems and reveal the unmarked bodies they do violence to. Your ballot is a discourse exercising binding power; the ballot disrupts the violent logic of inclusion; every ballot matters – repetition is what confers power on the performative act<br />

<br />
Plan: allow same-sex binational couples to immigrate under family visas.<br />
<br />
Advantage I - Homophobia<br />
- immigration sends a signal that homophobia is acceptable<br />
- heterosexism is bad - variety of reasons<br />
<br />
Advantage II - International Modelling<br />
- Soft Power - plan increases global diplomatic capital<br />
- Human Rights<br />
- Democracy
