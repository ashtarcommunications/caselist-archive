 Dream Act causes public backlash- perceived as a bailout for immigrants giving away jobs<br />

 Plan flaw- the aff literally does nothing: the aff provides EB visas to those who serve in the military or get a degree- BUT doing either one of those requires a provisional visa. The aff doesn’t provide provisional visas to aliens living in the US, that’s a different section of the AgJobs bill that the aff doesn’t cite- the impact is no-one who could potentially benefit from the plan is eligible, since it would be illegal for them to meet the requirements. You should call for the plan and relevant sections of law- here’s the ev:<br />

 Interpretation-the affirmative must defend a specific numerical increase of visas<br />
1. Definitions – <br />
Increase requires a number – <br />
Random House Dictionary, 2010<br />
[Dictionary.com Unabridged Based on the Random House Dictionary, &quot;increase,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/increase" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/increase</a>, CAH]<br />
in·crease [v. in-krees; n. in-krees]<br />
–verb (used with object)<br />
1.<br />
to make greater, as in number, size, strength, or quality;augment; add to: to increase taxes.<br />
B. Violation – AFF raises a cap instead of increasing the existing number of visas – this violates ‘increase’ in the resolution AND is not an on face increase – they have to prove demand above and beyond the current cap now and forever or they aren’t substantial.<br />
C. Vote neg.<br />
1. Ground – Any kind of disads or counterplans related to a specific number of visas are impossible under their interpretation. Providing no number is effectively providing every number. This allows the aff to shift out of negative arguments by simply making claims about how many visas will be used at any point in time. <br />
2. Precision - our interpretation gives meaning to the words ‘increase’ and ‘number’- each word in the resolution must have value and if they don’t meet part, they don’t meet any. <br />
3. Education – their interpretation kills critical thinking - finding a specific number and defending it is far more educational than a non-amount that can float to be whatever they need at the time.<br />
Independently, not specifying the number amount they raise the cap to is a voter,<br />
1. Moving target – substantial can be defined as anything, the aff can redefine their number based on substantial to answer disads differently, making no negative strategy compete.<br />
<br />
2. No solvency means you default negative- This is the one instance in which the elmore card is actually relevant<br />
Elmore, 80 <br />
(Richard F., “Backward Mapping: Implementation Research and Policy Decisions,” Political Science Quarterly 94, No. 4 Winter 79-80, p. 605)<br />
Analysis of policy choices matters very little if … in the realm of implementation.<br />
<br />
3. Ground – eliminates core counterplan ground that competes off of raising the cap to a different number-a key generic strategy at the beginning of the year<br />

C. Vote Negative-<br />
1. Predictability-unlimited number of cases and grounds that can be used to generate advantages-explodes an already large topic area.<br />
2. Ground-destroys core DA’s, politics, tradeoff and spillover all depend on increasing the number of people coming into the country<br />

<h3 id="toc11"><a name="Northwestern Rd. 3- Pittsburgh KS (Aff- Overrule the Chinese Exclusion Act)--Topicality- Eligibility"></a>Topicality- Eligibility</h3>
 Interpretation-Admissibility is distinct from eligibility under INA §212(a), eligibility is what qualifies an immigrant for a visa whereas admissibility is what allows them entrance to the country<br />
Hasche 05,<br />
(Tilman, &quot;An Overview of Immigration Law,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc</a>) bct<br />
The Act establishes a two check system as the main … be “lawfully admitted for permanent residence.” <br />
<br />
Violation- The affirmative removes an admissibility requirement which is distinct from an expansion of eligibility.<br />
<br />
C. STANDARDS<br />
1. Limits. Our Interpretation limits out an infinite number of cases that merely change the admissibility requirements for visas exploding the neg research burden killing fairness<br />
2. Ground. Takes away the best ground on the topic by forcing the neg to defend current policy as opposed to negating the positive expansion of eligibility<br />
3. Extratopicality. The USCIS lists visa name-number categories according to the 4 groups in the topic. If the aff grows one of those government-listed categories, they are topical. Their interpretation would allow them to remove admissibility standards that relate of any category of visa. This is extratopical, and makes it impossible for the judge to make an objective determination of jurisdiction, which is unfair to both sides.<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and communication. It’s a game of competing interpretations.<br />

 A. Interpretation: Debate should be a site for contest over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a resolutional plan of action for the United States federal government to reform visa policy and defend that their policy should be adopted.<br />
<br />
B. Our interpretation is Grounded in the Resolution<br />
1. The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon—the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters<br />
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing 2k<br />

<br />
C. Violation –<br />
1. The affirmative fails to defend the consequences of implementation of a plan carried out by the United States federal government to reform visa policy.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Reasons to Prefer<br />
Resolution centered debate is critical to a fair debate – it’s a voting issue.<br />
<br />
1. Predictability-<br />
A. the resolution sets the topic for discussion- allowing the aff to choose their ground outside of the resolution makes it impossible for the negative to engage the affirmative. There are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies unrelated to the topic which are impossible to predict- this leaves the negative unprepared to debate<br />
<br />
B. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, enabling the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground<br />
<br />
C. The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion<br />
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 181-2)<br />
The requirements given thus far are ... rests on some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
Two impacts- first, unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that allows us to critically examine their approach- this prevents informed clash which outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously examining it.<br />
The second impact is the possibility of change-the aff destroys possibility of political change by not allowing interlocutors to join the debate and buy into the affirmative’s political project. The criticism demonstrates the opportunity cost of engaging in the conversation over race in a certain way- they created the material conditions of a conversation framed in an adversarial format.<br />
<br />
2. Education -<br />
A. policy options are key to real world education about possible reforms- their framework devastates learning about the real world with reciprocal and clear deliberation about the merits of an idea<br />
<br />
B. Topical Education—by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government. Their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism<br />
Martin W. Lewis, Professor of Geography and Regional Science at George Washington University, 1992 (Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism. Page 247)<br />
A majority of those born between ... in fascism, regardless of their instructors’ intentions.<br />
<br />
C. Implementation- the aff will always win the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract- we can only debate the merits of arguments if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Harvard Carr Center for Human Rights Policy director and human rights practices professor, 04 (The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror, 20-21)<br />
There are two problems with ... might lead us to betray another.<br />
<br />
D. Informed Citizens - Fiat is key to being informed citizens, without it we never learn about the political process and don’t take responsibility for the possible bad outcomes of our actions. Simulating policy solves all their offense, allowing people a safe space to test new ideas<br />
Christopher C. Joyner, Professor of International Law in the Government Department at Georgetown University, Spring 1999 (Teaching International Law: Views From An International Relations Political Scientist, 5 ILSA J Int'l &amp; Comp L 377)<br />
Use of the debate can be an... critique, and legal defense.<br />
<br />
E. Our framework is critical to challenge fundamentalism and orthodoxy- it’s a progressive challenge to security politics<br />
English et al, Schenley Park Debate Authors Working Group scholar, 7<br />
(Eric, Stephen Lano, Gordon Mitchell, University of Pittsburg communications professor, Catherine Morrison, John Reif, and Carly Woods, “Debate as a Weapon of Mass Destruction,” June 2007, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/EnglishDAWG.pdf) atw<br />
It is our position, however, that rather than acting as a … orthodoxy, and reflexivity in the face of fundamentalism.<br />

F. It’s necessary to learn the language and the real-world functions of the state in order to transform it<br />
Lutz, Prof PolSci U of Huston, 2k<br />

 The culture of fear is a product of liberalism that finds its culmination in the fear of death. This culture of fear sustains the politics of being-for-death which creates the very insecurity and perpetual war the affirmative attempts to solve. Just like the call to &quot;die for God/9 the call to &quot;die for nothing&quot; defines life in relation to death which gives death permanence and traps us in the politics of being-for-death.<br />
Daniel M. Bell, Jr., Associate Professor of Theological Ethics, Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, 2007<br />
(Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory, &quot;The Politics of Fear and The Gospel of Life,&quot; JCRT 8.2 SPRING 2007 55,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jcrt.org/archives/08.2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrt.org/archives/08.2/</a>) mph<br />
Thus, as we examine the culture of fear… necessity of sacrifice and suffering.<br />
<br />
We advocate that the judge vote for the neg to create a space for a new political order. That political order is affirmed through the politics of being-for-life found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The truth-event of the resurrection is a radical act of affirmation that denies death meaning and ruptures the politics we have critiqued. Our ethic replaces the logic of reductive sacrifice (in the name of God or people) with the relentless affirmation of life that overcomes the politics of fear and allows ceaseless giving in the face of terror.<br />
Bell 07<br />
