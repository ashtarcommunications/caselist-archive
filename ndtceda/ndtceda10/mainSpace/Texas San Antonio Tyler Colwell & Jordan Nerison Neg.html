<span class="underline">Individuality is a… cloning pure and simple.</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: "Garamond","serif";">In fact, today no one can be expected to be entirely responsible for their own life, answerable to every aspect of their current situation or social location – this is a utopian hoax! Yet the affirmative continues to call for such impossibility, chaining all under its method to a truly unheard of form of self-servitude and management</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: "Garamond","serif";">Yet, the affirmative would have us continue to believe we are responsible subjects who fully align with ourselves politically, socially, and ethically – debating about no discourse that we can’t defend, no way of being that we are not – preventing us, ultimately, from being or speaking evil of any kind. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: "Garamond","serif";">This is what we’ll call tyranny of the self – a type of involuntary servitude that breeds political fascists by enslaving life to itself.</span></strong><br />

<br />
The attempt to liberate ourselves from all forms of oppression finds its inevitable conclusion in the collapse of the world in indifference. Instead we should rid ourselves of freedom by playing the game of debate subjectively. This allows for us to use the arbitrary nature of politics to shield ourselves from oppression, allowing for more mobility than if we were to be slaves to ourselves. Framework enables this by giving us an objective game to play without forcing us to give claim to identity. <br />

<strong>This turns the affirmative: the aff increases patriarchy – only the affirmative denial of the subject can solve, allowing effective resistance to patriarchy.</strong><br />
