A) The best estimates put the number of extraterrestrial civilizations at 10,000<br />
Drake, Chairman of the SETI Institute, 02<br />
(Frank, “Odds of Complex Life: Great Debates Part III,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.astrobio.net/news/article239.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrobio.net/news/article239.html</a>)<br />

Chris McKay: There is no solid evidence … in the stellar neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – the framework<br />
A) Humanity must acknowledge the equality of alien life to prevent universal genocide<br />
Packer, Master in Communication Wake Forest, 07<br />
&lt;Joe, Alien Life in Search of Acknowledgment, pg 62-63&gt;<br />
Once we hold alien interests as equal …humanity's obligations to life beyond this planet.<br />
<br />
B) There is no justification to exclude other beings from our moral calculation<br />
Singer, a chair in bioethics at Princeton University's Center for Human Values, 01<br />
&lt;Peter, “To: Richard A. Posner” June 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm</a> &gt;<br />
People often say, without much thought, …feel pain and pleasure. Lettuces can't.<br />
<br />
Contention three – the scenarios<br />
Scenario one – lasers<br />
A) New military technology will use lasers that exceed cosmic energy<br />
Leslie, Univ. of Guelph Philosophy Professor, 96<br />
(John, The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction, pages 113-114)<br />
Among the sources of electromagnetic waves … them radiate at the higher frequencies.<br />
<br />
B) These energies will disturb the vacuum<br />
Leslie, 96<br />
(John, Univ. of Guelph Philosophy Professor, The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction, page 109)<br />
How could anything as empty …mean a region absolutely empty.<br />
<br />
C) Vacuum destabilization destroys the universe<br />
Leslie, 96 (John, Univ. of Guelph Philosophy Professor, The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction, page 110)<br />
As Hut and Rees commented, it may … suffer gravitational collapse in 'microseconds or less'.<br />
<br />
Scenario two – particle accelerators<br />
A) Advances in particle accelerator technology ensure the destruction of the entire universe<br />
CR4.com, 8-13-07 (“Concern that the LHC might destroy the universe,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/11070/Concern-that-the-LHC-might-destroy-the-universe" rel="nofollow">http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/11070/Concern-that-the-LHC-might-destroy-the-universe</a>)<br />
People both inside and outside … Anyone want to discuss this?<br />
<br />
Scenario three – time travel<br />
A) Time travel will occur in the future – new advances ensure it<br />
Highfield, editor of the New Scientist, 8-8-07<br />
(Roger, “Time travel could be possible ... in the future,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/08/08/scitime108.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/08/08/scitime108.xml</a>)<br />
Prof Amos Ori has set out a theoretical …bend spacetime into a loop.<br />
<br />
B) Time travel will destroy the universe<br />
Herbert, 00 (Ryan, “Time travel,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://xar.us/stuff/papers/time_travel/" rel="nofollow">http://xar.us/stuff/papers/time_travel/</a>)<br />
Despite these restraints, …fools who would rush in&quot; (p. 32).<br />
<br />
Scenario four – zero point energy<br />
A) Zero point energy is coming now<br />
Scott, editor of Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, 3-1-04 (William, “To the stars,” Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, p. lexis)<br />
At least two large aerospace companies … low-level ZPE-related efforts underway.<br />
<br />
B) Zero point energy will destroy the universe<br />
Page, 8-7-07<br />
(Lewis, “Boffins flick Quantum vacuum switch from suck to blow<br />

Or, freely paraphrasing, we …Syndrome blasting something, captioned:<br />
<br />
Scenario five – nanotechnology<br />
A) Destroying humanity now is critical to prevent an unregulated boom in Nanotechnology<br />
Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, 1-21-04 (“The urgent search for solutions,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2004/01/page/2/" rel="nofollow">http://crnano.typepad.com/crnblog/2004/01/page/2/</a>)<br />
Molecular nanotechnology manufacturing will … we'd better get to work.<br />
<br />
B) Inevitable nano-accidents will destroy life throughout the universe<br />
ETC Group, 03 (“From Genomes to Atoms: The Big Down,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/171/01/thebigdown.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.etcgroup.org/upload/publication/171/01/thebigdown.pdf</a>)<br />
GRAY GOO What if nanobots …Sun and all the planets combined.”<br />
<br />
Scenario six – AI<br />
A) We will develop uncontrollable artificial life – unleashing a universal biocide<br />
Rheingold, 9-22-92 (Howard, “At the beginning of the twentieth century,” Whole Earth Review, p. lexis)<br />
It looks as if something even … level of ethical lapse.<br />
<br />
Scenario seven – high energy experiments<br />
A) Future technologies will produce experiments that exceed cosmic energies – causing a vacuum destabilization that destroys everything<br />
Leslie, 96 (John, Univ. of Guelph Philosophy Professor, The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction, pages 8-9)<br />
The possibility of producing an … with radically new technology.<br />
<br />
Scenario eight – anti matter weapons<br />
Anti-matter weapons are coming now – and will destroy everything<br />
AboveTopSecret.com, 1-6-05 (“Does anyone really understand antimatter?,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread144369/pg1" rel="nofollow">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread144369/pg1</a>)<br />

<h2 id="toc4"><a name="GMU Semis-2NC Case Dump"></a>2NC Case Dump</h2>
 <h3 id="toc5"><a name="GMU Semis-2NC Case Dump-Trade-"></a>Trade-</h3>
 1) Status quo solves—increased U.S. leadership ensures a deal on Doha <br />
Politi, 12-17-10 (James, “EU official welcomes US trade policy shift,” Financial Times, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8e82ed32-097a-11e0-8c68-00144feabdc0.html#axzz198YHe2Tf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8e82ed32-097a-11e0-8c68-00144feabdc0.html#axzz198YHe2Tf</a>) <br />
A top European Union official praised what he … added that “it could be the last chance”. <br />
<br />
2) Status quo solves—fresh offers are in the works <br />
Hermosa, 12-8-10 (Jessica, “Clock ticking on Doha deal,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=22608" rel="nofollow">http://www.bworldonline.com/main/content.php?id=22608</a>) <br />
WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy, however, was … by April, WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said.<br />
<br />
3) Alt cause—agricultural subsidies <br />
A) Agricultural subsidies prevent a Doha break through <br />
Rosario, 12-20-10 (Joe, “Farm subsidy system needs to be revamped,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Farm+subsidy+system+needs+revamped/4002405/story.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Farm+subsidy+system+needs+revamped/4002405/story.html</a>) <br />
The sordid tale of agricultural subsidies is … of the industry in the long run. <br />
<br />
B) Political will doesn’t exist to reduce agricultural subsidies <br />
Stevens, 12-17-10 (Tom Allen, “Free trade or farm support? You decide,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.agriculture.com/news/policy/free-trade-farm-suppt-you-decide_4-ar13307" rel="nofollow">http://www.agriculture.com/news/policy/free-trade-farm-suppt-you-decide_4-ar13307</a>) <br />
But the political will to retain it remains as strong …but few wished to scrap it altogether.<br />
<br />
4) Alt cause—special safeguard mechanism <br />
A) U.S.-Indian dispute over the Special Safeguard Mechanism is the root cause of Doha inaction <br />
The Casual Truth, 11-30-10 (“Trying to finish the Doha trade round,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thecasualtruth.com/story/trying-finish-doha-trade-round" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecasualtruth.com/story/trying-finish-doha-trade-round</a>) <br />
After seven years of negotiations and 90% of the deal done, … harm jobs in the short term, US concessions are unlikely. <br />
<br />
B) Disputes over the Special Safeguard Mechanism overwhelm consensus on visa policy <br />
Outlook India, 9-9-08 (“India &quot;missed&quot; more H1B visas with failure of Doha talks: US,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?10044" rel="nofollow">http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?10044</a>) <br />
The US today said India &quot;missed&quot; a major opportunity to get…to develop market access for firms and workers.<br />
<br />
5) Even a DOHA agreement won’t revitalize the WTO or the global trading system <br />
BLUSTEIN, 10 (Paul, “RIP, WTO,” January 2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/04/rip_wto" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/04/rip_wto</a>) <br />
Sadly, even in a best-case scenario for 2010, with … has any future as a negotiating forum.<br />
<br />
6) Predictions of imminent WTO destruction due to lack of a DOHA deal are false—here’s one example <br />
BLUSTEIN, 10 (Paul, “RIP, WTO,” January 2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/04/rip_wto" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/01/04/rip_wto</a>) <br />
Of course, commerce will continue across national borders, … credibility of the institution is now at stake ... 2010 is a real deadline.&quot;<br />
<br />
7) Turn—plan causes domestic protectionism <br />
Betts and Nicolaidis, 2-19-09 (Alexander and Kalypso, “The Trade-Migration Linkage: GATS Mode IV,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pcglobal/conferences/wtoreform/Betts_Nicolaides_memo.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.princeton.edu/~pcglobal/conferences/wtoreform/Betts_Nicolaides_memo.pdf</a>) <br />
One first way to tackle this question is to ask …more or less multilateral cooperation in the two issue-areas.<br />
<br />
8) Turn—Doha collapse is key to trade in the short term <br />
New York Times, 08 (“The next step for international trade,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/opinion/03iht-edtrade.1.14965784.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/03/opinion/03iht-edtrade.1.14965784.html</a>) <br />
The collapse of the seven-year effort to further reduce trade …retaliation for emissions of greenhouse gases under its rules.<br />

 A major attack wouldn’t happen - the few nations capable are unwilling and non-state actors prefer physical means<br />

Status Quo solves – Obama’s cybersecurity initiative secures critical infrastructure<br />
Zetter, Wired newsletter Senior Reporter, 10<br />

There's just one problem: There is no such thing as cyberterrorism… physical threats like car bombs or suicide bombers.&quot;<br />

Threats to cybersecurity are wildly overstated – most well-known incidents were accidental<br />
Washington Daily, 9<br />
(“Danger from Cyberthreats Wildly Overstated, Experts Say,” Washington Daily, 6-4, LN, accessed: 15 Nov 2010) beh<br />
President Barack Obama's new cybersecurity plan met with …under-the-radar intrusions as &quot;attacks,&quot; he said. <br />

 A. The affirmative’s imagination of a better world, free of suffering and tragedy is a continuation of the ascetic ideal. Their attempt to escape this world of sorrows in favor of an imaginative, more valuable world results in a hatred for this life which turns case. Fantasizing about a world where suffering is no more only produces impotence. Only our relationship to life can escape this paradox of ressentiment. <br />
Turanli, professor of Humanities and Social Sciences at Istanbul University, 2003 (Aydan “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein” Journal of Nietzsche Studies Vol 26 p. 55-63). Jt <br />
The craving for absolutely general specifications results in … show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle&quot; (PI §309).<br />

B. Their focus on pitying those who suffer turns case - it is a narcissistic self affection that ensures more instances that require pity. When we put ourselves in the place of the one who suffers, we are aware, nevertheless of the pleasure of not suffering like him.

Chastising the psychological naïveté of Schopenhauer's … the occasion for undermining their independence and asserting our own. <br />

C. Suffering is inevitable. The drive to abolish it holds life in contempt. The tension of the soul in time of misfortune, sorrow and suffering is what cultivates human greatness and gives meaning to our lives. <br />
Nietzsche, German Philosopher and Philologist, 1886. (Friedrich., doctorate in classical Greek Philology, Beyond Good and Evil, pg. 153-154). Jt <br />
Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or … philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.<br />
<br />
D. Life is a beautiful and twisted work of art – suffering is intrinsic to the condition of humanity. The idea that we have the ability to control the world by ridding it of tragedy allows suffering to be the dominating force and focus of our lives which destroys all value to life. <br />
Kain, Professor of philosophy at University of Santa Clara 2007. (Philip, &quot;Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the Horror of Existence,&quot; The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 33, Project Muse). Jt <br />
We have seen that in Nietzsche's opinion we cannot … the meaning he has succeeded in imposing on it. <br />
<br />
E. Stare into the horror of existence and vote negative – embrace life and accept the world as it is the status quo. Only accepting and loving our inevitable fate of suffering can we end the destructive cycle perpetuated by the affirmative. <br />

 The affirmative makes the question not how much how we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationships which makes genuine ethical engagement impossible.<br />
Zupančič, 2000<br />

In other words, one cannot attain the realm of the … refers to the faculty of desire as a priori.<br />
<br />
The belief that the political must remain in the background to generate change, is the ultimate sell-out of ethics. This act is unethical because it admits that the ethical posture alone is insufficient absent its capacity to generate change within the domain of institutional politics<br />
Thurschwell, 2003<br />
(Adam, Associate Professor of Law @ Cleveland State University, SYMPOSIUM: NIETZCHE AND LEGAL THEORY (PART II): SPECTERS OF NIETZSCHE: POTENTIAL FUTURES FOR THE CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL IN AGAMBEN AND DERRIDA, March, 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 1193, l/n) cnb<br />
Thus, as Derrida puts it, &quot;ethics enjoins a politics and … determined on the basis of something that resembles pure faith.<br />
<br />
The Belief that our activisms must inevitably, inexorably respond to the political conditions of our time through the leveraging of particular institutional appeals is precisely what nullifies our ethical potential. No matter the force of its opposition, the connection of transformation with an appeal to our institutions, mediates our relationships in such a manner that ethical transformation outside this frame of mediation becomes impossible.<br />
Hershock, 1999<br />

Black theologians have developed a center, or …colors whatever aspect of theology it touches.<br />

Being concerned with this form of justice means liberation theology cannot avoid direct conflict<br />
Daniel M. Bell, Assistant Professor of Theological Ethics at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Liberation Theology After the End of History, 2001<br />
This means that the Christian who is concerned …. history into something challenging and conflictual,'30<br />
<br />
Liberation theology ensures cycles of violence and continued oppression—it has abandoned the notion of shared love in politics which means it can no longer achieve an end to conflict<br />
Daniel M. Bell, Assistant Professor of Theological Ethics at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Liberation Theology After the End of History, 2001<br />
Prominent among these is the fact that justice, as … hiring the poor to kill the poor, and so forth.<br />
<br />
Liberation theology leads to cycles of violence because it accepts violence is possible, leads to the oppressed becoming the oppressor, and pits groups against each other<br />
Daniel M. Bell, Assistant Professor of Theological Ethics at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Liberation Theology After the End of History, 2001<br />
The extent of justice's inability to resolve conflict goes … threatened by the pull of competing visions of the good.<br />
<br />
Liberation theology’s conception of justice prevent it from truly changing the desire of people—by viewing justice as the guarding of rights they lack a corporate view of justice which is key to uniting change and their view that justice is the obtaining of rights for the oppressed makes their view compatible with capitalist domination <br />
Daniel M. Bell, Assistant Professor of Theological Ethics at the Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, Liberation Theology After the End of History, 2001<br />
As we have seen, the liberationists' conception of … there is “no hierarchy among singularities” (259).<br />

 Plan flaw- the aff literally does nothing: the aff provides EB visas to those who serve in the military or get a degree- BUT doing either one of those requires a provisional visa. The aff doesn’t provide provisional visas to aliens living in the US, that’s a different section of the AgJobs bill that the aff doesn’t cite- the impact is no-one who could potentially benefit from the plan is eligible, since it would be illegal for them to meet the requirements.

–verb (used with object)<br />
1.<br />
to make greater, as in number, size, strength, or quality;augment; add to: to increase taxes.<br />
B. Violation – AFF raises a cap instead of increasing the existing number of visas – this violates ‘increase’ in the resolution AND is not an on face increase – they have to prove demand above and beyond the current cap now and forever or they aren’t substantial.<br />
C. Vote neg.<br />
1. Ground – Any kind of disads or counterplans related to a specific number of visas are impossible under their interpretation. Providing no number is effectively providing every number. This allows the aff to shift out of negative arguments by simply making claims about how many visas will be used at any point in time.<br />
2. Precision - our interpretation gives meaning to the words ‘increase’ and ‘number’- each word in the resolution must have value and if they don’t meet part, they don’t meet any.<br />
3. Education – their interpretation kills critical thinking - finding a specific number and defending it is far more educational than a non-amount that can float to be whatever they need at the time.<br />
Independently, not specifying the number amount they raise the cap to is a voter,<br />
1. Moving target – substantial can be defined as anything, the aff can redefine their number based on substantial to answer disads differently, making no negative strategy compete.<br />
<br />
2. No solvency means you default negative- This is the one instance in which the elmore card is actually relevant<br />
Elmore, 80<br />
(Richard F., “Backward Mapping: Implementation Research and Policy Decisions,” Political Science Quarterly 94, No. 4 Winter 79-80, p. 605)<br />
Analysis of policy choices matters very little if … in the realm of implementation.<br />

3. Ground – eliminates core counterplan ground that competes off of raising the cap to a different number-a key generic strategy at the beginning of the year<br />

Violation- The affirmative removes an admissibility requirement which is distinct from an expansion of eligibility.<br />
<br />
C. STANDARDS<br />
1. Limits. Our Interpretation limits out an infinite number of cases that merely change the admissibility requirements for visas exploding the neg research burden killing fairness<br />
2. Ground. Takes away the best ground on the topic by forcing the neg to defend current policy as opposed to negating the positive expansion of eligibility<br />
3. Extratopicality. The USCIS lists visa name-number categories according to the 4 groups in the topic. If the aff grows one of those government-listed categories, they are topical. Their interpretation would allow them to remove admissibility standards that relate of any category of visa. This is extratopical, and makes it impossible for the judge to make an objective determination of jurisdiction, which is unfair to both sides.<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and communication. It’s a game of competing interpretations.<br />

 A. Interpretation: Debate should be a site for contest over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a resolutional plan of action for the United States federal government to reform visa policy and defend that their policy should be adopted.<br />

<br />
C. Violation –<br />
1. The affirmative fails to defend the consequences of implementation of a plan carried out by the United States federal government to reform visa policy.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Reasons to Prefer<br />
Resolution centered debate is critical to a fair debate – it’s a voting issue.<br />
<br />
1. Predictability-<br />
A. the resolution sets the topic for discussion- allowing the aff to choose their ground outside of the resolution makes it impossible for the negative to engage the affirmative. There are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies unrelated to the topic which are impossible to predict- this leaves the negative unprepared to debate<br />
<br />
B. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, enabling the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground<br />
<br />
C. The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion<br />
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 181-2)<br />
The requirements given thus far are ... rests on some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
Two impacts- first, unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that allows us to critically examine their approach- this prevents informed clash which outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously examining it.<br />
The second impact is the possibility of change-the aff destroys possibility of political change by not allowing interlocutors to join the debate and buy into the affirmative’s political project. The criticism demonstrates the opportunity cost of engaging in the conversation over race in a certain way- they created the material conditions of a conversation framed in an adversarial format.<br />
<br />
2. Education -<br />
A. policy options are key to real world education about possible reforms- their framework devastates learning about the real world with reciprocal and clear deliberation about the merits of an idea<br />
<br />
B. Topical Education—by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government. Their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism<br />
Martin W. Lewis, Professor of Geography and Regional Science at George Washington University, 1992 (Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism. Page 247)<br />
A majority of those born between ... in fascism, regardless of their instructors’ intentions.<br />
<br />
C. Implementation- the aff will always win the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract- we can only debate the merits of arguments if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Harvard Carr Center for Human Rights Policy director and human rights practices professor, 04 (The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror, 20-21)<br />
There are two problems with ... might lead us to betray another.<br />
<br />
D. Informed Citizens - Fiat is key to being informed citizens, without it we never learn about the political process and don’t take responsibility for the possible bad outcomes of our actions. Simulating policy solves all their offense, allowing people a safe space to test new ideas<br />
Christopher C. Joyner, Professor of International Law in the Government Department at Georgetown University, Spring 1999 (Teaching International Law: Views From An International Relations Political Scientist, 5 ILSA J Int'l &amp; Comp L 377)<br />
Use of the debate can be an... critique, and legal defense.<br />
<br />
E. Our framework is critical to challenge fundamentalism and orthodoxy- it’s a progressive challenge to security politics<br />
English et al, Schenley Park Debate Authors Working Group scholar, 7<br />
(Eric, Stephen Lano, Gordon Mitchell, University of Pittsburg communications professor, Catherine Morrison, John Reif, and Carly Woods, “Debate as a Weapon of Mass Destruction,” June 2007, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/EnglishDAWG.pdf) atw<br />
It is our position, however, that rather than acting as a … orthodoxy, and reflexivity in the face of fundamentalism.<br />
<br />
F. It’s necessary to learn the language and the real-world functions of the state in order to transform it<br />
Lutz, Prof PolSci U of Huston, 2k<br />

 The culture of fear is a product of liberalism that finds its culmination in the fear of death. This culture of fear sustains the politics of being-for-death which creates the very insecurity and perpetual war the affirmative attempts to solve. Just like the call to &quot;die for God/9 the call to &quot;die for nothing&quot; defines life in relation to death which gives death permanence and traps us in the politics of being-for-death.<br />
Daniel M. Bell, Jr., Associate Professor of Theological Ethics, Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, 2007<br />
(Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory, &quot;The Politics of Fear and The Gospel of Life,&quot; JCRT 8.2 SPRING 2007 55,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jcrt.org/archives/08.2/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrt.org/archives/08.2/</a>) mph<br />
Thus, as we examine the culture of fear… necessity of sacrifice and suffering.<br />
<br />
We advocate that the judge vote for the neg to create a space for a new political order. That political order is affirmed through the politics of being-for-life found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The truth-event of the resurrection is a radical act of affirmation that denies death meaning and ruptures the politics we have critiqued. Our ethic replaces the logic of reductive sacrifice (in the name of God or people) with the relentless affirmation of life that overcomes the politics of fear and allows ceaseless giving in the face of terror.<br />
Bell 07<br />

Hence, the commonplace reading is …, in expectation only of the gain that is filiation and communion
