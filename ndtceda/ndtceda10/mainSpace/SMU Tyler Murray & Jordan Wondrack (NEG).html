 Social norms do not exist separate from a declaration of sovereignty. Modern rationality’s calculation of means and ends is insufficient to give relative value to particular ends over others. The sovereign decision regarding the state of exception from outside the legal system is necessary to unify the popular behind a definitive norm and maintain political existence. The state provides a performative space from which to articulare these values.<br />
William Rasch, Assoc. Prof of Germanic Studies @ Indian Univ., 2000 Conflict as a vVocation: Carl Scmitt and the Possibility of Politics, Theory Culutre &amp; Socierty, SAGE: London, Vol. 12(6) 1-32<br />
To rescue the political ... existence of the state all together<br />
<br />
You should frame others as enemies – the impact to our turn is the destruction of the political and unsurpassed violence on a global scale<br />
Rienhard, UCLA, Jewish Studies, 200r (Kenneth, “Towards a Pokitical theology Of the Neighbor”) <br />
If the concept of . . . they would be identifiable”<br />

Alternative – Schmitt’s Distinction between friend and enemy is solely based in physical existential threats to oneself. Your affirmative is solved by the alternative – the personal decisions and differences based in sexuality are better addressed by the alternative because it makes distinction of friend and enemy based on physical threats.<br />
Frye, CE (1966) “Carl Schmitt’s Concept of the Political” The Journal of Politics (0022-3816) 28 (4) p 818 <br />
In considering his concept … all human situations – death.<br />

<h1 id="toc1"><a name="Human Rights K"></a>Human Rights K</h1>
 Human rights are nothing more than mythical creatures called to create a vision of a better humanity – however – these demands let the subject close their eyes to the violence tied to the use of law and paralysis our questioning of human rights<br />
Louis E. Wolcher, Prof of Law, U of Washington School of Law, The Paradox of Remedies: The Case of International Human Rights Law, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 2K<br />
I believe that good… any respect as a means<br />
<br />
Moreover, it is impossible for the subjective to use calls for absolutes to prevent violence  <br />
Louis E. Wolcher, Prof of Law, U of Washington School of Law, The Paradox of Remedies: The Case of International Human Rights Law, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 2K<br />
Now a widespread belief… for good or for ill.<br />
<br />
The easy case the disjoint between action and text – ignoring violence inherent in the law.<br />
We offer the following alternative – human rights are the easy case – the case that subject knows the answer before the question is even posed – out alternative is to expose the disjoint between action and text that is obscured by “The easy case”<br />
