<strong>Contention One: Inherency</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The US is losing its competitive edge – baby boom retirement and a failing education system will put the US behind many global competitors</strong><br />

<u>America rose to global economic … economy over the next decade.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>And, Home countries as well as other rising powers are challenging the US – Current restrictions on H-1B visas are preventing highly skilled workers and graduates from coming to the US</strong><br />

<strong>Plan: The United States federal government should remove the cap on H-1B visas.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention Two: Competitiveness</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The H-1B visa cap kills competitiveness – it makes it impossible for graduates to get a job and remain in the US and disincentivizes further enrollment in US universities – we lose highly skilled workers and future innovation which is key</strong><br />

<strong>Attracting students is critical to allow the US to compete in the changing ‘Creative Economy’ – H-1B visas are the best tool to secure the ‘Creative Class’ a spot in the job market</strong><br />
