A. Interpretation – Increasing the number of visas is raising the cap – exempting allows different individuals to not count against it <br />
San Jose Mercury News, ‘99 <br />
(“High Tech Visa Cap Should Not Rise Yet,” 8-10-99, provided through Adversity.net, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.adversity.net/special/immig_h1b.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.adversity.net/special/immig_h1b.htm</a></span>, accessed 10-26-10) PM <br />

<br />
B. Violation – the aff doesn’t increase the number of visas, just exempts a certain group. <br />
<br />
C. Standards – <br />
1. Predictable limits – no way the neg can predict which tiny group they can exempt from the cap – makes the neg research burden enormous and kills fairness. Holding them to raising the cap solves all their offense and allows the neg to predict their aff <br />
2. Specificity – allowing them to get their specific exemptions forces the neg to generic links because we can’t predict everyone they exempt. Infinite prep means they’ll have specific link turns that we can’t beat – makes it impossible to be neg. <br />
<br />
D. Topicality is a voter for fairness and education. Evaluate through competing interpretations – it’s key to prevent arbitrary reasonability and judge intervention.<br />

 Text: <br />
The United States federal government should lower the cap no H-1B visas to zero<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer provisional visas to all those who qualify to receive current H-1B visas. The number should be equivalent to a lifting of the cap on H-1B visas. A worker with a provisional visa would be admitted to the United States for three years, and could renew his or her visa one time by demonstrating payment of all direct and indirect taxes; the maintenance of a clean criminal record; and acquisition of English language ability during the initial visa period. At the end of the second period the worker would have the option to transition to permanent status by applying for an available green card, without employer sponsorship. Twelve months after the worker initially took up employment, the visa would be portable, allowing him or her to change employers without applying for a new visa.<br />
<br />
Provisional visas solve the entirety of the case and avoid our disads – they are more attractive to the best and brightest international workers without the flaws of H1B’s<br />

 Text: <br />
The United States federal government should lower the cap on its H-1B visas to zero<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer provisional visas to all those eligible for current H-1B visas with “advanced degrees” as defined by current H-1B policy. The number should be equivalent to a removing the numerical limitations on the “advanced degree” exemption for the H-1B visa. A worker with a provisional visa would be admitted to the United States for three years, and could renew his or her visa one time by demonstrating payment of all direct and indirect taxes; the maintenance of a clean criminal record; and acquisition of English language ability during the initial visa period. At the end of the second period the worker would have the option to transition to permanent status by applying for an available green card, without employer sponsorship. Twelve months after the worker initially took up employment, the visa would be portable, allowing him or her to change employers without applying for a new visa.<br />
<br />
Contention 1 is competition – the counterplan competes via lowering the cap and the disads as net benefits<br />
Contention 2 is solvency <br />
Provisional visas solve the entirety of the case and avoid our disads – they are more attractive to the best and brightest international workers without the flaws of H1B’s<br />
