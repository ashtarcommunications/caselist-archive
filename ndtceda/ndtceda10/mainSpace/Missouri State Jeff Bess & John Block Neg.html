Alt: refuse to categorize immigrants. Instead, we should embrace the particularity of each individual.<br />
This is a necessary interruption into the discourse of immigration that attempts to divide the population into the worthy and the unworthy. Instead we should accept that each particular person is valuable and important – we don’t need visas to divide us up.<br />

Our method should center the imposition of work for capital accumulation – this starting point allows us to better access immigration and the case impacts in order to make life meaningful – particular mechanisms of labor management like visas are best understood as countermoves within this struggle<br />

Their focus on the atrocities that the government creates because of things like subsidies ignores and trades off with recognizing our own personal complicity with violence. Only by refusing to make statements like “the United States Federal Government should” allows us to transform our own personal will to violence that is the root of their impacts<br />

Their attempt to sidestep the costs and benefits of policy implementation is the link – it demonstrates their orientation toward their project lacks seriousness<br />

Politics is about ends and means...society in which these activists live.<br />
<br />
Their activist reaction to deliberation lacks epistemic modesty – it engages in a form of knowledge production which replicates injustice<br />

That Young’s activist is not reasonable...Insofar as the activist denies this, he is unreasonable.<br />
