All claims to knowledge beg the question<br />

The considerations that Sextus relies on in supporting (4) are systematized in the five modes of Agrippa. We can see that the dialectical interpretation also fits very well with how they work. According to Sextus, every object of investigation can be brought under the following five modes: According to the mode deriving from dispute, we find that undecidable dissension about the matter proposed has come about both in ordinary life and among philosophers. Because of this we are not able either to choose or to rule out anything, and we end up with suspension of judgement. In the mode deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such source, which itself needs another, and so on ad infinitum, so that we have no point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgement follows. In the mode deriving from relativity, as we said above, the existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to the subject judging and to the things observed together with it, but we suspend judgment on what it is like in its nature. We have the mode from hypothesis when the Dogmatists, being thrown back ad infinitum, begin from something which they do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a concession. The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object under investigation; then being unable to take either in order to establish the other, we suspend judgement about both. Sextus describes here fives mode that are supposed to induce suspension of judgment about any object of inquiry. We may call them the modes of (1) disagreement, (2) infinite regress, (3) relativity, (4) hypothesis, and (5) circularity. It is not clear how they are to be understood. Usually they are thought to work together: the modes of disagreement and relativity challenge us to justify our beliefs by revealing that there are competing claims about the matter, and then the rest of the modes show that the process of justification cannot be completed in satisfactory way. All attempts to justify a belief lead either to an infinite regress, an arbitrary assumption, or circularity. Often the challenge modes are seen to be unnecessary because the skeptic is thought to assume implicitly that our concept of justification requires noncircular and nonarbitrary reasons. So the three modes of infinite regress, hypothesis, and circularity – the so-called Agrippa’s trilemma – alone form the problem that can be identified with the regress argument against the possibility of justified beliefs.<br />

This lack of objective knowledge means there is no basis for any claims, including life being superior to death – all preferences and beliefs are arbitrary without a solid grounding<br />
Mitchell Heisman 2010 (The Suicide Note: An Experiment in Nihilism, BA in Psychology from U of Albany, written in consultation with professors Dershowitz and Pinker of Harvard University)<br />
The following is an experiment in nihilism. Already I have contradicted myself! How can one believe in disbelief? I might be a nihilist except that I don’t believe in anything. If there is no extant God and no extant gods, no good and no evil, no right and no wrong, no meaning and no purpose; if there are no values that are inherently valuable; no justice that is ultimately justifiable; no reasoning that is fundamentally rational, then there is no sane way to choose between science, religion, racism, philosophy, nationalism, art, conservatism, nihilism, liberalism, surrealism, fascism, asceticism, egalitarianism, subjectivism, elitism, ismism. If reason is incapable of deducing ultimate, nonarbitrary human ends, and nothing can be judged as ultimately more important than anything else, then freedom is equal to slavery; cruelty is equal to kindness; love is equal to hate; war is equal to peace; dignity is equal to contempt; destruction is equal to creation; life is equal to death and death is equal to life. “For why has the advent of nihilism become necessary?”, asked Friedrich Nietzsche: Because the values we have had hitherto thus draw their final consequence; because nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals—because we must experience nihilism before we can find out what value these “values” really had.3 Was Nietzsche right? An absurd question that constitutes the crisis of an internally collapsed Western civilization. In the words of Leo Strauss: The crisis of modernity reveals itself in the fact, or consists in the fact, that modern western man no longer knows what he wants—that he no longer believes that he can know what is good and bad, what is right and wrong. Until a few generations ago, it was generally taken for granted that man can know what is right and wrong, what is the just or the good or the best order of society—in a word that political philosophy is possible and necessary. In our time this faith has lost its power….Above all, as is generally admitted, modern culture is emphatically rationalistic, believing in the power of reason; surely if such a culture loses its faith in reason’s ability to validate its highest aims, it is in a crisis.4 Uncertain of uncertainty, skeptical of skepticism, it seems that the most important question is whether there is an important question. The only serious question is whether there is anything to take seriously. What has previously been considered of value or importance appears as only an expression of myth, bias…error.<br />

All our arguments are made within the framework of knowledge, not because we endorse it, but to show inconsistencies and the equal validity of opposite conclusions.<br />

Does the skeptic believe, dogmatically, that a criterion (for example) should not be trusted if its sole support is an infinite regress? This is a question dogmatists have long asked. Does the skeptic believe that circular reasoning is fallacious in the sense that it should not be trusted? Does the skeptic have a dogmatic belief in the tropes? The answer is no. Infuriatingly to many, skeptics do not affirm or deny the soundness of the arguments they use to dissect dogmas (I.35). As the examples show, skeptics need not believe that proofs by circular reasoning or infinite regress are invalid; they need only observe that such methods allow equipollent support for contrary conclusions. A criterion supported solely by self-validation or by the stipulation of proponents is not to be trusted. But the reason is not that self-justification and the ipse dixit of the faithful are knowably untrustworthy; it is that the criterion's support would then be equipollent to that for conflicting criteria. It might be the true criterion (for the tropes do not falsify), but isosthenia obtains with its contraries (II.79, II.103, II.130). The intellectually honest must suspend judgment. Skeptics neither affirm nor deny that they have understood the dogmatist's position (II.1ff), that the tropes have eroded the claim of his dogmas to truth, or even that the tropes themselves are to be trusted (I.35). In an important sense the skeptic never speaks for herself, which might require some dogmatic commitments on her part. She enters the world of the dogmatist and explodes it from within. This is sometimes called arguing (or speaking) ex concessis or by concession. When one argues ex concessis one hypothetically or provisionally adopts the premises of the opponent. The skeptic provisionally adopts the principles and criteria and standpoint of the dogmatist. If she finds a contradiction, she points it out, not because she believes contradictions falsify ideas, but because the dogmatist believes they do. If she reduces the criterion or the method to a begged question or an infinite regress, it is not because she believes these will undermine the theory, but because by the dogmatist's standards they will. When she is not arguing ex concessis the skeptic juxtaposes conflicting theories and finds isosthenia. The skeptic speaks for herself only when she is finished applying the tropes and surveys the ruins. Then she says the dogma may be true, but it is not more certain or more likely to be true than the alternatives. She has established equipollence by making the theories on a particular question equally uncertain and unfounded. Then she says, &quot;At the moment I do not personally know which, if any, are true, so my inquiry is not over yet.&quot;<br />
Good is not good enough –ignoring skeptical questions for being too difficult to answer makes for the worst kinds of arrogance.<br />
Peter Suber 96 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm</a>) Suber was a professor of philosophy at Earlham College for 20 years<br />
But the skeptic has a legitimate fear of that ever happening. For she realizes that all firm beliefs are believed to be true even if they are false. As Peirce put it, &quot;we think each of our beliefs to be true, and, indeed, it is a mere tautology to say so.&quot;[Note 21] She worries, in short, that certainty is a sign of foolishness.[Note 22] She realizes, or fears, that after a lapse, no matter how much easier or more tranquil her life would become, and no matter how many truths she would finally affirm, she would not be able to tell the difference between a true belief and a false belief if the beliefs were her own and firmly fixed. Once fixed, a belief will use itself to interpret the evidence, color her judgment, and structure (or filter) the rest of her experience, even if the belief is false or incomplete.[Note 23] Others may be able to tell which of our fixed beliefs are false, but to the believer they are by definition truths no longer open, or at least no longer easy, to question. In short, certitude cures doubt, not ignorance. And with doubt conquered, ignorance is invincible. So skeptics dread attaining mere certitude or conviction, fearing it will (or could) mask its falsehood behind their enthusiasm. The possibility of error is not overcome by merely psychological conviction; it is hidden and buried by it. The skeptic wants to know the truth with certainty. She wants to stop being a skeptic, but does not want to believe blindly. Unlike the drunkard who knows that drinking solves no problems, but reconciles one to them unsolved, the skeptic fears to become satisfied with second-best. She wants to put an end to her skepticism in such a way that the dreaded possibility of error is rooted out, known to be conquered, and answered with finality, not simply submerged and forgotten or made to seem innocuous. As Benson Mates put it, &quot;we do not want merely to 'get over' [skepticism], whether by a natural deterioration or by some sort of therapy or 'treatment'. On the contrary, we require a more or less rational explanation of exactly where and how the skeptical train of thought goes wrong.&quot;[Note 24] The person in whom doubt is suppressed rather than answered makes the worst sort of dogmatist. The person who disregards the possibility of error or downplays its threat is the most heedless of the challenge of skepticism, the least humble in conviction, and perhaps the most blind to possibilities of disaster —and as W.K. Clifford would add, the most immoral, the most heedless of the moral consequences of credulity. <br />
<br />
Even if they win knowledge is possible, having experienced a skeptical attitude is the best way to teach good decision-making skills.<br />

Some commentators who think skepticism is refutable, like Descartes and Spinoza, and others who think it can be outgrown, like Nicholas of Cusa, Hume, and Margaret Wiley, say the natural escape from skepticism is dogmatism. Skepticism is a valuable preparation to good and honest commitment because it teaches impartiality, eliminates false starts, and disciplines the intellect. Deliberate use of skepticism to purge and improve or establish some dogmatism is often called methodological skepticism. Descartes used skepticism, or something much like it, to clear the boards of all dubitable opinions in order to find one idea he could not doubt. Then he dogmatized freely on that basis of that supposed certainty. Aenesidemus believed that the skeptical position that contraries apparently inhere in objects led to the Heraclitean position that they actually inhere in objects. Similarly, Margaret Wiley believes that the skeptical practice of affirming neither of two contraries leads, through the stages of dualism and paradox, to the mystical position of affirming both (cf. I.210). Edmund Spenser and Ralph Waldo Emerson are two of her many examples. For her and Aenesidemus, skepticism is the preparation for mystical religion.[Note 25] For Joseph Glanvill and W.K. Clifford skepticism is the preparation for science. For Hegel it is the preparation for the transition from one inadequate dogma to a more adequate (but still inadequate) dogma.[Note 26] For Kant it assists dogmatic methods in solving problems.[Note 27] For many commentators on (and allies of) Socrates, skepticism is the preparation for all change and progress, for personal enlightenment and social, political, religious, and scientific revolution. For others like Bertrand Russell it is the preparation for the always useful clear head and unbiased judgment.<br />
<br />
Thus we accept that anything may be true.<br />
The aff is a proposition which puts us into a dialectic about the possibility of knowledge, unable to decide and resulting in bliss. This is an issue of how you relate to knowledge.<br />
Markus Lammenranta 08 (“The Pyrrhonian Problematic,” in The Oxford Handbook of Skepticism, p. 13-14) Lammenranta is professor of philosophy at the University of Helsinki.<br />
Sextus starts his Outlines of Scepticism by distinguishing three kinds of outcomes that any inquiry may have: (1) it may result in discovery, (2) it may result in the denial of discovery and the confession that the truth cannot be discovered, (3) or it may just continue. According to Sextus, there are three kinds of philosophers corresponding to these outcomes: (1) the dogmatists think that they have discovered the truth, (2) the Academics think that the truth cannot be discovered, and (3) the skeptics continue inquiry. If discovering the truth amounts to knowing the truth, we can say that the dogmatists think that they know the truth, the Academics deny the possibility of knowledge, and the skeptics suspend judgment both about their actually knowing anything and about the possibility of knowledge. Here Sextus want to distinguish real skepticism – Pyrrhonism – from Academic skepticism. The latter is itself one sort of dogmatism – negative dogmatism – because it defends the dogma that nothing can be known. Presumably, this negative thesis is based on a positive epistemology: nothing can be known because the conditions of knowledge put forth by this epistemology cannot be satisfied. So both dogmatists and Academics need an epistemology: the former need it for defending their knowledge claims, and the latter for defending their claim about the impossibility of knowledge. Sextus ignores here the fact that the skeptics in Plato’s Academy typically argue ad hominem: they use their opponents’, the Stoics’, epistemology to argue against it. Yet the message is clear. The Pyrrhonist neither needs nor possesses any epistemology. She suspends judgment about both the nature and the possibility of knowledge. So her suspension of judgment is not based on any theory or epistemological thesis, such as infinitism. It is based rather on her inability to resolve disagreements among different dogmatists – including the disagreement about the possibility of knowledge. This is how Sextus describes the way one becomes a skeptic: Sceptics began to do philosophy in order to decide among appearances and to apprehend which are true and which false, so as to become tranquil; but they came upon equipollent dispute, and being unable to decide this they suspended judgement. And when they suspended judgement, tranquility in matters of opinion followed fortuitously. According to Sextus, the skeptics were originally inquirers who were seeking truth, but who realized that there were disagreements about truth that they could not resolve. They were therefore forced to suspend judgment. To their surprise, they achieved in this way the tranquility to which they originally aspired by trying to find the truth.<br />
<br />
You shouldn’t fear this indeterminacy – it is only the modernist mindset that says uncertainty is bad. Instead, we should trust the Pyrrhonists’ accounts of serenity.<br />
Peter Suber 96 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/skept.htm</a>) Suber was a professor of philosophy at Earlham College for 20 years<br />
What has worried some very honest dogmatists, however, is the usual result of this humble beginning. To adopt these practices of the skeptic may seem the very duty of all philosophers and scientists and inquirers of all kinds, and many have said so. But many dogmatists would like to write over this path the warning that Dante found inscribed over the gateway to Hell, &quot;Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here&quot;. For it happens that the Pyrrhonean skeptics end up believing nothing at all except that appearances appear (I.19) —which may not even be a belief. Sometimes they even appear to suspend judgment on whether appearances appear (II.50, II.70), but in any case say that only mental states are apprehended (I.215, II.72). They do not quarrel with appearances themselves, but only with the accounts given of appearances (I.15, I.19, I.22, I.59, I.78, I.87, I.93, etc.). And it just happens that they suspend judgment on (because they have found equipollence for) each and every account —interpretation and explanation— of appearances. We should probably take the word of the ancients that this led them to a profound peace of mind. It has not done so for moderns. Something has changed in our intellectual and cultural circumstances, and this radical learned ignorance has led modern thinkers, at least since Pascal in the 17th century, to despair. Of all the changes in the spirit of the times one of the most indicative is that the uncertainty of things, which skeptics make their business, is no longer a matter for mere observation, but for lamentation. It no longer soothes us to abandon ourselves to it. Instead of serenity it produces anxiety; it is not quietude but loss, not purgation but incompleteness. <br />
Pyrrhonism’s suspension of belief isn’t a final result; it’s the constant process of questioning our beliefs as they appear<br />
David R. Hiley 87 (“The Deep Challenge of Pyrrhonian Scepticism, Journal of the History of Philosophy, Volume 25, Number 2, April 1987, pp. 185-213, Published by The Johns Hopkins University Press) Hiley is a professor of Philosophy at the University of New Hampshire<br />
Though Hume defined belief in terms of the manner of its conception, the Pyrrhonists meant something quite different when they sought to suspend belief through the deployment of sceptical strategies. To have a belief was to assent to the truth of the propositional content of an idea. Thus a belief was more than a lively appearance. It was an account of the appearance to the effect that what appeared was true. Sextus made the point explicitly: &quot;We do not overthrow the affective sense-impressions which induce our assent involuntarily; and these impressions are 'the appearances'. And when we question whether the underlying object is such as it appears, we grant the fact that it appears, and our doubt does not concern the appearance itself but the account given of that appearance&quot; (Outlines, 15). If what Hume meant by claiming that Nature compels us to judge was that we are naturally disposed to philosophy--to assert the truth or reality beyond what appears-- the Pyrrhonists can agree, adding that it is because we are naturally disposed to philosophical investigation that sceptical strategies must continually be deployed to resist the temptation and to restore tranquillity. Epochs will not be acheived once and for all because there will always be new temptations and new beliefs to oppose by counterarguments. For the Pyrrhonist, there was always work to be done.<br />
<br />
Suspension of belief doesn’t mean never acting, just acting as things appear in the here and now<br />
David R. Hiley 87 (“The Deep Challenge of Pyrrhonian Scepticism, Journal of the History of Philosophy, Volume 25, Number 2, April 1987, pp. 185-213, Published by The Johns Hopkins University Press) Hiley is a professor of Philosophy at the University of New Hampshire<br />
There are three distinguishable arguments in these passages. The first involved Hume's assumption like the assumption about Pyrrho that Montaigne had recounted with such puzzlement--that the sceptic's suspense of judgment entailed a suspense of action. In this argument, however, Hume had simply misunderstood the force of Pyrrhonism by failing to recognize that instead of urging or resulting in life of inactivity, the Pyrrhonian instead urged, as a consequence of his scepticism, that one act in conformity with the appearance of things and with custom. I have attempted to make clear above that the conservative thrust of Pyrrhonism for practical affairs is integral to the sceptical activity. Hume simply failed to take account of this aspect of Pyrrhonism. <br />

Passing judgment results in spiritual confusion and creates political action that cannot succeed. Instead, you should accept life as it is<br />
Slabbert, Taoist teacher and philosopher, 2001<br />
(Jos, “Tao Te Ching: How to Deal With Suffering,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.taoism.net/theway/suffer.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.taoism.net/theway/suffer.htm</a>)<br />
We easily become victims of our own discriminatory faculties, which are closely linked to desire. We desire because we discriminate in terms of what we observe to be quality and beauty, or desirable and undesirable. We are then easily driven by our own ideas of what should be rejected, and what is desirable and should be obtained. It turns life into a quest for material gain, and our relationships become a selective process often driven by lust and a desire for status. But is this a form of suffering? Many would argue it is not. It is in fact the spice of life, they would claim. It gives life meaning, they would insist. They would argue that there must be a reason why consumerism has become such an obsession in the modern world. Do not be fooled by this. This preoccupation with possession, manipulation and exploitation is a symptom of spiritual confusion, in fact an acute form of suffering. Like hungry ghosts, people are trying to satisfy the insatiable. They are driven by their greed, and can never be satisfied, and they never find rest. They are like creatures trying to quench their thirst with salt water. The more they drink, the thirstier they become. Their suffering is acute, no matter how happy they pretend to be. There is a solution to this. Cease being run by your discriminatory faculties. Only then will the essential tolerance on a spiritual level be possible. Quite simply accept life as it is. Be like a child. The world is the way you see it. If you see it as full of innocence and beauty, it will be full of innocence and beauty. It does not mean that you deny the presence of ugliness and evil in the world. No, you just refuse to focus mainly on the gloomy side and do not give it a chance to change your perspectives and darken your own spirit. You do not have to search for meaning. Just get rid of your negative thoughts. The meaning of life is life itself. Live it. In this way, you will fill the world with beauty and meaning. It is more powerful than any political program. <br />

Truth is intrinsically good<br />
Michael P. Lynch 04 (“True to life: Why Truth Matters,” MIT Press, p. 15-19) Lynch is a professor of philosophy at the University of Connecticut.<br />
Science-fiction scenarios like this are popular partly because in thinking about what we would do in such imaginary situations, we figure out what we care about. As I'll show more fully in a moment, reflecting on these sorts of situations, at least for most of us, suggests that we care about the truth for more than just the benefits it brings us. Of course, we don't necessarily need science fiction to tell us this. There are times in all of our lives when we simply want to know for no other reason than the knowing itself. Curiosity is not always motivated by practical concerns. Consider extremely abstract mathematical conjectures. With regard to at least some such conjectures, knowing their truth would get us no closer to anything else we want. Nonetheless, if we were forced to choose between believing truly or falsely about the matter, we would prefer, at least to some tiny degree, the former. If we have to guess, we prefer to guess correctly. And of course, we sometimes care about the truth despite extremely impractical consequences. People often wish to know the truth about a spouse's infidelity even when there is an excellent chance that nothing productive will come of it. Similarly, many people wish to know when they are dying of an untreatable disease, even if they can do nothing to prevent it, and even if that knowledge has no practical value for their actual state of health. The fact that we value truth for its own sake doesn't mean we don't also value it as a means to other ends. Indeed, the most obvious reason to pursue true beliefs is that believing the truth can get us all sorts of other things we want. Believing the truth is practically advantageous. Imagine crossing the street; looking both ways, you try to estimate the speed of approaching traffic. In making this and countless other decisions, you need to get it right. Otherwise bad things will happen, like getting run over by a bus. Believing the truth is valuable because it is a means to other ends—sturdy bridges, cures for diseases, and safety. We can sum this up by saying that truth is instrumentally good. Many of the things we aim at in life, from money to legible handwriting, are only instrumentally good. We care about them not for their own sake but for what they can do for us. Most of us believe dollar bills are like this. Having dollars is good, no doubt, but only as a means to getting other things—a house, food, clothes, and the like. There is nothing valuable about the paper itself. Something is normative if it is worthy of aiming at, or caring about. But something is deeply normative, or a value properly so-called, when it is worthy of caring about for its own sake. Love is arguably like this. Being in love with someone isn't good only as a means to other things. No doubt, it can lead to other goods (sex, contentment, a richer life, etc.), but that is clearly not the' whole story. People value love even when it is highly impractical, or even detrimental to their pursuit of other ends. Love is worth caring about for its own sake. Indeed, to love someone just because it gets you something you want arguably means that you don't really love him or her at all. So one way of thinking about our fourth truism about truth is that truth is more like love than money. We—or at least most of us—care about truth, at least sometimes, for more than instrumental reasons. Truth is deeply normative; it is worth caring about for its own sake. Of our four truisms about truth, this is perhaps the most contentious. Yet as I noted earlier, thinking about certain hypothetical situations can help you figure out whether you believe it. So let's think more carefully about the sort of imaginary situation I mentioned at the beginning of this section. In thinking about our reactions to such situations and what those reactions show, it will be helpful to proceed in steps. The first step is to see whether we have what I'll call a basic preference for the truth. By a &quot;basic preference&quot; I mean a preference for something that can't be explained by our preference for other things. Avoidance of pain is perhaps a basic preference; preference for money is not. If truth was not a basic preference, then if I had two beliefs B1 and B2 with identical instrumental value, I should not prefer to believe B1 rather than B2. The considerations above already point to the fact that this isn't so, however. In particular, if we didn't have a basic preference for the truth, it would be hard to explain why we find the prospect of being undetectably wrong so disturbing. Think about a modification of the experience-machine scenario we began with. Some super neuroscientists give you the choice between continuing to live normally, or having your brain hooked up to a supercomputer that will make it seem as if you are continuing to live normally (even though you're really just floating in a vat somewhere). When in the vat, you will continue to have all the same experiences you would have in the real world. Because of this, you would believe that you are reading a book, that you are hungry, and so on. In short, your beliefs and experiences will be the same, but most of your beliefs will be false. If we didn't really prefer true beliefs to false ones, we would be simply ambivalent about this choice. Vat, no vat; who cares? But we don't say this. We don't want to live in the vat, even though doing so would make no difference to what we experience or believe. This suggests that we have a basic preference for truth. Some may protest that we want more than mere experiences out of life, and it is this fact—-not any preference for truth—that makes us prefer the real world over the vat. So consider another scenario, one dreamed up by Bertrand Russell. Suppose that, unbeknownst to us, the world began yesterday—it seems older, but it isn't. If I really lived in a Russell world, as I'll call it, almost all my beliefs about the past would be false. Yet my desires would be equally satisfied in both worlds.5 This is because the future of both worlds unfolds in exactly the same way. If I believe truly in the actual world that if I open the refrigerator I'll get a beer, then I'll get a beer if I open the refrigerator. Since events in the Russell world are just the same as in the actual world once it begins ticking along, I will also get that beer in the Russell world if I open the refrigerator, even if (in the Russell world) I believe falsely that I put it there yesterday. In other words, whatever plans I accomplish now, I would also accomplish if the world had begun yesterday, despite the fact that in that case, my plans would be based on false beliefs about the past. Yet, given the choice between living in the actual world and living in a Russell world, I strongly prefer the actual world. Of course, once &quot;inside&quot; that world, I wouldn't see any difference between it and the real world; in both worlds, after all, events crank along in the same way. But that is beside the point. For the fact remains that thinking about the worlds only insofar as they are identical in instrumental value, there is difference right now between the two worlds that matters to me. Even when it has no effect on my other preferences, I—and presumably you as well—prefer true beliefs to false ones.<br />
<br />
You should evaluate skepticism in a modernist epistemology before adopting ours. This is key to a dialectic <br />
Lawrence Sklar 1975 (“Methodological Conservatism,” The Philosophical Review, Vol. 84, No. 3 (Jul., 1975), pp. 374-400) Sklar is a distinguished professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan.<br />
Instead, it is argued, we must realize that all justification is &quot;local.&quot; We justify the beliefs we take to be in need of justification &quot;one at a time,&quot; using all the resources of our unchallenged background belief in the process. Such &quot;local&quot; justifications are the only justifications of which we can make sense, for all justi­fication requires a body of unchallenged background belief, and we never could justify our totality of beliefs &quot;all at once.&quot; But, the position continues, such &quot;local&quot; justifications are all that is necessary to make sense of rationality in science. For example, in talking about the rationality of belief we have used the notion of evidence. But what are evidence propositions? Not, this view asserts, some ultimately self-warranting reports of private awareness, or anything of the sort. They are, instead, unchallenged background beliefs. Now some philosophers who hold this view may be &quot;foundationalists&quot; in a weak sense—that is, in the sense that they would restrict the class of evidential propositions to a proper subclass of our total beliefs (for example, Neurath's protocol sentences or Popper's spatiotemporally restricted singular existence statements). Others deny even this weak version of foundationalism, allowing any currently un­challenged scientific belief, no matter how general or theoretical, to play an evidential role. But all agree that the justificatory process proceeds a step at a time, and all agree that justification is, and needs only be, relative to currently unchallenged scientific belief. Again, we earlier assumed various methods of justification which we imagined as having been applied before conservatism was brought into play—such as deductive and inductive inference, and so forth. Now the claim will be that there are no such principles which have their justification in any &quot;self-warranting&quot; way. Rather, it is claimed, the rules of inference which we may challenge in some particular case are, once again, justified only by reference to our currently held body of unchallenged belief. Perhaps the extreme version of this is Quine's view that even the principles of inference we call deductive logic are but the application to new cases of the truths we hold at the core of our present empirical theory of the world, truths held so firmly that we mark them out with the honorific title of &quot;logical truths.&quot; But, it is claimed, these truths, and those which ground inductive inference if, indeed, there is such a thing, are nothing more than fragments of our momentarily unchallenged belief corpus. We are warranted in using them to decide upon the acceptance and rejection of new hypotheses only because their own status is at the time not under scrutiny or challenge. One standard objection to such models of justification and rationality amount, more or less, to reworkings of old objections to coherence theories of truth. Here they are taken to be objections to a &quot;coherence&quot; theory of the rationality of belief. If all justi­fication is &quot;local&quot; and relative to background theory', isn't it possible that our whole system for accepting and rejecting novel hypotheses amounts to just an apparatus for propagating new error from old? And just as the objection to the coherence theory of truth was frequently couched in terms of the alleged possibility of alternative, incompatible but equally coherent total bodies of belief, now the point is raised that without some places at which the body of belief as a whole is rationalized by reference to something outside the corpus of belief, can't we imagine wholly incompatible total belief structure all equally &quot;rational&quot; from the point of view of &quot;local&quot; justification?<br />

Lastly, we debate and answer questions in a dogmatic manner, but there is an implicit skepticism to everything we say.<br />

As to speech, the skeptics themselves listed at least three ways to talk without dogmatic assertion. The first is the simple reporting of one's state of mind at the moment, such as that one sees yellow or recalls that Socrates said such-and-such (I.4, I.19-20 etc., I.197, I.203). The second is loose speaking (I.191, I.195, I.207; cf I.9). A skeptic will speak like the rest of us most of the time, saying for example &quot;It is day&quot;. If somebody jumps down her throat and demands to know, very precisely, whether that is a claim to knowledge, then Nescio will back off good naturedly and say she was speaking loosely. &quot;If you really want to know, at the moment I do not personally know whether or not it is day; let's inquire together.&quot; Arne Naess, a modern Norwegian philosopher of language, believes the skeptics' notion of loose talk is quite valid, distinct from dogmatic assertion, and a recognition of the subtleties of actual conversation centuries before its time (as if intelligent Greeks had to wait for 20th century professors to understand language). Naess believes that all dialogue moves through stages of loose and strict speaking, according to the importance the context places on detail and precision.[Note 35] Even if it is not saying much, the skeptics have modern analytic philosophy on their side for this one. The third method of aphasia, or non-assertion, is the most interesting by far. When dogmatists ask whether skeptics know that they do not know, they are trying to make the skeptical statements self-refuting. The skeptics anticipated this and when pressed beyond loose talk made their statements self-justifying instead. To the skeptic, statements on uncertainty apply to themselves and, therefore, announce their own uncertainty and do not dogmatize (I.14-15, I.206, II.188). Sextus compares the skeptical expressions to aperient drugs (I.206, II.188), Montaigne[Note 36] compares them to rhubarb: they wash out the system and take themselves out at the last.[Note 37] Even if it were a mere difference of perspective whether the statements are self-refuting or self-justifying, the conflict between the perspectives is balanced ₪ stopped here at 19:57 ₪ in isosthenia and skeptics will suspend judgment. As always, as Pascal observes, in a standoff between skepticism and dogmatism, the skeptic will win because it is a standoff.[Note 38] There are other methods of aphasia described in Sextus Empiricus, at least by implication. One is to use terms &quot;in an undogmatic and indeterminate sense&quot; (I.239-240). Another is to use questions instead of statements, although skeptics do (and may) use statements (I.189). Speaking and asserting are distinguished even when no method is discussed for doing the former and avoiding the latter (I.196, I.197). Other defenses of skeptical talk have come from friends throughout history. One is that the irony with which Socrataes spoke was non-committal in the dogmatic sense, even while it was an accurate and precise tool in discourse (cf. I.221, II.42). Another is my interpretation that Pyrrhoneans speak and may speak ex concessis, a claim compatible with, but never asserted by, Sextus Empiricus. A final defense is the claim by both Voltaire and Talleyrand that language conceals thought and belief far more than it reveals them.
