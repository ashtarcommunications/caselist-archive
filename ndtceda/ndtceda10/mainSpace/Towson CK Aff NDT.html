TIM WISE A FORMER DEBATE DESCRIBES HOW WHITENESS IS PROPS UP IN THIS ACTIVITY<br />
wise, race relations speciaslist, &quot;White LIke Me&quot;<br />
I say that this process is white becuase my experience...the Nazis would win<br />
<br />
Some of the main practices that the aff participates in perpretuate the white aesthetic<br />
1. sole reliance on traditional authors--this act has been one to take creditability from our perosnal narratives, msuic, lived experience to make arguemtns--it tels us only those with knowledge have phds jds and mds<br />
2. silence on the issue of white supremecy and how it has been essential to shaping this debate activity through norms and procedures<br />
3. objective disconnected narration in which the aff says nothing aobut their perosnal political agency in relation to the advocacy of the aff.<br />
4. having a managerial approach to dealing with racism instead of seeking to eradicate white supremacy<br />
<br />
fairness isnt neutral or objective<br />

<span class="Underline"><strong>Decision: 3-0 for Towson Matheson, Richey, Lauzon</strong> </span><br />
<strong>Advocacy: Fernando and I advocate the topic as a site to avow the middle passage as America’s first immigration policy</strong><br />
<strong>1NC: Anti-politics, T, tie to the topic</strong><br />
<strong>2nr: T, solvency argument: flawed epistemologically because it’s not tied to the topic, boggs- cede to the right</strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong>2ar:</strong> terminally non-unique- conflation happening in status quo. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">They concede 1. Rodriguez evi- topicality is technology that has tried and failed- secures white supremacy </span><br />
<span class="Underline">2. Pennit and con evi- inaccessible to the people of the community that need support. They advocate no change- corporate elites will be the only ones who engage in this framework. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">3. Double consciousness from trying to play agent and individual—bad </span><br />
<span class="Underline">We collapse debate to something that is better </span><br />
<span class="Underline">T-judge should vote for the best political strategy for desconstructing white supremacy in relation to the topic </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Buckner evi- slaves were not eligible for visas—cannot talk about visas </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Blacks are not treated as people, cannot get visas in the squo </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Tried the structure and it failed- we actively disengage it </span><br />
<span class="Underline">We proved better education—we set a limit- must engage the topic </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Conflates the aff to an analogy—trying to flatten the middle passage instead of recognizing it. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Reject T for pedagogy- stone evi- it will be filled in with elites, neoliberalism </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Fairness- censorship happens under their interpretation </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Additional Framework Cites </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Tolerance is a technology of violent imperialism, camouflaging the valorization of western governance and culture under the cloak of neutrality while isolating non-tolerant difference as a site for extermination </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Wendy Brown 2006 “Regulating Aversion: Tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire”, Princeton Univ Press, 202-4 </span><br />
<span class="Underline">That tolerance is preferable…neither tolerant nor tolerable. </span><br />
<br />
<span class="Underline">Fairness is not neutral or objective but rather shot through with biases produced by dominant power relations </span><br />

<span class="Underline">We have clearly built…get away with it. </span>
