The INA specifies under what circumstances foreign workers can come to the Unites States as temporary workers. Temporary workers, which the INA formally deems “nonimmigratns,” are permitted to come to the United States “for a temporary period and for a specific purpose.” As mentioned above, the United States issues approximately one million temporary work visas per year. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">While there are a number of temporary worker visa categories</span>, including one for individuals with “extraordinary ability,” another for exceptional entertainers and athletes, and a third for foreign nurses in “medically underserved areas,” <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this section discusses the larger, better-known, and </span>perhaps <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">most controversial categories </span>of temporary migrant workers visas: (1) temporary workers in specialty occupations <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">(H-1B </span>visa holders) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and </span>(2) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">temporary ag</span>ricultural and non-agricultural <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">workers</span> (H-2A and H-2B visa holders).<br />
B. Lit checks- creates functional limits- only substantial cases have enough literature to be ran and competitive against process counterplans<br />
C. No ground loss- the neg gets disads links based on increasing temporary workers or ag workers not the overall increase to visas<br />
D. Don’t vote on potential abuse- rejecting only actual abuse solves.<br />
E. Reasonability- good is good enough- competing interpretations lead to a race to the bottom that kills education and ground on both sides AND our affirmative is reasonable because there is a congressional debate going on about agriculture worker visas now, takes out all their offense.<br />

 Tying employment and visa status to one’s employer reentrenches the system of slavery in the agricultural industry – the first step away from this system of hierarchy is to remove this requirement<br />

Interpretation - aff gets the plan, neg gets a competitive policy option or the status quo. <br />
Impacts:<br />
A). Ground – Infinite number of non-policy arguments that you could run, making it impossible to research. <br />
B). Even if we don't go for our interpretation, we should get to weigh our impacts. Mooting the 1AC makes it impossible to be affirmative. <br />
c). Vague alts bad - it's a moving target, makes it impossible to debate - this is an independent voting issue. We can’t read arguments that link if we don’t know what the alternative is.<br />

Lit checks- creates functional limits- only already proposed visas have sufficient literature- affs like nurses and ag workers have good ground and are predictable BUT entirely new visas would be unstrategic- no aff lit means no defense of the mechanism- the aff will always lose to process counterplans.<br />
No ground loss- the neg gets disads links based on increasing temporary workers and ag workers- process link ground is irrelevant- substance is key.<br />
Don’t vote on potential abuse- they should have ag links- rejecting only actual abuse solves.<br />
Reasonability- good is good enough- competing interpretations lead to a race to the bottom that kills education and ground on both sides AND our affirmative is reasonable because there is a congressional debate going on about agriculture worker visas now.<br />
