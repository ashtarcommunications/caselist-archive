Current immigration policy excludes individuals suspected of terrorism<br />

A foreign national may be deemed… the group’s terrorist activities.<br />
<br />
Current definitions of “terrorists” make almost anyone a terrorist<br />

Section 411 vastly expands the class of immigrants… prior to the enactment of the Act.<br />
<br />
Jacob and I demand that The United States federal government no longer consider section 212(a)(3)(B)<br />
of the Immigration and Nationality Act in determining eligibility for employment-based immigrant visas,<br />
nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family based visas, and human trafficking-based visas.<br />
<br />
The rhetoric of terrorism posits the US as the bearer of civilization in an unending war for<br />
global salvation. This logic only finds agency through the government and justifies in the<br />
infinite extension of US hegemony, imperialism and discipline.<br />

<br />
The Bush administration perpetually affirms… into the United States for the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
More specifically, post 9/11 terrorism policy has been inextricably tied with immigration<br />
policy. The Anti-terrorist immigration policy is based on the idea that all immigrants are<br />
potential threats to our security<br />

<br />
Review, Vol. 92, No. 4 (Jul., 2004), pp. 1173-1239]<br />
Since 9/11, terrorism policy has misappropriated … inherently threatens the United States.<br />
<br />
The Global War on Terror requires an enemy to fight. When America triumphantly<br />
defeated communism, it did not result in a more secure world – only more fear that now<br />
the Commies would be hidden within the nation. In the same vein, the threat of terrorism<br />
is constructed and leads to endless war and self-fulfilling prophecy of more fear and more<br />
terror.<br />

<br />
But the<br />
<br />
demise of the communist bloc … proof of, continuing insecurity.<br />
<br />
Terrorism is grounded in a policy of security and promotes American exceptionalism<br />
resulting in a need to eradicate those who are deemed lesser<br />

<br />
The stubborn question of security… countries in order to destroy freedom itself.<br />
<br />
Security reduces individuals to tools of sovereign calculation, and it dictates the ethical and<br />
territorial boundaries of all life. This bio-power drives oppression underground and makes<br />
extinction inevitable. The power to expose an entire population to nuclear annihilation is<br />
the underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s existence.<br />

<br />
Foucault posited some direct…Foreign Policy are all a part.<br />
<br />
LASTLY IS THE FUNCTION OF THE DEMAND<br />
<br />
Demands against the State represent the strategic reversibility of power<br />
relations. Our demand acts as a focal point of resistance that destroys the<br />
discursive foundations of securitization and biopower.<br />

Dear Joe Miller, Yes…policy makers is leading<br />
<br />
Orthodox debate is policed to prevent new forms of critical inquiry. Unfortunately, it is precisely<br />
these new forms of inquiry that need to take place. Release the shackles of preconceived notions and<br />
endorse the 1AC<br />
