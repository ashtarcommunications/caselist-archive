<br />
<br />
Put away your US worker turns- studies show that raising the cap doesn’t hurt American wages, jobs or the market- it enhances them<br />
Atkinson 6-1 [Robert, “H-1B Visa Workers: Lower-Wage Substitute, or Higher-Wage Complement?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.itif.org/publications/h-1b-visa-workers-lower-wage-substitute-or-higher-wage-complement" rel="nofollow">http://www.itif.org/publications/h-1b-visa-workers-lower-wage-substitute-or-higher-wage-complement</a>]<br />

“It’s made it needlessly controversial,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said yesterday. “I can’t tell you right now how easy it will be to go forward with that bill, but it’s certainly created an element of controversy that would not have been otherwise there.”<br />

In truth, no advocate of a commission can be confident how it would work in practice. The mandates given to the commission in the MPI report are general enough that commission members would be able to recommend anything they wish based upon personal preference, citing whatever data they desire to conform to their opinions.

<strong><u>One of the</u></strong> boldest and <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">least predictable recommendations of the Roundtable is the creation of a Standing Commission</span></u></strong> on Immigration Policy to be composed of appointed officials holding staggered, seven-year terms. The Commission, backed by a permanent staff of expert analysts, would issue a report to Congress every 2 years making recommendations for changes in numbers and other features of the program. The Commission is designed to make policy more flexible without taking it out of the hands of Congress. By injecting data-based rational analysis into program development it could be an instrument of incremental policymaking that nonetheless aspires to avoid the “ad hockery” of the present system. The Standing Commission is obviously intended to tamp down the temperature of immigration politics by substituting dispassionate and expert opinion for the free-wheeling clash of interests that is the dominant mode at present. The idea of a non-partisan commission is intrinsically appealing (and indeed it has also been proposed by the Migration Policy Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations3), but what would it mean in practice? Three outcomes seem possible, none of which is wholly desirable. The most likely is that <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">the Commission would be ignored by a legislative body jealous of its prerogatives and doubtful that an unelected commission would provide sufficient political cover against angry constituents who disagree with the Commission’s proposals.

H-1B visa holders earn high wages</span></u></strong>--the average H-1B worker earned $71,000 in 2007--and pay substantial taxes on those earnings.[9] Chart 1 shows estimates from The Heritage Foundation's tax model of the total tax revenue[10] the government would receive if Congress increased the H-1B cap to 195,000 workers.[11] This is a conservative estimate of potential new revenue, considering that it does not account for increased taxes from the higher wages of workers whose skills complement those of the H-1B workers. It should be noted that increasing the cap to 195,000 visas does not guarantee 130,000 new workers. In some years, all of the visas will be used; in others, the cap will never be reached.[12] For our estimates, we used a conservative assumption of an additional 100,000 workers each year. Our in-house tax model projects revenue from these new workers. In the first year, the government would collect nearly $2 billion in added tax revenue. For the next several years, the annual revenue raised would continue to increase as many current workers remain and new additional workers take advantage of the program. Annual tax revenues would rise by nearly $10 billion in 2013. Between 2008 and 2016, the government would collect $36 billion in income taxes and $33 billion in payroll taxes--a total of $69 billion over eight years. <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">This additional revenue could be used to offset the costs of an economic stimulus package</span></u></strong>, or any other new program, <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">or to reduce the deficit</span></u></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">.</span><br />

Based on the research of the National Research Council, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Education, the Computing Research Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the RAND Corporation and a host of other university research sources, <span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">the AFL-CIO labor organization published a report in December refuting the claim that there is a shortage of engineering, technology and scientific talent in the United States</span>. This report comes from the Department of Professional Employees, which is an amalgamation of four AFL-CIO unions, including those representing IT workers, engineers, scientists, professors and other educators. The report, entitled &quot;Gaming the System: Guest Worker Visa Programs and Professional and Technical Workers in the U.S.,&quot; pokes holes in guest worker programs and sheds light on the core issue of wage reduction for technical professionals in the United States and expansion of guest workers into newer fields such as health care and education. <span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">The report touches on the oft-cited abuse and mistreatment of guest workers from foreign countries, as well as closely examining near-stagnant wages for U.S. workers and H-1B visa holders. The report looks at real-world examples of wage abuse based on 2008 wages of several technical H-1B visa holders</span>,<br />
including one whom Mabemah, based in Ocoee, Fla., paid $11.20 per hour for a Web developer job—well below the prevailing wage for that occupation. It also cites the example of a director of Medical Information Technology who made $11.90 an hour at The Pediatric Associates in Montrose, Colo. Tactics for wage repression of H-1B visa holders cited in the report include: &quot;<span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Employers often set lower salaries by: selecting a survey source with the lowest salaries, misclassifying experienced employees as entry-level, giving an H-1B visa holder a lower job title than [his or her] work requires, or citing wages for a low-cost area of the country while the H-1B holder is unlawfully transferred to a higher-cost area</span>.&quot; The executive summary of the report expresses several of its key findings, (PDF) including U.S. graduation rates in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) fields: &quot;Claims of shortages necessitating these programs, especially in the STEM fields, have been widely disputed and are not borne out by basic economic indicators. A Congressionally-mandated study released by the National Research Council found that, &quot;the current size of the H-1B workforce relative to the overall number of IT professionals is large enough to keep wages from rising as fast as might be expected in a tight labor market. ... If a genuine labor shortage existed, wages in these fields would have risen dramatically in ways they have not. ... In addition, unemployment rates in this sector have increased dramatically over the past year, with engineers reaching their highest unemployment rate since at least 1972. Graduation rates in the STEM fields also indicate that the United States is producing enough graduates to meet the employment needs of the industry.&quot; &quot;This whole concept of shortages is bogus; it shows a lack of understanding of the labor pool in the USA,&quot; Videk Wadhwa, a professor at Duke University's Master of Engineering Management Program, said to Baseline Magazine in 2008. Wadhwa also rejected the shortage notion based on wages. &quot;<span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">It doesn't add up. We live in a free economy,&quot; Wadhwa told Baseline. &quot;If we were sitting in a government-controlled economy it would be one thing, but in a free economy what happens ... when shortages begin to develop is that prices rise and the money compensates for the shortage.&quot; Yet, even with an abundance of technically able graduates in the United States, according to the report, many in the field are rejecting these areas for fear of being outsourced</span>. The AFL-CIO report said: &quot;A study by Rutgers University released in October 2009 found that while the U.S. is still producing enough skilled graduates in core STEM disciplines to fill industry needs, many highly qualified U.S. students in STEM fields leave the &quot;pipeline&quot; from STEM college major to STEM career possibly based on perceptions that STEM careers are highly susceptible to offshoring.&quot; The report also took a stab at the U.S. government's lack of reporting on the H-1B visa program as mandated by law and said USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) has not released a fully updated report since 2005. <br />

<span style="color: black;"> WASHINGTON — At times subtle, at times loud, <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is spending record amounts on lobbying and in election battlegrounds, elbowing into the nation's politics in unprecedented ways for the business community. The country's largest business lobby has pledged to spend $75 million in this year's elections</span></u></strong></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;">. That's on top of a lobbying effort that already has cost the organization nearly $190 million since Barack Obama became president in January 2009. </span><strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: black;">Those numbers alone, together with what chamber officials say is a network of online backers that can amplify the pro-business message, give the group clout as a virtual third party and a powerful voice in what laws are made and who's elected to write them</span></u></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. &quot;Elections have consequences, votes matter,&quot; said Bill Miller, the chamber's political director. &quot;And we're going to go out and engage in an effort to try and ensure we have people on Capitol Hill that will listen to our arguments and propose and promote ideas that are more supportive of the free enterprise system.&quot; In its dual lobbying-politicking roles,</span><span style="color: black;"> <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">the chamber has been a visible player in congressional debates</span></u></strong></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">, fighting Obama administration initiatives on health care, financial regulations and energy policy. It's weighed in on Senate contests, spending more than $4 million so far in Massachusetts, Arkansas, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Illinois and Ohio. It's endorsed Republican Senate candidates in Florida, California and Missouri, and it plans another wave of ads around Labor Day.</span><br />

Responding to industry warnings of an impending high-tech crisis, Congress voted in 1998 to temporarily double the number of skilled workers allowed into the country on visas. Moves are under way to allow in even more workers and to make the increase permanent. &quot;<strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Once again, the cap on H-1B visas is preventing American companies from hiring the best and the brightest workers from throughout the world,&quot; William T. Archey of the American Electronics Association told a congressional committee late last year.</span></u></strong> Behind the H-1B movement are AEA and another industry group, the Information Technology Association of America, headed by Harris Miller, who once served on the staff of the House committee again being asked to raise the ceiling on the program. Under the 1990 law that created the program, a limit of 65,000 a year was set on the number of H-1B visas that could be issued. But lobbyists from Silicon Valley soon warned that 65,000 a year was not enough, due in part to the need to debug computers of problems associated with the year 2000. Under U.S. immigration law, workers with H-1B visas can stay in the United States for up to six years. After that, they can apply for permanent resident status but cannot remain in the H-1B program unless they leave the United States for at least a year. Under the law, foreign workers are to be paid salaries comparable to those of American workers in the same jobs<strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">. INS officials say many of those temporary workers become permanent U.S. citizens under other immigration programs. As a result of the lobbying effort, the immigration law was amended in 1998 to raise the annual cap on H-1B visas to 115,000.</span></u></strong> It will remain at 115,000 in 2000, then drop to 107,500 in 2001 and to 65,000 in 2002. <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Powerful allies The industry groups and the companies employing H-1B workers have a powerful ally in the American Immigration Lawyers Association. AILA members have thrown their financial muscle and support behind the congressmen who play a key role in determining the fate of the program.</span></u></strong><br />

<strong>US-Russia relations are resilient</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u><span style="color: black;">As for Russia, a full-scale war between it and the United States now seems inconceivable. Given the desires for larger cuts in nuclear forces that Russia displayed in negotiating the 2002 Moscow Treaty, Russia hardly seems enough of a threat to justify the size and forward-leaning posture of America's present arsenal.</span></u></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">It is now estimated that about </span><u><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">twenty-five countries are in a position to make nuclear weapons</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> rather quickly. </span><u><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Most</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> countries that could have acquired nuclear military capability </span><u><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">have refrained from doing so. Most countries do not need them</span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Consider Argentina, Brazil, and South Africa. Argentina and Brazil were in the process of moving toward nuclear military capability, and both decided against it-wisely I believe-because neither country needs nuclear weapons. South Africa had about half a dozen warheads and decided to destroy them. </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;">You have to have an adversary against whom you think you might have to threaten retaliation, but most countries are not in this position. Germany does not face any security threats-certainly not any in which a nuclear force would be relevant</span></u></strong><u><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">. </span></u><strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: black;">I would expect the pattern of the past to be the same as the pattern in the future, in which one or two states per decade gradually develop nuclear weapons</span></u></strong><strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">.</span></strong>
