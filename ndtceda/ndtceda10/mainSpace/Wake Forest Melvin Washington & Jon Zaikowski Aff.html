 The Known Unknown<br />
<br />
Contention one is the known unknown:<br />
<br />
The anti-trafficking movement is lacking ex-captive participation and information now<br />
Denise Brennan 2005 (?Methodological Challenges in Research with Trafficked Persons: Tales from the Field?) Associate professor of Anthropology at Georgetown University.<br />
<br />
On many occasions throughout this research I have heard social service providers and human rights attorneys liken this ?anti-trafficking movement? to that of the domestic violence movement. However, whereas domestic violence victim-advocates took an active leadership role in that fight, trafficked persons were not a significant part of the fight for anti-trafficking legislation, nor are they now with the exception of members of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers shaping the direction of the anti-trafficking ?movement.? Unlike the research and advocacy environment in Australia that Veronica Strang describes, where there is a ?small but growing number of Aboriginal academics, lawyers and political activists? who speak for themselves (2003: 180), the anti-trafficking movement is still so new in the United States that most often non-ex-captives must ?speak for? most ex-captives if their story is to be told at this time.17 The movement activists, at this early stage of the fight against trafficking, are generally elites, often human rights attorneys. In Margaret Keck and Kathryn Sikkink?s now-classic book on transnational advocacy networks, they argue that ?in a world where the voices of states have predominated, transnational advocacy networks have opened channels to bring alternative visions and information into international debate. (1998: x)? In the case of trafficked persons to the United States, they have been voiceless for different reasons: because of fear of reprisals from their traffickers, their stage in the recovery process, and concern that their community of co-ethnics will stigmatize them. Given these obstacles, it is possible that few ex-captives will ever step out from the anonymity of their case managers? offices, to give interviews to researchers, let alone public presentations or press conferences as part of anti-trafficking movement activities.<br />

<br />
Current data on human trafficking is completely unreliable ? most estimates of its scope are no more than rough guesses<br />
Elzbieta Gozdziak and Elizabeth Collett 2005 (Director and researcher at the Institute for the Study of International Migration, a journal focused on contemporary issues affecting international migration Georgetown University, ?Research on Human Trafficking in North America: A Review of Literature?)<br />
<br />
The US State Department, for example, has produced the oft-quoted estimates of the size of the trafficked population worldwide: 800,000 to 900,000 annually, with 14,500 to 17,500 trafficked into the United States alone.11 These figures are used by a number of international organizations, including the UN and IOM, as authoritative, yet there has been no release of information with respect to the methodology used to obtain the baseline data. Information provided by the US State Department at the conference in Rome where the papers in this volume were first presented includes a brief description of the statistical methods employed to calculate estimates, but does not explain the methodology used to arrive at the baseline data sources either. Indeed, the number of trafficking victims entering the United States has been revised at least three times: down from 45,000 to 50,000, a figure reached by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1999 (O.Neill Richard, 1999), to 18,000 to 20,000 victims reported in 2003, and even further down to 14,500 to 17,500 quoted in the 2004 TIP report. Each time an improved methodology was cited as a reason for these new figures. Charles Keely, Professor of International Migration and Demography at Georgetown University, comments that any estimate of trafficking in the United States (or in any other country) requires a reliable source of data, presumably a partial count, and then a justified basic rule with which to extrapolate and estimate from this basic data. Given that neither government nor NGOs have a sufficient overview or a data source for extrapolation that allows for a national estimate in the United States, he believes that the US State Department figures are merely guesstimates.<br />

Without accurate information about the scope of trafficking, effective policy solutions are impossible to create<br />
Guri Tyldum and Anette Brunovskis 05 (?Describing the Unobserved: Methodological Challenges in Empirical Studies on Human Trafficking?) Tyldum is a researcher at the Institute of Comparative Politics and University of Bergen whose research specialites include human trafficking, survey design and analysis, and studies on hidden/difficult-to-reach populations. Brunovskis is a researcher at the University of Oslo, whose research focuses on trafficking.<br />
<br />
As the international awareness to the problem of trafficking in persons has increased, the number of studies and publications on the topic has escalated. A substantial number of these publications set out to describe the various elements associated with human trafficking, including estimates of the scope of the phenomenon, descriptions of trends, and characteristics of victims (Kelly, 2002). However, the methodologies applied are not always well suited for these purposes, and inferences are often made based on very limited data. This has lead to an urgent call for the improvement of research methods to study human trafficking (see for instance Kelly, 2002; Laczko and Gramegna, 2003; EU, 2004). The concern is not only one of academic pedantry; inadequate data collection methods might result in descriptions that have little to do with reality. Consequently, there is a danger that policies and interventions developed based on these findings will be ineffective (Kelly, 2002). In regard to the use of numbers in the human rights field, Mike Dottridge (2003: 82) argues: Some human rights activists argue that exaggeration is not a major problem, as long as attention ends up being given to whatever abuses are occurring. This seems to be a rather idealistic, not to say na?ve approach, which ignores the damage that can be done by misrepresenting the scale of a problem. [?] an inaccurate estimate of the problem is likely to result in a remedy being proposed that is equally inappropriate. The action needed to deal with human trafficking from Hungary, for example, is different if the annual number of estimated victims is 200, as opposed to 1,000 victims. Overestimating the extent of a phenomenon can have equally negative consequences as underestimating it. Uncritically using or publishing findings not based on sound methodologies may result in misinformation and hinder the creation of relevant policies and appropriate programmes.<br />
<br />
<br />
The input of ex-captives is needed to design effective treatment and assistance programs<br />
Elzbieta Gozdziak and Elizabeth Collett 2005 (Director and researcher at the Institute for the Study of International Migration, a journal focused on contemporary issues affecting international migration Georgetown University, ?Research on Human Trafficking in North America: A Review of Literature?)<br />
<br />
There is a need for both qualitative and quantitative research that would provide macro- and micro-level understanding of the trafficking phenomenon. Methodologically sound compilation of official statistics on the number of trafficked victims would enable large-scale quantitative analysis and inform appropriation of funds for counter-trafficking efforts and services for victims. Rigorous ethnographic and sociological studies based on in-depth interviews with trafficking survivors would provide baseline data on trafficking victims and their characteristics. Too often victims of trafficking remain one-dimensional figures whose stories are condensed and simplified, which does not bode well for the development of culturally appropriate services. In order to develop appropriate assistance and treatment programmes for trafficking survivors, increased attention needs to be paid also to the expertise and practical knowledge of NGOs and their experience in working with different groups of trafficking survivors, including women, men, and children. Therefore, monitoring and evaluation studies should be an integral part of every assistance programme, public and private. Well-designed monitoring and evaluation studies, particularly external evaluations, can identify effective policies and ?best practice.? approaches as well as assess the success of different programmes.<br />

Overreacting can be just as harmful as under-reacting ? it makes us falsely believe we?re solving the problem and leads to bureaucratic inefficiency<br />
David Brown 2004 (?Defending the Fortress? Assessing the European Union?s Response to Trafficking?) Professor of Terrorism and Internal Security at the British Army Officer Training Center, published in the journal European Security.<br />
<br />
Antonio Vitorino, JHA Commissioner, has lamented that, ?National governments, when asked what they are doing to combat that type of crime, frequently answer that Europol has now been given the competence to deal with it and that therefore the problem is solved.?53 It is not enough simply to allocate another competency to Europol, or create a further agency to tackle the problem?this is to confuse activity with accomplishment. It can also prove counterproductive. Not only has the allocation of continued competencies to Europol?s mandate given the member states a false sense of security in relation to how it is handling problems such as human trafficking, but it also creates a problem of prioritization within the organization. Europol, at present, is being asked to cover a substantial array of soft security problems, without the budget or the manpower to effectively manage its ever-expanding mandate. This situation is only likely to worsen as enlargement brings new states with new problems to the table.<br />

Slavery<br />
<br />
Contention two is slavery:<br />
<br />
Trafficking is modern-day slavery<br />

<br />
Drug trafficking has historically attracted international organized crime interest, but another form of trafficking is stealing market share; human trafficking or the commodication of persons has exploded. Our global community is witnessing the growth of a modern form of slavery. These modern traffickers treat men, women, children, and human organs as commodities to abuse, sell, and transport across borders like contraband cigarettes, illegal drugs, or stolen weapons. According to the United Nations, over one million people per year are sold into slavery. The globalization of our economies, a very high demand for personal services, a rise of unemployment (especially among women), the spiraling need for organ transplants and the Internet, all facilitate the rapid, unregulated enticement and movement of human capital. The dark side of the Internet involves fraud, theft, and pervasive pornography, as well as criminal organizations intent upon exploitation of humans.<br />

Slavery is the refusal to recognize ourselves in others?it dooms society to moral decay and is incompatible with free society?it must be overcome.<br />
Anthony Pagden, staff writer for The New Republic, 1997, (December 22, ?The Stain? lexis)<br />
<br />
On the very eve of their success, it seemed to many of the abolitionists as if the force of the conviction that the servility of the African was his or her natural state would endure forever. How and why public opinion managed to triumph over such powerful interests is a complicated story. It has at least something to do with the introduction of sugar from Asia, as the older Marxist literature on the subject has always insisted, and the corresponding decline of the need for slave labor in the West Indies. Moreover, as Robin Blackburn has recently shown in The Making of New World Slavery: From the Baroque to the Modern 1492-1800, it has something also to do with the modernization of the European state system and of its overseas economies. As the &quot;baroque&quot; state (this is Blackburn's term) of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries gradually exchanged display for administrative efficiency, it slowly replaced an archaic system of indebtedness with a far more durable and less offensive one. But the abolition of the trade, and finally of slavery itself, was also the outcome of a massive shift in European attitudes toward the value of human life, and the claims that peoples in remote and alien cultures might have upon us. The French, in particular, had insisted that if the Africans were truly human--and what rational person could deny that they were?--then they must be the bearers of the same rights as all other humans. Slavery was the refusal--the ultimate refusal--to recognize ourselves in others. This, the writers of the Enlightenment had come to believe, was a failure not merely of understanding; it was also a failure of one's own humanity. Slavery, Montesquieu warned, did not only inflict an injustice on the slave, it also corrupted and degraded the enslaver. A slave-owning, slave-trading society was doomed to moral decay. Empires were in some sense looked upon as wholes, and the moral evil that took place in the periphery would ineluctably contaminate the center. Thomas Bertram could not hope to escape forever the moral contagion of what his overseers were doing in Antigua, however rarely he chose to visit the island. Slavery, as Anne-Robert Turgot, sometime French Minster of finance, warned the new United States, &quot;is incompatible with a good constitution.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
We have an ethical obligation to stop such measures. We cannot let ourselves remain complicit to a system of slavery that we enable.<br />
Kevin Bales 1999 (Disposable People New Slavery in the Global Economy p. 262) Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Roehampton University in London; this book was nominated for the Pulitzer prize and has been translated into 10 languages.<br />
<br />
We have to answer the same question today. Whether we like it or not, we are now a global people. We must ask ourselves: Are we willing to live in a world with slaves? If not, we are obligated to take responsibility for things that are connected to us, even when far away. Unless we work to understand the links that tie us to slavery and then take action to break those links, we are puppets, subject to forces we can't or won't control. Not to take action is simply to give up and let other people jerk the strings that tie us to slavery. Of course, there are many kinds of exploitation in the world, many kinds of injustice and violence that merit our concern. But slavery is exploitation, violence, and injustice all rolled together in their most potent combination. If there is one fundamental violation of our humanity we cannot allow, it is slavery. It there is one basic truth that virtually every human being can agree on, it is that slavery must end. What good is our economic and political power, if we can't use it to free slaves? If we can't choose to stop slavery, how can we say that we are free?<br />
<br />
<br />
Governments must utilize moral implications in light of the uncertain nature of policy consequences.<br />
David Halloran Lumsdaine, Yale assistant professor of political science, 1993 (Moral Vision in International Politics, pg. 273)<br />
Nations are faced by a need to anticipate a future that is filled with uncertainty. Even the possible contingencies and courses of action are unknown; knowing the probabilities of various kinds of future outcomes is, for the most part, out of the question. In this kind of a situation, basing a policy on detailed calculations of what will work out to the national advantage is a strategy of limited usefulness. Its usefulness is limited not only because of the difficulty of even guessing how a policy will turn out in detail but also because much of the need is not to choose among already existing alternatives but to generate new options, plans, and ways of doing things. In such a situation, general principles of wise action are likely to provide some of this vague guidance. And deeply held convictions that are general enough to be shared are likely to provide some of the vision and impetus needed to force creative solutions to problems of long-term structuring in an unpredictable environment. At the same time, the uncertainty of the long-term future means that there is not necessarily an obvious or overwhelming need to pursue a policy governed only by realpolitik considerations. the exclusion of private or government luxury consumption. In such a situation, policy can be influenced by plausible arguments about a long-term future, and plausibility will be based in part upon a policy?s affinity to a broad base of domestic political experience and interpretation, and upon generally accepted principles of practical reasoning, including a society?s ethical traditions.<br />

<br />
Even if they win util and a probable extinction scenario, you still vote aff. Don?t let specific analysis guide your decision; stick to the principle that slavery is usually wrong and reject it in all instances, since this is most likely to maximize utility. Making exceptions, even once, leads to bad decision calc, even from a util standpoint.<br />
R. M. Hare 1979 (?What is Wrong with Slavery,? Philosophy and Public Affairs, Vol. 8, No. 2, Winter 1979, pp. 103-121) Hare was Oxfords? professor of ethics for 17 years, the creator of prescriptivism, and a former POW.<br />
<br />
That, perhaps, will do for our imaginary example. Now for the philosophical argument. It is commonly alleged that utilitarianism could condone or commend slavery. In the situation described, utility would have been lessened and not increased if the Juban government had abolished slavery and if as a result the economy of Juba had deteriorated to the level of that of Camaica. So, it might be argued, a utilitarian would have had to oppose the abolition. But everyone agrees, it might be held, that slavery is wrong; so the utilitarians are convicted of maintaining a thesis which has consequences repugnant to universally accepted moral convictions. What could they reply to this attack? There are, basically, two lines they could take. These lines are not incompatible but complementary; indeed, the defence of utilitarianism could be put in the form of a dilemma. Either the defender of utilitarianism is allowed to question the imagined facts of the example, or he is not. First let us suppose that he is not. He might then try, as a first move, saying that in the situation as portrayed it would indeed be wrong to abolish slavery. If the argument descends to details, the anti-utilitarians may be permitted to insert any amount of extra details (barring the actual abolition of slavery itself) in order to make sure that its retention really does maximize utility. But then the utilitarian sticks to his guns and maintains that in that case it would be wrong to abolish slavery, and that, further, most ordinary people, if they could be got to consider the case on its merits and not allow their judgement to be confused by association with more detestable forms of slavery, would agree with this verdict. The principle of liberty which forbids slavery is a prima facie principle admitting of exceptions, and this imaginary case is one of the exceptions. If the utilitarians could sustain this line of defence, they would win the case; but perhaps not everyone would agree that it is sustainable. So let us allow the utilitarian another slightly more sophisticated move, still staying, however, perched on the first horn of the dilemma. He might admit that not everyone would agree on the merits of this case, but explain this by pointing to the fantastic and unusual nature of the case, which, he might claim, would be unlikely to occur in real life. If he is not allowed to question the facts of the case, he has to admit that abolition would be wrong; but, ordinary people, he might say, cannot see this because the principles of political and social morality which we have all of us now absorbed (as contrasted with our eighteenth-century ancestors), and with which we are deeply imbued, prevent us from considering the case on its merits. The principles are framed to cope with the cases of slavery which actually occur (all of which are to a greater or less degree harmful). Though they are the best principles for us to have when confronting the actual world, they give the wrong answer when presented with this fantastic case. But all the same, the world being as it is, we should be morally worse people if we did not have these principles; for then we might be tempted, whether through ignorance or by self-interest, to condone slavery in cases in which, though actually harmful, it could be colourably represented as being beneficial. Suppose, it might be argued, that an example of this sort had been used in anti-abolitionist writings in, say, 1830 or thereabouts. Might it not have persuaded many people that slavery could be an admirable thing, and thus have secured their votes against abolition; and would this not have been very harmful? For the miseries caused by the actual institution of slavery in the Caribbean and elsewhere were so great that it was desirable from a utilitarian point of view that people should hold and act on moral convictions which condemned slavery as such and without qualification, because this would lead them to vote for its abolition. If utilitarians take this slightly more sophisticated line, they are left saying at one and the same time that it would have been wrong to abolish slavery in the imagined circumstances, and that it is a good thing that nearly everyone, if asked about it, would say that it was right. Is this paradoxical? Not, I think, to anybody who understands the realities of the human situation. What resolves the paradox is that the example is imaginary and that therefore people are not going to have to pronounce, as a practical issue, on what the laws of Juba are to be. In deciding what principles it is good that people have, it is not necessary or even desirable to take into account such imaginary cases. It does not really matter, from a practical point of view, what judgements people reach about imaginary cases, provided that this does not have an adverse effect upon their judgements about real cases. From a practical point of view, the principles which it is best for them to have are those which will lead them to make the highest proportion of right decisions in actual cases where their decisions make a difference to what happens-weighted, of course, for the importance of the cases, that is, the amount of difference the decisions make to the resulting good or harm. It is therefore perfectly acceptable that we should at one and the same time feel a strong moral conviction that even the Juban slave system, however beneficial, is wrong, and confess, when we reflect on the features of this imagined system, that we cannot see anything specifically wrong about it, but rather a great deal to commend. This is bound to be the experience of anybody who has acquired the sort of moral convictions that one ought to acquire, and at the same time is able to reflect rationally on the features of some unusual imagined situation. I have myself constantly had this experience when confronted with the sort of anti-utilitarian examples which are the stock- in-trade of philosophers like Bernard Williams. One is led to think, on reflection, that if such cases were to occur, one ought to do what is for the best in the circumstances (as even Williams himself appears to contemplate in one of his cases) ;12 but one is bound also to find this conclusion repugnant to one's deepest convictions; if it is not, one's convictions are not the best convictions one could have. Against this, it might be objected that if one's deep moral convictions yield the wrong answer even in imaginary or unusual cases, they are not the best one could have. Could we not succeed, it might be asked, in inculcating into ourselves convictions of a more accommodating sort? Could we not, that is to say, absorb principles which had written into them either exceptions to deal with awkward cases like that in my example, or even provision for writing in exceptions ad hoc when the awkward cases arose? Up to a point this is a sensible suggestion; but beyond that point (a point which will vary with the temperament of the person whose principles they are to be) it becomes psychologically unsound. There are some simple souls, no doubt, who really cannot keep themselves in the straight and narrow way unless they cling fanatically and in the face of what most of us would call reason to extremely simple and narrow principles. And there are others who manage to have very complicated principles with many exceptions written into them (only 'written' is the wrong word, because the principles of such people defy formulation). Most of us come somewhere in between. It is also possible to have fairly simple principles but to attach to them a rubric which allows us to depart from them, either when one conflicts with another in a particular case, or where the case is such an unusual one that we find ourselves doubting whether the principles were designed to deal with it. In these cases we may apply utilitarian reasoning directly; but it is most unwise to do this in more normal cases, for those are precisely the cases (the great majority) which our principles are designed to deal with, since they were chosen to give the best results in the general run of cases. In normal cases, therefore, we are more likely to achieve the right decision (even from the utilitarian point of view) by sticking to these principles than by engaging in utilitarian reasoning about the particular case, with all its temptations to special pleading. I have dealt with these issues at length elsewhere.13 Here all I need to say is that there is a psychological limit to the complexity and to the flexibility of the moral principles that we can wisely seek to build deeply, as moral convictions, into our character; and the person who tries to go beyond this limit will end up as (what he will be called) an unprincipled person, and will not in fact do the best he could with his life, even by the test of utility. This may explain why I would always vote for the abolition of slavery, even though I can admit that cases could be imagined in which slavery would do more good than harm, and even though I am a utilitarian.<br />

Objective analysis is impossible when dealing with impacts of their magnitude; humans inevitably engage in irrational fatalism<br />

Some critics denigrate utopian, millennial and apocalyptic impulses, both religious and secular, seeing them as irrational at best, and potentially murderous and totalitarian at worst. They certainly can manifest in the dangerous and irrational ways as I've catalogued in this essay. But they are also an unavoidable accompaniment to public consideration of catastrophic risks and techno-utopian possibilities. We may aspire to a purely rational, technocratic analysis, calmly balancing the likelihoods of futures without disease, hunger, work or death, on the one hand, against the likelihoods of worlds destroyed by war, plagues or asteroids, but few will be immune to millennial biases, positive or negative, fatalist or messianic. Some of these effects can be positive. These mythopoetic interpretations of the historic moment provide hope and meaning to the alienated and lost. Millennialist energies can overcome social inertia and inspire necessary prophylaxis, and for forcing recalcitrant institutions to necessary action and reform. In assessing the prospects for catastrophic risks, and potentially revolutionary social and technological progress, can we embrace millennialism and harness its power without giving to magical thinking, sectarianism, and overly optimistic or pessimistic cognitive biases?<br />

A nuclear war is impossible to predict ? empirically proven by near-misses like the Cuban Missile Crisis<br />

The journal boasts that the adjustment of the ?Doomsday Clock? is done in consultation with many Nobel laureates. The problem with such dramatic timekeeping, however, is that the journal?s ?keepers of the clock? ? no matter how prize-worthy ? cannot credibly offer fine-grained predictions about the imminence of nuclear war. It is laughable to expect the onset of nuclear war to be so predictable. As with the rest of us mere mortals, the clock-keepers cannot know enough about the myriad of possible perceptions, motives, beliefs, and behaviors of nuclear powers to predict with any precision the onset of a nuclear war. The many possible proximate causes of great risk-taking and crisis-escalation may be wholly unrecognizable or visible only in part, and thus the timing of war resists close prediction. This limitation is evident in pertinent history. Careful observers of international relations were surprised by two of the 20th century?s potential nuclear-war triggers, the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Other less well known but extremely dangerous crises also came as surprises to careful Western observers.<br />

Preparing for the worst makes those scenarios more likely to happen<br />

<br />
It might be argued that biases in the subjective probabilities of scenarios do not matter because in &quot;worst-case planning&quot; probability is irrelevant; one simply prepares for the worst case - no matter how improbable - and assumes this preparation will suffice for less drastic scenarios. Two things are wrong with this argument. First, preparations for a worst-case scenario may make other undesirable events more probable. For example, preparing for what to do if deterrence fails may well increase the probability that it will in fact fail. As Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said recently on the issue of MX vulnerability to surprise attack, &quot;the chances for a true, bolt-from-the-blue surprise attack are extremely small. But even in times of crisis, our political leaders may choose not to put our nuclear forces on wartime alert for fear of triggering a nuclear shoot-out&quot; (reported in New York Times, March 24, 1989: A 9). Thus, the overall utility of preparing for the worst case cannot be determined without assessing how such preparations affect the likelihood of that worst case and of other scenarios. Second, since the domain of possible scenarios (and the range of attributes used to characterize those scenarios) is unbounded, it is impossible to define the worst case.3 The only way to salvage the idea is to reintroduce the role of probability and deal with &quot;worst plausible cases.&quot; But once scenario probability assessment became necessary again, the problem of psychological distortions would resurface.<br />
<br />
<br />
The probability that their scenarios for harms are correct is practically zero; instead, these scenarios distract us from much likelier harms<br />

<br />
In a study of heuristics used in probability judgments, Tversky and Kahneman asked the participants of the 1982 Second International Congress on Forecasting to evaluate hypothetical scenarios (Tversky and Kahneman, 1983). All participants were professional forecasters and planners, and many had used scenarios in their work. One group evaluated the probability of &quot;a complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983&quot;; the other group judged the probability of &quot;a Russian invasion of Poland, and a complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983.&quot; The suspension-and-invasion scenario was judged to be much more probable than the suspension-only scenario, even though the latter event is a strict subset of the former. Tversky and Kahneman call this the &quot;conjunction fallacy,&quot; because the conjunction of two events is judged more likely than one of them, even though this is a logical impossibility. People's probability judgments seem to follow their impressions of the plausibility of different scenarios: They find the suspension-and-invasion scenario more &quot;representative,&quot; or typical, of superpower behavior than the suspension-alone scenario, which may seem inexplicable and hence not representative. This fallible evaluation method is an example of what Tversky and Kahneman call the &quot;representativeness heuristic.&quot; Thus, intuition tells us that the more detailed a scenario is, the more probable it is. Logically, however, the exact opposite is true. Tversky and Kahneman conclude that scenarios can usefully serve to stimulate the imagination.... However, the use of scenarios as a prime instrument for the assessment of probabilities can be highly misleading. . A detailed scenario consisting of causally linked and representative events may appear more probable than a subset of these events. This effect contributes to the appeal of scenarios and to the illusory insight that they often provide [Tversky and Kahneman, 1983: 308]. Consideration of particular war-fighting scenarios has long played a key role in strategic analysis. Herman Kahn, who developed a complex taxonomy of different possible war-fighting scenarios, argued that scenarios &quot;serve to call attention, sometimes dramatically and persuasively, to the large range of possibilities that must be considered in strategic analysis, some of which may escape notice if an analysis is done using conventional analytic techniques&quot; (Kahn, 1962: 144). But while Kahn correctly recommends that the scenario not be used as a &quot;predictive device,&quot; his position reflects some psychological naivete. People find causal sequences highly compelling and will often judge a representative scenario to be more likely than any of its component events. Thus, even if the purpose of developing scenarios is not to make or influence probability judgments, this may be the unintended consequence. In fact, there is evidence that strategic priorities have in the past become distorted by overemphasizing the most extreme scenarios at the expense of less flashy but more likely ones. In 1960, although 90% of RAND studies used a bolt-out-of-the-blue surprise attack as a starting point, Herman Kahn and Tom Schelling polled their RAND colleagues and found that this was considered the least likely scenario (Herken, 1985: 205). Overemphasis on first-strike scenarios is not restricted to Hawks. Rathjens and Reed (1986) point out that while the most important arguments that Doves raised against the MX missile were that it was unnecessary and expensive, &quot;it was most effectively opposed, however, by calling attention to its threatening characteristics as a first-strike weapon and its attractiveness as a target for a first-strike by the Soviet Union&quot; (1986: 45). But, they contend, such arguments are unrealistic and lead to a distortion in perceptions of what are the most likely scenarios for the initiation of conflict.<br />

Granting more ex-captives T visas is key to including them in the anti-trafficking movement<br />

Modern-day slavery exists because a range of other exploitative labour conditions exist. The current legislation that protects trafficked persons and offers them the possibility of staying in the United States with a new visa, is based on a binary conceptualization of labour. One is either trafficked or not; suffered under ?severe forms of exploitation? or not; and thus, eligible for benefits or not. The current system of identifying trafficking victims sorts exploited workers into trafficked and non-trafficked categories. It does not allow for a more nuanced understanding of the kinds of work sites where there is a spectrum of abuse and where slavery can flourish. Often, in these sites, those held in servitude labour side by side with contract employees who have a marginal ability to leave. Indeed, in many of the cases that have been prosecuted in the United States, T Visas have been issued to tomato pickers and women working in brothels who worked alongside friends who might make a different wage, though not a liveable one, and therefore do not qualify as ?trafficked.? I am interested in this liminal space, a kind of grey zone that is not written about in the media?s anti-trafficking frenzy. Critical to more ex-captives? participation in the anti-trafficking movement is the inclusion of these individuals who do not qualify for T visas. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers? membership, for example, draws from this liminal group. Since CIW?s members who are excaptives speak publicly about labour exploitation, they are a model organization for how to incorporate exploited workers and ex-captives in the decision making and leadership of an anti-trafficking organization. Their efforts aim to illuminate how the conditions of work create a potential for a spectrum of abuse.<br />

A clear causal connection links the TVPA and other countries? anti-trafficking policies<br />

Examining the recent trafficking legislation of specific countries also provides evidence of the legislative international impact of the TVPA. The U.S. Department of State issued a Model Law to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which it released on March 12, 2003.219 This law was modeled after certain recently enacted foreign anti-trafficking laws, (e.g. the Kosovo trafficking law, the Romanian trafficking law), the U.N. Protocol, and the TVPA. The Model Law states in ? 306 that: the authority . . . shall provide victims of trafficking and accompanying dependent children with appropriate visas or other required authorization to permit them to remain in the country for the duration of the criminal prosecution against the traffickers, provided that the victim is willing to comply with reasonable requests, if any, to assist in the investigation or prosecution of the traffickers. Further, victims of trafficking shall be eligible for permanent residence. . .provided they have complied with reasonable requests; and, a victim?s spouse and children . . ..220 Anti-trafficking laws in most parts of the world, including countries of the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and Asia, still consider deportation of trafficked victims to be traditional immigration law practice; however, some countries have recently followed the United States model by granting T-visa type benefits to trafficking victims and a stay of deportation. For example, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands allow victims a three-month temporary stay, with costs paid, in order to provide victims with enough time to decide whether they wish to testify against their traffickers.221 Greece now permits victims willing to testify against traffickers to remain in the country, but it is within the prosecutor?s discretion to provide this protection.222 Likewise, Israel now provides housing with room, board, and pocket money to victims willing to testify against their traffickers. 223 These are some of the examples that indicate the positive impact of the TVPA on the enactment of anti-trafficking legislation in foreign countries.<br />

<br />
Sex trafficking is likely to increase because the current sex trafficking laws around the world are weak, or non-existent in certain countries. Existing laws are not enforced at all or enforced too strictly, too late, and to the detriment of the victim. The powerful networks of international organized crime are attracted to the sex trade industry precisely because the criminal penalty for sex trafficking in most countries is light. Unless specific enforceable trafficking laws aimed at prevention of the crime, prosecution of the perpetrator, and protection of the victim are enacted on the national level and in countries around the world, this serious human rights violation is likely to continue globally. The Victims Protection Act seeks to rectify the inadequacy of current U.S. penalties for sex trafficking. Hopefully, the new U.S. law will influence other nations to enact or amend sex trafficking legislation, to correct weak enforcement policies, and to harmonize legislation internationally. The Victims Protection Act sets up a coordinated effort to criminalize the conduct of traffickers and penalize sex trafficking as if it were a crime as serious as rape, punishable with a sentence of twenty years to life imprisonment.23 This United States law may indeed set a legislative example for other nations, and even though the effort may be deemed imperialistic or hegemonic, the beneficial result of the protection of women's human rights would justify the effort. A serious question remains. Will this new law be strictly enforced in the United States, and will it be able to accomplish productive international cooperation in order to reach the interlocking rings of businessmen, modern mafias, and corrupt government officials who are supporting this crime and human rights violation? Many countries look to the United States to effectively address the crime of sex trafficking and to lead by legislative example.24 Therefore, it is imperative that an enforcement arm be added to this new United States law to protect the victims, punish the traffickers, and prevent the continuation of a savage and cruel form of contemporary slavery.<br />

Even if victims do not fear retaliation, they may not want to testify about the ordeal they went through, which may have included repeated rapes by their captors. Advocates report that only about half of victims agree to testify or cooperate with law enforcement (Bales et al. 2005; Rieger 2007). Furthermore, in many cases, there is no prosecution of offenders. For instance, in one report of trafficking in one state, it was reported by survey respondents that government prosecutors decided not to prosecute in 60 percent of the cases (Busch-Armendariz et al. 2008). It is still possible to obtain the T visa in these cases, but it is less likely that victims will be able to obtain the necessary endorsement of law enforcement that they are &quot;cooperating.&quot;<br />

The inclusion of ex-captive voices is necessary to effectively change US anti-trafficking policy<br />

<br />
An approach that relies solely on a victim?s own demonstration of compliance with the statute is consistent with encouraging survivor participation in the political struggle against human trafficking. Thus far, this struggle has been defined by feminists and religious leaders opposed to sex work, prosecutors and law enforcement agents interested in convicting traffickers, and advocates seeking to protect victims? rights in the current framework. The inclusion of survivor voices is crucial to re-examining and redefining the United States? anti-trafficking efforts. If a range of victims? voices becomes part of the anti-trafficking debate, our conception of trafficking victims will surely expand to encompass a wide range of experiences from a diverse group of victims.
