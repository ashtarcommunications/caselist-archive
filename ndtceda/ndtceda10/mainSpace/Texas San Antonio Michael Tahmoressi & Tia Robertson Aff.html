<strong>The status quo has remained silent long enough. While the public sphere has acknowledged domestic violence, there is little attention paid to the causes, manifestation and resolution of domestic violence among immigrants. The operation of the H-4 visa targets women as an invisible class of potential victims – the policy formations of the program actively perpetuates the position of women married to H-1B visa holders as dependents, making them uniquely susceptible to domestic violence</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>The public sphere constructs women as dependent. Visa status exacerbates the control of an abusive spouse and creates an environment where domestic violence is a virtual certainty. Public discourses have shielded themselves from discussing domestic violence, and have regulated it to the private. Our discussion of this dichotomy provides women with a microphone- exposing the private sphere for its ignorance and subjagation.</strong></span><br />

<strong>Dependent visas rely on the doctrine of coverture, a holdover from medieval common law that gives a man the authority and obligation to control his wife. The 1AC bares witness in an attempt to bring the privatized issue of domestic violence into public light, exposing the trauma of domestic violence, patriarchy and the lack of legal autonomy and personhood from women. This action of can challenge and break down forms of public/private dichotomies.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>This formation of the public/private dichotomy structures social, political and economic relationships. At the heart of violence is a discussion of Otherization and masculinity.

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman"; font-size: 10pt;">  </span><span style="font-size: 35px; font-weight: normal;">Thus, we advocate baring witness to the trauma of domestic violence placed onto immigrant women because of current dependency requirements from H-4 Visas.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">By bearing witness, we seek to constantly interpret the affects of others, even those who were once considered objects incapable of expression through their oppression. The privatized nature of domestic violence for immigrant women reveals the way in which oppression forecloses the subjectivity of its victims—yet by witnessing their experience, we move beyond the objectification, we do not see their stories ending with a static meaning that can be possessed and easily interpreted or accommodated. By fracturing the silence surrounding domestic violence, the public sphere becomes a space in which to challenge masculinity and subordination.</span></strong><br />

<span style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our methodology is prerequisite to activism --- Individuals and Policy Makers must be open to narratives of trauma—bearing witness establishes ethical connection to other that founds impetus for activism. Without this method discussion becomes limited to 1st world perspective and fails to challenge exclusive notions of community that generates violence against immigrants. </span></strong></span><br />
