<span class="Underline">Zumbrun ‘8 [Josh. Staffer for Forbes. “Getting Down With the Farm” 9/3/8. Forbes, ln]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">The high-decibel message: Agriculture has arrived. It's an unprecedented time of power and importance for the industry in the nation's capital. All these companies and organizations are quick to point out that, while all part of the broad agriculture tapestry, they're not exactly natural allies. When fertilizer prices go up, the farmers take a hit; when commodity prices go up, the processors take a hit; when fuel prices go up, everyone takes a hit (except, perhaps, ethanol). But underneath the industry's dozens of competing interests is one overarching theme--trade--and a question: Which presidential candidate best helps their interests? Long something of an afterthought, an over-subsidized laggard during the infotech boom, agriculture is now a burgeoning bright spot in a largely troubled economy. While government sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are teetering on the edge of nationalization, the Farm Credit System, a forgotten government-sponsored enterprise, is buzzing along. Gone are the days where debt from Fannie and Freddie was second only to U.S. Treasuries. Today, spreads are lower in the farm credit system, a testament to the surging strength of agriculture, says AgStar Financial President Paul DeBriyn and a member of the board of directors for Farmer Mac. And with long-standing subsidies secured by passage of the 2008 farm bill earlier this year, industry leaders in Minneapolis were free to focus on open markets for a new generation of products. Technology is rapidly changing the interests of the industry. John Johnson, the chief executive of CHS, a major agriculture co-op, explains the industry's new fundamentals. Improvements in seeds and farming practices allowed corn yields to double in 15 years. As crops get more bug-resistant and drought-resistant and can grow in more tightly planted rows, that number could double again in the next couple of decades. In the past, there's been little incentive to develop this new lab-grown abundance. Demand in the U.S. grows mostly in step with the population, which hardly grows at all. This led to the industry taking a bad rap for overproduction--for stuffing calories into Twinkies or letting crops rot in silos. Now, rising global demand, for food and fuels, changes the equation. Increasing production is needed to feed the world's masses--and gas tanks. The producers of genetically modified seeds are going from Dr. FrankenFoods to the potential saviors of the global hungry.” </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The true long-term threat to human existence is soil erosion. Doubling the yields on the best and safest farmland cuts soil erosion by more than half. And now herbicides and conservation tillage are letting us cut those low rates of soil erosion by 65 to 98 percent. It should now be possible to build topsoil and soil tilth on much of the world's best farmland -- while carrying on intensive high-yield farming. For 10,000 years, man has accepted soil erosion as the long-term price for having a dependable food supply in the short run. In the U.S. alone, the Conservation 'Technology Information Center reports roughly 100 million acres using conservation tillage systems. The systems are continuing their rapid spread through such widely-differing agricultures as Western Europe, Brazil, Australia and Kenya. We are doing this with chemicals. Herbicides are the first alternative mankind has ever developed to &quot;bare-earth&quot; farming. These herbicide-based farming systems are the most sustainable farming Systems ever devised. They save more soil, even as they encourage more earthworms, more soil microbes and more soil tilth than plowing. Nor do the herbicides present any significant threat to wildlife or people from runoff or residues. (Atrazine, the most widely-used &quot;suspicious&quot; herbicide in the world has just had its safety rating raised seven-fold by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.) In addition, high-yield farmers are in the midst of developing &quot;no-leach&quot; farming. Tractors and applicator trucks for farm chemicals now can be guided by global positioning satellites and radar within inches of their true positions across the field, while microprocessors vary the application rates of chemicals and seed seven times a second based on intensive soil sampling, soil hydrology, slope, plant population and nearness to waterways. It is now practical to manage our farms by the square yard, rather than in chunks of 10 or 100 hectares. High-yield farming must now claim environmental credit for both the acres not plowed. and for the soil erosion not suffered.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The past 50 years have been the most productive period in global agricultural history, leading to the greatest reduction in hunger the world has ever seen. The Green Revolution, as this period came to be known in the developing world, has kept more than one billion people from hunger, starvation, and even death. Many factors contributed to the Green Revolution. The doubling of the global area under irrigation was certainly important. But at the core was the development and application of new high-yielding, disease- and insect-resistant seeds, new products to restore soil fertility and control pests, and a succession of agricultural machines to ease drudgery and speed everything from planting to harvesting. It took around 10,000 years for the world's farmers to reach their current production of nearly six billion gross tons of food, consumed virtually in its entirety by 6.4 billion people annually. Within 50 years, we will have to increase this amount by at least another 50% -- to nine billion tons. Most likely we will have to achieve this feat on a shrinking agricultural land base, and with most of the production increases occurring in those countries where it is to be consumed. However, agricultural science is increasingly under attack by groups and individuals who, for political rather than scientific reasons, are campaigning to limit advances, especially in new fields such as genetic modification (GM) through biotechnology. Despite this opposition, it is likely that 250 million acres will be planted to GM crops in 2005. Most of this acreage is in the industrialized world, although the area in middle-income developing countries is expanding rapidly. However, the debate over biotechnology in the industrialized countries continues to impede its acceptance in most poor, food-insecure countries. More than half of the world's 800 million hungry people are small-scale farmers who cultivate marginal lands. New science and biotechnology have the power to address the agro-climatic extremes. Their use lies at the core of extending the Green Revolution to these difficult farming areas. Because there are so many hungry and suffering people, particularly in Africa, attacks on science and biotechnology are especially pernicious. Africa is facing a pandemic scourge of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases, aR 30-year period of continuous degradation in soil fertility, frequent droughts and a burgeoning population. This set of converging circumstances can lead to a human catastrophe in Africa on a scale the world has never seen. We know it is coming. We have the knowledge to avert it. If we put it off, solving it later will mean the acute suffering -- and even death -- of millions of innocents who could have been spared such a tragedy. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Thanks to technology, trade and democracy, the world of 2050 will have little of the poverty that much of the world still knows too well today. Democracy and free trade are spreading rapidly. Education and communications are improving worldwide. We are unraveling the secrets of the human genome, and proving that gene therapy can cure many human diseases. We are making exciting progress with such technologies as diesel-electric cars and fuel cells. Virtually all environmental-quality measurements in the affluent countries are much higher than 20 years ago, and getting better year by year. Thanks to affluence, virtually all of human society will be able to invest in environmental preservation during the coming half-century. However, there is still one critical threat to the world, its people, and its natural resources. It is a threat that could undermine the stability of our society in the next few decades and ultimately bring on the collapse of natural resources predicted by pessimists for the last 2000 years. It is a threat particularly relevant to this college, to this year’s graduates, and to the students who will pursue knowledge here throughout the coming years. That threat is low-yield agriculture and forestry in a more populous and affluent world. The question is whether we will meet urgent human needs through the use of the best technologies and systems that our societies can develop to produce high yields on a small amounts of land or destroy the forests for low-yield production of crops, livestock, and paper pulp.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic ones. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. LESSONS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">(c) Free trade prevents nuclear winter</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Copley News Service, December 1, 1999, “Commentary”</span><br />
<span class="Underline">For decades, many children in America and other countries went to bed fearing annihilation by nuclear war. The specter of nuclear winter freezing the life out of planet Earth seemed very real. Activists protesting the World Trade Organization’s meeting in Seattle apparently have forgotten that threat. The truth is that nations join together in groups like the WTO not just to further their own prosperity, but also to forestall conflict with other nations. In a way, our planet has traded in the threat of a worldwide nuclear war for the benefit of cooperative global economics. Some Seattle protesters clearly fancy themselves to be in the mold of nuclear disarmament or anti-Vietnam War protesters of decades past. But they’re not. They’re special-interest activists, whether the cause is environmental, labor or paranoia about global government. Actually, most of the demonstrators in Seattle are very much unlike yesterday’s peace activists, such as Beatle John Lennon or philosopher Bertrand Russell, the father of the nuclear disarmament movement, both of whom urged people and nations to work together rather than strive against each other. These and other war protesters would probably approve of 135 WTO nations sitting down peacefully to discuss economic issues that in the past might have been settled by bullets and bombs. As long as nations are trading peacefully, and their economies are built on exports to other countries, they have a major disincentive to wage war. That’s why bringing China, a budding superpower, into the WTO is so important. As exports to the United States and the rest of the world feed Chinese prosperity, and that prosperity increases demand for the goods we produce, the threat of hostility diminishes. Many anti-trade protesters in Seattle claim that only multinational corporations benefit from global trade, and that it’s the everyday wage earners who get hurt. That’s just plain wrong. First of all, it’s not the military-industrial complex benefiting. It’s U.S. companies that make high-tech goods. And those companies provide a growing number of jobs for Americans. In San Diego, many people have good jobs at Qualcomm, Solar Turbines and other companies for whom overseas markets are essential. In Seattle, many of the 100,000 people who work at Boeing would lose their livelihoods without world trade. Foreign trade today accounts for 30 percent of our gross domestic product. That’s a lot of jobs for everyday workers. Growing global prosperity has helped counter the specter of nuclear winter. Nations of the world are learning to live and work together, like the singers of anti-war songs once imagined. Those who care about world peace shouldn’t be protesting world trade. They should be celebrating it.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">High-yield ag key to solve warming</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Stanford News Service 10 [June 14, 2010“High-yield agriculture slows pace of global warming, say Stanford researchers”]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Advances in high-yield agriculture over the latter part of the 20th century have prevented massive amounts of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere – the equivalent of 590 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide – according to a new study led by two Stanford Earth scientists. The yield improvements reduced the need to convert forests to farmland, a process that typically involves burning of trees and other plants, which generates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The researchers estimate that if not for increased yields, additional greenhouse gas emissions from clearing land for farming would have been equal to as much as a third of the world's total output of greenhouse gases since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1850. The researchers also calculated that for every dollar spent on agricultural research and development since 1961, emissions of the three principal greenhouse gases – methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide – were reduced by the equivalent of about a quarter of a ton of carbon dioxide – a high rate of financial return compared to other approaches to reducing the gases. &quot;Our results dispel the notion that modern intensive agriculture is inherently worse for the environment than a more 'old-fashioned' way of doing things,&quot; said Jennifer Burney, lead author of a paper describing the study that will be published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</span><br />

<span class="Underline"> Fertilizer use is down</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer costs money, so as one would expect, farmers attempt to become more efficient in its use. The best measure of this is the ratio of nitrogen in the fertilizer applied to the nitrogen in the crop. This ratio fell for American farmers by 2% a year from 1986 to 1995. Further, there is no evidence that bulk deposition of nitrogen, which is of environmental concern because of run-off into rivers and streams, has been increasing (Frink et al. 1999). Another measure of increasing efficiency in nitrogen use is the feed-to-meat ratio. As we have just shown, the synthetic nitrogen-to-nitrogen in the crop has been falling and now, in turn, the &quot;calculated feed to produce a unit of meat fell at an annual rate of 0.9%&quot; from 1967 to 1992 (Waggoner and Ausubel 2002). With increasing crop yields per acre, &quot;cropland for grain-fed animals to produce meat for Americans shrank 2.2% annually&quot; (Waggoner and Ausubel 2002).</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The emergence of synthetic urea brought an even stronger response -it was man-made, alien to the environment and dead, in the words of Rudolf Steiner. We must remember that the movement for &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;biodynamic&quot; agriculture was first a response to the use of synthetic fertilizer and not to pesticides. Synthetic fertilizers have proved their worth and there is no question that we would not be able to feed 6.3 billion people today without them, nor could we do so for the expected 9 billion people in 2050 when population growth is expected to level off or even decline (Smil 2000 and 2001, 159). Though many believe in the mystic vitalist properties that manure provides to the crop, plant physiology tells us that manure has to be broken down in the soil and that the plant takes in cations and anions that are no different from those provided by synthetic fertilizer. The difference is that with modern agronomy, the farmer can more accurately provide the needed nutrient in proper proportions with synthetic fertilizer than with manure whose nutrient content may vary considerably.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Not feasible to use organic fertilizer</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Rattan Lal, Professor of Soil Science and Director of the Carbon Management and Sequestration Center at The Ohio State University, 2004 [“Agriculture”, Pollution A to Z. Ed. Richard M. Stapleton. Vol. 1]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Sustainable agriculture implies profitable farming on a continuous basis while preserving the natural resource base. It is not synonymous with low-input, organic, or alternative agriculture. In some cases, low input may sustain profitable and environmentally sound farming. In others, it might not. The addition of organic amendments might enhance soil quality, but may not eliminate the need for the judicious use of fertilizers. Large quantities (10 to 20 ton/hectare/year) of organic manures are needed to supply enough nutrients to produce the desired yields. Therefore, the use of organic manures, although desirable, may not be logistically feasible. In sub-Saharan Africa, low inputs on impoverished soils and low yields have been responsible for low standards of living, severe malnutrition, and widespread problems of soil and environmental degradation. Therefore, the adoption of RMPs is a necessary prerequisite to feeding the earth's expected ten billion inhabitants by the year 2100. Judicious management includes the conversion of marginal agricultural soils to restorative land use and adoption of RMPs. Technological options differ among soils, ecoregions, and social and cultural settings, but the underlying basic principles remain the same.</span><br />

<span class="Underline"> Transitioning to small farms ¬decimates crop yields – transportation, specialization – this card indicts their methodology</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Haddad 8 [Abigail Haddad, B.A. Economics @ Kenyon College, Economist @ Bureau of Labor Statistics, June 10, 2008, “The Problem With Organic Food”, The American, journal of the American Enterprise Institute] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Beyond meeting certain aesthetic desires, however, the case for local and organic agriculture breaks down. In a recent New York Times op-ed, chef and small-farm advocate Dan Barber noted that a four-acre farm in the United States nets, on average, $1,400 per acre, while a 1,364-acre farm nets $39 an acre. This is supposed to demonstrate that small farms are significantly more productive than large farms; in fact, it does nothing of the sort. What Barber’s statistic shows is that the crops being grown on very small farms are different from the crops being grown on large farms, and that the sorts of crops that make financial sense to grow on small, labor-intensive plots are expensive to cultivate and therefore expensive to buy. No matter what breed of corn you cultivate, there is no meaningful market demographic that will allow you to net $1,400 an acre for it. Small farms have their own set of environmental inefficiencies. The concept of “food miles”—the idea that consumers should think about the distance their food travels to get to them—has acquired some cachet. The implication is that the number of food miles reflects the environmental cost of transportation. However, because of economies of scale, industrial agriculture captures efficiencies in transportation that small farms do not, so not every food mile is equally efficient. If you drive to your local farmers’ market to buy a few items from a farmer who has driven a truck several hours to be there, the number of food miles is relatively small; but compared to conventional agricultural products, the efficiency of each food mile is much lower. The upside of buying organic produce comes down to this: if you want to pay more money for a really fantastic tomato, you can do so. When done on a large scale, organic agriculture is similar to conventional agriculture. If you drink organic milk, you may picture happy cows wandering in fields full of grass; but in fact, as Michael Pollen discussed in his 2001 New York Times article “Behind the Organic-Industrial Complex,” it’s more likely your organic milk came from cows that spend their days in lots, eating grain and attached to milking machines—just like conventional cows. The same is true of organic crops: environmentalists take issue with crop monocultures (acre after acre of the same strain of a particular crop being grown); but as organic crops become just another part of agribusiness, these practices are being duplicated in their production. So while companies may make sentimental pitches for organic food based on the notion of small, diversified farms and happy roaming cows, that’s not for the most part what they’re selling. Foodies and environmentalists like Barber and Pollen believe that large farms and the increasing resemblance of organic agriculture to conventional agriculture are problems, but also unavoidable problems, given how much Americans are willing to pay for food. The reason small farms tend to specialize in certain high-cost crops, and the reason that organic agricultural practices mimic conventional ones, is that our current system of agriculture is very good at inexpensively mass-producing food. Between 1930 and 2006, the percentage of disposable income that Americans spent on food dropped from 24 percent to under 10 percent; during that same period, the percentage of America’s food budget that was spent on food away from home rose from 13 percent to over 40 percent, according to the USDA. These numbers show a very clear picture of what most consumers want: cheap food and convenience. The industrial agriculture system has provided them with both, and even as niche agriculture has made heirloom tomatoes and wild strawberries available for higher prices, most Americans have not significantly changed their spending and eating habits. Shifting toward organic farming would require major changes in land and labor allocation. One of the successes of industrial agriculture has been its ability to create more with less. Over the past 60 years, the labor hours devoted to farming have shrunk by about 3 percent annually, even as output has skyrocketed, and the amount of land used for farming has decreased by nearly 30 percent. These aren’t problems to be overcome; they are major economic success stories that have resulted in cheaper food. Indeed, the current model of agribusiness has led to massive increases in productivity, which is why organic operations have mimicked some of its practices. Before the advent of efficient fertilizers and technology, farming was dominated by small, family-owned farms whose inputs were seeds, water, natural fertilizer, sun, and labor. But the environmental case for that type of agriculture is weak, and even the aesthetic case is not applicable to most organic agriculture. The upside of buying produce from outside the mainstream agricultural system—whether from small, local farms or from larger businesses—comes down to this: if you want to pay more money for a really fantastic tomato, you can do so.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Specialization – Undermines subsidies and crop stability by decreasing specialization</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Dobbs ‘7 [Thomas. Prof Emeritus of Econ @ South Dakota State. “It’s Economics, Not Agronomy” 2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.grist.org/article/its-economics-not-agronomy" rel="nofollow">http://www.grist.org/article/its-economics-not-agronomy</a> ]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">But if we take a &quot;long run&quot; perspective, it is not just agronomy that matters. Economics matters a lot. Farmers will not continue to invest in capital and yield-increasing technologies if it is not profitable to do so. It is undeniable that decades of subsidies for just a few major crops have increased the extent of commodity specialization and chemical intensification that evolved over the last half of the 20th century. Ray contended that changes in prices and subsidies have little impact on the amount of land that stays in agricultural production. While that is true, Ray and Philpott do not take adequate account of the changes that would occur over the long run in the mix of crops and livestock produced, and in methods of production. If we were to permanently alter U.S. farm policy by eliminating or drastically reducing the system of commodity subsidies over time, we could eventually see a return to more biologically diverse crop and livestock systems, more ecologically sustainable crop production systems, and livestock systems that are less dependent on feed grains and oilseed crop protein supplements.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">FPF ‘8 [Farm Policy Facts. “Myth Busters Part 1 – Commodity Prices and the Farm Bill” Oct 2008 www.farmpolicy.org/mm_myth_busters_part1.cfm ]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">During this farm bill, a handful of special interest groups and big city papers have continued to regurgitate numerous myths about farm programs even though the numbers prove these arguments to be blatantly false. Over the next couple of weeks, Farm Policy Facts will debunk some of the biggest whoppers. Myth: Farmers will rake in big bucks with higher commodity prices; they don’t need a farm bill. The Truth: History has shown that prices fall as fast as they rise. And, commodity programs in the farm bill are structured to react with wild price swings—policies kick in when prices are low and producers receive less support when prices are higher. That’s why farm policies are referred to as a safety net; they keep producers from falling off the cliff when prices suddenly and inevitably plummet. Yet, the policies have limited impact on tax payers when prices are on an upswing. For example, farm program expenses are projected to be far less because of current price levels. Farm policies were created primarily to add a level of stability for producers who are directly tied to commodity markets notorious for their roller-coaster characteristics. Without such stability, fewer farmers would farm and even fewer lenders would provide the operating loans necessary to cash-flow today’s farming operations. Interestingly, the last time there was a crop price situation similar to today was just before the farm crisis of the 1980s. Farmers back then lacked the farm safety net and crop insurance options we have today, and bankruptcies and foreclosures became commonplace. The result was an economic situation in rural America that weighed down the entire country’s economy. Economists are warning that a similar crash could be right around the corner. It is also important to keep in mind that prices are only one side of the equation. Producers’ input costs have been rising along with commodity prices. If not for farm policies, farming would be a money-losing proposition for some growers—even with higher crop prices.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Second, a dollar of farm commodity program payments does not increase cropland values by the same amount as a dollar of market- based earnings. Landowners' and buyers' expectations about certainty and stability of an income source will directly affect the degree to which that income is translated into cropland value through the capitalization process. If uncertainty exists as to whether farm commodity program payments will endure, the current value of expected future payments (the basis of farmland value attributable to commodity program payments) will be significantly discounted. This means associated cropland values will be lower than if there were complete assurance that programs would continue indefinitely. The long-term existence of farm commodity programs (over 50 years) has created expectations among landowners that programs will persist in some form and level. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The research, published this month in the American Journal of Public Health, comes just as states are making important changes to national nutrition programs. For years, the federally-funded Women, Infants and Children (W.I.C.) program, which subsidizes food purchases for low-income women and young children, hasn’t included fruits and vegetables, except for fruit juice and carrots for breastfeeding women. After a push by health groups and a recent report from the Institute of Medicine, the United States Department of Agriculture in December revised W.I.C. to include monthly subsidies for fruits and vegetables. States will begin implementing the new rules in February. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles tracked the eating habits of 602 area women taking part in the federal W.I.C. program. Some of the women were given $10 in weekly vouchers for vegetable and fruit purchases at a nearby farmers’ market or supermarket, while a control group received coupons for non-food products in exchange for sharing information about eating habits. After six months, women who shopped at the farmers’ markets were eating about three additional servings of fruits and vegetables a day, compared to the control group. Supermarket shoppers consumed 1.5 extra servings. It’s not clear why mothers visiting a farmers’ market wound up buying more vegetables than grocery store shoppers, but some women told the researchers that the produce sold at markets seemed to be fresher and of higher quality than supermarket offerings. Many shoppers also said they enjoyed the pleasant community experience and the chance to interact directly with growers, the authors noted.</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Industrial ethic is key – encourages the development of new tech</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Hosemann ‘3 [John. Chief Economist for the American Farm Bureau. Agricultural Policy and the Environment, 2003, Pg 173. ]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">During the past thirty years, US farm production increased more than 80 percent. On the livestock side, genetic improvements and better animal nutrition have enabled beef, pork, dairy, and poultry producers to achieve higher output levels relative to inputs. On the crop side, similar output results have been achieved through genetics, better management of soils and water, plant nutrition, and crop pest controls. These advancements are in part the result of government subsidies for research and development. Between 1970 and 2000, taxpayer-funded agricultural research at public institutions averaged almost $3 billion a year. In addition to subsidies for research and development and extension education, there were other important subsidies on the farm output side through direct federal payments and federal price guarantees for major crops (feed grains, soybeans, wheat, rice, peanuts, sugar, tobacco, cotton, and dairy). Price guarantees accrued primarily to large-output producers because subsidies are based on volume of production. The subsidies encouraged purchases of more advanced technologies, larger farm equipment, and more land. Companies that produce advanced technologies are better able to finance such projects because crops and commodities are less risky due to the role of the federal government. On balance, government-sponsored research, direct government subsidy payments to farmers, and commodity price guarantees have resulted in high-tech, high yield intensive agriculture. The story does not end there. The government reduced farm and agribusiness risks in many other ways through subsidized credit programs, crop insurance programs, food purchase, and domestic and export sales. All of these risk-reducing programs had a predictable outcome: more output than would have otherwise been the case.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Long-term competitiveness – Large farms crucial to protect crop yields – small farms can’t be competitive in the long-run, even if plan boosts them in the short run</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Business Wire 6 [4/18/06, &quot;Only 1500 Farms Have Revenues Greater Than $5 Million in the United States &quot;, lexis] </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The US agriculture sector includes 1 million crop farms covering 300 million acres, with combined annual revenue of $100 billion. The industry includes a few large growers such as Dole Food, but the vast majority of farms are privately owned with annual revenue under $250,000. About 12,000 farms have annual revenue over $1 million, of which only 1,500 have revenue of $5 million or more. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE Demand for crops depends on the growth of the US population and the condition of export markets. Crop yield is a significant factor in profitability. Small farms can compete effectively if they produce a specialty crop or are located near a favorable market. Large economies of scale can occur, depending on the type of crop. Large farms with annual revenue over $1 million produce over 40 percent of total industry revenue. Many small farms remain in operation only because their owners have additional sources of income.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">(This is not a precise estimate, since it is impossible to know just how sharply yields would drop over time without pest protection, as insects and diseases proliferated. Nor can we predict exactly the sustainable yields from the steeper, more fragile soils which would have to be brought into production.) It is certainly possible that if the world population did reach 10 billion, low-yield farming might need 30 million square miles of crops to feed them -- or more. That would mean plowing the equivalent of South America, North America, Europe and much of Asia for food. In contrast, high yield agriculture has been raising world crop yields by 2 percent annually for the past 30 years. It is currently raising food production in the Third World at more than 4 percent -- which is twice the population growth rate in the developing countries. Nor is there any indication of a slackening in productivity growth. If the world continues to fund research in high yield agriculture--especially with biotechnology -- we should be able to feed the 21st century human population with no more cropland than is plowed today! We are also using pesticides today that have only narrow toxicity, degrade quickly, need only ounces per hectare and are thoroughly tested to ensure minimum risk to wildlife and the environment. We increasingly deliver these safer pesticides in dry, granular forms and water-soluble packets to prevent spillage we deliver them in reusable bulk containers that lock onto the spray equipment without spillage -- and then go back to the factory without leaving a plastic jug to be thrown in a landfill. We are displacing low-yielding landrace crop varieties in the world's fields. But we are not losing those genetic resources. Rather than turn the world into a starving gene museum, a worldwide network is not only preserving those seeds, but will make them far more available to future crop researchers than they would be in a remote Asian village. BROADENING ENVIRONMENTAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS The environmental movement is right in saying that we must broaden the risk-benefit analysis we use in evaluating agricultural systems. To the best of our ability, we must include the environmental impacts of high-yield farming systems in our cost-benefit analysis. We must factor in soil erosion, wildlife impacts, water quality and availability, soil tilth -- and the human health impacts of farm chemical use. But that means including the true environmental benefits of high-yield farming systems in the equation. We must include in those benefits not just the number of spiders and weeds that survive in an acre of monoculture crops. but also the billions of organisms thriving in the two acres that didn't have to be plowed because we tripled the yield on the best and safest acre! In much of the world, we have already tripled the yields, and more. We must also credit to high-yield farming the millions of acres of high-risk land taken out of crops and cut back into grass and forest because we tripled the yields on the best and safest acres. In the United States, we have taken millions of acres of steep and fragile soils out of crops in places like New England, West Virginia and the Ozark Hills. Sweden has shifted more than 5 million hectares of land back into forest since 1968, because it has not needed those acres for crop product ion. Chile has been able to support a population growing at 1.7 percent annually, feed that population an improving diet and expand its exports of high-value winter fruits and vegetables with no increase in cropland. It has been able to achieve this because of rising crop yields. Next door in Ecuador, yields have not been rising. Population growth has remained far higher, at 2.6 percent. ~ As a result, Ecuador has the worst record in Latin America of cutting forests; it is expanding its cropland by 2 percent annually. 9 High-yield farming Ls a hunger triumph. Without high-yield farming, we would indeed have faced famine for billions of people. But in the secure affluence of today's First World countries, fighting hunger isn't enough. More and more people are demanding that we preserve the quality of life, and sustain natural resources for future generations. High-yield farming today must justify itself on environmental grounds. Remarkably, however, high-yield farming has made bigger contributions to environmental sustainability and wildlife preservation than Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Fund, and the Sierra Club put together!</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands--if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem--and could lead to a Third World War--but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.</span><br />

<span class="Underline">The first gasoline powered tractor to be mass produced was introduced by Ford in 1917. Yet the yield take-off doesn't begin until 1940, and is almost certainly due to the agricultural innovations that comprise the green revolution. As The Future of Crop Yields and Cropped Area explains it: The Green Revolution strategy emerged from a surprising confluence of different lines of agricultural research (Evans, 1998) – the development of cheap nitrogenous fertilizers, of dwarf varieties of major cereals, and of effective weed control. Nitrogenous fertilizers increase crop production substantially, but make plants top-heavy, causing them to fall over. The development of dwarf varieties solves this problem, but at the cost of making plants highly susceptible to weeds, which grow higher than the dwarf plants, depriving them of light. The development of effective herbicides removed this problem. Further Green Revolution development focused on crop breeding to increase the harvest index – the ratio of the mass of grain to total above-ground biomass. Secondly, anyone who wants to suggest that the world can be fed other than through industrial agriculture has some explaining to do about this data. Every crop shows yields prior to the green revolution that were flat and a small fraction of modern yields. If we returned to yields like that, either a lot of us would be starving, or we'd be terracing and irrigating most of the currently forested hillsides on the planet for food. While shopping for locally grown produce at your nearest organic farmer's market, stop and give a moment of thanks for the massive productivity of the industrial enterprise that brings you, or at least your fellow citizens, almost all of your calorie input. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">HIS opponents may not know it, but Borlaug has long warned of the dangers of population growth. &quot;In my Nobel lecture,&quot; Borlaug says, &quot;I suggested we had until the year 2000 to tame the population monster, and then food shortages would take us under. Now I believe we have a little longer. The Green Revolution can make Africa productive. The breakup of the former Soviet Union has caused its grain output to plummet, but if the new republics recover economically, they could produce vast amounts of food. More fertilizer can make the favored lands of Latin America -- especially Argentina and Brazil -- more productive. The cerrado region of Brazil, a very large area long assumed to be infertile because of toxic soluble aluminum in the soil, may become a breadbasket, because aluminum-resistant crop strains are being developed.&quot; This last is an example of agricultural advances and environmental protection going hand in hand: in the past decade the deforestation rate in the Amazon rain forest has declined somewhat, partly because the cerrado now looks more attractive. Borlaug continues, &quot;But Africa, the former Soviet republics, and the cerrado are the last frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before.&quot; </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Many agroecological approaches, such as the production of green manure, tend to be land using. While this may be appropriate in certain communities where land is abundant, it may be inappropriate in areas with severe land scarcity. Low and declining soil fertility is a serious problem in many low-income countries, including most of Africa. Figure 29 shows the average annual nutrient depletion in Africa during the early to mid-1990s. About 86 percent of the countries in Africa show negative balances of nutrients greater than 30 kilograms of NPK per hectare per year. The cost of eliminating this nutrient depletion by using fertilizer would amount to US$1.5 billion per year.24 Although improved soil conservation measures, recycling of crop residues, better rotation schemes, and use of nitrogen-fixing legumes as well as farm manure are important to deal with soil fertility problems, expanded use of chemical fertilizers will be necessary to effectively solve the soil fertility problem in most of the low-income countries. The current average consumption of chemical fertilizers in Africa is 10–15 kilograms per hectare, and its use is heavily concentrated on a small number of export crops. Failure to combine expanded use of chemical fertilizers with agroecological methods is likely to result in further declines in soil fertility and crop yields to the detriment of the livelihoods of small-scale farmers in Africa. Furthermore, opportunities for using modern biotechnology to develop cereal varieties that could fix nitrogen from the air and extract phosphorus from acid soils should be explored. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">Organic farming cannot support either the people or the wildlife already on the planet. Organic production has no effective strategy proposals for feeding the larger human population in prospect without destroying huge tracts of wildlife habitat. The first problem is that organic farming offers half or less of the yield from the good mainstream farms supported by chemicals. Worse than that, the world lacks the organic nitrogen to implement organic farming on a broad scale. Nor is organic farming as sustainable as high-yield farming! If it requires twice as much cropland, it would yield more than twice as much soil erosion. Moreover, organic farming has nothing comparable to the soil- saving powers of the best new high-yield farming systems that use all technical inventions of mankind. High-yield agriculture is all that has provided food for mankind in a way, that prevented radical reductions in world wildlife habitat in the midst of the rising populations and incomes. Because of high-yields, we are currently feeding literally twice as many people as the world supported in the 1950s - on almost the same cropland base used in the 50s. In 1955, the world was cropping 1,352 billion hectares. Today, the total is only 1,444 billion - a mere 6 percent increase</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Adding up the impact The researchers calculated emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, converting the amounts of the latter two gases into the quantities of carbon dioxide that would have an equivalent impact on the atmosphere, to facilitate comparison of total greenhouse gas outputs. Burney, a postdoctoral researcher with the Program on Food Security and the Environment at Stanford, said agriculture currently accounts for about 12 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Although greenhouse gas emissions from the production and use of fertilizer have increased with agricultural intensification, those emissions are far outstripped by the emissions that would have been generated in converting additional forest and grassland to farmland. &quot;Every time forest or shrub land is cleared for farming, the carbon that was tied up in the biomass is released and rapidly makes its way into the atmosphere – usually by being burned,&quot; she said. &quot;Yield intensification has lessened the pressure to clear land and reduced emissions by up to 13 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year.&quot; &quot;When we look at the costs of the research and development that went into these improvements, we find that funding agricultural research ranks among the cheapest ways to prevent greenhouse gas emissions,&quot; said Steven Davis, a co-author of the paper and a postdoctoral researcher at the Carnegie Institution at Stanford. To evaluate the impact of yield intensification on climate change, the researchers compared actual agricultural production between 1961 and 2005 with hypothetical scenarios in which the world's increasing food needs were met by expanding the amount of farmland rather than by the boost in yields produced by the Green Revolution. &quot;Even without higher yields, population and food demand would likely have climbed to levels close to what they are today,&quot; said David Lobell, also a coauthor and assistant professor of environmental Earth system science at Stanford. &quot;Lower yields per acre would likely have meant more starvation and death, but the population would still have increased because of much higher birth rates,&quot; he said. &quot;People tend to have more children when survival of those children is less certain.&quot;</span><br />

<span class="Underline">Stanford News Service 10 [June 14, 2010“High-yield agriculture slows pace of global warming, say Stanford researchers”]</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Avoiding the need for more farmland The researchers found that without the advances in high-yield agriculture, several billion additional acres of cropland would have been needed. Comparing emissions in the theoretical scenarios with real-world emissions from 1961 to 2005, the researchers estimated that the actual improvements in crop yields probably kept greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to at least 317 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, and perhaps as much as 590 billion tons. Without the emission reductions from yield improvements, the total amount of greenhouse gas pumped into the atmosphere over the preceding 155 years would have been between 18 and 34 percent greater than it has been, they said. To calculate how much money was spent on research for each ton of avoided emissions, the researchers calculated the total amount of agricultural research funding related to yield improvements since 1961 through 2005. That produced a price between approximately $4 and $7.50 for each ton of carbon dioxide that was not emitted. &quot;The size and cost-effectiveness of this carbon reduction is striking when compared with proposed mitigation options in other sectors,&quot; said Lobell. &quot;For example, strategies proposed to reduce emissions related to construction would cut emissions by a little less than half the amount that we estimate has been achieved by yield improvements and would cost close to $20 per ton.&quot; The authors also note that raising yields alone won't guarantee lower emissions from land use change. &quot;It has been shown in several contexts that yield gains alone do not necessarily stop expansion of cropland,&quot; Lobell said. &quot;That suggests that intensification must be coupled with conservation and development efforts. &quot;In certain cases, when yields go up in an area, it increases the profitability of farming there and gives people more incentive to expand their farm. But in general, high yields keep prices low, which reduces the incentive to expand.&quot; The researchers concluded that improvement of crop yields should be prominent among a portfolio of strategies to reduce global greenhouse gases emissions. &quot;The striking thing is that all of these climate benefits were not the explicit intention of historical investments in agriculture. This was simply a side benefit of efforts to feed the world,&quot; Burney noted. &quot;If climate policy intentionally rewarded these kinds of efforts, that could make an even bigger difference. The question going forward is how climate policy might be designed to achieve that.&quot; David Lobell is a Center Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies and at the Woods Institute for the Environment. The Program on Food Security and the Environment is a joint project of the Woods Institute and the Freeman Spogli Institute.
