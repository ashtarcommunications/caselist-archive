Homegrown radicalization key to terror attacks – they’re invaluable terrorist assets<br />

<span style="font-size: 5pt;">Rick “Ozzie” Nelson is a former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot with over 20 years of operational and intelligence experience, including assignments at the National Security Council and the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). He recently served in Afghanistan. He is senior fellow and director of the Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program at CSIS. He joined CSIS in September 2009, after retiring from the U.S. Navy, where he served in a variety of senior policy and operational positions. His last military assignment was with the Joint Special Operations Command. In 2005, he was selected to serve as an inaugural member in the National Counterterrorism Center’s Directorate of Strategic Operational Planning. Prior to his assignment at NCTC, he served as associate director for maritime security in the Office of Combating Terrorism on the National Security Council staff at the White House, where he led the development of the National Strategy for Maritime Security. Other career assignments have included counterterrorism team leader in Deep Blue, the navy’s operational think tank created after September 11; navy legislative fellow for Senator Edward M. Kennedy; assistant aviation officer community manager; and flag aide in Okinawa, Japan, to the commander of naval amphibious forces in the Western Pacific. He is operationally trained in naval helicopter strike warfare in the SH-60B Seahawk and SH-2F Seasprite helicopters, and he has deployed around the world and flown in support of numerous operations. Nelson graduated from the George Washington University in 1989 with a B.A. in political science, holds an M.A. in national security studies from Georgetown University, and is a graduate of the Naval War College. He is also an adjunct lecturer at Georgetown University, where he teaches courses on homeland security and counterterrorism. Ben Bodurian is research assistant and program coordinator for the Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program at CSIS. In this capacity, he works with the program director to analyze new and unconventional threats to U.S. and global security in the twenty-first century. He and Rick “Ozzie” Nelson have coauthored multiple opinion pieces on U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. They also presented a paper, “Academia and Policy: Enhancing Cooperation, Increasing Understanding,” at the February 2010 International Studies Association conference in New Orleans. Ongoing projects include studies on international approaches to border security and the future of U.S. counterterrorism policy. Prior to joining CSIS, he concluded a year-long, nonresident Presidential Fellowship with the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, where he presented a research paper on the Nixon administration’s strategy to end the Vietnam War. He holds a B.A. magna cum laude in history and political science from Williams College. </span><br />

Coon 1/2/11 <br />
My name is Carleton Coon. I am the author of these essays, except as otherwise noted, and the owner/manager of this website. I am a retired US diplomat living in Washington Virginia, and in Washington DC. I was born in 1927, graduated from Harvard in 1949 (after serving briefly in the US Army at the end of World War II), and joined the US Foreign Service that same year. 37 years of government service saw me posted in a variety of countries stretching from Morocco to Nepal. From 1981-1984 I was US Ambassador to Nepal. I retired in 1985. After retirement I rediscovered some old interests that I had had little time to pursue during my diplomatic career. Music was one, mostly western classical but also non-western. With the help of rapidly evolving computer programs I composed a number of works, mostly chamber and piano. Meanwhile I renewed an old interest in human evolution, which I had inherited from my anthropologist father, and traveled widely in parts of the world I had not previously visited. I wrote essays on the human condition and several books. My interests increasingly focused on humanism and I became involved with the American Humanist Association. In 2004 I was elected to the AHA Board and shortly afterwards became AHA’s Vice President. I served as VP for five years, then retired (for the second time) and turned to family, writing, and further reflection on the human condition. <br />
