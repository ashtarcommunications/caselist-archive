<strong>The body, identity, and subjectivity are all fluid. we are constantly moving through geographies, breaking down the boundaries between that which is self and that which is other. This fluidity is feminized and otherized, which maintains masculinity.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Longhurst '1</strong> (Robyn. <em>Geography and the Body: Exploring Fluid Boundaries</em>, 2001, pg.19-20)<br />
<br />
&quot;...how the body acts........to systems of signification.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Confronting sexual difference through the abject is key. The abject and the feminine signify boundaries that exist spatially and create worry about contamination within our borders.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Longhurst '1</strong> (Robyn. <em>Geography and the Body: Exploring Fluid Boundaries</em>, 2001, pg.28-32)<br />
<br />
&quot;Following Anne McClintock's.........and through sex/gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Immigrants have come to represent that contamination in our liminal space. The construction of them as the abject, to be &quot;cleaned up,&quot; results in dehumanization and material violence against the immigrant in order to normalize and purify otherwise fluid identities.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cisernos '8</strong> (J. David, &quot;Contaminated Communities: The Metaphor of 'Immigrant as Pollutant' in Media Representations of Immigration,&quot; <em>Rhetoric and Public Affairs</em>, 11.4, 2008.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Even as this metaphoric..........and non-immigrants alike.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>These pure forms of subjectivity are coded by masculinity -- it creates &quot;neutral&quot; ideal forms of citizenship that are abstracted from more feminine and fluid forms of subjectivity -- this makes politics impossible.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Caldwell '2</strong> (Anne. &quot;Transforming Sacrifice: Irigaray and the Politics of Sexual Difference,&quot; <em>Hypatia</em>, 17.4, 2002.)<br />
<br />
&quot;For Irigaray, the institution.......for an undifferentiated citizenry.&quot;<br />
<br />

<strong>You should vote for whoever has the best relationship to subjectivity. We say that is one that embraces the fluid, abject, feminine subject.</strong>
