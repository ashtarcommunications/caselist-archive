<strong>Let the Right one in K</strong><br />
Framework - Immigration Advocacy Trope Analysis is a necessary starting point for debating policy reform – Our alternative is best understood as Critical Policy Analysis<br />

Why the 1AC is Bad<br />
The 1AC should be understood in historical context – the US Empire was built on the backs of immigrants and maintained via their instrumentalization<br />
Lovato ‘8 <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">[Roberto, New America Media, <em>The Public Eye Magazine</em>, v23, #1 Spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v23n1/immigrant_crackdowns.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v23n1/immigrant_crackdowns.html</a>]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<br />
The 1AC’s economic advantages are just another version of the transcontinental railroad – ethnocentric motivations masked by claims of inclusiveness. The AFF wrongly posits its advocacy in opposition to xenophobia, when in reality the two go hand in hand<br />
