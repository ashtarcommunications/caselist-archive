 The American immigration system only seeks to accept the normal immigrant body inside its borders while rejecting the applications of the queer body in hopes of removing a threat from the outside. This creates a normative mode of thought that extends to all aspects of America. This causes the creation of normative spaces that explicitly eliminates the queer body.<br />

<br />
The heteronormativity that allows for the exclusion of queer bodies has permeated into this year’s debate community. The resolution only allows for us to focus on legal migration, forcing participants of the activity to prioritize bodies that are already deemed worthy to enter. This forces the question of the queer body out of the resolution. The resolution forces judges to play the role of the Immigration Services and the debaters borders security, policing ourselves and making sure we include the “good” policy debater that talks about the resolution, and forcing those “queer” debaters that aren’t topical out of the discussion.<br />

<br />
Chas and I know something about heteronormativity:<br />
Welcome to Liberty University, we have a football field where you can play smear the queer, a little white chapel where as long you don’t got the same parts we can unite your hearts, our counseling department is pretty good if you are ever feeling gay, oh Liberty where rainbow flags aren’t permitted unless it has to do with Noah’s ark, you also want to be careful when you are on our campus because if you admit to being a queer lover you might as well be a queer, we host a conference titled “Understanding Same-sex Attractions and Their Consequences,” that teaches you how to counsel same sex lovers and what the implication of their existence is on our society. You see Chas and I are the queer body in this debate round and outside of it on our campus, we are the illegal immigrants that the resolution leaves out this what acts as invisible centers in which heteronormativity is able to take charge and cause the normalization of the queer body. This allows for the continued domination, marginalization, and eradication of individuals not seen as fit to be within its framework.<br />

Do not care about the future of the debate community – tieing ourselves to resolution prevents the queer body from being recognized. You must focus on the here and now in order to form restiance against the dominant power structures.<br />

Advocacy Statement: Chas and I advocate affirming the anti citizen<br />
<br />
From our position of privilege we must reject the traditional ideas of the normal immigrant in favor of the anti-citizen. Through this radical queering of the heteronormative structures we are able to undermine the process of normalization produced by them<br />

<br />
The 1AC is a coming out experience for the debate community. Through the queering of this year’s resolution we are able to suspend the anticipation of the future and open up a space that will allow for us to rupture the heteronormativity that is reproduced in this space, round after round and tournament after tournament. We will sever off the head of reason and lift the anxiety the queer body brings to our community.<br />

<u>A sharp decline in farmworkers suggests a looming labor shortage. USDA counted 70,000 fewer farmworkers between April 2007 and April 2008</u>. The 7% drop is attributed partly to a slow spring start across rain-soaked regions from the Mississippi Delta to the Corn Belt. But dry areas...Calif., Fla., Rocky Mountains...had thousands fewer, too. <u>With high profile raids and other actions</u> taken against illegals, <u>there's no doubt that pressure on undocumented workers has an effect.

Fourth, their interpretation focuses on how to make debate the best political game for the best output. That is based within an ideology of effectiveness and those that do not meet the requirements are excluded. This justifies the elimination of the queer. There is no way to criticize or question the structures of the topic when the interpretation normalizes the sexual identity of the citizen.

Queer Citizenship 1AC<br />
<br />
We read a narrative about a transgendered individual at the top of our 1AC to give a face to the effects of heteronormativity T<br />
<br />
he American immigration system only seeks to accept the normal immigrant body inside its borders while rejecting the applications of the queer body in hopes of removing a threat from the outside. This creates a normative mode of thought that extends to all aspects of America. This causes the creation of normative spaces that explicitly eliminates the queer body. Brown et al 07. (Kath Browne is Lecturer in the School of the Environment, University of Brighton, UK. Jason Lim is Lecturer in Geography at the University of Southampton, UK. Gavin Brown is at Kings College London, UK., Geographies of Sexualities. Pg. 3-4, google books). Jt The spaces that we can understand … in a given place.<br />
<br />
The heteronormativity that allows for the exclusion of queer bodies has permeated into this year’s debate community. The resolution only allows for us to focus on legal migration, forcing participants of the activity to prioritize bodies that are already deemed worthy to enter. This forces the question of the queer body out of the resolution. The resolution forces participants to play the role of the Immigration Services, policing ourselves and making sure we include the “good” policy debater that talks about the resolution, and forcing those “queer” debaters that aren’t topical out of the discussion. Luibheid, Professor of ethnic studies at Bowling Green State University, 2002. (Eithne., Entry Denied: Controlling Sexuality at the Border, 2002, pg 138-139). jt My focus on sexuality directly … immigration processes operate<br />
<br />
The resolution and the immigration system both act as invisible centers in which heteronormativity is able to take charge and cause the normalization of the queer body. This allows for the continued domination, marginalization, and eradication of individuals not seen as fit to be within its framework. Yep, Professor of Communication Studies at San Francisco State University, 2004. (Gust A., Ph.D. in Communication.,<br />
