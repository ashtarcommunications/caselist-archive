Contention Two – Racism -<br />
<br />
Biometrics perpetuate global inequality by disproportionately targeting groups perceived as foreign and increasing the costs of global migration for lesser developed countries.<br />
<strong>Thomas 5</strong> (Rebekah, Associate Policy Officer, Global Commission on International Migration, “Biometrics, international migrants and human rights,” Global Migration Perspectives, No. 17, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gcim.org/gmp/Global%20Migration%20Perspectives%20No%2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcim.org/gmp/Global%20Migration%20Perspectives%20No%2017.pdf</a>)<br />
Existing evidence demonstrates...ever more impenetrable.38<br />
<br />
Collection of biometric identifiers for the topically designated visas reproduces a silent system of whiteness – continued development, application and rationalization for this program authorizes unlimited violence.</span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">How can epidermalization...neo-pastoral governance practices.<br />
<br />
Racism is the foundation of all warfare and genocide – their DA scenarios are all inevitable in a world in which we fail to challenge the state’s use of racism as a means to motivate violence.<br />

<br />
Contention Three – The State of Exception -<br />
<br />
Biometric visas constitute us all as individual security threats to the State, allowing the sovereign to globalize war as a permanent condition. Individual resistance is not enough to strike at the heart of this biopolitical relationship that that allows the indefinite suspension of oversight and accountability.<br />
<strong>Gates 8</strong> (Kelly, Assistant Professor of Communication at University of California-San Diego, “Biometric Registration: The Liquidation of US Democracy?” Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, 5(2)<br />
Giorgio Agamben’s decision...been effectively suspended.<br />
<br />
Lack of public debate about biometric visas is precisely what unleashes the state of exception through surveillance. We must actualize protection against biometrics in order to resist the racialized and militarized subjugation that has become routinized in everyday life.<br />
<strong>Yadav 9</strong> (Vikash, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, “Biometrics and Biopolitics,” August 18, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afghannotebook.blogspot.com/2009/08/biometrics-and-biopolitics.html" rel="nofollow">http://afghannotebook.blogspot.com/2009/08/biometrics-and-biopolitics.html</a>)<br />
One of the...even at home.<br />
<br />
Biopolitics requires the elimination of all possible threats by mobilizing the population to ensure the preservation of our way of life – the logical endpoint of this double sided thinking is extinction of entire populations.<br />

</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Contention Four – Securitization</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Biometrics represent a unique nexus of industry and intelligence that creates products touted as the solution to international security and terrorism. Such efforts allow the unsolicited collection of information to be compared to watch lists, even though such identities may have no dangerous affiliation whatsoever.</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Zureik 4</strong> (Elia, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Queen’s University (Canada), with Contribution from Karen Hindle, “Governance, Security and Technology: The Case of Biometrics,” Studies in Political Economy, Vol. 73, Spring/Summer)</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Promoting Biometrics: The...other transportation employees.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Even if biometrics themselves don’t threaten immigrants, the perception created renders the individual subservient to the idea of national security. This paves the way for more unthinkable invasions by the State under the guise of security.</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Thomas 5</strong> (Rebekah, Associate Policy Officer, Global Commission on International Migration, “Biometrics, international migrants and human rights,” Global Migration Perspectives, No. 17, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gcim.org/gmp/Global%20Migration%20Perspectives%20No%2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcim.org/gmp/Global%20Migration%20Perspectives%20No%2017.pdf</a>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The driving force behind...this overriding priority.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Securitization creates a cycle of limitless use of violence, makes war a permanent feature of politics, and alienates us from the world.</span><br />

Contention Five – Solvency -<br />
<br />
Political action and public debate is critical to restoring accountability for the use of biometrics – this is the only way to provide comprehensive solutions to the problems biometrics are meant to solve.<br />
<strong>Petermann et al 6</strong> (Thomas, Arnold Sauter and Constanze Scherz, “Biometrics at the Borders: The Challenges of a Political Technology,” International Review of Law Computers and Technology, 20 (1/2)<br />
The path of the...citizens are necessary.<br />

The political possibilities...identity is articulated.”<br />
<br />
A public commitment to oppose biometrics is critical to stopping the combined power of corporations and the national security state that threatens to impose repressive subjugation. Now is the key time – full imposition of biometrics will undermine the scope for effective opposition.<br />
<strong>Clarke 1</strong> (Roger, Visiting Fellow, Department of Computer Science, Australian National University, “Biometrics and Privacy,” 4/15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rogerclarke.com/DV/Biometrics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rogerclarke.com/DV/Biometrics.html</a>)<br />

Contention One – Inherency – <br />
Under the promise of security and objectivity, the US requires biometric data collection for all visa applicants.<br />

The United States...re-considered without prejudice.<br />
<br />
Expanded use of biometrics are at the center of immigration reform proposals – legislation won’t pass without it – these will be used to identify all eligible workers in the US.<br />

Interest is growing....according to Graham.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – Racism –<br />
We’ll isolate three internal links – <br />
First is <u>Deportation</u> –<br />
Homeland Security will identify 95 percent of those deemed ‘illegal immigrants’ as it expands biometrics nationwide. This connects the drug war with immigration debates, spilling over to justify racism and deportation of the entire immigrant population.<br />

<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 10pt;">The Department of Homeland Security....immigration reform,” he said.</span><br />
Second is <u>Whiteness</u> – <br />
Biometrics are structurally calibrated to record the white identity – non-white identity is cast into the realm of irregularity or glitch. This classification of identity around a norm of whiteness underpins the hierarchical construction of race that renders certain bodies unimportant and thus non-representable.<br />

<u>In order to</u>...scanning of subjects.<br />
<br />
Third is <u>Inequality</u> – <br />
Biometrics perpetuate global inequality by disproportionately targeting groups perceived as foreign and increasing the costs of global migration for lesser developed countries.<br />

Existing evidence demonstrates...ever more impenetrable.38<br />
<br />
Next, the impacts – <br />
Racism is the foundation of all warfare and genocide – their DA scenarios are all inevitable in a world in which we fail to challenge the state’s use of racism as a means to motivate violence.<br />

The struggle against....stakes are irresistible.<br />
<br />
THUS THE PLAN:<br />
<span style="display: block; font-size: 12pt;">The United States Federal Government should prohibit the collection of biometric data as a means of determining beneficiary eligibility for its employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family visas and human trafficking-based visas.</span><br />
Contention Three – Solvency – <br />
A public commitment to oppose biometrics is critical to stopping the combined power of corporations and the national security state that threatens to impose repressive subjugation. Now is the key time – full imposition of biometrics will undermine the scope for effective opposition.<br />

Biometrics is one...be drastically reduced. <br />
<br />
Political action and public debate is critical to restoring accountability for the use of biometrics – this is the only way to provide comprehensive solutions to the problems biometrics are meant to solve.<br />
