 Resist the attempt to take everything and lay the world open to analysis. We must maintain the intelligence of mystery or suffer planetary symbolic extinction<br />
Baudrillard 2010 CARNIVAL AND CANNIBAL p70-3<br />
In the promethean perspective ….. the intelligence of the mystery<br />
NOTES: Science was to assign meaning to everything, reveal all that is concealed, production of meaning destroys the inviolable, should not we try to restrain the production of meaning, we do this with thinking – not analysis, but understanding or intelligence of the mystery<br />
<br />
Debate and your arguments are structured based on accumulation and acceleration. The amassing of evidence, info, and truth only makes the world more unreal and dissuasive. The excess of all systems only paves the world to violent reversion<br />
Baudrillard 5 INTELLIGENCE OF EVIL OR THE LUCIDITY PACT p192-3<br />
Every process growing …. Cancels itself out<br />
NOTES: Each process creates barriers, accumulation of data produces more uncertainty (unreality), every excess creates the opposite of what it intends (excessive health focus = new viruses, for example), the shock wave going the opposite direction is bigger and more than cancels itself<br />
<br />
Like meaning, criticism is categorically unhappy and hopefless. In order to attain hope or happiness, we muyst affirm illusion as it is created by the medium of language itself. This is the only (political or optimistic) act which remains in a world which transforms itself more than we care capable for transforming it<br />
Baudrillard 96 THE PERFECT CRIME p 102-4<br />
It is not a question …. Cannot be resolved<br />
NOTES: each idea is presumed guilty and should disappear if it cannot defend itself, critics fight at the level of ideas, radical thought would INSTEAD accept mystery. <br />
<br />
The lack of theory is to unmask the illusion of the objective and causal reality. Epistemological claims that claim to mirror the reality of the world are illusion. Bet on radical illusion. <br />
Baudrillard 5 THE INTELLIGENCE OF EVIL p40-1<br />
The task of philosophy …. Part of the object it reflects<br />
NOTES: The purpose of the world is not for us to know it. Reality out there has no necessary relation to knowledge. We know the world through a mirror, but the mirror becomes part of the object it reflects. <br />

James and I affirm the “resolved colon”: The USFG should substantially expending beneficiary ellegibility for and/or substantially reduce restrictions for employment based immigrant visas/non-employment based migrant visas/human trafficking based visas/family based visas.<br />
<br />
Our 1AC affirms the topic from the zero zone which is produced by the fulfillment of the resolution. The argument is that whenever any logic, mission statement or even resolution is carried through to its fulfillment we find these places where logic reverses itself.<br />
<br />
Stop picking on Kirt. We're serious. If he wants to be a homo, it's up to him.<br />
<br />
“I am ashamed of what I tell them: that they should indeed worry about making an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true. Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control. Once you have been sexually encroached upon by a professor, your faith in your work corrodes. If the administration knew and did nothing—because the teacher was valuable to them—they had made a conscious calculation about his and our respective futures: It was okay to do nothing because I—and other young women who could be expected to remain silent—would never be worth what someone like Bloom was worth. … Then, more women began to call me, several of whom had followed the university’s grievance procedures and were dismayed with what they felt to be bureaucratic stonewalling, and even the use of the procedures to protect faculty and the university at the student’s expense. …. But sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is, most seriously, a corruption of meritocracy; it is in this sense parallel to bribery. I was not traumatized personally, but my educational experience was corrupted. If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil-rights and civil-society issue, everything becomes less emotional, less personal. If we see this as a systemic-corruption issue, then when people bring allegations, the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission. The Catholic Church is a good example: The public understood that church leaders’ maintaining silence about systemic sexual transgressions corrupted the mission of an organization that had a great responsibility to society as a whole. Even the military is starting to understand that systemic sexual harassment of cadets corrupts its social mission. If we change the framework to this kind of transparency and accountability question, then instead of asking, 'What were you wearing?' or 'Why disrupt this man’s life?” we would ask: “What are we—together—going to do about it?'”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should clarify the “extraordinary ability” standard of O, P, and EB-1 visas to apply to all professional athletes, regardless of country of origin.<br />

“Plan”: Against this silencing gesture, Derek and I approach the resolution. Each year we encounter a resolution with our peers. It is meant to ground a debate into a set parameter and construct an ideal predictable, researchable set of arguments in order to create a stable debate. Each year debaters grapple with its meaning, never touching the surface of the entirety of the resolution. Some make it submit to our idea of how the story of a debate should be told by objective policy analysts. Against this tradition Derek and I affirm the trauma of the resolution and speak the betrayal of our very community:<br />
Resolved: the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for one or more of the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, human trafficking-based visas.<br />
Against the idea of a perfect set of language games to affirm the resolution we assert the un-speak-ability of the resolution. Our affirmation is a bearing witness to trauma and the inability to speak the reality of the world—it is a respect for difference and alterity within the resolution and is a solidarity with the stories unable to be told by the immigrant survivors of exploitation and oppression. This is our witnessing of Abner’s torture.<br />

<strong>-Spreading Link and Impact</strong><br />
<strong>Oversaturation of information systems to the point of absolute inertia – too many cards, not enough time; too many causes, not enough effects; too many messages, no meaning</strong><br />
Baudrillard, 2009,. 34-36) <br />
<br />
“This process is not a critical one: crisis is always” …. “in fact a foreshadowing of this absolute inertia.” <br />
<br />
<strong>-Debate/acceleration link and impact</strong><br />
<strong>Debate and your arguments are structured based on accumulation and acceleration, the amassing of evidence, information and truth only makes the world more unreal and dissuasive. The excess of all systems only paves the world to violent reversion.</strong><br />
Baudrillard, 2005, (“The Intelligence of Evil or the Lucidity Pact”, Pg. 192-193) <br />
<br />
“Every process growing exponentially generates a barrier: the speed barrier” … “negative horizon, and beyond which it cancels itself out.” <br />
<strong>-Death is Everywhere – Function, Value, Information</strong><br />
<strong>-Link and Impact</strong><br />
<strong>Death functions in the reduction of things to inert objects of knowledge defined by their value. Universal equivalence only proves no unique value. Information itself only serves as a testimony to the grand meaninglessness of our civilization. Buried under mountains of information, all the world has become a museum.</strong><br />
Baudrillard, 1976, (“Symbolic Exchange and Death”, Pg. 185, Sage Publications) <br />
<br />
“Pursued and censured everywhere, death springs up everywhere” …. “reaches the point of no return when it is nothing more than a system of writing.” <br />
<strong>-Nukes Link and Impact</strong><br />
<strong>The spectral threat of nuclear war is itself part of a system of deterrence which neutralizes all events, including the real possibility of nuclear war. This is an implosive violence; the balance of terror is the terror of balance. That all things must be quilted through the nuclear issues marks its function as a simulacrum to conceal the death of politics</strong><br />
Baudrillard, 2006, (“Simulacra and Simulation”, University of Michigan Press, Pg. 32-34) <br />
<br />
“The apotheosis of simulation: the nuclear. However, the balance” …. “only simulacra of conflicts and carefully circumscribed stakes remain.” <br />
<strong>-Economy Link and Impact</strong><br />
<strong>The economy only exists as a hyper-real simulacrum based on financial speculation. This is the true abolition of the political economy beyond the prophecies of Marx: an ecstasy of value without referent, an empty form of destabilization which consumes money itself</strong><br />
Baudrillard, 2009 (“The Transparency of Evil”, Pgs. 37-39) <br />
<br />
“Not the least of paradoxes, given this context, is to see the economy” … “wild bull market, is fundamentally far more original than all our old political utopias.” <br />
<br />
<strong>-Catastrophic Death Link and Impact</strong><br />
<strong>While death is an inevitable part of life, the preference for catastrophic death encased in virtual artifice betrays a symbolic economy in which group identity is founded by devouring the deaths of others. Not only does this economy make ‘natural’ or non-catastrophic deaths meaningless but it also makes us all hostages in which our card may be pulled, willed by the collective group to die. To identify death as the locus of the real is to transform our bodies into flesh caskets.</strong><br />
Baudrillard 1976, (“Symbolic Exchange and Death”, Pg. 164-166, Sage Publications) <br />
<br />
“Why is it that today there are no expected and foreseen deaths” … “ everything else: no longer willing to give or receive it, death encircles us in the biological simulacrum of our own body.” <br />
<strong>-Criticism Link and Impact / AT: Your Nihilists</strong><br />
<strong>Like meaning, criticism is categorically unhappy and hopeless. In order to attain hope or happiness, we must affirm illusion as it is created by the medium of language itself. This is the only (political and optimistic) act which remains in a world which transforms itself more than we are capable of transforming it.</strong><br />
Baudrillard, 1996, (“The Perfect Crime”, Verso, Pg. 102-104) <br />
<br />
“It is not a question of defending radical thought. Every idea one defends” … “only is its charm lost, but the meaning itself cannot be resolved.” <br />
<br />
<strong>-Role of theory – illusion</strong><br />
<strong>The task of theory is to unmask the illusion of the objective and causal reality. Epistemological claims that claim to mirror the reality of the world are illusion. Bet on radical illusion.</strong><br />
Baudrillard, 2005, (“The Intelligence of Evil, Or The Lucidity Pact Berg”, Pg. 40-41) <br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt;">“The task of philosophy is to unmask this illusion to objective” ,,,, “objective truth, since the mirror is part of the object it reflects.” </span><br />

 <strong><u>Rough Draft of 1NC vs Texas ML Wonderful Aff</u></strong><br />
Mystery define now?<br />
Question? Source? <br />
The mist stares back at you?<br />
Biological order- borjas<br />
Little by little they will not imitate us- baudrilliard 98- singular light of representation mirror. No mirror is true. Every image has been obliterated. All those images will be abrupt. What will come? A new victory. Something order. Negative fatality…. Passive fatality. <br />
4th I took a photo of you-<br />
Identity- anarchy. Only the photo is more toggling of the text. Without the photo there is no meaning but it is also an object of meaning. Baudrilliard.<br />
Neither is key to the other. Both are important not mutually enforcing though. <strong>Ironic</strong>. Mauntage makes aesthically meaningful. <br />
Identifying with each other. Symbolic order. Exhaustion- baudrilliard 98<br />
Subject trasnculent evil. Bends willingless. Disobeys all legislation. Social order should be reexamined. Most baligned. Secretly takes disobedience. This is a poor conductor of the sovereign order.<br />
You can’t interrogate us and you can’t interrogate yourselves. Probably means you shouldn’t cross x us. <br />
“I will not be your mirror”<br />
You will be our mirror. Our favorite disappearance act.<br />
Screw research projects. Behind research creates uncertainty. Their wonder is nothing more than uncertainty.<br />
Conceals nothing- baudrilliard 98<br />
Saturation is fatal creates inertia. Divise for handling data. Condition demonic pregnancy. So many messages can never be read. Hyper trophy world. Single idea generated. All we have brutal. Crucial desaturation..<br />
This piece of evidence is not substantive but poetic baudrilliard 98-<br />
Deserves to disappear. Never takes into account. Juggling of meaning is unhappy. They are both born of critical disillusion. Discourse and language always creates illusion. Poetic singularity. Objectivity. Language disparatiy of such tegious. Voluntaristic thought of despair. Infinite trap. Superconductor of meaning and non-meaning.<br />
Cross-x us and you probably will lose.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>CX</u></strong><br />
Why vote neg?<br />
Because we do the performance of your aff better- What’s the performance of your aff again?<br />
What is the role of the PIC?<br />
We stole your objectivity.<br />
Text has no meaning unless it is part of the image- ironic force.<br />
Separate from their mirroring arguments.<br />
Q: What about the world makes it that we have to reverse the binary?<br />
The identity is enigmatic. Polysegmic bad. <br />
The world understands us. We don’t understand it. <br />
Exhaustions good- probably good because it pushes us to the limit. Exhaustion makes events possible again.<br />
<h3 id="toc36"><a name="Plans-Team Name Neg Loyola Maramount-Block Strategy:"></a>Block Strategy:</h3>
 Your attempt to rupture is the bloodlife of politics. You maintain the metastasis of debate. The profusion of research in their claims. We will never claim to be an event. The 1ac was not an event to remaster the world. Just like the cx arguments. We are the crack. That interplay allows the maintenance of the model. You are the positivism of the wonder. Our links are based on exhaustion. Those pushing of the forms of exhaustion that causes its collapse and reversion and mystery that creates wonder. The relation that minatenance that allows simulations to take hold. Not one card or answer in the 2ac. Push those exhaustion through that creates a rupture point. We don’t claim it will change politics. It’s a singularity of mystery. Their bracketing of wonder. You shouldn’t bracket from the current world. We should maintain the objectivity of mystery. Everything signifies everything.<br />
Our evidence indicates criticism takes place allows the lifeline. Maintain that relation. That image is the best form function together unknowing of the other. We are the surrealistic play that allows the other. <br />
We are not alliance policing. You bracket of what is wonderful and meaning. How do you determine what is meaning?<br />
We are better mirror. We are not narcissistic. That rupture access humanism argument is better. The notion of the body is not a symbolic argument. That calculations in the form of acceleration destroys the meaning you take out of wonder.<br />
We have stolen that gfinite encounter. We are more you than you.<br />
Whether those things can be wonderful. You link to those humanism arguments. <br />
Distinction between us and the object. Those things are reversible. You indicate that the subject a polar distinction of those two things. <br />
cx- AT: moment of curiosity to rethink- that attempt to render visible educes us to the subject<br />
AT: Perm- the 1ac is a subject. Mirroring. To permute is a form that creates symbolic nothing.2. even if – they can’t eliminate the link arguments about form about social sciences, evidence, research, their notion of simulation simulacron the same way we exterminate non western cultures. Baudrilliard 96<br />
Exhaustion politics good because it reverses it and creates more wonderful than the aff-<br />
You have to win the univosity argument- that univocal meaning cannot be a non wonderful meaning. We define mystery. To maintain that uncertainty is an uncertain politics. Oppose the otherness. It is not negotiable.<br />
Perm western rationality universal rationalitization. Maintain singularity of wonder. <br />
We have not made a dubbling argument- we just said we are your mirror.<br />
We collapse your empirical subject. The 1ac inevitably falls back to the same certainty.<br />
The reason to vote negative .<br />
The 1ac presumptuous to say that you can rupture. <br />
We lay open the possibility the mystery to those events.<br />
You bracket off exhaustion.<br />
Borjas better strategy for political strategy. That use of poetics. Of singularity. Open to other interpretations. Misunderstood me already. You cannot confine us to meaning. Any attempt to do so in the 1ar is reason to confine.<br />
Their notion of body is captured by the image. There is no reason to bracket off exhaustion.<br />
Not about impacts but about the possibility of such. We are mystery. We maintain the mystery. You look at the abyss but the abyss stares back. <br />
<h3 id="toc37"><a name="Plans-Team Name Neg Loyola Maramount-2nr Strategy:"></a>2nr Strategy:</h3>
 No internal link to wonderful.<br />
Univosity of meaning.<br />
The reflection wins. Changing those expectations. The world made them do this. We proved the 1ac. We are the space of reflection that made this possible. We are the space. We are the relative speed of time. You are debating yourselves. Dope way of taking your 1ac.<br />
We don’t maintain metastasis. Probably vote neg on presumption.<br />
Stick them to the warrants of the 1ar.<br />
If you concede one link about mystery. <br />
We are the space that allows you to open the space of the aff.<br />
All our perm answers answers this<br />
1. not fucking warranted- their attempt to hug their own reflection. The alternative is something like a counter permutated. Means you cantreflect on things. <br />
2. this a form of certainty. Severance of their own meaning. This takes out meaning. Baudrilliard evidence. Trying to get their own reflection. Try to permute your own aff.<br />
We are not an alternative.<br />
The entirety of the 2ar will just argue with itself.<br />
Our advocacy is to push through. The 1ac was exhaustion bad. You cant leverage offense because we are not you. <br />
The relative speed of light. We are that lag. Absent us there is more certainty. You stand there in awe. <br />
Don’t double turn ourselves. They link just as much to their positivism argument. <br />

UNLV - vs. Harvard in Octos<br />
<br />
&quot;They read 7 baudrillard cards and argued that we are currently in an over saturation of meaning and information which makes things more unreal and meaningless and compared this to debate's use of evidence. They said this means suffering becomes the only real thing which justifies ethnic cleansing and military intervention. They read a card about nuclear war never happening because we like to play with scenarios of nuclear war happening too much. And that there were no events and politics was dead as a result. Finally they argued we should affirm illusion and word play in order to restore a form of optimism. <br />
<br />
They do not read cards in the block but instead just the tags and cites and argue that since the tags are quotes from the cards its fine.&quot; (This was not written by LMU)<br />
