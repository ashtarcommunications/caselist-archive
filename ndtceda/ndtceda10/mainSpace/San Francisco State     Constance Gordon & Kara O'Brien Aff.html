We read a narrative by a migrant named Olga from the book Underground America edited by Peter Osner in 2007. <br />
In the narrative, Olga talks about her transgendered daughter, Vica's experience being detained in a detention center. Vica is HIV/AIDS positive and is not given her medication. She eventually dies shackled to a hospital bed in the detention center, where her mother is unable to hug, hold or be with her daughter during this process. <br />
<br />
The narrative is followed by these cards...<br />
<br />
<br />
Current legal framework creates a barrier between the law and humanity. Behind that barrier is where it is legally justified to ignore the atrocities of immigration policy by hiding behind the law as the master solution for creating better future for the right to migrate, such as this years topic choosing visa policy as a focal point to solve for the violence that is immigration policy. <br />
Foucault, 1980.<br />
<br />
The current master narrative perpetuates the law as being neutral and objective, absent any moral relationship with those who are more effected by laws that protect or exclude them.<br />
Delgado, 2000<br />
<br />
PLANTEXT:<br />
Thus we affirm the invisible stories within and around USFG visa and immigration policy as a disruption of this years resolution which reads:<br />
&quot;Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for one of more of the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, and human trafficking visas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Olga’s skill level doesn’t fit into what is considered valuable labor under U.S. visa standards and the violence of detention centers is hidden behind our need to develop the proper legal solution to our visa inquiry. The 1AC is an act of making visible the unseen, to create material change on a moral, aesthetic and political level. <br />
Foucault 1980.<br />
<br />
Olga and Vica’s story is one like many others that falls beneath the cracks of the master narrative. We read this counter-story as the way to disrupt dominant narratives, to reallocate power away from the normative legal frameworks we are complacent under in the status quo. Even counter-stories, which expose the cruelty of immigration policies, have the ability to form a co-constitutive understanding and a more vital, ethical engagement with the lives that are affected the most in immigration discourse. <br />
Delgado, 2000<br />
<br />
Your ballot represents the affirmation of a counternarrative to current US immigration policy. Voting affirmative is the recognition that the personal is political and together our collaboration can create a new future story to rehumanize legal normativity. <br />

PLAN TEXT<br />
<br />
We believe that Levinas’ concept of the face allows us to be confronted with the precariousness of life. The face that demands our responsible political counteraction in understanding an ethical engagement that allows us to see behind the borders of immigration policy, which is why when we are confronted with Vica’s story, a new space can be re-imagined without violence. <br />
Butler 04 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Judith. Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence. Professor of rhetoric and comp. literature at the University of California, Berkely.) </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The encounter of the Other through the face reveals a certain violence which forbids a reduction to parallel and at the same time, install a responsibility for the Other in the Self. We must give up our complacency with immigration policy and enter the sphere of politics as one where the face of Olga confronts visa policy in order to invoke new desires to preserve life. <br />
Butler 04 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Judith. Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence. Professor of rhetoric and comp. literature at the University of California, Berkely.) </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Once locked down by visa policies, violence can be inflicted upon us forcing us to be intelligible identities. Categorizing visas is violent inflicted upon us by the USFG because they can determine who fits into the mold of a legal body. The face understands human suffering as a representation through the figure of the face, but is neither identified nor unidentified. The unintelligible quality of the face escapes the being captured by evil, queering the possibilities of violence being inflicted upon the other any longer. Precariousness allows unintelligible space. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By reading Olga’s story we are confronted with the face of immigration. Through an encounter with the other we can realize that the political subjectivity we maintain can only be redrafted as a call to responsible policy making. <br />

<br />
<strong>AND Miller cont…. Fashion makes people feel linked together and therefore less isolated. This brings people together and creates world peace.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Framework</u></strong> <br />
1. Interp: Policy debate means the negative has to be a non-competitive policy option that the AFF can permute. This is best for clash and ensures that the NEG never wins. <br />
2. Ground- There an infinite number of predictable k frameworks, k links and impacts. Forcing the AFF to debate in the neg framework moots the 1AC cuz it could literally be about anything. <br />
3. PLAN IN A VACUUM- Our f/w ensures a stable locus for the AFFs plan as the starting point while neg frameworks don’t talk about our plan which ensures debate confusion and makes judge intervention inevitable.<br />
4. Fairness: We should be able to weigh the ADV of the AFF to the NEG and then win.<br />
5. Education: Prefer the education of the AFF because it is about fashion models and they need education the most- this is best for post plan education. This is not the same but kind of like extra educational. <br />
6. Predictability: We should be able to know exactly what they are going to say in the 1NC. Pre-round disclosure checks abuse. They didn’t tell us they were going to run:___.<br />
7. Limits: This standard is just another reason you can’t say anything you want but we can say everything we want to.<br />
8. Bright-line: This is a voter.<br />
9. Shively says switch-side debate is the only way to establish terms that we both have in debate it’s a matter of starting points.<br />
10. Boggs says that this will cede to the political and the right will take over this means that there will be more republicans in the house and senate than the there were last year and next thing we know it they have the chief justice of the supreme court!!! This probably leads to nuclear war, oppression, exploitation, extinction. <br />
7. Framework is a voter for fairness, education, predictability, limits, bright-line, and interpretation. <br />
Framework is a pre-requisite to any other argument in the round. Except for the plan, and anything else the AFF says.<br />
