High total levels of immigrants have pushed public opinion to the brink of backlash because of lower levels of assimilation<br />
Husock 8 (Howard, vice president for policy research at the Manhattan Institute, where he is also director of its Social Entrepreneurship Initiative, former fellow at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. “Immigration: Bring Back Assimilation,” The Sun, May 13, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nysun.com/opinion/immigration-bring-back-assimilation/76347" rel="nofollow">http://www.nysun.com/opinion/immigration-bring-back-assimilation/76347</a>)<br />

<h2 id="toc5"><a name="Offcase-Consult NATO"></a><u><strong>Consult NATO</strong></u></h2>
 <br />
Text: Prior to the adoption of the plan, the United States will initiate a process of binding consultation with the NATO Alliance and will propose that: [plan]<br />
<br />
During consultation, the US will advocate the adoption of this proposal but will allow the NATO allies to propose modifications and alternative solutions. The US will implement the proposal as per the results of consultation. Funding and enforcement will be ensured - we'll clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
The counterplan competes –<br />
<br />
The counterplan is mutually exclusive – the 1AC ensures the immediate and unconditional implementation of the plan - any permutation that solves our net benefit must sever, which is a voting issue for reasons of ground and predictability.<br />
<br />
The counterplan is theoretically legitimate – <br />
<br />
It’s not topical – the counterplan tests the word “resolved” which means “to make a firm decision about,” it also test the word “should” which is “used to imply obligation or duty” – counterplans that test the resolution are key to predictable negative ground.<br />
[American Heritage Dictionary at dictionary.com]<br />
<br />
Consultation counterplans are legitimate – conditioning the plan is the only way to preserve the option of solving the case which checks unpredictable 2ac add-ons and plan clarifications. This risk is compounded by the aff monopoly on pre-round prep and structural advantages in late developing debates. <br />
<br />
The Net Benefit is Terrorism <br />

Genuine consultation with Europe is critical to maintain relations – and Europe wants US to cooperate with Palestine, Syria and Iran<br />

H1-B Case Arguments<br />
<br />
Turn: Domestic violence is widespread and increasing against the spouses of H1-B visa holders -- green card status is key to liberating women<br />
Sharmila Lodhia, Women's Studies Quarterly, Spring/Summer, 2010, p. 164-5<br />
&quot;In describing earlier patterns of gendered&quot; and &quot;citizens or legal permanent residents (Davis 2004).&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn: Lack of mobility means H-1B workers get exploited by employers -- green card status solves<br />
Paula Chakravartty, &quot;Weak Winners of Globalization&quot;, AAPI Nexus, 3.2., Winter 2005, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://people.umass.edu/pchakrav/research/publications/weak_winners.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://people.umass.edu/pchakrav/research/publications/weak_winners.pdf</a><br />
&quot;However, unlike a green card holder&quot; and &quot;or &quot;techno-slaves .&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn: H1-B visa is unethical because it subjects foreign workers to exploitation by giving corporations control over immigration status<br />
Roy Lawson, Immigration Daily, 2009, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.itpaa.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2215" rel="nofollow">http://www.itpaa.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=2215</a><br />

&quot;The greatest impetus for world peace&quot; and &quot;law in international relations.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Turn: H-1B program denies temporary workers individual freedom and political equality because they lack job mobility and citizenship rights<br />
Sharmila Rudrappa, University of San Francisco Law Review, Fall 2009, p. 371-2<br />
&quot;The liberal American state is built on&quot; and &quot;seen as inherently non-existent.&quot;<br />

First Priority/Give the Land Back <br />
<br />
The 1AC recognizes chattel slavery as an early form of immigration but remains silent in the face of the on-going colonization of native North America. The plan serves as a mask for the state, making it appear benevolent, even as its existence is contingent upon a continuing legacy of colonization that guarantees continued international exploitation, turning the case. <br />
Ward Churchill 1996 (Professor of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado, Boulder, BA and MA in Communications from Sangamon State, From A Native Son pgs 520 – 530) <br />
&quot;I'll debunk some of this nonsense&quot; and &quot;militaristic order on non-Indians.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Alternative is to reject the Affirmative and pursue indigenous land return as a first priority. This act of impossible realism solves the case—Colonization is the root cause of oppression, exploitation and war. Only a return to an indigenous politics can remedy the ills of colonialism. <br />

Studying Native Americans history as immigration history is critical to ask the question “Who is American?” – only our advocacy can break down sovereignty <br />
Kevin Kenny, Professor of History at Boston College, “Immigrants and Native Americans”, OUP Blog, June 18, 2009, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blog.oup.com/2009/06/immigrants-native-americans/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.oup.com/2009/06/immigrants-native-americans/</a><br />
&quot;Why do historians of American immigration need to study Native American history?&quot; and &quot;And that is the question that all historians of immigrant ask about the past.&quot;<br />
<br />
Native Americans are ignored on immigration and the theft of indigenous land is creating the conditions for immigration – you cannot solve without recognizing this <br />
Marta Donayre, co-founder of Love Sees No Borders and a member of the Leadership Council of the Bay Area Immigrant Rights Coalition, “Listen to the Native Americans on Immigration”, October 19, 2006, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.imdiversity.com/villages/native/politics_law/nam_native_immigration_1006.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdiversity.com/villages/native/politics_law/nam_native_immigration_1006.asp</a><br />

Denying Native American sovereignty claims allow whiteness and whiteness studies to continue to ignore Indigenous oppression by operation outside these structures <br />
Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Geonpul scholar and professor of indigenous studies at Queensland University of Technology, “Writing Off Treaties: White Possession in the United States Critical Whiteness Studies Literature” in Transnational Whiteness Matters, edited by Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Maryrose Casey, Fiona Jean Nicoll, 2008, p. 87 <br />
&quot;Within the United States of America the sovereignty&quot; and &quot;individualized rights framework accorded to this subject.&quot; <br />
<br />
The counterplan is a prior question -- The fact there is white possession of Native’s land is Natives are ignored in whiteness studies which predominately focus on the black/white dichotomy – only by giving the land back first can we even have this discussion <br />
Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Geonpul scholar and professor of indigenous studies at Queensland University of Technology, “Writing Off Treaties: White Possession in the United States Critical Whiteness Studies Literature” in Transnational Whiteness Matters, edited by Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Maryrose Casey, Fiona Jean Nicoll, 2008, p. 87 <br />
&quot;Indigenous sovereignties within the USA are excluded from the whiteness literature&quot; and &quot;fundamental both to its establishment and to its continued existence.&quot; <br />
<br />
White possession of native lands produces racism – this is a macro-level issue because failure to prioritize the fact that the US stole indigenous lands causes a sociodiscursive shift in ALL whiteness studies where “race” becomes synonymous with “black” and slavery becomes the proof of whiteness instead of the stolen land, which grants white privilege in the first place<br />
Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Geonpul scholar and professor of indigenous studies at Queensland University of Technology, “Writing Off Treaties: White Possession in the United States Critical Whiteness Studies Literature” in Transnational Whiteness Matters, edited by Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Maryrose Casey, Fiona Jean Nicoll, 2008, p. 90<br />
&quot;Despite the colonial history of the United States and racializing Native Americans in popular culture, as the embodiments of ‘redness,’ the whiteness literature makes a racial demarcation between African Americans and Native Americans.&quot; and &quot;This reflects a failure to address the sociodiscursive way that white possession functions to produce racism.&quot; <br />
<br />
White privlidge is based on stolen land – our advocacy is a prerequisite to solve <br />
Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Geonpul scholar and professor of indigenous studies at Queensland University of Technology, “Writing Off Treaties: White Possession in the United States Critical Whiteness Studies Literature” in Transnational Whiteness Matters, edited by Aileen Moreton-Robinson, Maryrose Casey, Fiona Jean Nicoll, 2008, p. 88<br />
&quot;Few Native American scholars&quot; and &quot;system based on racial inequality and stolen land.&quot;<br />

Colonization is the root cause of chattel slavery <br />
Ella Shohat, Professor of Cultural Studies and Women's Studies at New York University, and Robert Stam, University Professor at New York University, Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media, 1994, p. 77-8<br />
&quot;Prior to colonialism, slavery was traditionally based on the rationale of the “spoils of war,”&quot; and &quot;slavery was practiced against other groups such as Native Americans; it was not the exclusive “privilege” of Blacks&quot;<br />
<br />
Must insist on hierarchies—The Alternative must be a priority or it risks being neutralized as just any other political issue <br />
Ward Churchill 2003 (Professor of Ethnic Studies at University of Colorado, Boulder, BA and MA in Communications from Sangamon State, On the Justice of Roosting Chickens, Page 8) <br />
&quot;Turning to America’s vaunted “opposition,” we find record of not a single significant&quot; and &quot;the practice of proponents often suggests something far less noble.&quot;<br />
