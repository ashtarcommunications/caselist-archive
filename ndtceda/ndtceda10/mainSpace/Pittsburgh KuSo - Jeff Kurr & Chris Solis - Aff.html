<span class="Underline">These standard </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">assumptions—that remaining space rocks are few</span></span><span class="Underline">, and that encounters with planets were mainly confined to the past—</span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">are being upended</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. On March 18, 2004, for instance, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">a 30-meter asteroid</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> designated 2004 FH—a hunk potentially </span></span><span class="Underline">large enough to obliterate a city—</span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">shot past Earth, not far above the orbit occupied by telecommunications satellites</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (Enter “2004 FH” in the search box at Wikipedia and you can watch film of that asteroid passing through the night sky.) Looking at the broader picture, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">in</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> 19</span></span><span class="Underline">92</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span></span><span class="Underline">astronomers</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> David Jewitt, of the University of Hawaii, and Jane Luu, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, </span></span><span class="Underline">discovered the Kuiper Belt</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, a region of asteroids and comets that starts near the orbit of Neptune and extends for immense distances outward. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">At least 1,000 objects big enough to be seen from Earth have already been located there</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">These objects are 100 kilometers across or larger, much bigger than whatever dispatched the dinosaurs; space rocks this size are referred to as “planet killers” because their impact would likely end life on Earth. Investigation of the Kuiper Belt has just begun, but there appear to be substantially more asteroids in this region than in the asteroid belt, which may need a new name. Beyond the Kuiper Belt may lie the hypothesized Oort Cloud, thought to contain as many as trillions of comets. If the Oort Cloud does exist, the number of extant comets is far greater than was once believed. Some astronomers now think that short-period comets, which swing past the sun frequently, hail from the relatively nearby Kuiper Belt, whereas comets whose return periods are longer originate in the Oort Cloud. But if large numbers of comets and asteroids are still around, several billion years after the formation of the solar system</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span></span><span class="Underline">wouldn’t they by now be in stable orbits—ones that rarely intersect those of the planets?</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Maybe not. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">During the past few decades, some astronomers have theorized that the movement of the solar system within the Milky Way varies the gravitational stresses to which the sun, and everything that revolves around it, is exposed</span></span><span class="Underline">. The solar system may periodically pass close to stars or groups of stars whose </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">gravitational pull affects the Oort Cloud, shaking comets and asteroids loose from their orbital moorings</span></span><span class="Underline"> and </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">sending them downward</span></span><span class="Underline">, toward the inner planets. Consider objects that are already near Earth, and the picture gets even bleaker. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Astronomers traditionally spent little time looking for asteroids</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, regarding them as a lesser class of celestial bodies, lacking the beauty of comets or the significance of planets and stars. Plus, asteroids are hard to spot—they move rapidly, compared with the rest of the heavens, and even the nearby ones are fainter than other objects in space. Not until the 1980s did scientists begin systematically searching for asteroids near Earth. They have been finding them in disconcerting abundance. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">In 1980, only 86 near-Earth asteroids</span></span><span class="Underline"> and comets </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">were known to exist</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. By 1990, the figure had risen to 170; by 2000, it was 921; </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">as of this writing, it is 5,388</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, part of NASA, keeps a running tally at </span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats" rel="nofollow">www.neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats</a></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ten years ago, 244 near-Earth space rocks one kilometer across or more—the size that would cause global calamity—were known to exist; now 741 are. Of the recently discovered nearby space objects, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">NASA has classified 186 as “impact risks”</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (details about these rocks are at </span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk" rel="nofollow">www.neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk</a></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">). And because most space-rock searches to date have been low-budget affairs, conducted with equipment designed to look deep into the heavens, not at nearby space, the actual number of impact risks is undoubtedly much higher. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Extrapolating from recent discoveries, NASA estimates that there are perhaps 20,000 potentially hazardous asteroids and comets in the general vicinity of Earth</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">There’s still more bad news. Earth has experienced several mass extinctions—the dinosaurs died about 65 million years ago, and something killed off some 96 percent of the world’s marine species about 250 million years ago. Scientists have generally assumed that whatever caused those long-ago mass extinctions—comet impacts, extreme volcanic activity—arose from conditions that have changed and no longer pose much threat. It’s a comforting notion—but what about the mass extinction that occurred close to our era? About 12,000 years ago, many large animals of North America started disappearing—woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, mastodons, and others. Some scientists have speculated that Paleo-Indians may have hunted some of the creatures to extinction. A millennia-long mini–Ice Age also may have been a factor. But if that’s the case, what explains the disappearance of the Clovis People, the best-documented Paleo-Indian culture, at about the same time? Their population stretched as far south as Mexico, so the mini–Ice Age probably was not solely responsible for their extinction. A team of researchers led by Richard Firestone, of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in California, recently announced the discovery of evidence that one or two huge space rocks, each perhaps several kilometers across, exploded high above Canada 12,900 years ago. The detonation, they believe, caused widespread fires and dust clouds, and disrupted climate patterns so severely that it triggered a prolonged period of global cooling. Mammoths and other species might have been killed either by the impact itself or by starvation after their food supply was disrupted. These conclusions, though hotly disputed by other researchers, were based on extensive examinations of soil samples from across the continent; in strata from that era, scientists found widely distributed soot and also magnetic grains of iridium, an element that is rare on Earth but common in space. Iridium is the meteor-hunter’s lodestar: the discovery of iridium dating back 65 million years is what started the geologist Walter Alvarez on his path-breaking theory about the dinosaurs’ demise. A more recent event gives further cause for concern. As buffs of the television show The X Files will recall, just a century ago</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">in 1908, a huge explosion occurred above Tunguska</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Siberia. The cause was not a malfunctioning alien star-cruiser but a small asteroid or comet that detonated as it approached the ground. The blast had hundreds of times the force of the Hiroshima bomb and devastated an area of several hundred square miles. Had the explosion occurred above London or Paris, the city would no longer exist. Mark </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Boslough</span></span><span class="Underline">, a researcher at the Sandia National Laboratory</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in New Mexico, recently </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">concluded that the Tunguska object was surprisingly small</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps only 30 meters across. Right now, astronomers are nervously tracking 99942 Apophis, an asteroid with a slight chance of striking Earth in April 2036. Apophis is also small by asteroid standards, perhaps 300 meters across, but it could hit with about 60,000 times the force of the Hiroshima bomb—enough to destroy an area the size of France. In other words, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">small asteroids</span></span><span class="Underline"> may be more dangerous than we used to think—and </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">may do considerable damage even if they don’t reach Earth’s surface</span></span><span class="Underline">. Until recently, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">nearly all the thinking about the risks of space-rock strikes has focused on counting craters. But what if most impacts don’t leave craters?</span></span><span class="Underline"> This is the prospect that troubles Boslough. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Exploding in the air, the Tunguska rock did plenty of damage</span></span><span class="Underline">,</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> b</span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">ut if people had not seen the flashes, heard the detonation, and traveled to the remote area to photograph the scorched, flattened wasteland, we’d never know the Tunguska event had happened. Perhaps a comet or two exploding above Canada 12,900 years ago spelled the end for saber-toothed cats and Clovis society. But no obvious crater resulted; clues to the calamity were subtle and hard to come by. Comets, asteroids, and the little meteors that form pleasant shooting stars approach Earth at great speeds—at least 25,000 miles per hour. As they enter the atmosphere they heat up, from friction, and compress, because they decelerate rapidly. Many space rocks explode under this stress, especially small ones; large objects are more likely to reach Earth’s surface. The angle at which objects enter the atmosphere also matters: an asteroid or comet approaching straight down has a better chance of hitting the surface than one entering the atmosphere at a shallow angle, as the latter would have to plow through more air, heating up and compressing as it descended. The object or objects that may have detonated above Canada 12,900 years ago would probably have approached at a shallow angle</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><span class="Underline">If, as Boslough thinks, most asteroids and comets explode before reaching the ground, then this is another reason to fear that the </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">conventional thinking seriously underestimates the frequency of space-rock strikes</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—the small number of craters may be lulling us into complacency. After all, if a space rock were hurtling toward a city, whether it would leave a crater would not be the issue—the explosion would be the issue.  </span></span><br />

One of these new systems is </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Pan-STARRS</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System), whose </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">prototype</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> element </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">is now operating</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on Haleakala in Hawaii. </span></span><span class="Underline">When complete, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Pan-STARRS will have 3-16 times the collecting power of current NEO survey telescopes.

Another planned system is LSST, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, to be sited in northern Chile. Beginning in 2014, the 8.4-m telescope will scan the entire visible sky every three nights using a 3.2-billion-pixel CCD camera the size of a small car. </span></span><span class="Underline">The LSST will be able to find 90% of the near-Earth asteroid population 140 m and larger</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> within about a dozen years--close to what Congress directed NASA to do in 2005 (a search program still unfunded). The Gates Foundation earlier this year put $30 million toward the telescope's construction, and the University of Arizona has just completed casting the main mirror. Over the next 15 years, these NEO search systems will lead to the discovery of over 500,000 asteroids, large and small, in the inner solar system. Of these, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">several thousand will be categorized as</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> potentially </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">hazardous</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> asteroids, or PHAs, defined as objects that come within 0.05 astronomical units of the Earth (about 7.48 million km) and measure at least 150 m in diameter. As of August, there were 211 known PHAs, and 140 of those were larger than 1 km--</span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">capable of causing global devastation. By 2020, we may be staring at</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> a PHA catalog that numbers </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">more than 5,000!</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Deciding to </span></span><span class="Underline">deflect Search </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">programs will usually give us</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> years, if not </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">decades, of impact warning</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. But how should we use this vital, and worrisome, information? At the outset, we can prepare evacuation and disaster mitigation plans to cope with an unexpected or unavoidable impact. But our technology offers options: Spacecraft have rendezvoused with several NEOs, and we possess the means to deflect most asteroids on a collision course. The first step would be to attach a transponder to the NEO, so we can predict its future orbit precisely; refined tracking will eliminate the uncertainty surrounding most impact calculations. If deflection is necessary, we can hover near an asteroid and change its velocity slightly with a &quot;gravity tractor&quot; spacecraft. We can ram an oncoming NEO with a high-speed projectile, transferring momentum and altering the object's velocity. In the very rarest of cases (a large NEO or little warning time), we can use a nuclear explosive to vaporize the top millimeter of its regolith, with the resulting jet of gas and debris nudging the asteroid off course. Any efforts at NEO deflection must be international in scope. First, because of tracking uncertainties, a NEO's predicted impact point will lie along a thin line spanning most of a hemisphere (the projection of its orbital plane on Earth's surface). This risk corridor will span many nations until tracking accuracy improves, quite close to impact. Second, the process of deflecting a NEO will necessarily shift that impact point along the corridor, toward the Earth's limb, lowering impact risk for one nation but temporarily raising it for another, until the threat is eliminated entirely. Only an international consensus on deflection decisions will succeed; without it, a serious impact threat will generate controversy, prolonged argument, and political inaction--in short, paralysis. </span></span><span class="Underline">Of the several thousand</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> PHAs </span></span><span class="Underline">we will face 10-15 years from now, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">several dozen will possess</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> an uncomfortably </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">high probability of striking Earth</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. With local or regional devastation a real possibility, the global community will face a decision, then, on whether to act to prevent an impact. What probability of a future impact will trigger a collective decision to deflect a NEO? We will seldom possess perfect knowledge about the threatening NEO. Indeed, because of the substantial lead time required to fund, plan, and execute an asteroid deflection campaign (the series of missions needed to assure a &quot;miss&quot;), our institutions may have to act before we are certain an impact will actually occur. Erring on the side of caution, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">we may be forced to make crucial, timely decisions about NEO deflection much more frequently than the occurrence of actual impacts</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, given the potential devastation an impact might cause, we may decide to deflect an object even if it has just a 10%, or as little as a 1%, probability of hitting Earth. If the actual NEO impact frequency for a future Tunguska is 1 per 500 years, but we decide to act at a threshold of impact probability of 2% (1 in 50), </span></span><span class="Underline">then </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">we will face such a decision once every 10 years</span></span><span class="Underline">. </span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span><br />

Scientists say WISE could revise the familiar portrait of our solar system. &quot;What we're doing with WISE is opening up the sky in a way that hasn't been possible before. It will transform the picture of our solar neighborhood,&quot; said Peter Eisenhardt, a scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge, where the mission is managed. &quot;It will give scientists things to study for decades.&quot; Steinn Sigurdsson, an astronomer at Pennsylvania State University who is not affiliated with the mission, agrees that WISE offers &quot;considerable prospects for significant discoveries.&quot; It's even possible, he says, that the mission could find planets around other stars. Of course, this isn't the first time anyone has thought of scanning the sky in wavelengths other than the narrow region of visible light. Radio telescopes like the Arecibo instrument in Puerto Rico search deep space for the long radio waves emitted by many galaxies. Other instruments try to capture the intensely short and dangerous gamma rays released by exploding stars. But some things, such as the process in which stars form from balls of hard-to-see interstellar gas, are much easier to study in the infrared, which can pick up very dim and relatively cool objects. &quot;From my perspective, this is an incredibly exciting mission,&quot; said Andrea Ghez, an astronomy professor at UCLA who is not part of the WISE team. The forerunner to WISE was NASA's Infrared Astronomical Satellite. Launched in 1983, it probed the entire sky in the infrared, increasing the number of cataloged astronomical objects by a staggering 70%. It detected 350,000 new objects, including comets and wisps of invisible but warm dust clouds in almost every direction of space. But by using just 62 pixels to measure the heavens, that satellite was a dim flashlight compared to WISE. Each of WISE's four detectors will scan space with 1 million pixels, making the suite of instruments thousands of times more sensitive. After being launched by a Delta II rocket, WISE will settle into orbit about 326 miles above the Earth's surface. The heart of the 9-foot-tall spacecraft is a 16-inch-diameter telescope housed in a shroud of solid, frozen hydrogen called a cryostat. This floating ice chest is designed to keep the instruments so cold -- as low as minus 445 degrees Fahrenheit -- that the four detectors will not accidentally pick up heat from the mission's own electronics. The first class of objects likely to pop out of hiding is a type of failed star called a brown dwarf. Brown dwarfs didn't possess the sheer bulk necessary to sustain the nuclear fusion reaction that causes stars like our sun to burst into flames after collapsing from a ball of gas. Brown dwarfs don't shine, except in the infrared. Their temperatures, ranging from a downright icy minus 330 degrees to 1,300 degrees, are remnants of the heat generated by their gravitational collapse. According to Eisenhardt, many scientists believe there are as many brown dwarfs in any region of space as regular stars. Within 25 light-years of the sun, there are about 100 known stars, only six of which are brown dwarfs. That means there could be another 90 or so brown dwarfs in that area awaiting discovery. There is an even chance, Wright said, that one might be closer than the conventional star Proxima Centauri. Four light-years away, Proxima holds the record for our closest starry neighbor. &quot;That would be a very exciting discovery,&quot; Eisenhardt said. Within our solar system, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">WISE will</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> probably </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">uncover</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> as many as </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">100,000 new asteroids</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> in the rocky junk pile between Mars and Jupiter. The several hundred thousand asteroids we know now consist mostly of those with surfaces that reflect light</span></u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> well. Further, <u>the conventional way to measure an asteroid,</u> Wright said, <u>is to equate its size with its brightness. But some things just don't reflect as well as others, regardless of size.

That doesn't mean the spacecraft will find a &quot;doomsday asteroid&quot; that poses a threat to Earth. What it does mean is that </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the mission will help scientists judge</span></span> <u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">the size of </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">any threatening asteroid, giving</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> greater </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">advance warning</span></span> <u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">about the ones that could be the next weapon of extinction,</span></u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> like the one suspected of wiping out the dinosaurs.</span> <br />

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That's why he's taking the new report so seriously. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">NASA's official view is that the most efficient way to divert a</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> potentially threatening </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">NEO is by setting off a nuclear bomb</span></span> <span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nearby, to nudge it into a safe orbit. &quot;</span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">The implication is that it is the preferred way to go to deflect essentially any near-Earth object</span></span><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;">,</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; Schweickart complained. In contrast, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Schweickart argues</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> that </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> so-called &quot;</span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">nuclear</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> standoff&quot; </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">option should be used only as a last resort</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. He contends that 98 percent of the potential threats can be mitigated by using less extreme measures. For example, he favors the development of </span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">a </span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 10.0pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16788616/" rel="nofollow">&quot;gravity tractor&quot;</a></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> - </span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">a spacecraft that would </span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">hover near an asteroid for years at a time, using subtle gravitational attraction to draw the space rock out of a worrisome path</span></u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. To kick it up a notch, Schweickart said <u><span style="background: aqua;">a </span>threatening <span style="background: aqua;">NEO could </span>first <span style="background: aqua;">be hit with a kinetic impactor</span></u> </span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">- say, a scaled-up version of the </span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8464385/" rel="nofollow">Deep Impact bullet</a></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that hit Comet Tempel 1 back in 2005 - </span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">and <span style="background: aqua;">then</span> the orbital track could be <span style="background: aqua;">fine-tuned using the tractor.</span> Navigational sensors aboard the tractor would check to make sure the NEO was on a completely safe path.</span></u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> &quot;This combination is obviously the way to go,&quot; he said. <u>NASA</u> sees it a different way, however. The report <u>said the gravity tractor</u> concept <u>and similar techniques would be the &quot;most expensive&quot; ways to divert an asteroid:</u> &quot;In general, the slow push systems were found to be at a very low technology readiness level and would require significant development methods,&quot; it said. Schweickart said <u><span style="background: aqua;">NASA </span>must have <span style="background: aqua;">&quot;misunderstood </span>or mischaracterized&quot; <span style="background: aqua;">the gravity tractor </span>concept.</u> And he worried that </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;">the report may make things tougher for researchers working on</span></u> <u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">kinder, </span></u><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;">gentler ways to head off</span></u> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">killer </span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;">asteroids</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> &quot;</span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;">It may be harder to continue with that research</span></u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">,&quot; he said. &quot;<u>The irony is that <span style="background: aqua;">NASA </span></u></span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;">ought to be</span></u><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10.0pt;"> doing that research</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. </span></u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">&quot;</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But beyond </span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">that, there is also the issue that people are beginning to wrestle with this question on a much larger basis internationally,&quot; he said. &quot;The idea that the only way you can protect Earth from these things is to compromise all your principles about nonproliferation would be shocking to anybody else. Almost anytime the United States is going to say anything about this, eyebrows are going to go up.&quot; Schweickart already has written a 13-page retort to the report, as well as a letter to NASA Administrator Michael Griffin asking him to reconsider the agency's policy.

Schweickart is also calling on NASA to release more of the background analysis that went into the final report. &quot;I just felt that it was inappropriate that this stand unchallenged - not only unchallenged, but unsupported,&quot; he said.

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Dr. </span></span><span class="Underline">Holdren’s letter</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> is very welcome. It should help advance United States government planning. He </span></span><span class="Underline">reaffirms NASA’s lead responsibility for detection of NEOs. He adds that </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">NASA should</span></span><span class="Underline"> even </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">lead in the study of mitigation and deflection, coordinating with</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> other federal agencies, including </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the Department of Defense</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security. </span></span><span class="Underline">He also recommends that </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the U.S. continue to coordinate with international efforts</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to study the problem. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am personally uneasy about NASA being the lead agency to consider mitigation, even though at the moment they know more about the subject than other parts of government. But </span></span><span class="Underline">mitigation involves consideration of nuclear weapons</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and deflection of asteroids can be considered a weapon system. Having that as part of NASA’s mission needs some debate (especially if it detracts from space exploration). Inter-agency discussion can help resolve who should be lead; thus, the Administration’s recommendations are a valuable step forward. But it is not enough of a step. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Any consideration of NEOs should be international. No nation can consider deflection of a potentially hazardous object unilaterally</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It’s my view that spacefaring nations should organize an ad-hoc task force, which someday might evolve to a treaty organization(analogous to NATO) to address policies, protocols and plans for dealing with the threat of a potentially hazardous object hitting Earth. </span></span><span class="Underline">The United States could, and should, lead by proposing such a task force</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We need consideration soon, not because an impact is likely soon, but, because the threat of an impact is likely soon.

<span style="font-size: 7pt;">Characterization. Large NEOs are relatively well characterized, although only about - 10% have actually been discovered. Most discoveries have been through decadal searches with film-based telescopes. Planned programs to increase that discovery rate generally involve decadal searches with conventional telescopes with improved electronic focal planes. As on the average, most NEOs should be observed several times before hitting the Earth, so such searches are an effective way of using long <span class="SmallCardText">search</span> duration to minimize the technical performance required from the telescopes and focal planes used. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">For long period comets</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(LPCs), objects with periods greater than 220 years, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">decadal search is inadequate. Most LPCs have not been observed</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">; indeed, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">many would be observed only on their approach to the Earth</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. The distribution of LPCs is poorly known; estimates are controversial. It is presently estimated that LPCs might make up from - 4 to - 40% of the total flux, with the higher values from the most accomplished comet observers. Deflection. Given detection, it should be possible to deflect most NEOs away from the Earth. The measures required depend on the size of the object and the warning time. For intermediate objects and times of decades.- kinetic energy should suffice. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">If an inert or explosive payload were delivered to the NEO, its impact would blow a greater amount of material off the NEO, whose removal would cause the NEO to move in the opposite direction</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. If the deflection were great enough, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the NEO could miss the Earth</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">. Even if the NEO were too large to be deflected completely away, </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">the impact could still pulverize the NEO into pieces too small to survive atmospheric entry</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. This pulverization has the potential to reduce the energy and cost of deflection by about a factor of 100. Pulverization with kinetic energy interceptors should be possible for NEOs up to about 0.5 km in diameter, which includes the most frequent impactors. For LPCs the interceptors would have to be maintained in readiness. Once such interceptors were developed, they could be retrofitted with higher energy explosives, if required for larger objects. It would be difficult to achieve the conditions for deflection experiments in terrestrial experiments. Fortunately, asteroids frequently pass the Earth in trajectories that are energetically accessible and suitable for the test of interaction phenomena. The Clementine experiments were designed to perform such tests. Our near-total ignorance of the compressive and tensile strength of NEOs is the largest barrier to the formulation of a confident defense. Impacts by inert masses could measure both through interpretation of the initial flash and the subsequent mass evolution. There are opportunities in the future for soft and hard landings, seismic strength tests, pulverization, and deflection. Such tests would also provide some of the data needed for predictions of deflection by higher energy sources. Analysis. There is a need to work through a planning cycle, to see how well mission planning, detection concepts, missile configurations, explosives, homing, and control would work under simulated scenarios. An essential part would be the development of improved theory for interaction, negation, and mission planning. There have been a number of studies: the Detection Workshop, the Interception Workshop, and several International Meetings. However, they have mostly conducted top-level studies. There has been little work to tie together the pieces of each Workshop - let alone the different Workshops. Road maps exist for detection, interception, and experiments separately, but there is a need to integrate them with road maps for detection, launch capabilities, and mission control. The first step toward this integration would be the creation of a group to maintain continuity in these core areas between meetings. Summary. NEOs represent a global threat that justifies continuing efforts on search, cataloging, and preparation for defense. There is a wide range of sizes of objects, which produce a variety of effects. The largest objects are globally devastating but infrequent; the smaller objects produce localized effects, but impact more frequently. Each presents an unique and serious hazard. The most familiar portion of the threat is the large number of inferred, undiscovered NEOs. Most could be found efficiently through modest ground-based searches, which would primarily require an organized and continuing search program. The Air Force has developed the essential assets in telescopes, This is compounded by an uncertainty in the reflectivity or albedo of the LPCs, which causes them to appear as uncountable &quot;stealth&quot; objects</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">LPCs</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">could roughly double the number of objects in the threat. More importantly, observation only on their final pass </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">would require response times on the order of months</span></span> <u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">to years </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">rather than the decades</span></span> <u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">to centuries </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">thought to be available for other NEOs</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. Thus, LPCs are the most stressing class of NEOs because of the challenges they present to both detection and interception schemes. The effects of Intermediate NEOs are not as well documented - in part because the fossil record they produce is transient. It is known that geologic seabed activity can cause devastating Tsunami; it is not clear that NEO impacts in the ocean have done so. At present, the inference is based on the anomalous deposition of coral and other seabed materials, anecdotal evidence, and theoretical analysis of deep water and run-up phenomena. The effects of onshore damage have been studied only parametrically. The effects of small objects have been do</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">cumented more carefully, as they occur more frequently. Impacts over Tunguska in Siberia in 1908, the Brazilian rain forest in the 1930s, and elsewhere have made it possible to produce a body of evidence and interpretation as well as a thorough assessment of the impacts of the objects, which are largely analogous to those of the explosions of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere. The smallest objects have been studied systematically, as meteors occur virtually every night. More recently, the information from defense warning satellites has also been made available to supplement that data base, to aid interpretation and to reduce false alarm rates. Detection technology for ground-based telescopes is rapidly shifting from film to charge-coupled device (CCD) focal planes. Although film has long been a convenient and compact storage medium, its sensitivity is far below that of the human eye, and human observers are fallible and expensive. Thus, the CCD, essentially a digital, silicon retina with electronic processing and readout, is natural for low-light, wide area searches for NEOs. The possibility of shifting to CCDs has been studied for the last decade, and the Air Force now mounts a limited CCD search on its operational GEODSS cameras. The NEO Survey Working Group commissioned by Congress in 1995 recommended that megapixel CCD focal planes on existing telescopes should be effective sensors, and that a single such telescope costing - $25M could perhaps the complete the search for large NEOs in a decade. That implies a shift in strategy. In the past telescopes increased aperture to maximize the distance to which they could see. This new program would increase detector count to maximize field of view and rate of search, permitting greatly increased performance from existing telescopes. Rapid, ground-based search for large NEOs is only part of the problem. It is also necessary to search for LPCs, as well as other dimmer and smaller objects that might be seen only on first approach. For these objects it would be useful to shift the sensors to space, where they can take advantage of unobstructed viewing as well as the favorable scaling on both aperture and focal plane size to produce compact, efficient sensors that can see out to the - 1 AU required for adequate warning and response from a number of such sensors in constellations around the Earth. CCD technology, focal planes, computers, networks, and facilities for such searches. The key to the effectiveness of such a search is an early start and continuity. It needs a principal sponsor with a planning horizon as long as that of the problem.-The obvious candidates are NASA and the Air Force. The Air Force's operational mission is in many ways a better fit to the requirements for this long-term, careful search. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">LPCs</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> represent a significant fraction of threat. They </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">have more stringent detection requirements and require more rapid response.</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">They could require search times measured in days and interceptors maintained in readiness, both of which favor space basing of key elements. They are a more stressing threat and will require further development of the technologies for detection, computation, and negation. For most objects, kinetic energy pulverization is the preferred means of deflection. While it would be difficult to perform experiments on the Earth, asteroids frequently pass on accessible trajectories that are suitable for interaction tests. Clementine was designed to perform such tests; there will be more such opportunities in the future. Soft and hard landings, seismic strength tests, pulverization, and deflection tests could provide much of the data needed for kinetic deflection as well as others. It should not be difficult to develop means for the international oversight and/or control of conventional missiles and explosives. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><br />

That causes extinction <br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold'; font-size: 11pt;">Marusek 05</span> (James, nuclear physicist &amp; engineer, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, The Cosmic Clock, The Cycle of Terrestrial Mass Extinctions, <span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1009.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1009.pdf</a></span>)  <br />
<span style="font-size: 7pt;">These unexpected results led to a reevaluation of the impact hypothesis. The estimate of impactor size was derived from equations comparing impactor crater size to that of a comparable nuclear surface burst. But <u>if the impactor was larger, such as a long period comet</u> (</span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">LPC</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">), <u>it would have sufficient energy to</u> </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">penetrate the Earth’s crust</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;"> (especially an ocean impact where the crust is thin) and this assumption would begin to fall apart. Deep impacts produce smaller craters because most of the energy is released within the interior of the planet. The impact energy can be thought of as the sum of the energy released at the surface and the en-ergy released deep within the Earth’s mantle. The surface component can be approximated to the blast and thermal radiation effects from a comparably-sized nuclear explosion. The effects of the impact energy released in the mantle are obscure and are only observ-able in massive flood basalt eruptions, the creation of a deep magma hot spot, kimberlite pipes and interior structure anomalies, such as magnetic pole reversals. This analysis was expanded to the end-Permian extinction, which shared distinct similarities with the end-Cretaceous. In both extinctions, massive volcanic flood basalt eruptions took place and a significant drawdown of oxygen levels in the atmosphere and oceans occurred. From this study, a hypothesis took shape describing a cluster of comet impacts over a short geological timeframe (5-8 million years) as the cause of the end-Permian extinction. Several impacts were of sufficient size to rupture through the Earth’s crust, producing deep impact effects. The impacts focused shock destruction on the opposite side of the Earth creating fractures at continent/ocean seams. The resulting Emeishan &amp; Siberian Traps generated pro-longed periods of surface flood basalt eruptions induc-ing extensive acid rainfall. Acidification targeted evo-lutionary weaknesses within marine and terrestrial life forms, culminating in a massive die-off at the end of the Permian Period [2]. In summary, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">one mechanism capable of producing a global extinction event is deep impact from a LPC</span></span><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. It is theorized </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;">these massive, high velocity comets can drive through the Earth’s crust and deep into the Earth’s interior producing episodes of massive flood basalt eruptions on the other side of the globe.</span></span><br />

<span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Any efforts at NEO deflection must be international in scope</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">. </span></u><span style="font-size: 7pt;">First, because of tracking uncertainties, a NEO's predicted impact point will lie along a thin line spanning most of a hemisphere (the projection of its orbital plane on Earth's surface). This risk corridor will span many nations until tracking accuracy improves, quite close to impact. Second, the process of deflecting a NEO will necessarily shift that impact point along the corridor, toward the Earth's limb, lowering impact risk for one nation but temporarily raising it for another, until the threat is eliminated entirely. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Only an international consensus on deflection decisions will succeed; without it, a serious impact threat will generate controversy, prolonged argument, and political inaction--in short, paralysis</span></span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 6pt;"> Of the several thousand PHAs we will face 10-15 years from now, several dozen will possess an uncomfortably high probability of striking Earth. With local or regional devastation a real possibility, the global community will face a decision, then, on whether to act to prevent an impact. What probability of a future impact will trigger a collective decision to deflect a NEO? We will seldom possess perfect knowledge about the threatening NEO. Indeed, because of the substantial lead time required to fund, plan, and execute an asteroid deflection campaign (the series of missions needed to assure a &quot;miss&quot;), our institutions may have to act before we are certain an impact will actually occur. Erring on the side of caution, we may be forced to make crucial, timely decisions about NEO deflection much more frequently than the occurrence of actual impacts. For example, given the potential devastation an impact might cause, we may decide to deflect an object even if it has just a 10%, or as little as a 1%, probability of hitting Earth. If the actual NEO impact frequency for a future Tunguska is 1 per 500 years, but we decide to act at a threshold of impact probability of 2% (1 in 50), then we will face such a decision once every 10 years. We clearly need an international process, in place and widely supported, enabling us to deal with a potential NEO threat consistently and promptly. Preparing to act Today, we can detect NEOs and predict their potential for collision with Earth. For the first time in our planet's 4.5-billion-year window of vulnerability to cosmic collisions, we have the technical capability to prevent such devastating events. The keys to succeeding in all cases are preparation, planning, and timely decision-making. Three years ago, the Association of Space Explorers (ASE, the international nonprofit professional and educational organization of over 320 space fliers from 33 nations) approved an open letter calling on the world to take prudent action to prevent future asteroid and comet collisions. The association formed a committee from its cosmonaut and astronaut membership to promote discussion and possible solutions. Beginning in 2007, the committee raised private funds to mount a workshop series to understand the NEO challenge. The ASE gathered a respected panel of diplomats, scientists, engineers, and legal experts, called the Panel on Asteroid Threat Mitigation, to study the scope of the NEO hazard and recommend a cooperative way forward. During the first three meetings, the panel met to draft a global framework for NEO decision-making. ASE's final workshop took place September 22-25 in San Francisco. At this session, the panel finalized and adopted a document called &quot;Asteroid Threats: A Call for Global Response&quot; (</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 6pt; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.space-explorers.org" rel="nofollow">www.space-explorers.org</a></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">). Noting that a threat of global dimensions requires a global consensus for concrete action, the panel calls for harnessing information-sharing and communication capabilities to recognize and warn society of potentially hazardous NEOs. The panel also calls for consideration of and agreement on an international decision-making program, or framework, detailing how the world, led by the spacefaring nations, will respond to a potential impact. A global response</span> <u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">The ASE &quot;global response</span></u><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; document, endorsed by September's ASE Planetary Congress in Seattle, makes six major recommendations.

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 7pt;">But if one of them - or even a smaller, city-destroying rock - were detected on a collision course, would the world community be prepared to handle it? A conference of legal experts that discussed this question at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln last month answered it with a resounding &quot;No.&quot; Scientists and engineers who have studied the problem of deflecting a dangerous asteroid believe the technical issues are difficult but solvable. The challenge now is figuring out the legal issues of who takes action on behalf of humankind and of what their responsibilities and liabilities will be. Asteroid hunters believe they can give us plenty of warning. There is &quot;a fair chance that the next Earth impactor will actually be identified with many decades and perhaps centuries of warning time,&quot; explains Mr. Chesley of the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in the March/April issue of the Planetary Report. That's plenty of time to develop a spacecraft whose gravitational attraction might nudge an asteroid aside - or a rocket or some application of nuclear explosives to do the job. However,</span></span> <span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">if a single country</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> - or small group of nations - </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">tries to take the initiative on its own, the international reaction could stall any action at all. &quot;The international political reactions to the US shooting down one of its own satellites</span></span><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> a year ago to prevent presumably dangerous and toxic rocket fuel from reaching Earth only </span></u><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">foreshadows what would happen if the US would detonate</span></span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">nukes <u><span style="background: aqua;">[</span></u></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">nuclear weapons] claiming to destroy an incoming asteroid</span></span><u><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10.0pt;">,</span></u><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">&quot;</span></u> <span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">said Frans von der Dunk, a University of Nebraska space law expert, at the Nebraska conference, according to Space News. Overlooking the hype about nuclear weapons, which engineers consider an unlikely, extreme measure, Professor von der Dunk has pointed out the main issue. Averting a regional or global asteroid threat may involve unforeseen collateral damage - such as splintered chunks making their way to Earth or worse. Therefore, the world community has to have a say in how that threat is handled.</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span><br />

However, estimates of the asteroid population suggest dozens more have yet to be found, with unknown orbits that could intersect with the Earth. To get a sense of how much water might be jettisoned into the atmosphere if these asteroids hit the ocean, the team modelled what would happen if they reached Earth's atmosphere at a clip of 18 kilometres per second, an average speed expected for a near-Earth object, and hit the ocean in the northern hemisphere at a 45-degree angle. As expected, the simulations showed that the larger, 1-km asteroid created the bigger splash, throwing 42 trillion kilograms of water and vapour – enough to fill 16 million Olympic-sized swimming pools – across an area more than 1000 kilometres wide and up to hundreds of kilometres above the Earth's surface.

<span class="Underline">Nuclear explosions, and a wide variety of technologies not yet realized, have been proposed to deflect asteroids away from collision with Earth. In contrast, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">here we present realistic models for simple kinetic energy impact deflection</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, using the actual orbital elements of 795 catalogued Potentially Hazardous Asteroids, and impactor masses </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">launched to intercept trajectories by Atlas V HLV rockets</span></span><span class="Underline"> or equivalent</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We take asteroid diameter, density, cratering characteristics, and Earth-collision lead time as parameters whose influence is to be investigated. Assuming asteroids of rock-like density, we find deflection off of Earth-collision to be achievable given 5- year lead time with a single kinetic energy intercept for 100% of 250 m diameter PHAs, 20-year lead with a single intercept for 93% of 500 m PHAs, 20-year lead with five and ten intercepts respectively for 55% and 94% of 1 km PHAs, or 100- year lead with one and two intercepts respectively for 55% and 94% of 1 km PHAs.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold'; font-size: 11pt;">BBC</span> 8/31/<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold'; font-size: 11pt;">2009</span> (British plan to tackle asteroids, <span style="color: black; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8230138.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8230138.stm</a></span>) <br />
A team of <span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">British scientists</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and engineers is </span></span><span class="Underline">developing</span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;"> plans for a</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> spacecraft that could stop large asteroids from hitting the Earth. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The 10-tonne &quot;</span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">gravity tractor</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; would deflect any orbiting rocks years before any potential collision could happen. </span></span><br />
<span class="Underline">The device</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which would rely on the force of gravity, is being developed by Stevenage space company EADS Astrium. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, the idea </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">is still in its early stages</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and the company says a prototype is some way off from being built. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The US space agency's (Nasa) Near Earth Object programme reports on its website that it has recorded 1068 known &quot;Potentially Hazardous Asteroids&quot;, however there are thousands more estimated to be present in space. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Dr Ralph Cordey, who is EADS Astrium's head of exploration and business, told BBC News that the concept of a gravity tug was actually first mooted by two Nasa astronauts, Edward Lu and Stanley Love, a few years ago. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">He said: &quot;Frankly, I thought it was crackers. I thought it would never work.&quot; </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">But he said after reconsidering the idea and focusing on specific engineering issues, including the size of the spacecraft, and long-term propulsion methods, </span></span><span class="Underline">it was considered by the team to be potentially feasible. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">The tractor would intercept the asteroid from just 48m away and exert a small gravitational force on it</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, pulling the rock towards it. The pair would then embark on a slightly different orbit, away from the Earth. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">It could possibly be powered using solar panels. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">However, the device would have to be launched at least 15 years before any predicted collision and would need a team to monitor it from the ground during this time. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Dr Cordey said </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the company had worked with a number of space authorities</span></span><span class="Underline"> on other methods</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of protecting the Earth from asteroids but this one would be able to target a wider range. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">He said: &quot;We have done quite a lot of design work on this with the European Space Agency and we believe this would work just as well on a big solid iron asteroid as well as other types.&quot; </span></span><br />
<span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">But the high cost implications mean</span></span><span class="Underline"> that before the device could be made, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">it would have to be commissioned by a</span></span><span class="Underline"> government or a </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">group of governments working together</span></span>. <br />

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">WHEN it comes to deflecting an asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth, &quot;most people think of the Hollywood treatment – throw a nuclear weapon at it&quot;, says NASA astronaut Edward Lu. &quot;That's the blast-and-hope strategy.&quot; It is hard to predict where the shattered pieces would go, and many smaller chunks might still head towards Earth. Now </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Lu and</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> fellow astronaut Stanley </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Love</span></span><span class="Underline"> at NASA's Johnson Space Center</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Houston, Texas, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">have come up with the simplest</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – and least glamorous – </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">solution</span></span><span class="Underline"> yet: </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">park a heavy spacecraft near the asteroid and use gravity as an invisible towline to tug the rock off its deadly course</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Other ideas for dealing with such threats have included detonating nuclear bombs near the asteroid – rather than nuking it directly – to nudge it off track. But this carries the same risks as shattering the asteroid. Some have advocated painting the asteroid white to change the amount of solar energy it reflects, thus altering the forces acting upon it and hopefully changing its course. However, the sheer amount of paint this would require makes it impractical, says Lu. In another attempt to come up with a practical solution, the researchers envisioned landing a spacecraft on an asteroid and then steering it off course using the craft's propulsion. But an asteroid's weak gravity may not hold the spacecraft down, so it would have to be anchored to the surface – a complicated task on a surface that could be loose rubble, says Lu. To make matters worse, asteroids often rotate, and pushing on one might just set it spinning faster rather than alter its trajectory. It was then </span></span><span class="Underline">that Lu and Love realised that </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the spacecraft does not need to land</span></span><span class="Underline">. Just getting close and staying there is enough</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For instance, their calculations showed that </span></span><span class="Underline">for a 200-metre asteroid, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">a 20-tonne spacecraft hovering 50 metres above the rock for about a year would change the asteroid's speed</span></span><span class="Underline"> by roughly 2 millimetres per second – </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">enough to knock it off course given time</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Nature , vol 438, p 177). &quot;</span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">This is hands down the best idea I have seen,&quot; says</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Erik </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Asphaug</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, an asteroid and comet specialist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. &quot;</span></span><span class="Underline">This will work. But you need to put a large enough spacecraft out there at the right time.&quot; </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">The spacecraft would need to begin deflecting the asteroid 20 years before a potential impact with Earth</span></span><span class="Underline">, but that is feasible, given that </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">astronomers can predict asteroid paths decades in advance. And such large spacecraft launches are within our grasp</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Lu says. NASA's multi-billion-dollar Prometheus programme, which was set to explore the outer solar system but has now been delayed, included just such a heavy vehicle, propelled by nuclear fission.</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span><br />

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Aside from costs, </span></span><span class="Underline">there remains a larger concern </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">with unilateral deflection. Consider the scenario where</span></span><span class="Underline"> a NEO is projected to impact Country X. </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Country Y</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps the United States or Russia, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">attempts to deflect</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, either by nuclear or conventional means, the NEO from colliding with Earth altogether. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">As a result, the NEO explodes over Country Z</span></span><span class="Underline"> and devastates a major city</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While the Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of nuclear weapons in space, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">there is not a norm pertaining to what country would take responsibility</span></span><span class="Underline"> for a deflection mistake</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Bucknam &amp; Gold, 2008). This becomes problematic as some analysts argue that such deflection technology could actually turn a NEO into a potential weapon or that the deflection technology itself could be used as a weapon (Preston, Johnson, Edwards, Miller, &amp; Shipbaugh, 2002). If Country Y‘s deflection mission fails for technical reasons, there would not be a concrete process to determine if it was a technical failure or if it was intentional. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Cooperation</span></span><span class="Underline"> between multiple nations </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">would make this issue less likely</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Independent of mistakes would be international perception of a country taking unilateral action to deflect an incoming NEO. If a NEO required nuclear deflection, which could occur in extreme cases, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">unilateral nuclear deflection could create repercussions</span></span><span class="Underline"> that would potentially stall that action</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Owen, 2009).

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">The probability of a devastating impact in the United States is small compared to the likelihood of an impact in other nations, most with far fewer resources to detect, track and defend against an incoming NEO. </span></span><span class="Underline">The NEO hazard</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, however, </span></span><span class="Underline">is such that a single country, acting unilaterally, could potentially solve the problem</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

There have been several international efforts to characterize objects in the near-Earth environment, but these studies have generally been driven by scientific curiosity and were not designed to address the risk of NEOs. As NEO survey requirements evolve to fainter objects and mitigation strategies are refined, </span></span><span class="Underline">additional </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">resources</span></span><span class="Underline"> will be necessary that </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">could be provided by other</span></span><span class="Underline"> developed </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">countries</span></span><span class="Underline">. International </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">partnerships can be sought with other science organizations</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, notably but not exclusively space agencies, in the areas of surveys, characterization, and mitigation technologies.

Space missions to test such strategies could also be developed on a cooperative basis with other nations, making use of complementary capability</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. While a coordinated intergovernmental program is needed to address the full spectrum of activities associated with NEO surveys, characterization, and mitigation, </span></span><span class="Underline">an important first step in this direction would be to establish an international partnership</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, perhaps of space agencies, to develop a comprehensive strategy for dealing with NEO hazards. </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Many scientists, especially among the world’s planetary scientists, have been concerned for well over a decade with the danger posed to Earth from the impact of an asteroid or comet.

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">International conferences and small meetings, as well as the Internet, allow experts in different aspects of space science and technology, including asteroid detection and mitigation, to personally know their counterparts in other nations. Such connections often lead to offers of, or requests for, aid in solution of common problems arising in the course of their work. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Veterans of the U</span></span><span class="Underline">nited </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">S</span></span><span class="Underline">tates </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">or Russian space programs</span></span><span class="Underline"> often </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">participate</span></span><span class="Underline"> either </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">openly</span></span><span class="Underline"> or behind the scenes </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">in the E</span></span><span class="Underline">uropean </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">S</span></span><span class="Underline">pace </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">A</span></span><span class="Underline">gency </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">and the J</span></span><span class="Underline">apanese </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">S</span></span><span class="Underline">pace </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">A</span></span><span class="Underline">gency, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">and Indian and Chinese space activities</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the event of a sudden emergency due to discovery of a threatening NEO it is likely that people forming this international network will be the first to communicate with one another and consider responses to the threat. For instance, when an observatory in Arizona discovered NEO 2008 TC3 only 19 hours before its impact in Sudan, the informal network of amateur and professional astronomers in many countries responded in time for thousands of observations of the object to be made and communicated to </span></span><br />
<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the MPC, thus allowing an extremely accurate prediction of the time (&lt;1 min error) and location (&lt;1 km error) of impact. </span></span><br />

<span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although cinematic film can be an excellent tool in raising public awareness, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the task of</span></span><span class="Underline"> public </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">education on</span></span><span class="Underline"> the true scientific nature of </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">the NEO issue remains an extremely important one</span></span><span class="Underline">, albeit one </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">that</span></span><span class="Underline"> perhaps </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">should be undertaken as a part of policy implementation</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> rather than as a prerequisite. There are several obstacles that will need to be overcome with regards to educating the public about the near-Earth object issue. The first has to do with the general state of the public’s science education, which is necessarily tied to its perception of science and scientists. The general level of science education of members of the public is quite low (speaking from a U.S.-centric position). Even </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">students who take</span></span><span class="Underline"> basic core </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">science classes at the university level</span></span><span class="Underline"> often </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">complete those</span></span><span class="Underline"> classes </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">without a complete understanding</span></span><span class="Underline"> of how the process of scientific inquiry works</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Mole 2004). Instead, Mole explains, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">they are</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> often </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">introduced to classes</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> concerning the interaction of science and society that concentrate on real and imagined deficiencies of science, while </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">neglecting</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> important topics such as the history of science, the role of the peer review process, and </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">discussions on</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> why individual scientists may have widely </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">divergent views</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on a particular subject. This last point is especially germane when dealing with members of the public who have no science background whatsoever. When addressing an issue such as near- Earth objects, the public can become easily confused by lack of consensus among scientists. The diverse range of views regarding the likelihood of catastrophic impact over a given time period and its resultant effects (e.g. Bryant 2001; Chapman 2004; Chapman and Morrison 2003; Keller 1997; Marsden 2004; Masse, Chap. 2 of this volume; Svetsov 2003; Yabushita 1997) particularly when filtered through various popular science media (e.g. Anonymous 1998; Applegate 1998; Dalton 2003; Hecht 2002; Ravilious 2002) can end with the layperson throwing up his or her hands in exasperation and walking away from the issue altogether. Peer-review, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">disagreement, and discourse are</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, after all, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">part of the process of conducting science</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, but many in the general public are unaware of this. Finally, cinematic film may do wonders to increase public awareness of important scientific issues, but public perception of science and scientists is, at least in part, shaped by their portrayals in popular cinematic film, and video and TV programs. Such portrayals are often less than flattering, with the “mad” (e.g. Frankenstein) or bumbling scientist stereotype perpetuated and the idea that science itself is responsible for the world’s ills (Haste 1997; Steinmuller 2003). 3.5 Conclusions In industrial societies, the celestial constants and some phenomena have been relegated to the realm of scientific curiosity. However, </span></span><span class="Underline">unusual transient events can trigger significant</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, albeit often brief, </span></span><span class="Underline">resurgences in public interest</span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is clear that public understanding of and interest in the near-Earth object issue has undergone a transformation over the last decade that was initiated by the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter. This real-world event and the resultant popular cultural cinematic productions helped focus the public on the actual threat that near-Earth objects present, and also greatly increased public awareness and potential support for development and implementation of public policy on the issue. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">When targets-of-opportunity arise</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as feature films addressing topics of serious scientific concern, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">scientists should take a proactive role in initiating and participating in frank discussions</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that engage the public </span></span><span class="Underline">on relevant issues depicted in mass popular culture, </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">offering correction and explanation</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> when appropriate, and availing themselves of the opportunity to educate about the process of science at the same time. </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">Science fiction</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> film </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">can</span></span><span class="Underline"> also </span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">present excellent opportunities to teach students about real science and the process of critical thinking</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Dubeck et al. 1988). As an additional measure, </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">promoting good general science education at all educational levels</span></span><span class="SmallCardText"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> will </span></span><span class="Highlight"><span style="background: #00bafb;">ensures that the future public is better equipped to independently evaluate where their support should be focused on such issues.</span></span><span style="background: aqua; font-family: "Times New Roman Bold"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fourth, <u>the <strong>plenary power</strong> doctrine <strong>has</strong> largely <strong>removed</strong> the <strong>immigration</strong> issue <strong>from U.S. constitutional law</strong></u>, especially on entry decisions. The time-tested proposition is that &quot;in the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.&quot; n115 <strong><u>This is due to</u></strong> <u>the uniqueness of the immigration field and <strong>its being interwoven with</strong> political questions and <strong>foreign affairs powers</strong>. In principle, <strong>the use of race</strong></u>, religion and nationality <strong><u>is more common in the context of persons seeking admission</u></strong><u>. In this context, <strong>U.S. courts have</strong> usually <strong>upheld the Government's broad scope of</strong> permissible <strong>authority to base decisions on race</strong></u>. As Kevin Johnson has written, race is central to the enforcement of U.S. immigration law, particularly near the borders. n116 Administrative policies are entitled to deference, although courts may require a rational basis showing to justify them. <u>But <strong>when Congress passes an immigration law, courts grant a wider degree of deference</strong></u> and are inclined to find these laws constitutional. Nevertheless, <u>one must ask whether <strong>courts</strong> would <strong>uphold the constitutionality of an immigration statute that</strong> clearly <strong>discriminates on the basis of race</strong></u> or religion. Some critics of U.S. immigration policy, such as Peter Brimelow, trace our woes to the 1965 Act that ended the national origins quota system. n117 Brimelow and like-minded restrictionists openly call on Congress to pass laws that would favor white Anglo-Saxon immigrants, and would bar the world's unwashed from being able to enter the United States. <u>Although <strong>no court has explicitly held such discrimination to be a violation of</strong> the <strong>equal protection</strong> principles, it is significant that at least [*267] <strong>eight</strong> Supreme Court <strong>Justices have suggested that such legislation would be impermissible</strong> (although never in one opinion, and always <strong>in dissent</strong></u>). n118 As no such legislation has recently passed Congress, the closest we have come to a definitive answer is the question posed by Justice Marshall <u>in his dissent in Jean v. Nelson. Justice Marshall rejected the possibility that the government may discriminate on the basis of race</u> &quot;in the absence of any reasons closely related to immigration concerns.&quot; n119 He admitted that a constitutional claim would fail when it &quot;lies at the heart of immigration policy,&quot; and added that &quot;the individuality of the alien&quot; is a factor only when &quot;central immigration concerns are not at stake.&quot; n120 Yet, even Marshall's dissent is far more modest than the absolute prohibition under British law. In the Roma case, the House of Lords has ruled that &quot;if a person acts on racial grounds, the reason why he does so is irrelevant.&quot; n121 </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>Plenary immigration power was founded on</u></strong> <u>the back of blatant <strong>racial discrimination</strong>. The Chinese Exclusion Case</u>, n89 <strong><u>which affirmed the exclusion of Chinese</u></strong> nationals from the United States, <u>established</u> within the political branches <u>the absolute power to develop a profile of the &quot;desirable&quot; immigrant <strong>unfettered by any provision of our higher law</strong></u>. n90 As Professor Henkin has noted, &quot;whatever the Court intended [in the Chinese Exclusion Case], both <strong><u>its holding</u></strong> and its sweeping dictum <strong><u>have been taken to mean that there are no constitutional limitations on the power of Congress to regulate immigration</u></strong>.&quot; n91 <u>From racial discrimination, plenary immigration power grew without bounds</u>, allowing Congress to reflect the mood of an often anxious and fearful nation, <u>unencumbered by the dictates of the Constitution</u>. n92 During the &quot;red scare&quot; of McCarthyism, Congress wielded this power to deport long time resident aliens for their thoughts and associations. n93 <strong><u>Today it continues</u></strong> <u>to stand as a sentry at our gates, allowing the political branches <strong>to formulate immigration policy without</strong> the <strong>restrictions</strong> that would otherwise be required by our constitutional traditions</u>. n94 </span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A similar phenomenon has emerged in constitutional equal protection analysis. Domesticating immigration law muddies the existing equal protection dichotomy under which <strong><u>federal</u></strong> <u>alienage</u> <strong><u>laws receive rational basis review while state</u></strong> <u>alienage</u> <strong><u>laws</u></strong> <u>usually</u> <strong><u>trigger strict scrutiny</u></strong><strong><span style="color: #a61b2d;">.</span></strong> <span style="color: #000099;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/lnacui2api/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1284059275219&amp;returnToKey=20_T10082849112&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.946193.5221014152#n257" rel="nofollow">n257</a></span> <strong><u>That dichotomy is sustainable</u></strong> <u>only</u> <strong><u>so long as federal</u></strong> <u>immigration</u> <strong><u>law manifests as a facet of foreign policy and state and</u></strong> <u>local legislation</u> <strong><u>appears confined to domestic</u></strong> <u>police</u> <strong><u>powers</u></strong><u>.</u> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Conversely, <strong><u>excluding nonimmigrant aliens</u></strong> <u>from the protection afforded by strict scrutiny would have far-reaching consequences and &quot;could serve to erode the rights of nonimmigrants in other contexts.&quot; n165 Not only <strong>would</strong> it <strong>perpetuate</strong> the history of social <strong>discrimination against aliens in general, it could spark a new wave of discrimination against nonimmigrant aliens</strong>, both socially and politically</u>. By differentiating between subclasses of aliens and <u>giving preferential treatment to immigrant aliens over nonimmigrant aliens, <strong>it could create a</strong> social <strong>stigma for nonimmigrant aliens</strong> and create a political hierarchy within the general alien class</u>. Even more detrimental, <u>it would contravene one of the primary purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment by <strong>subjugating a disenfranchised minority to the unfettered discrimination of the majority</strong></u> - a majority that history has proven to vote and legislate unfavorably toward nonimmigrant aliens. n166 In essence, <strong><u>states would be able to discriminate freely</u></strong> <u>against nonimmigrant aliens simply by claiming transience as justification</u>. <span style="color: blue;">n167 </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Until an effort equal to the efforts to create and maintain housing segregation and its consequences is initiated, supported, and perpetuated in our country, we can expect our racist legacy to continue and intensify. The effort must start with dismantling the racist institutions of housing segregation, white privilege, school segregation, and discrimination in the criminal justice system. <u>The systemic problem of <strong>racism must be attacked</strong> systemically. Again, Professor Williams states: With regard to all these configurations, let me just say that I am certain that <strong>the solution</strong> to racism <strong>lies in our ability to see its ubiquity</strong> but not to concede its inevitability. It lies <strong>in the</strong> collective and <strong>institutional power to make change</strong>, at least as much as with the individual will to change. It also lies <strong>in the</strong> absolute <strong>moral imperative to break the</strong> childish, deadly circularity of <strong>centuries of blindness</strong> to the shimmering brilliance of our common, ordinary humanity</u><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt;">.</span></u> <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">n203</span> <u>Above all, <strong>each individual</strong> (and I'm speaking here to white people) needs to acknowledge that they <strong>can</strong> either <strong>be part of the problem or part of the solution. Continuing</strong> merrily <strong>along</strong>, enjoying our white privilege, oblivious to the negative impact we have on our black neighbors, <strong>makes us complicit in</strong> the centuries of <strong>racism</strong> that brought us to our racist present. <strong>Doing nothing is</strong> doing everything <strong>to</strong></u> [*72] <strong><u>be a part of the problem</u></strong>. In the eloquent words of Professor June Jordan: We need, each of us, to begin the awesome, difficult work of love: loving ourselves so that we become able to love other people without fear so that we can become powerful enough to enlarge the circle of our trust and our common striving for a safe, sunny afternoon near to flowering trees and under a very blue sky. n204 <u>We can continue to travel the path of hatred and distrust or <strong>we can</strong> choose to <strong>begin dismantling the institutions borne of the distrust</strong> between races. Which kind of world do we want to live in - a world of hate or a world of love? <strong>Will we choose a world that</strong> isolates, separates, and <strong>wreaks unimaginable suffering on</strong> entire communities of <strong>people, or a world that celebrates the diversity</strong> of people and welcomes differences between people for the richness it brings to our lives?</u> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Dreaded Disease Tuberculosis Raises Its Ugly Head When Mr. Andrew Speaker and his wife returned to United States from Europe they were immediately quarantined by the health officials . Speaker and his family have been fighting back ever since, disputing the accounts of government health officials who contended he had been warned not to fly because he posed an infection risk to others. The disease in Speaker came to fore when he went for a check up for a rib injury. His X-ray picked up shadow in his right lung and TB was suspected. Only after intense test it was realized that the TB was drug resistance. But Speaker was not aware of it till late. Until a few weeks ago, <strong><u>many Americans had never heard of</u></strong> <u>extensively <strong>drug-resistant tuberculosis</strong>, or XDR-TB</u>. But Speaker got plenty of press as he was ordered into federal quarantine, having crisscrossed the Atlantic on commercial flights while infected with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). <u>In the 1970s, eradicating TB appeared possible. Now, <strong>the drug-resistant strains are winning</strong>. Of the 9 million new TB cases each year, an estimated 450,000 are multi-drug resistant</u>, or MDR. <strong><u>Only two-thirds of</u></strong> MDR TB <strong><u>patients are cured</u></strong>. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, there were 27,000 cases in 37 countries of XDR TB, which is resistant to at least three of the six second-line drugs used when the first drugs fail. <strong><u>The cure rate for XDR TB patients is just one-third</u></strong><u>. Scariest of all, two women in Italy recently died from a fully resistant type of TB that's officially incurable</u>. (Scientists are dubbing it XXDR TB.) Today, <strong><u>TB terrorizes those whose immunity has been weakened</u></strong> by HIV, hunger, alcoholism or other diseases. <strong><u>If the new strains become dominant, everyone is at risk</u></strong><u>. The rising worldwide number of XDR-TB cases like Speaker's may herald the end of a glorious 60-year holiday from many common and highly contagious diseases</u> -- such as polio, measles and cholera <u>-- that once routinely ravaged vast swaths of humanity</u>. Ironically, there has long been a disturbing tendency to romanticize the white plague, as tuberculosis is also known. But <strong><u>in real life, tuberculosis is a messy, agonizing and debilitating ordeal</u></strong>. Once the tubercle bacilli gain the momentum to proceed unchecked through the body, there is no romance to be found. <u>The actual experience of tuberculosis is one of exhaustion, drenching bouts of sweating, groaning, a cough punctuated by uncontrollable spurts of blood. XDR TB is already too widespread to quarantine<strong>. We need to combat it globally before it becomes pandemic</strong></u>. Last week, the WHO asked governments worldwide to pay up the $3 billion a year needed to fund existing TB programs and an additional $1 billion a year to combat XDR TB. In the U.S., Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and others proposed spending $300 million on TB next year, much of it on research. Given that isolating and treating a single XDR patient can cost up to $250,000, the case for spending far more on prevention and control is self-evident. Today, <u>more than one-third of the world'</u>s more than 6 billion people <u>have been exposed to the tuberculosis germ</u>. Five to 10 percent of them, or <u>at least 100 million, will develop symptomatic TB. <strong>Each will infect 10 to 20 people before</strong></u> they are either successfully <strong><u>treated</u></strong> or they die. <u>Last year,</u> active -- and contagious -- <u>tuberculosis was diagnosed in more than 8.8 million people</u>. Approximately 420,000, or 5 percent, of them have a drug-resistant strain that requires several more medications than drug-sensitive cases do; about 30,000 of these 420,000 cases are even more difficult and expensive to treat, the highly lethal XDR-TB. </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>In</u></strong> contemporary <strong><u>Africa, democratization and constitutionalism are pursued in tandem</u></strong><u>.

Instead, <u>throughout common law Africa, independently supervised competitive elections have become a fairly routine means of selecting and changing government</u>, and, in combination with new presidential [*1278] term limits, have eliminated from the political landscape the phenomenon of &quot;president for life.&quot; </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>The &quot;default&quot; answer to this question</u>, in light of Africa's past experience, <u>is negative, implying that the burden is on those who believe otherwise to state their case and overcome the presumption of futility</u>.

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Second, Loose interpretations of stare decisis</strong> </span><br />

Kwasi Prempeh, Professor of Law at Seton Hall Law School, former Director of Legal Policy and Governance at the Ghana Center for Democratic Development.

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Africa's judiciaries are emerging at last from decades of powerlessness and marginalization at the hands of omnipotent executives and strongmen</u>. Constitutional reforms that have accompanied democratic transitions in countries like Benin, Ghana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are helping to redefine the role and enhance the stature of the judiciary in the contemporary African state. <u>While <strong>past judiciaries served primarily as passive instruments of legitimation for authoritarian regimes, today’s African courts</strong>, like their counterparts in emerging democracies elsewhere, <strong>must enforce constitutional limitations</strong> on the exercise of governmental</u> power, as well as protect the rights of citizens, the media, and civil society. The idea of <u>judicial review is now enthusiastically embraced in a growing number of African countries. Establishing judicial review is, of course, the easy part</u>; a clause or two in the national constitution is generally all that is required to bestow such awesome power on the courts. <strong><u>The challenge is to ensure that judges</u></strong> <u>in newly democratizing states <strong>exercise their new power so as to advance and deepen the transition to constitutional democracy</strong></u>. This is indeed a matter of genuine concern, because <u>judicial review</u>, though widely celebrated by democrats and constitutional architects in transitional democracies, <u>is not quite the unmitigated virtue it is frequently made out to be</u>. As Alexander Bickel has reminded us, “judicial review means not only that the Court may strike down a legislative [or executive] action as unconstitutional but also that it may validate it as within constitutionally granted powers and as not violating constitutional &lt;Continued – no text deleted&gt; limitations.” <u>Because judicial review “performs not only a checking function but also a legitimating function,” it is a double-edged sword</u>. If exercised courageously (but prudently) to defend rights or hold the line against abuses of power, it could enhance constitutionalism in transitional democracies. <u>In the hands of weak, insecure, or illiberal judges, however, judicial review could easily become an even more formidable instrument for legitimating authoritarianism. Thus <strong>Africa’s newly democratizing states must seek to minimize the risk that judicial review</strong> will become a curse rather than the blessing it was meant to be</u>. Because it has generally been assumed that the African judiciary’s primary problem to date has been that lack of institutional autonomy and career security for judges, <u>Africa’s contemporary constitutional architects have adopted that standard Hamiltonian solution: judicial independence</u>. Thus Africa’s new constitutions all carry the standard provisions designed to secure judges in their jobs, salaries, jurisdiction, and judgments. Judges no longer hold their offices at the sufferance of the executive; judicial salaries and other benefits may not be varied to the judges’ detriment; jurisdiction of the courts may not be diminished at the pleasure of the executive or legislature; and, in general, at least two independent institutions must cooperate in making judicial appointments. In some cases, as in Ghana, the new constitution goes even further by giving the judiciary autonomy in the preparation, administration, and control of its own budget. Except in South Africa and Benin, where newly created “constitutional courts” have been laid over the preexisting judiciary, <strong><u>Africa’s newly refurbished judiciaries have generally consisted entirely of holdovers from the ancient regime “grandfathered” into the new constitutional arrangement</u></strong> <u>in the name of institutional continuity</u>. The assumption seems to have been that, given a new constitution with a host of rights-friendly provisions, limitations on governmental power, and guarantees of judicial independence, judicial review will lead to a liberal-democratic jurisprudence almost as a matter of course. Yet the evidence that is emerging, especially from the common-law jurisdictions, suggests that <strong><u>there is a significant risk that an asymmetrical jurisprudence will take hold</u></strong><u>, with the constitutional text contemplating a rights-friendly, liberal-democratic jurisprudence while that actual decisions and reasoning of the courts take a different course</u>. Ghana’s experience under its new constitution is a case in point. The case of Ghana indicates that reliance on judicial review and formal guarantees of judicial independence as the exclusive mechanisms for liberating African courts from their authoritarian past may be futile, unless such reforms are considered as incidental to the more fundamental question of how to produce a paradigm shift in the jurisprudence of the judges. <u>If the constitutions of Africa’s transitional democracies can be said to compel a new jurisprudence of constitutionalism, <strong>it also appears that recourse to tradition and longstanding common-law docrine</strong></u>, an ingrained deference to executive diktat, and <strong><u>the forse of stare decisis all propel Africa’s judges back toward a jurisprudence of executive supremacy</u></strong><u>. The trajectory of <strong>Africa’s democratic transitions will be adversely altered if Africa’s judiciaries fail to make a contemporaneous transition</strong> from the jurisprudence of executive supremacy to the jurisprudence of the constitutionalism</u>. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">THE PROBLEM </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>The</u></strong> <u>common <strong>root cause of</strong> economic decay, <strong>state collapse, ethnic violence, civil war</strong>, and humanitarian disaster <strong>in Africa is</strong> bad, <strong>abusive governance</strong></u>. Because <u>most <strong>states lack</strong> any semblance of a <strong>rule of law and norms of accountability</strong> that bind the conduct of those in government</u>, their societies have fallen prey to massive corruption, nepotism, and the personal whims of a tiny ruling elite. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In such circumstances, <u>every political clique and ethnic group struggles for control of a stagnant or diminishing stock of wealth. <strong>There are no institutions to facilitate trust</strong></u>, cooperation, or confidence in the future. Every competing faction tries to grab what it can for the moment while excluding other groups. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">THE SOLUTION </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>The only real antidote to this decay is a constitutional framework that facilitates the limitation</u></strong><u>, separation, devolution, and sharing <strong>of power</strong> so that each group can have a stake in the system</u> while checking the ruling elite and one another. In essence, <strong><u>this means a democratic political system</u></strong>, to one degree or another. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Given Africa’s authoritarian history, <u>many changes in beliefs and institutions will be necessary for democracy to emerge</u>. A growing segment of African elites and the public realize that every type of dictatorship on the continent has been a disaster. Thus, there is increasing hunger for economic and political freedom and the predictability of a democratic constitution. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As Hoover Institution senior fellow Barry Weingast pointed out in the American Political Science Review, ethnic groups will not trust and tolerate one another and cooperate for a larger national good unless there are credible limits on the state. <strong><u>Democracy cannot be stable unless rulers see that it is in their interest to abide by the rules</u></strong>. What makes it in their interest is the overriding commitment of all major ethnic groups, parties, and interest organizations to a constitution. </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Rabid Tiger Project believes that <u>a <strong>nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa</strong>. Civil wars</u> in the Congo (the country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, <u>as well as occasional brushfire and other <strong>wars</strong></u> (thanks in part to &quot;national&quot; borders that cut across tribal ones) <strong><u>turn into a really nasty stew</u></strong>. We've got all too many rabid tigers and <u>potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button</u> rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. <u>Very few countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. South Africa</u> is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably <u>already has the Bomb</u>. Thus, outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and don't need any &quot;help,&quot; thank you. Thus, <strong><u>an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly</u></strong>. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. <strong><u>Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing</u></strong><u>.</u> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Despite the emerging judicial consensus that the Commerce Clause was the proper basis for the exercise of federal power over immigration policy, the rationale for that authority began to [*231] change in 1889. <strong><u>In the</u></strong> <u>seminal <strong>Chinese Exclusion Case</strong></u>, which involved an 1888 Act of Congress that retroactively prohibited the re-entry of Chinese laborers who had left the United States, n35 <strong><u>the Court</u></strong> <u>abandoned any suggestion that the power required an explicit constitutional justification</u>, in the Commerce Clause or otherwise, <u>and <strong>announced a stand-alone, inherent federal power that granted Congress the power to</strong> control the nation's borders and <strong>exclude particular aliens from entering the country</strong></u>. n36 This was not found in the enumerated powers of the Constitution, but rather inferred from the broad and largely undefined principles of national sovereignty. n37 Writing for a unanimous Court, <strong><u>Justice Field described the risk</u></strong> posed by the entry of Chinese laborers <strong><u>as</u></strong> a national security concern: &quot;<u>The presence of Chinese laborers</u> had a baneful effect upon the material interests of the State, and upon public morals; that their immigration <u>was in numbers approaching the character of <strong>an Oriental invasion, and</strong> was <strong>a menace to our civilization</strong></u>.&quot; n38 In describing the Chinese laborers in such a fashion, the Court made no effort to locate the federal power to prohibit Chinese laborers from entering the country within the Commerce Clause or any other constitutional provision. n39 Rather, <strong><u>the Court derived the authority from</u></strong> <u>sweeping <strong>principles of sovereignty</strong></u>: [*232] That the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy. <u>Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation</u>. It is a part of its independence. If it could not exclude aliens it would be to that extent subject to the control of another power. n40 International principles of national sovereignty thus came to serve as the new basis for the federal power to regulate the entry of foreign nationals. In the years that followed, <strong><u>additional immigration cases reaffirmed</u></strong> <u>and extended <strong>the national sovereignty argument</strong> utilized in The Chinese Exclusion Case</u>. n41 Freed from the restrictions that came with tying the authority to regulate immigration to the text of the Constitution, <u>the Court provided Congress with <strong>an expansive power that was both &quot;indefinite and dangerous,&quot;</strong> n42 giving it carte blanche to make laws regulating foreign nationals who were seeking admission</u>. Additionally, <u>as <strong>the Court</strong> was upholding increased federal power to exclude aliens, it <strong>simultaneously decreased the scope of judicial review in the area of immigration</strong></u>. As the Court stated, &quot;it is not within the province of the judiciary to order that foreigners who have never been naturalized, nor acquired any domicile or residence within the United States, nor even been admitted into the country pursuant to law, shall be [*233] permitted to enter.&quot; n43 <strong><u>This combination</u></strong> <u>of increased congressional power</u>, not limited by the Constitution's text, <u>and decreased judicial oversight, <strong>marked a new reign of the plenary, inherent federal immigration power that continues today</strong></u>. n44 </span><br />

Peña,” 76 Or. L. Rev. 425, Lexis, JAK) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>Federal courts should apply the Court's current strict scrutiny</u></strong> of state alienage classifications to federal alienage classifications that affect immigrants' rights in the context of alienage law as well as those <strong><u>that affect fundamental rights in the context of immigration law</u></strong>. Aside from fairly ensuring that items such as tax burdens and welfare benefits are properly allocated between citizen and noncitizen whether imposed by the state or federal authorities, <strong><u>this congruence between alienage laws and immigration laws that affect fundamental rights adequately captures the essence of equal protection</u></strong> - the protection of discrete and insular minorities. n73 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>First</u>, as a starting point, <strong><u>the text of the Adarand opinion supports the idea that federal alienage classifications should be viewed with the</u></strong> same <strong><u>strict scrutiny</u></strong> to which state alienage laws are subject. Despite <strong><u>the Adarand majority's insistence that the congruence principle does not apply to laws within the expertise of the political branches of government, such as immigration</u></strong>, n74 alienage law - the law involving immigrants' rights - <strong><u>bears little constitutional relation for equal protection</u></strong> purposes to immigration law - the law governing noncitizens' entry into and exit from this country. Thus, under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress may appropriately distinguish between citizens and noncitizens in determining who is entitled to enter and leave the United States as part of its immigration power. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">However, one's citizenship may be of significantly less constitutional importance when Congress distributes public benefits. n75 Indeed, whether it [*443] is a state or a federal entity that decides to deny a noncitizen public benefits based on that person's status matters very little to the individual affected by the denial. n76 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In alienage law, a classification distinguishing between citizen and noncitizen onerously burdens the noncitizen, whether it is the state or the federal government that chooses to create it. Professor Kenneth Karst reminds us that it was not long ago that Congress pursued several well-meaning, but ultimately coercive, anti-immigrant measures within alienage law: </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In 1918 Congress doubled the income tax on &quot;non-resident aliens&quot;; although it was not clear who would be considered non-resident, thousands of [noncitizens] promptly declared their intention to become citizens. Other measures were proposed and even introduced in Congress, but failed to pass: ... &quot;suppression of the foreign-language press, mass internments, and the denial of industrial employment to [noncitizens].&quot; n77 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Last year's welfare reform bill that denies certain benefits even to documented immigrants closely mirrors the anti-immigrant measures of old. n78 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In addition, even within immigration law, strict scrutiny should be brought to bear on classifications that impair fundamental rights. Professor T. Alexander Aleinikoff suggests, for example, that critical examination should follow the enactment of immigration laws that burden family relationships; he provides the following example regarding the right to marry: </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Citizens and permanent [residents] do not enjoy similar opportunities for reuniting with immediate family members lo- [*444] cated outside the United States. The entry of the spouse or minor child of a [permanent resident] is subject to a numerical limitation (if the relationship was formed after the [noncitizen] entered the country), while the entry of the spouse or minor child of a U.S. citizen is not. The impact of the statutory scheme is dramatic because the numerical limits have created a waiting list of tens of thousands of [noncitizens]. Thus, if a permanent [resident] marries a Mexican national, the [noncitizen] spouse may have to wait as long as 10 years to be eligible for entry. However, if a U.S. citizen marries a Mexican national, the [noncitizen] spouse may enter as soon as immigration authorities process the paper work. n79 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Indeed, such an approach would be consistent with the &quot;fundamental rights&quot; strand n80 of equal protection analysis which, in Professor Aleinikoff's example invoking the constitutionally-based fundamental right to marry, n81 would sadly be subordinated to the plenary power of Congress over immigration matters. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Second</u>, as a practical matter, <strong><u>stricter scrutiny should apply to</u></strong> [*445] <strong><u>federal alienage classifications because the current rational basis test has not had much force when pitted against the ancient plenary power doctrine</u></strong>. n82 Although it has been invoked recently to strike a Colorado constitutional amendment that was patently anti-homosexual, n83 <strong><u>the existing rational basis test rarely has bite</u></strong> n84 to it, much less in its application to federal alienage classifications. In contrast, <strong><u>strict scrutiny will ensure parity in how laws are reviewed</u></strong>. n85 To do otherwise would be to effectively hold that the plenary power of the federal government trumps the rights of all noncitizens. In addition, to characterize the burdens on noncitizens as merely incidental denies the reality that the harm to the noncitizen is the same whether directly or indirectly inflicted. n86 Indeed, the government should be more vigilant when burdens are incidental so that it may properly assess the impact of such burdens on noncitizens' lives. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Third<strong>, the dangerous intersection of race and alienage caution greater</strong></u>, rather than lesser, <strong><u>scrutiny of</u></strong> both <strong><u>federal</u></strong> and state alienage <strong><u>classifications</u></strong>. Professors Neil Gotanda and Robert [*446] Chang have written extensively about how Asian-Americans, unlike blacks or whites, have always been marked as &quot;foreign.&quot; Professor Gotanda points to the Court's decision to uphold the wartime internment of all persons of Japanese ancestry in United States v. Korematsu as an example of this presumption at work: </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The evacuated Japanese-Americans, including U.S. citizens, were presumed to be sufficiently foreign for an inference by the military that such racial-foreigners must be disloyal. Japanese-Americans were therefore characterized as different from the African-American racial minority. With the presence of racial foreignness, a presumption of disloyalty was reasonable and natural. n87 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Gotanda's words strike a bitter chord in the real world: Racist remarks directed against persons of Asian and Latino descent more likely command the victims to return to their homeland than slurs aimed at blacks. Indeed, immigrant blacks from the West Indies often find a cultural disconnect with native African- Americans and yet are often perceived as part of the indigenous black community. n88 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Affirming Gotanda's thesis, <strong><u>Chang points out the historical intersection of race and immigration law in the Chinese Exclusion Case</u></strong>, in which the Court affirmed Congress's ban on Chinese immigration: </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>The Court begins by stating that the Chinese are foreigners of a different race</u></strong>, or what Neil Gotanda terms, racialized foreigners. n89 These racialized foreigners &quot;will not assimilate with us.&quot; Implicit in this is a notion of us or of we in &quot;We the People.&quot; The us the Court is talking about is the national community. They, the Chinese, are not us. Further, they will not assimilate with us. And therefore, we will not let them become us. This is justified because they are dangerous to our peace and security. They are the Yellow Peril, threatening our [*447] sense of the national community. Therefore, Congress must exclude them at the border. n90 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Chang concludes that Asian-Americans are &quot;perpetual foreigners&quot; whose &quot;foreign-ness is inscribed upon our bodies in such a way that Asian-Americans carry a figurative border with us.&quot; n91 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Latinos and Latinas, especially Mexican-Americans, also suffer the stigma of living with figurative borders. Professor Kevin Johnson notes that, despite public perception of the &quot;illegal alien&quot; as the unskilled, brown-skinned, Mexican male, Mexicans comprised only thirty-nine percent of all undocumented immigrants in the United States in 1992. n92 While many more Mexi- [*448] cans are legal immigrants to this country, n93 Mexicans, like Asian- Americans, are marked as perpetually foreign by the color of their skin. Further, just as Asian-Americans have been historically excluded through judicial and legislative action, Mexican- Americans have been similarly targeted by government action, most notably in California. n94 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">More importantly, this intersection of race and alienage is not simply a theoretical construct, but is a genuine concern born of the recent influx of nonwhite immigrants. Since the National Origins quota system severely curtailing immigration from predominantly nonwhite nations n95 was abolished in 1965, n96 most recent immigrants have been from Asia and Latin America. n97 Indeed, the top five countries of birth for legal immigrants in 1990 were Mexico, El Salvador, the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic. n98 Because of the larger numbers of nonwhite immigrants, the more Congress and the states create alienage [*449] classifications, the greater the likelihood that nonwhite immigrants will be unduly burdened by such classifications. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>These large numbers make anti-immigration</u> and anti-immigrants' rights <u>law an easy proxy for racism</u>. n99 Through the intersection of race and alienage, nativist sentiment reinforces racist beliefs and vice-versa, making it exceedingly more difficult to discern whether newer alienage classifications merely mask underlying racial prejudice. n100 <strong><u>By invoking strict scrutiny, courts will be able to better ferret out invidious racial discrimination</u></strong> or perhaps even benign neglect. n101 In addition, white and black noncitizens will benefit from the stricter standard even if the border of foreignness does not specifically bound them. n102 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">[*450] <u>Fourth</u>, noncitizens have relatively little political power because they do not have the power to vote. n103 While other minority groups - blacks, women, gays and lesbians - may argue (whether correctly or incorrectly) that they have suffered more historically, these groups have had the benefit of the franchise and access to the political process, n104 while noncitizens have had to rely on the benevolence of citizen-advocacy groups. n105 Unfortunately, such <strong><u>advocacy is hampered by the reality that Congress largely has free rein to discriminate against noncitizens</u></strong>, even on the basis of activity that is not illegal. n106 Further, where Congress enacts laws that only incidentally burden immigrants' rights, <strong><u>the judiciary should be particularly alert because noncitizens' advocates may not act as swiftly as they would if the law directly targets noncitizens</u></strong>, notwithstanding the genuine impact on the affected group. n107 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">[*451] Fifth, the United States has long taken pride in promoting the values of diversity, tolerance, and community. We experience diversity in the large influx of nonwhite immigrants into this country; it would be a shame if the salutary effects of the abolition of the National Origins quota system of immigration n108 - itself a triumph of the nation's commitment to diversity - continue to be diminished by the passing of ever more oppressive anti-immigrant laws subject to minimal judicial scrutiny. Moreover, tolerance is not only the touchstone of the First Amendment free speech right, n109 but also exemplifies the principle underlying the Declaration of Independence. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal.&quot; n110 A government that fails to appreciate the equal moral worth of all people n111 - citizen and noncitizen - fails to fully adhere to the historical imperative of tolerance of different people with different views and backgrounds. Finally, the United States has long believed in the principle of community. As stated in the introduction to this Article, the very words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty proclaim America as a welcoming community for those rejected by other nations. n112 To allow federal and state governments to divide the community of America between citi- [*452] zen and noncitizen in the conferral of benefits without good reason would be to undermine the historical principle of community symbolized so eloquently by Lady Liberty. </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In sum, <strong><u>the logic of the congruence principle, the inefficacy of the rational basis test</u></strong> in safeguarding immigrants' rights, <strong><u>the dangerous intersection between race and alienage</u></strong>, the political powerlessness of noncitizens, and America's historical adherence to principles of diversity, tolerance, and community <strong><u>combine to create a powerful case for strictly scrutinizing federal alienage classifications</u></strong> in the same manner as state classifications in the realm of alienage law and fundamental rights. </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">B. <u>Relevant <strong>Cases Holding that the Medical Rights of Detainees are not Protected</strong></u> by the Due Process </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">While the Supreme Court and other federal courts have held that aliens are protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, these <strong><u>courts have limited the extent of protection these individuals can receive</u></strong> in the following cases. <strong><u>In</u></strong> 1889, the Supreme Court considered the case <strong><u>Chae Chan Ping</u></strong> <u>v. United States</u>. n149 The appellant was [*170] a citizen of China who worked as a day laborer in San Francisco. n150 He returned to China for one year and carried a certificate issued by the collector of customs of the port of San Francisco, allowing him to return to the United States pursuant to the immigration laws in force at that time. n151 When he returned to San Francisco, he was denied permission to land because, during his absence, Congress had passed an act that nullified the certificates permitting Chinese individuals to return to the United States. n152 The appellant was prohibited from entering the United States and filed a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that his due process rights had been violated. n153 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>The Supreme Court</u></strong> of the United States <strong><u>found that it did not have the authority to consider the motives of Congress in passing legislation that would ban a certain group of citizens from immigrating</u></strong> <u>to the United States</u>. n154 The court stated &quot;[t]hat the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy.&quot; n155 The Supreme Court believed that the power to exclude aliens developed from the sovereign power of the nation. n156 Thus, </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">[t]o preserve its independence, and give security against foreign aggression and encroachment, is the highest duty of every nation . . . It matters not in what form such aggression and encroachment come, whether from the foreign nation acting in its national character, or from vast hordes of its people crowding in upon us. n157 </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Therefore, the Court held that the government had power to determine that certain people and groups should not be admitted and it was not the duty of the Court to question this finding. n158 <strong><u>This case is an early example of the</u></strong> [*171] <strong><u>plenary power doctrine</u></strong> <u>that the Supreme Court</u> and other federal courts <strong><u>have used to avoid determining the exact protection that the Due Process Clause provides for detainees</u></strong>. <span style="color: blue;">n159</span> </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As we enter the twenty-first century, <u>the attitude one encounters toward comparative law in the United States might, in some ways, compare with the attitudes that prevailed in France in the first half of the nineteenth century</u>. We recall that a certain paradox existed then. While the French Civil Code was spreading triumphantly across [*1094] Europe and around the world (sometimes manu militari, other times admiringly received like written reason itself), and becoming perhaps the greatest legal export ever seen, at home, the jurists of France maintained the narrowest, most self-absorbed focus possible. This was the height of l'ecole de l'exegese; France considered itself cut off from the wider world of civil law. One recalls the phrase of Bugnet, an early commentator: &quot;I know nothing of civil law; I only teach the code Napoleon.&quot; To use a trendy word, the code was headed global (even reaching la belle Louisiane) while French jurists only thought local. The land of Montesquieu was oblivious to comparative law. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sremote.pitt.edu/lnacui2api/,DanaInfo=www.lexisnexis.com+frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1284311680197&amp;returnToKey=20_T10095540756&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.835617.356872184#n2" rel="nofollow">n2</a></span> To my eyes <u>there is a similar phenomenon in the United States</u>, and it is illustrated by the attitude of our judges, legislators, mainstream scholars, and law reformers. I am aware that public law is not an area that comparativists usually focus upon; nevertheless, it seems natural for an American perspective to begin there, for that is where the guiding attitude has its source. Now as everyone knows, <strong><u>the United States Constitution has been a prodigious influence on world constitutionalism, particularly in regard to</u></strong> <u>the spread of the concept of <strong>judicial review</strong></u> and the notion of justiciable human rights. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sremote.pitt.edu/lnacui2api/,DanaInfo=www.lexisnexis.com+frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1284311680197&amp;returnToKey=20_T10095540756&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.835617.356872184#n3" rel="nofollow">n3</a></span> In the post-World War II era, perhaps <strong><u>our greatest donation to</u></strong> <u>the constitutional systems of</u> Europe, Asia, India, <strong><u>Africa</u></strong>, and Latin America <strong><u>has been the central principles of our Constitution</u></strong> and a wealth of Supreme Court interpretative jurisprudence. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sremote.pitt.edu/lnacui2api/,DanaInfo=www.lexisnexis.com+frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1284311680197&amp;returnToKey=20_T10095540756&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.835617.356872184#n4" rel="nofollow">n4</a></span> Yet <strong><u>our High Court</u></strong><u>, which sets the pattern and tone for the entire judiciary of this country and <strong>is regarded in many other countries</strong></u> as the prototype for their own constitutional courts, probably uses comparative law less than any constitutional court in the world.

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">With the scant mention immigration receives in the text of the Constitution itself, the combination of both principles has caused the field of immigration law to veer far from the standards and rights upheld in other areas of constitutional law.

Unfortunately, it seems that <strong><u>politicians and pundits</u></strong> <u>(and, in some cases, dissenting judges) <strong>have no patience for difficulty, care or nuance. It is a lot easier to simply lob the rhetorical grenade that a decision</strong> with which someone disagrees <strong>is</strong> an exercise in <strong>judicial activism.</strong></u> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><u>My suggestion is</u></strong> <u>that <strong>we</strong> either <strong>eliminate judicial activism from our vocabulary</strong> about decisions of the courts</u> or specify precisely what is meant by the term. Either way, it is clear that to complain that a decision is illegitimate because the court overturned a statute, or overruled a prior case, or recognized a right that is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution --the usual uses of the insult -- is simply not enough. <strong><u>Complaining about judicial activism</u></strong> <u>on those familiar grounds <strong>is nothing more than</strong> an epithet, <strong>the verbal equivalent of a can of spray paint wielded by those who are unwilling</strong> or unable <strong>to engage in</strong> the rigorous and <strong>responsible discourse</strong></u> of citizenship. We can do better than that. </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>The <strong>visa eligibility</strong> process <strong>is characterized by</strong></u> extremely <u>broad <strong>administrative discretion</strong>, as well as immunity from judicial review</u>, [*762] <strong><u>which makes the process susceptible to racial</u></strong> discrepancies and <strong><u>biases</u></strong><u>.

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The more prosperous and &quot;professional&quot; areas, such as Hermosillo and Mexico City, where trade and investment representatives and the intelligentsia tend to be concentrated, have higher rates of visa acceptances.

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Race discrimination in application locations is allowed and is SUBSTANTIAL!</strong> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Chin 98</strong> - Professor of Law at University of Cincinnati, J.D. from Yale University (Gabriel J., “Segregation’s Last Stronghold: Race Discrimination and the Constitutional Law of Immigration,” 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1 1998-1999, JAK) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Congress recently granted statutory authority to engage in race discrimination in processing visa applications</u>. Although the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) generally prohibits discrimination on the basis of &quot;race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence,&quot;54 <strong><u>the</u></strong> <u>Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility <strong>Act of</strong></u> 19<strong><u>96</u></strong>555 <strong><u>created a</u></strong> <strong><u>substantial</u></strong> <strong><u>exception, authorizing</u></strong> <u>the State Department <strong>to use race</strong></u> (as well as religion, sex, and other factors) <strong><u>in establishing</u></strong> <u>visa <strong>application procedures</strong> and locations</u>. Thus, <strong><u>a</u></strong> <u>future <strong>secretary of state could permit</strong> would-be <strong>immigrants of</strong> African or <strong>Asian descent</strong></u> (or, for that matter, who are Jews, Muslims, or Scientologists) <strong><u>to apply only to the consulate in Berne</u></strong> <u>or Sao Paolo, or impose procedural requirements <strong>that would make it</strong> practically <strong>impossible for them to receive visas</strong></u>. Although it seems unlikely that any secretary of state would do so, the INA itself currently presents the issue of whether the plenary power doctrine continues to permit classification of aliens by race. Perhaps more importantly, <u>treating the immigration cases as race cases offers a new critique of the plenary power doctrine in all of its applications.</u> While the Court has shown little inclination to abandon the plenary power doctrine, <u>underscoring the racial origins of the doctrine ought to give the Court pause.</u> </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The control of local matters being left to local authorities, and national matters being intrusted to the government of the [p606] Union, the problem of free institutions existing over a widely extended country, having different climates and varied interests, has been happily solved. For local interests the several states of the Union exist, but for national purposes, embracing our relations with foreign nations, we are but one people, one nation, one power. To preserve its independence, and give security against foreign aggression and encroachment, is the highest duty of every nation, and to attain these ends nearly all other considerations are to be subordinated. It matters not in what form such aggression and encroachment come, whether from the foreign nation acting in its national character, or from vast hordes of its people crowding in upon us. The government, possessing the powers which are to be exercised for protection and security, is clothed with authority to determine the occasion on which the powers shall be called forth; and its determinations, so far as the subjects affected are concerned, are necessarily conclusive upon all its departments and officers. <strong><u>If</u></strong><u>, therefore, <strong>the</strong> government of the United States, through its <strong>legislative department, considers the presence of foreigners of a different race</strong> in this country, who will not assimilate with us, to be dangerous to its peace and security, <strong>their exclusion is not to be stayed because at the time there are no actual hostilities with the nation</strong> of which the foreigners are subjects</u>. The existence of war would render the necessity of the proceeding only more obvious and pressing. <strong><u>The same necessity</u></strong><u>, in a less pressing degree, <strong>may arise when war does not exist</strong>, and the same authority which adjudges the necessity in one case must also determine it in the other. <strong>In both cases its determination is conclusive upon the judiciary</strong></u>. If the government of the country of which the foreigners excluded are subjects is dissatisfied with this action, it can make complaint to the executive head of our government, or resort to any other measure which, in its judgment, its interests or dignity may demand; and there lies its only remedy. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a. The Visa Application Process Generally, the admissions process involves three main steps. Unless the non-citizen must secure a labor certification or is part of a visa waiver [*57] program, the first step generally involves filing a visa petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). n8 <u>The petitioner, who is usually an employer or a family member with USC or LPR status, files a visa petition on behalf of a non-citizen beneficiary who is seeking entry into the U.S. n9 The visa petition gives the beneficiary the opportunity to show that she falls into an appropriate visa category</u>. n10 If the USCIS approves the petition, the information is provided to the National Visa Center (NVC), which then transmits it <strong><u>to the consular officer</u></strong> in the country of residence of the beneficiary. If the non-citizen is temporarily residing in the U.S., the non-citizen's last residence abroad serves as the appropriate consular district. The second step involves filing a visa application with the U.S. consulate in the appropriate country. <strong><u>The beneficiary must show that</u></strong> <u>he falls into an appropriate visa category and that <strong>she is not subject to any of the inadmissibility grounds</strong></u>. The third step involves seeking admission to the U.S. at a valid port of entry. The beneficiary may be subjected to a final examination by a Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) officer. n11 </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>B. Consular denials aren’t subject to review in the case of race discrimination.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Boswell 3</strong> - Professor of Law and Director, Center for International Justice and Human Rights, University of California, Hastings College of the Law (Richard A., Fall 2003, “Racism and U.S. Immigration Law: Prospects for Reform after “9/11?”” 7 J. Gender Race &amp; Just. 315, Lexis, JAK </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>Another doctrinal <strong>legal barrier is the non-reviewability of consular decisions.n127</strong></u> One of the earliest criticisms of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, and at least a partial reason that President Truman vetoed the Act, was that it placed unrestrained and unreviewable power in the hands of the person making the decision to grant or withhold visas. n128 <u>Because a visa is</u> the [*340] <u>essential</u> document <u>for gaining admission</u> to the United States, <u>the ability to grant or deny visas without judicial review places enormous power in the hands of the consular official</u>. While our current laws, like the 1952 Act, preclude judicial review and are silent on administrative review,n129 there have been at least two small yet important changes since 1952. First, the Department of State implemented a program of advisory opinions in an effort to place some controls on errant consular officers. n130 This advisory program is only partially satisfactory, however, because the opinions from the Visa Office at the Department of State are only advisory as to the law and simply accept the consular officers' version of the facts. n131 The second important change since 1952 occurred with the enactment of the 1990 Immigration Act. n132 The 1990 Act contains a provision that the person denied a visa is entitled to a written notice of a visa denial. n133 <u>These doctrinal barriers place formidable legal obstacles to immigration reform</u>. On one hand, <u>the <strong>plenary power</strong> doctrine <strong>leaves congressional enactments, even those</strong></u> that may be <strong><u>blatantly racist, immune from judicial scrutiny</u></strong>. On the other hand, <u>the non-reviewability doctrine immunizes arbitrary executive action from scrutiny</u>. However, when viewed together with the attitudinal barriers, one realizes the true nature of the challenges facing progressive reform of the immigration law. C. Attitudinal Barriers The extensive history of violence against immigrants at U.S. borders at the hands of officials or private citizens is legion and reflects some of the attitudinal barriers that exist in the system. Throughout U.S. history there have been periods when nativist fears were strong, but it would be hard to identify a period in which the sentiment had fully subsided. <u>Racism</u>, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance or bias are an inveterate human problem. They are a unique condition of the human psyche. On one level, these biases are the manifestations of an individual's fears and reflect a person's attitudes about those around them. These fears may be of little consequence when standing alone and held by persons with little power. [*341] However, <u>when possessed by a person with the power to make a decision affecting the lives of others, these biases pose a serious force</u>. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 delegated great authority to personnel within the U.S. Department of State and the INS to make decisions regarding whether potential immigrants or foreign visitors will be allowed to travel to or be admitted to the United States.n134 At U.S. borders and within the United States, <u>immigration officers make daily decisions regarding whether a foreigner may enter the country</u>, be allowed to remain in the country or may impose conditions on the person's stay. <strong><u>If a consular</u></strong> or immigration <strong><u>officer is motivated by any form of bias, it seems unlikely that the victim</u></strong> <u>of bias <strong>can overcome the</strong> adverse <strong>decision</strong></u>. In an area of law subject to very limited review, the decision maker would have greater discretion to make arbitrary decisions; including those that incorporate bias. <strong><u>The</u></strong> <u>1965 <strong>reforms did not</strong> include provisions to <strong>deal with the racial</strong>ly motivated attitudes and <strong>biases held by consular</strong></u> and immigration <strong><u>officials</u></strong>. While not the primary focus of this article, these attitudes seem to persist today and <u>the attitudes</u> of those who make literally millions of decisions to determine whether someone will receive a visa or a favorable exercise of discretion invariably <u>will have a major impact on who comes to this country</u>. n135 </span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>6. Their interp is bad for debate</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A. It means illegal immigration isnt part of the immigration topic.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Benavidez 8</strong> - Associate, Latham &amp; Watkins LLP, Orange County, California; J.D., University of California, Berkeley School of Law (Mayte Santacruz, December 2008, “Learning from the Recent Interpretation of INA Section 245(a): Factors to Consider When Interpreting Immigration Law,” 96 Calif. L. Rev. 1603, Lexis, JAK) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u>One</u> controversial <u>ground of inadmissibility penalizes persons who entered the U.S. without authorization</u> because they are considered &quot;inadmissible.&quot; More precisely, section 212(a)(6) (the &quot;unlawfully present ground of inadmissibility&quot;) of the INA provides: &quot;<u>An alien present in the United States without being admitted</u> or paroled, or who arrived in the United States at any time or place other than as designated by the Attorney General, <u>is inadmissible</u>.&quot; <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sremote.pitt.edu/lnacui2api/,DanaInfo=www.lexisnexis.com+frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1289256783926&amp;returnToKey=20_T10556590657&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.692050.5709471729#n41" rel="nofollow">n41</a></span> The term &quot;admitted&quot; in the immigration context means &quot;the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.&quot; <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sremote.pitt.edu/lnacui2api/,DanaInfo=www.lexisnexis.com+frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1289256783926&amp;returnToKey=20_T10556590657&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.692050.5709471729#n42" rel="nofollow">n42</a></span> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This was the first time <u>Congress made an illegal entry a ground of inadmissibility, thereby affecting most immigrants already present in the U.S. who entered the country without a visa</u> or any other legal documentation. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sremote.pitt.edu/lnacui2api/,DanaInfo=www.lexisnexis.com+frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1289256783926&amp;returnToKey=20_T10556590657&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.692050.5709471729#n43" rel="nofollow">n43</a></span> At the same time, however, Congress created a narrow exception for battered women and children with approved VAWA petitions: </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Illegal immigration should be the core of the immigration topic. Just because the community chose to focus on speciality worker visas doesn’t mean illegal immigration isn’t A) predictable or B) germane to the topic.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>B. It unlimits the topic. Allowing affs to change eligibility of single visa classifications allows a number of small affs, such as giving Australian E-3 visas to non-Australians</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>7. Our interp is better.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A. Debating Chinese Exclusion is key b/c its the foundation for visa denials</strong> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Katyal et al 10</strong> - Acting Solicitor General, Counsel of Record (Neal Kumar; Tony West, Assistant Attorneys General; Lanny A. Breuer, Assistant Attorneys General; Edwin S. Kneedler, Deputy Solicitor General; Sarah E. Harrington, Assistant to the Solicitor General; Donald E.

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Second, <u>the power to confer or deny citizenship</u> to individuals born abroad—individuals who are aliens insofar as the Constitution is concerned—<u>is also an aspect of the power to exclude aliens</u> from the Nation. <u>That power “is an incident of every independent nation.” The Chinese Exclusion Case, 130 U.S. 581</u>, 603 (1889). Accordingly, “[c]ourts have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental sovereign attribute exercised by the Government’s political departments largely immune from judicial control.” Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 210 (1953); see Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 766-767 (1972); United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 (1936). </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>B. Debating about courts and immigration law is key to being good policy makers</strong> </span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Thamkul 08</strong> - J.D. expected, University of California, Berkeley School of Law, 2008 (Janel, April 2008, “The Plenary Power-Shaped Hole in the Core Constitutional Law Curriculum: Exclusion, Unequal Protection, and American National Identity,” 96 Calif.

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fortunately, legal <strong><u>academic leaders</u></strong><u>, who mold future political leaders,</u> <strong><u>have the ability</u></strong>, through changing the legal canon, <strong><u>to adopt a new</u></strong> <u>and more accurate American national</u> <strong><u>identity narrative in which diversity and commonality are not mutually exclusive</u></strong>. As Fran Ansley argues: In legal education and <u>in American communities,</u> <strong><u>we should teach about</u></strong> <u>the boundaries of American citizenship</u>, should probe <u>the meanings and the mechanisms behind this &quot;nation of immigrants,&quot; and</u> we should do so with <strong><u>the history of immigration law</u></strong>, the national quota system, and the long line of Mexican guest worker programs in plain view. <strong><u>Given the impact of immigration</u></strong> <u>and immigration law on our society</u> and economy, and given the difficult immigration questions confronting us today, <strong><u>this is an issue that should be prominently in the canon</u></strong>. Immigration even has its own national monument surrounded by controversy, surely a sign that it has canonical status in the American imagination. <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexisnexis.com:80/lnacui2api/frame.do?reloadEntirePage=true&amp;rand=1283185971982&amp;returnToKey=20_T10012652092&amp;parent=docview&amp;target=results_DocumentContent&amp;tokenKey=rsh-20.240403.40539306248#n244" rel="nofollow">n244</a></span> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>8. Standards Debate</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>A. It doesn’t unlimit. We prevent hundred of small single eligibility affs. Even if they are subsets of admissibilities, other words check back.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>B. Ground: no abuse. We overrule 120 years of precedent. Disad links are based on different forces that don’t matter in a world of our aff. There’s no right to politics or midterms. There’s comparable disads against courts, such as judicial capital.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>C. Literature checks abuse. Chinese Exclusion is the basis for our entire immigration law</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<strong>9. Good is good enough—our interpretation provides predictable limits and fair ground, satisfying the purpose of T as a voter. “Best interpretation” is a myth since marginal differences in limits and ground are subjective and are outweighed by loss of aff flexibility.</strong><br />

<br />
A. They can still contest the solvency of the case affecting other principles, such as international law, enforcement, etc.<br />
<br />
B. In a vacuum, the plan text is topical. It prevents judge intervention.<br />
<br />
C. Extra-topicality is inevitable. Teams claim extra-topical advantages all the time, such as adhering to some treaty our immigration policy violates, or reviving the Doha talks. Affecting broader things is just an effect of the court.<br />
<br />
D. No ground loss. We can’t fiat around specific legal principle disads. Anything we claim as an advantage can be read as a disad even if we dont read it in round.<br />
<br />
E. Provides predictable neg ground. Counterplans would always lose to vague texts with perm do the counterplan. Specifying the overrule allows the negative a variety of mechanism counterplans.<br />
<br />
F. Education. We provide for actual education concerning how the courts overrule cases that determine visa eligibility.<br />

Conflict in Liberia is rearing up again, recent elections prove<br />
Economist 1/6/2011 (“Fear of contagion: Trouble is brewing on the two countries’ porous border”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.economist.com/node/17857371?story_id=17857371&amp;fsrc=rss" rel="nofollow">http://www.economist.com/node/17857371?story_id=17857371&amp;fsrc=rss</a>)<br />
The second Liberian group that has popped up again, previously known as the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, was once sponsored by Mr Taylor, who backed Côte d’Ivoire’s northern rebels in their vain effort to oust Mr Gbagbo during the Ivorian civil war in 2002. Abandoned at the end of that conflict, this group’s militia has swapped sides to fight for Mr Gbagbo.<br />
This is worrying for Liberia. A fragile peace has held since its civil war ended in 2003 after 14 brutal years. Disarmament and reintegration continue. But rebel attacks have previously been launched from across borders, sometimes with a wink from neighbouring governments. Ethnic groups straddling borders can spread war on either side. “Fighters have their own unpredictable agendas and retribution in Liberia is a danger,” says Pewee Flomoku, an analyst in Monrovia, Liberia’s capital.<br />
Liberia has its own elections in October. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa’s first female head of state, seems likely to be re-elected. But opposition politicians may be tempted to use gunmen returning from Côte d’Ivoire to stir up trouble.<br />
Liberia’s government has stepped up security at crossings. But the border with Côte d’Ivoire often runs through jungle and is 716km (445 miles) long. Some 85% of Liberians are said to be out of work; average annual income is around $200. “Many former fighters are jobless and linger around,” says Mr Flomoku. “Money and arms are a strong pull.”<br />
Meanwhile Mr Gbagbo is proving hard to oust, even though most of the world, including the UN and the African Union (AU), is arrayed against him. A bevy of African leaders has flown in to persuade him to go. The presidents of Benin, Cape Verde and Sierra Leone, among others, aired the idea of using military force, as well as offering him safe passage into exile. Most recently Kenya’s prime minister, Raila Odinga, has done his bit, in vain.<br />
Regional outfits, led by the influential 13-country Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have excluded Mr Gbagbo from their membership. He and his circle have been banned from travelling to most Western countries and their assets there frozen. The Central Bank of West African States, serving eight countries formerly in the franc zone, has recognised Alassane Ouattara, Mr Gbagbo’s rival for the presidency, as Côte d’Ivoire’s new head of state, and is refusing to accept Mr Gbagbo’s signature for transactions. ECOWAS has repeatedly threatened force.<br />
But Mr Gbagbo is still backed by the Ivorian army, state television and mobs in Abidjan, the commercial capital in the south, where his support is strongest. An attempt by Mr Ouattara’s people to march on the state television building on December 16th left about 20 dead. At least 170 more have been killed since then. The UN’s peacekeeping chief in Côte d’Ivoire, whose mandate is only to protect civilians, wants more troops to defend the Abidjan hotel where Mr Ouattara is holed up.<br />
Though international bodies may try to starve Mr Gbagbo of cash, he has a lot of it stashed away. Receipts from cocoa, the economy’s mainstay, which is still being exported through the two main Ivorian ports, continue to fill his coffers.<br />
In power since 2000, Mr Gbagbo is a master of calling his opponents’ bluff. Regional forces have previously intervened in west Africa to prop up governments under threat, such as those in Liberia and Sierra Leone. However, ousting a government by force is another matter. The AU managed it in 2008 in the puny Comoro Islands. But Côte d’Ivoire, by regional standards, is powerful. An attack on Mr Gbagbo’s Abidjan headquarters might risk high casualties. Supporters of the recalcitrant leader, who remains strong in the south, could also inflict ferocious reprisals on civilians, especially northerners, suspected of favouring Mr Ouattara. In short, while fear of regional contagion rises, Mr Gbagbo’s rapid removal looks as awkward as ever.<br />
<br />
The ability to use child soldiers makes civil war in Liberia inevitable<br />
AFP 07 (Agence France-Presse, 6/11/07. “Africa to mull post-conflict problems at UN conference.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EKOI-7439BR?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EKOI-7439BR?OpenDocument</a>)<br />
In Sierra Leone some 7,000 child soldiers have been reintegrated, among the overall total of 72,500 former fighters who killed, maimed and mutilated hundreds of thousands during a decade-long reign of terror. This time the venue is, symbolically, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is emerging from five years of regional wars. A political transition in the country culminated last year with the first free elections in 41 years. The process of integrating former fighters is an uphill task due to problems linked to lack of finance and political shenanigans. In war-ravaged countries such as Angola, the DRC and Liberia the proliferation of small arms and the systematic failure of reinsertion programmes calls the whole process into question. In the DRC, UN experts say 150,000 former combatants need to be reintegrated into civilian life. &quot;If nothing is done for their reinsertion, it will take just one local leader to re-arm 15 percent of them to plunge the country back into instability,&quot; UN official Renner Onana, who deals with security issues, said. Foreign armed groups from neighbouring states remain a major problem and the entire Great Lakes region remains vulnerable to this threat. In the west African country of Liberia, ravaged by back-to-back wars between 1989 and 2003, the descent into renewed bloodletting could be very easy. There were 100,000 demobilised fighters &quot;who can be easily recruited by mercenaries or armed gangs,&quot; Jackson Spear from the Foundation for International Dignity non-governmental organisation said. Burundi, emerging from 13 years of civil war, has managed to reintegrate only 8,000 of 23,000 demobilised fighters, because of political problems and insufficient funding.<br />
<br />
Liberia Adv - 2/7<br />
<br />
That sustains and initiates the conflict in Liberia<br />
HRW 04 Human Rights Watch, February 2004, “How to Fight, How to Kill: Child Soldiers in Liberia” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hrw.org/reports/2004/liberia0204/liberia0204.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://hrw.org/reports/2004/liberia0204/liberia0204.pdf</a><br />
Over the last fourteen years, Liberians have known little but warfare. Conflict and civil war have devastated the country and taken an enormous toll on the lives of its citizens, especially children. Thousands of children have been victims of killings, rape and sexual assault, abduction, torture, forced labor and displacement at the hands of the warring factions. Children who fought with the warring parties are among the most affected by the war. Not only did they witness numerous human rights violations, they were additionally forced to commit abuses themselves. Both of the opposition groups, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), as well as government forces which include militias and paramilitary groups widely used children when civil war resumed in 2000. In some cases, the majority of military units were made up primarily of boys and girls under the age of eighteen. Their use and abuse was a deliberate policy on the part of the highest levels of leadership in all three groups. No precise figures exist as to how many children were used in the last four years of warfare; however, United Nations (U.N.) agencies estimate that approximately 15,000 children were involved in the fighting.1 Although international law prohibits the use of children in armed conflict, thousands of children, some as young as nine and ten years old, were used by the fighting forces in Liberia. The use of child2 soldiers poses a serious threat to the rights of children, including their rights to life, to health, to protection and to education. Many child soldiers have suffered egregious abuses: forced conscription into the armed groups; beatings and other forms of torture; and psychological damage resulting from being forced to kill others. Girl soldiers have suffered the additional humiliation of rape and sexual servitude, sometimes over periods of several years.<br />
<br />
That exacerbates the conflict in size and length<br />
Singer 05 P.W. Singer, Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution. 2005. Children at War. Pg. 94-95.<br />
As a new source of fighters, children multiply the potential military capabilities of groups that choose to adopt the child soldier doctrine. This eases the difficulties groups often face in force generation, thus increasingly the likelihood of rebellions and wars. Children’s recruitment also allows the proliferation of armed opposition groups with weakened or nonviable ideological bases, which would have prevented their survival just a few decades ago. Moreover, the way in which child soldiers are used means that those conflicts are inherently “messier,” featuring atrocities and attacks on civilians. At the same time, child soldier group leaders consider children’s lives cheaper. Subsequently, they deploy their recruits on the battlefield in a manner that leads to a higher casualty ratio. The ultimate result is that, when children are present, violent conflicts tend to be easier to start, harder to end, and greater in loss of life. They also lay the groundwork for conflict recurrence in following generations.<br />
<br />
Even if conflict doesn’t spread, trauma shapes the psyche of child soldiers making repeat conflict inevitable<br />
West 98 Harry G. West, New School for Social Research, “Girls With Guns: Narrating The Experience Of War Of Frelimo’s ‘‘Female Detachment,’’ Anthropological Quarterly, 1998, accessed June 29, 2007, jk<br />
Increasingly, the literature also focuses on how children are drawn into violent conflict as combatants and perpetrators of the violence. The roles of victim and perpetrator, this literature seeks to demonstrate, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In the stereotypical scenario, portrayed in the literature on children and war in locations around the globe, children are conscripted to serve guerrilla insurgencies and, sometimes, state militaries well below the age of eighteen. After a brief training period, the loyalty of new conscripts is often tested through compelling them to commit atrocities, sometimes against former neighbors and even members of their own family. These children are overtaken by a sense that they no longer have a home and a family to which they might return some day. State militaries and guerrilla armies are often successful in driving a wedge between new conscripts and their communities of origin, producing for societal consumption an image of these young people as insensate killing machines. But many who have worked with ex-child soldiers in a post-war context have reported that they suffer long-term remorse and guilt for such deeds, even when carried out under compulsion (for example, Fleischman 1994). In any case, the general assumption in the literature is that war, and young people's participation in it, gives rise to a future generation of adults for whom violence is a part of everyday life. Today's victims reproduce the &quot;trauma&quot; they have experienced, giving rise tomorrow to cycles of recurring violence. If this is true, it does not bode well for Africa, a continent in which so many of today's population are young people who have experienced violence at first hand.<br />
<br />
Liberia Adv - 3/7<br />
The dramatic influx of conflicts as a result of child soldiers will eventually collapse Liberia and spark refugee flows that destabilize all of Africa.<br />
Singer 05 P.W. Singer, Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution. 2005. Children at War. Pg. 95-96.<br />
Child soldiers thus become one of the many forces lessening civil order and undermining weak state institutions, leading to what has become known as the “failed state” phenomenon. The rise of new armed groups in the context of weakening state institutions has repeatedly been the spark for coups, revolts, and other political and ethnic struggles to secure control over resources. As the recent collapse of the DRC illustrates, warlords, plunderers, and other violent actors then often emerge to fill the void left by a failing government. These groups all recruit children to help them build their personal power. That the child soldier phenomenon is concentrated in areas that are undergoing tenuous political transitions, such as Africa and Southeast Asia, only heightens its threat of instability and state failure. It is important to add that, while the West often imagines itself able to stand aside from failed states, the realities of the global system no longer permit this. Since the 1990s more than eight million people have been killed in failed states like Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and the DRC (all where child soldiers were present) and millions more have become refugees. Within these countries, hundreds of millions more have been deprived of basic human needs, such as security, health care, and education, which then feed back upon the problem. For many, the resulting scenes of chaos and tragedy create a moral imperative to take action. These occurrences may create a strategic mandate to act as well. The failure of local states can destabilize entire regions, create refugee flows that wash upon our doorsteps, or sometimes even endanger valuable financial or political assets. Some claim that the United States, for example, has equal or greater economic investments in areas of Africa that are at risk than either in the Middle East or Eastern Europe. These include critical supplies of oil (roughly one fifth of all U.S. oil imports) and strategic minerals.<br />

These wars cause draw in major powers and go nuclear.<br />
Deutsch 02 Dr. Jeffrey Deutsch, founder of the Rabid Tiger Project, a political risk consulting and related research firm, 11-18-02, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rabidtigers.com/rtn/newsletterv2n9.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabidtigers.com/rtn/newsletterv2n9.html</a><br />
The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa. Civil wars in the Congo (the country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as occasional brushfire and other wars (thanks in part to &quot;national&quot; borders that cut across tribal ones) turn into a really nasty stew. We've got all too many rabid tigers and potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. Very few countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. South Africa is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably already has the Bomb. Thus, outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and don't need any &quot;help,&quot; thank you. Thus, an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing.<br />

More important than lost investments is that these weak or failed zones tend to become havens for transnational terrorist groups. The collapse of governance in Afghanistan may have mattered little to the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, but it was an issue that came back to haunt us on September 11, 2001. As the UN Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi noted, the 9/11 attacks were “a wakeup call, [leading many] … to realize that even smaller countries, far away, like Afghanistan cannot be left to sink to the depths to which Afghanistan has sunk.” The decay of local law and order in these states give outside extremist groups freedom of operation. These zones then become a magnet for global terror groups that are seeking to take advantage of the local void in governance. As al Qaeda’s basing in Afghanistan illustrates, terrorism tends to thrive where failing or failed states are too weak to stamp it out. Indeed, even state failures that are seemingly disconnected to this threat can still have dangerous consequences. For example, policymakers in Washington were unconcerned by Sierra Leone’s collapse in the 1990s, as they saw little strategic value in the tiny country. Its state failure also had more to do with the child soldiers of the RUF than al Qaeda or any other terrorist groups. Nonetheless, the tiny West African country served as a critical node in the fund-raising efforts of Osama bin Laden’s al Qaeda network. The group used the chaos of Sierra Leone’s war to hid its own activities, including the conversion of al Qaeda cash into more easy to smuggle diamonds in the period just before the 9/11 attacks. In addition, three al Qaeda members reputed to have been involved in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania also took refuge in Charles Taylor’s Liberia in the summer of 2001. This illustrates that stability even in far away West Africa, which child soldier groups endanger, should be a concern of American national security.<br />

Mr. Chairman and distinguished members, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today on behalf of the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism. Congress created our Commission early in 2008, based on the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, assigning us the task of assessing the risk of WMD terrorism and recommending steps that could be taken to prevent a successful attack on the United States.<br />
The Commission’s Report assessed both nuclear and biological threats, and provided 13 recommendations and 49 action items. The Commissioners unanimously concluded that unless we act urgently and decisively, it was more likely than not that terrorists would attack a major city somewhere in the world with a weapon of mass destruction by 2013. Furthermore, we determined that terrorists are more likely to obtain and use a biological weapon than a nuclear weapon. Shortly thereafter, this conclusion was publicly affirmed by then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell.<br />

Only an enthusiastic US response supporting the reconstruction of Liberia, can keep the international community from abandoning the US and leaving us at the mercy of the terrorists<br />
O’Connell 04 (Jamie O'Connell, Law Clerk to the Honorable James R. Browning, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Harvard Environmental Law Review, Spring, 2004. 17 Harv. Hum. Rts. J. 207. “Here Interest Meets Humanity: How to End the War and Support Reconstruction in Liberia, and the Case for Modest American Leadership.”)<br />
Failing to lead in Liberia also would undermine the United States' ability to mobilize international cooperation on issues important to it. This interest is no less vital for being indirect: international cooperation is widely recognized as necessary to promote U.S. goals in areas such as security, trade, the environment, and health. Cutting off terrorists' funding requires regulation in every one of the scores of countries integrated into the international banking system, many of which profit from dubious transactions. Trade negotiations involve hundreds of issues, many of which have uncertain distributional consequences that make it difficult to strike deals based purely on immediate mutual interest. Pollution flows easily across borders and presents a classic free-rider problem, tempting every state to hold out on environmental agreements rather than bear the costs of conservation. In the SARS epidemic a new disease threatened the whole world, but a few countries bore the cost of containing it. On these and other issues, U.S. goals often diverge from those of other countries, and it is too expensive to buy them off. Accommodating other states' preferences when it is easy can create goodwill that translates into reciprocal flexibility in other areas. In addition to serving U.S. interests directly, leading in Liberia would generate such goodwill. The Bush Administration's policies have convinced political leaders and the general public in many countries that it has opted out of the international community. They believe the Administration sees little value in international cooperation and cares nothing for the needs and preferences of other countries. 163 The United States went to war in Iraq over widespread international opposition. Its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol on global warming drew protests from Europe. It has fought the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, a stronger Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention, and, most vigorously, the International Criminal Court. 164 A survey of European public opinion in early 2002, long before debate on war in Iraq began, [*242] found that &quot;85% of Germans, 80% of French, 73% of British and 68% of Italian respondents say the U.S. is acting mainly on its own interests in the fight against terrorism, while very few feel the U.S. is taking into account the interests of its allies.&quot; 165 Bush Administration officials' tone also has been criticized for suggesting disdain for other countries. 166 Clyde Prestowitz, formerly a senior official in the Reagan Commerce Department, decries these unilateral moves, calling the refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol a &quot;metaphor for American profligacy, unconcern, and arrogance.&quot; 167 Michael Ignatieff, director of the Carr Center for Public Policy at Harvard, has commented, &quot;In a war on terror, an isolated America whose military power awakens even the resistance of its friends may prove a vulnerable giant.&quot; 168 United States policymakers should heed the view held around the world that the United States has a responsibility to lead international efforts in Liberia. Failure to respond will strengthen the perception that the United States refuses to do its share of the global community's work, and will reduce other countries' willingness to cooperate on other issues. The Washington Post editorialized, The United States, and the Bush Administration in particular, is in sore need of the international goodwill that could be won from a modest but energetic response to Liberia . . . . People around the world[]are questioning whether the United States is still willing to use its strength for international causes outside its own narrowly defined self-defense. 169 The governments of the United Kingdom and France, 170 U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, 171 the editorial pages of The New York Times 172 and The Economist, 173 and the Assistant Secretaries of State for African Affairs under Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Clinton 174 all made clear that they considered sending troops a U.S. responsibility. Liberia is widely seen as the United States' turn to pitch in on the international effect to end the West African war. The United Kingdom and France are leading the international interventions in their former colonies, Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire. The United States maintained close ties with Liberia during the Cold War, as well as in the nineteenth century.<br />
&quot;If Washington wants other countries to help in sharing security burdens that fall on its shoulders in the future, it is essential that it play a lead role in Liberia today,&quot; Crocker wrote. 175 Rice, a Democrat, spoke more sharply: &quot;The British have played the major role in Sierra Leone, as have the French in Cote d'Ivoire, and the Australians in East Timor . . . . So far we have just opted out, [rather than] showing some concept of leadership and therefore some concept of burden-sharing in Africa.&quot; 176 The most authoritative statement, though, came from the U.S. government itself, through Assistant Secretary Kansteiner: U.S. follow-through on Liberia will affect our relations with Nigeria and the other 14 countries of ECOWAS. Liberia's stability is important not only for our relations with our African partners . . . but also for our relations with Europe. Specifically, the United Kingdom and France, which have invested significantly in stabilizing Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire, have publicly called on the U.S. to take the lead in resolving the Liberia crisis. Indeed, had the United States walked away from the country it created, many in the world would have doubted the depth of our commitment to Africa. 177 The problem, though, was that the United States had walked away. It deployed a handful of troops for a few weeks and then withdrew completely two days before Kansteiner spoke. The contrast with Iraq could hardly be sharper. In Iraq, the Bush Administration has jealously guarded political and military control over both war and reconstruction. Of Liberia, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said in July, &quot;it's necessary . . . for the U.N. to begin a political process&quot; for national reconstruction. 178 The Administration has so far resisted even the modest involvement others have urged. In Iraq it has pursued an enormous invasion and occupation against the weight of international opinion, costing hundreds of American lives and over $ 100 billion based on only flimsy evidence [*244] of a threat to the United States. 179 If it fails to respond to pleas from all local factions in Liberia and around the world to contribute to a multinational effort to stabilize and reconstruct an entire region, alongside two major allies, at almost no risk to U.S. soldiers, and for less than $ 2 billion over ten years, it will solidify its reputation abroad as a selfish unilateralist unwilling to do its part as a global citizen. Whether justified or not, this reputation will hinder the United States' pursuit of its interests in areas where cooperation is a necessity, not a luxury.<br />

Testimony to the House Committee on International Relations. “Renewing Transatlantic Partnership: Why and How.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://transatlantic.sais-jhu.edu/PDF/speeches/hirc_dh_testimonyJune.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://transatlantic.sais-jhu.edu/PDF/speeches/hirc_dh_testimonyJune.pdf</a>)<br />
Second, those who advance the proposition of American power and European weakness reduce the concept of power to its purely military component – a simplistic, unidimensional view of power in a complex, multidimensional world. It’s like being forced to watch a black and white, reel-to-reel movie on the wall of your basement when you know the full-color, digital Surround Sound version is playing in the theatre next door. Of course there is no substitute for effective military power when it comes to certain dangers. But in the post-September 11 world, power is distributed differently on different issues and, as Joseph Nye reminds us, resembles a three dimensional chessboard. On military issues, the world certainly is unipolar. But on economic issues, as I described above, the world is multipolar, and on the third level of play -- transnational issues outside the control of governments -- power is chaotically organized and it makes no sense to speak of a unipolar moment. “Those who focus on only one board in a three-dimensional game are likely to lose in the long run,”3 Nye cautions. Inordinate attention to one dimension of power deprives you of other tools in your tool box and blinds you to problems for which military power may not be the answer – WMD terrorism, or the peaceful reconstruction and rehabilitation of failed or rogue states such as Afghanistan or Iraq, for example. Few great goals in this world can be reached without America, but few can be reached by America alone. The American people are unlikely to support an approach to the world that makes every problem our problem and then sends our warriors to conduct our foreign policy. In this era of shadowy networks and bioterrorists, failed states and recession, the only way we can share our burdens, extend our influence, and achieve our goals will often be by banding together with others, particularly our core allies.<br />

Terrorists could strike at any moment – any delay increases the risk of a massive attack.<br />
AP, 7/12/07, “New Intelligence Report Finds Al Qaeda Focused on U.S. Strike,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118425569222864774.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118425569222864774.html?mod=googlenews_wsj</a><br />
Al Qaeda is stepping up its efforts to sneak terror operatives into the U.S. and has acquired most of the capabilities it needs to strike here, according to a new U.S. intelligence assessment. The draft National Intelligence Estimate is expected to paint an increasingly worrisome portrait of al Qaeda's ability to use its base along the Pakistan-Afghan border to launch and inspire attacks, even as Bush administration officials say the U.S. is safer nearly six years into the war on terror. Among the key findings of the classified estimate, which is still in draft form and must be approved by all 16 U.S. spy agencies: • Al Qaeda is probably still pursuing chemical, biological or nuclear weapons and would use them if its operatives developed sufficient capability. • The terror group has been able to restore three of the four key tools it would need to launch an attack on U.S. soil: a safe haven in Pakistan's tribal areas, operational lieutenants and senior leaders. It could not immediately be learned what the missing fourth element is. • The group will bolster its efforts to position operatives inside U.S. borders. In public statements, U.S. officials have expressed concern about the ease with which people can enter the U.S. through Europe because of a program that allows most Europeans to enter without visas. National Intelligence Estimates are the most authoritative written judgments that reflect the consensus long-term thinking of senior intelligence analysts. Government officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the report has not been finalized, described it as an expansive look at potential threats within the U.S. and said it required the cooperation of a number of national security agencies, including the CIA, FBI, Homeland Security Department and National Counterterrorism Center. National security officials met at the White House on Thursday about the intelligence estimate and related counterterrorism issues. The tentative plan is to release a declassified version of the report and brief Congress on Tuesday, one government official said. Ross Feinstein, spokesman for National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell, declined to discuss the document's specific contents. But he said it would be consistent with statements made by senior government officials at congressional hearings and elsewhere. The estimate echoes the findings of another analysis prepared by the National Counterterrorism Center earlier this year and disclosed publicly on Wednesday. That report -- titled &quot;Al-Qaida better positioned to strike the West&quot; -- found the terrorist group is &quot;considerably operationally stronger than a year ago&quot; and has &quot;regrouped to an extent not seen since 2001,&quot; according to a counterterrorism official familiar with the reports findings. On Thursday, news of the counterterrorism center's threat assessment renewed the political debate about the nature of the al Qaeda threat and whether U.S. actions -- in Iraq in particular -- have made the U.S. safer from terrorism. At a news conference , President Bush acknowledged al Qaeda's continuing threat to the U.S. and used the new report as evidence his administration's policies are on the right course. &quot;The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on Sept. 11,&quot; he said. &quot;That's why what happens in Iraq matters to security here at home.&quot; Yet Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller (D., W.Va.) said Iraq has distracted the U.S. He said the U.S. should have finished off al Qaeda in 2002 and 2003 along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Instead, &quot;President Bush chose to invade Iraq, thereby diverting our military and intelligence resources away from the real war on terrorism,&quot; Mr. Rockefeller said. He called for the U.S. to end its involvement in what he called the Iraqi civil war. In recent weeks, senior national security officials have been increasingly worried about an al Qaeda attack in the U.S. Appearing on a half-dozen morning TV shows Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff laid out a list of factors contributing to his &quot;gut feeling&quot; that the nation faces a higher risk of attack this summer: al Qaeda's increased freedom to train in South Asia, a flurry of public statements from the network's leadership, a history of summertime attacks, a broader range of attacks in North Africa and Europe, and homegrown terrorism increasing in Europe. &quot;Europe could become a platform for an attack against this country,&quot; Mr. Chertoff told CNN, although he and others continue to say they know of no specific, credible information pointing to an attack here.<br />

Nuclear terrorist attack would lead to extinction<br />
Ayson 10 (Robert, Professor of Strategic Studies and Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies: New Zealand – Victoria University of Wellington, “After a Terrorist Nuclear Attack: Envisaging Catalytic Effects”, Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism, 33(7), July)<br />
A terrorist nuclear attack, and even the use of nuclear weapons in response by the country attacked in the first place, would not necessarily represent the worst of the nuclear worlds imaginable. Indeed, there are reasons to wonder whether nuclear terrorism should ever be regarded as belonging in the category of truly existential threats. A contrast can be drawn here with the global catastrophe that would come from a massive nuclear exchange between two or more of the sovereign states that possess these weapons in significant numbers. Even the worst terrorism that the twenty-first century might bring would fade into insignificance alongside considerations of what a general nuclear war would have wrought in the Cold War period. And it must be admitted that as long as the major nuclear weapons states have hundreds and even thousands of nuclear weapons at their disposal, there is always the possibility of a truly awful nuclear exchange taking place precipitated entirely by state possessors themselves.<br />
But these two nuclear worlds—a non-state actor nuclear attack and a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange—are not necessarily separable. It is just possible that some sort of terrorist attack, and especially an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons between two or more of the states that possess them. In this context, today’s and tomorrow’s terrorist groups might assume the place allotted during the early Cold War years to new state possessors of small nuclear arsenals who were seen as raising the risks of a catalytic nuclear war between the superpowers started by third parties. These risks were considered in the late 1950s and early 1960s as concerns grew about nuclear proliferation, the so-called n+1 problem.<br />
It may require a considerable amount of imagination to depict an especially plausible situation where an act of nuclear terrorism could lead to such a massive inter-state nuclear war. For example, in the event of a terrorist nuclear attack on the United States, it might well be wondered just how Russia and/or China could plausibly be brought into the picture, not least because they seem unlikely to be fingered as the most obvious state sponsors or encouragers of terrorist groups. They would seem far too responsible to be involved in supporting that sort of terrorist behavior that could just as easily threaten them as well.<br />
Some possibilities, however remote, do suggest themselves. For example, how might the United States react if it was thought or discovered that the fissile material used in the act of nuclear terrorism had come from Russian stocks,40 and if for some reason Moscow denied any responsibility for nuclear laxity? The correct attribution of that nuclear material to a particular country might not be a case of science fiction given the observation by Michael May et al. that while the debris resulting from a nuclear explosion would be “spread over a wide area in tiny fragments, its radioactivity makes it detectable, identifiable and collectable, and a wealth of information can be obtained from its analysis: the efficiency of the explosion, the materials used and, most important … some indication of where the nuclear material came from.”41<br />
Alternatively, if the act of nuclear terrorism came as a complete surprise, and American officials refused to believe that a terrorist group was fully responsible (or responsible at all) suspicion would shift immediately to state possessors. Ruling out Western ally countries like the United Kingdom and France, and probably Israel and India as well, authorities in Washington would be left with a very short list consisting of North Korea, perhaps Iran if its program continues, and possibly Pakistan. But at what stage would Russia and China be definitely ruled out in this high stakes game of nuclear Cluedo?<br />
In particular, if the act of nuclear terrorism occurred against a backdrop of existing tension in Washington’s relations with Russia and/or China, and at a time when threats had already been traded between these major powers, would officials and political leaders not be tempted to assume the worst? Of course, the chances of this occurring would only seem to increase if the United States was already involved in some sort of limited armed conflict with Russia and/or China, or if they were confronting each other from a distance in a proxy war, as unlikely as these developments may seem at the present time. The reverse might well apply too: should a nuclear terrorist attack occur in Russia or China during a period of heightened tension or even limited conflict with the United States, could Moscow and Beijing resist the pressures that might rise domestically to consider the United States as a possible perpetrator or encourager of the attack?<br />
Washington’s early response to a terrorist nuclear attack on its own soil might also raise the possibility of an unwanted (and nuclear aided) confrontation with Russia and/or China. For example, in the noise and confusion during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist nuclear attack, the U.S. president might be expected to place the country’s armed forces, including its nuclear arsenal, on a higher stage of alert. In such a tense environment, when careful planning runs up against the friction of reality, it is just possible that Moscow and/or China might mistakenly read this as a sign of U.S. intentions to use force (and possibly nuclear force) against them. In that situation, the temptations to preempt such actions might grow, although it must be admitted that any preemption would probably still meet with a devastating response.<br />

Once children have become soldiers, it is extremely difficult to reintegrate them back into society. The long-term psycho-social effects of armed conflict on child soldiers can be absolutely devastating.149 Children often experience severe withdrawal symptoms from harsh narcotics, bedwetting, nightmares, and flashbacks.150 Numerous children do not have families to return to and face the possibility of being re-recruited.151 If they are returned to a caregiver, it becomes very arduous for the child to regain sometimes years of their childhood that has been lost.152 Learning to be a child again and go back to school after putting down their weapon is an enormous defeat that they could have never imagined before joining an armed group.<br />

Child soldiers are vulnerable to three profound sequelae in their adult lives. The first of these is that the desocialization and dehumanization of a young adolescent's mind becomes self-perpetuating. The excitement of interpersonal physical conflict, of combat, of dominance and of sexual violence entraps such victims. Second, the 'lost childhood' of these victims means that schooling and subsequent rehabilitation are very difficult. Third, although as yet there is no published work on the long-term sequelae of 'life and childhood in combat ranks', all who work with children and adolescents are aware of the inescapability of post-traumatic stress disorder. In particular, someone enmeshed throughout their formative years in society-induced psychopathy is very difficult to rehabilitate. The responses of young adolescents to violence and disaster cause profound changes in their attitudes towards life and their future.62 Adolescents exposed to trauma demonstrate increased risk-taking behaviour. Often, in the pre-recruitment phase when a child or young adolescent is particularly vulnerable to enlistment as a child soldier, he or she has already lost both parents, some or all of their siblings and their extended family. The situation can be compounded by the fact that when parents or other close relatives are lost in massacres, landmine or bomb blasts, or in epidemics, the normal rituals of closure do not occur. Burials and memoralization are a luxury of civilian society or of conflicts where the Laws of War still apply.63<br />
<br />
Soldiering affects the physical, mental, and moral development of the child.<br />
Troyer 2005 (Kathryn University of Denver originally published in The Applied Anthropologist, Volume 25, Number 2, fall 2005, Pages 135-146. The Mental-Health Needs of Child Soldiers in Uganda: A Case Study of Structural Violence)<br />
Armed conflict affects the physical, mental, and emotional aspects of child development. Bullets, bombs, knife wounds, and landmines kill thousands of children each year during wars, but more die from the indirect results of conflict, such as malnutrition and disease in refugee camps. Girls are vulnerable to gender-based violence during the war. Many have been raped while fleeing or staying at refugee camps or have been forced into prostitution due to economic circumstances. This results in the contraction of sexually transmitted diseases like the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and unwanted pregnancies at an early age. A child’s education also suffers during a war because safety issues or economic conditions may prevent children from attending school. During armed conflict, a child’s family support system breaks down along with other forms of protection, such as government and community support systems. When children are exposed to traumatic events like war, they often experience nightmares, increased anxiety, decreased appetite, or withdrawal from people around them. Older children and adolescents may feel anxious or depressed, develop aggressive behavior, or lose hope about the future (Machel 2005). Children increasingly participate in war as child soldiers, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and are at heightened risk of being harmed physically, mentally, and emotionally. Child soldiers are perhaps the most afflicted victims of armed conflict, especially in Africa.<br />

This soldiering normalizes violence.<br />
Hill and Langholtz 2003 (Kari Hill researcher in the field of child soldiers in Africa Harvey Langholtz is an associate professor at the College of William and Maryand a senior special fellow at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. Rehabilitation Programs for African Child Soldiers published in peace review online)<br />
Although the type and degree of participation may vary, the wartime experiences of child soldiers are uniformly corrupting and of lasting consequence, affecting children both psychologically and socially. While few studies have focused specilcally on the psychological effects of soldiering on children, the available data do suggest that children who have been involved in war suffer from PTSD. For example, a study at a rehabilitation center in Sri Lanka found that the children suffered from symptoms such as anxiety, nightmares, flashbacks, and suicidal thoughts. Studies that have looked at the effects of children’s exposure to chronic danger indicate the psychological impact soldiering might have on them. First, it may produce changes in personality and patterns of behavior. Second, soldiering may alter the framework children use to interpret and make sense of danger. Third, children’s moral development may be interrupted. When chronic danger is paired with an exposure to political ideology many children develop a “vendetta mentality,” beyond which they may not move. Fourth, danger can affect children by their identification with the aggressor. As a result of this process, children model their behavior on the powerful and aggressive individuals in their environment, who have caused the danger. In a conflict situation, children might eventually come to accept the “power of a gun” as a normal form of discourse and therefore begin to use violence and aggression as a “normal” means of interaction. Soldiering dramatically affects children’s individual, family, and community social spheres. At the individual level, children miss significant portions of their schooling or receive no education at all while they are child soldiers. This is significant for three reasons. First, when the war is over, they lack the skills needed in a civilian economy, which puts them at risk for being re-recruited into the armed forces. Second, when the war ends, it is difficult to enroll the children in school again because they are often at a lower level than other children their age. And third, former child soldiers return to normal society identifying themselves as soldiers rather than as civilians.<br />
<br />
That embeds violence into society making it inevitable.<br />
Troyer 2005 (Kathryn University of Denver originally published in The Applied Anthropologist, Volume 25, Number 2, Fall 2005, Pages 135-146. The Mental-Health Needs of Child Soldiers in Uganda: A Case Study of Structural Violence)<br />
Uganda’s history of conflict is a good example of Paul Farmer’s theory of structural violence. Farmer (2003) argues that violence is often structured by historically given and economically driven forces that conspire to constrain human agency through routine, ritual, or the hard surfaces of life. In a structurally violent society, a person’s choices—both small and large—are limited by racism, sexism, poverty, and other forms of oppression. Structural violence influences the nature of adversity, suffering, and marginalization in a society. Violence can sometimes be so structurally and insetitutionally imbedded into a society that its leaders, governments, and emerging groups will continually perpetrate it. For example, human-rights abuses in a structurally violent society are not random in distribution and effect but instead are symptoms of deeper pathologies of power and are intimately linked to the social conditions that determine who suffers abuse and who is shielded from harm (Van Arsdale 2005). The world’s poor are the chief victims of structural violence because the poor are more likely to suffer and less likely to have their suffering noticed (Farmer 2003).<br />

The effects of this socialization of violence outweigh the negative’s disads<br />

Child soldiering does not assume centrality on the West's security agenda, whose top priorities are terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and weapons of mass destruction. Nor is it a preoccupation of scholars in security studies. Yet despite its relatively low profile in both realms, child soldier recruitment is important because it involves the suffering and death of thousands of children every year -- many more than are direct victims of terrorism or the use of weapons of mass destruction. Concerns about the immorality of their recruitment and transgression of the rules of war might be regarded as self-evident. But to this consideration can be added several others, including the heightened exposure of naive children to the risks of death or injury in combat; the difficulty of rehabilitating child combatants; and the excessive cruelty inflicted by some child soldiers on their victims. It has long been understood that socialization into violence in youth creates a generation of violent adults, perpetuating a vicious cycle of instability within countries. Now, according to the aforementioned media reports, child soldiering has become intertwined with terrorism, suggesting that the increasing use of child soldiers poses a long-term threat to the health and security of societies far beyond the borders of the war-torn, fragile states in which these civil and ethnic conflicts take place. If their rehabilitation is difficult but necessary for the future stability of societies, then prevention is arguably even more vital and less costly.<br />

Second is The Exploitation of Children.<br />
<br />
Child soldiers are another form of trafficking that exploits children<br />

The recruitment of a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation and/or the participation in an armed conflict falls under the ambit of “trafficking in persons.”51 The first element of human trafficking is established when the trafficker (commander) recruits the child into the armed forces. The recruitment can occur within the country border of the DRC or across several nations.52A child soldier is trafficked when there is forced recruitment or no genuine voluntary recruitment; when the recruitment is done without the informed consent of the child’s parent or legal guardian; and when the child is not fully informed about the duties involved in the military service.53 The second element of force, coercion, or fraud is met by the means in which the commander(s) recruit children. Traffickers of children often target unsuspecting young individuals using calculating, ruthless trickery to entice innocent victims.54 Or traffickers forcefully abduct children from their homes, the streets, schools, or orphanages.55 Finally, the third element of exploitation can be established through multiple means. In the armies, child soldiers are used for a wide range of tasks: They serve as messengers, spies, camp guards or cooks.56 They are used to carry arms and ammunition.57 Many children are also forced into battle, where they are placed on the front lines or have to clear mines.58 Some have even been used for suicide squads.59 Children face heightened risk of rape, sexual humiliation and prostitution.60 Male and female child soldiers are often sexually abused and are at high risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases.61 Many girl soldiers are forced to be the wives of their commanders and this can result in unwanted pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV/AIDS), and social stigmatization.62<br />

While the recruitment process for child soldiers might be multifaceted, the experience of child soldiers is consistently one of victimization. n153 Child soldiers are brainwashed &quot;until their ethics and moral values become so distorted that they believe doing evil is good.&quot; n154 The children frequently are intoxicated with mind-altering drugs in order to make them fearless. n155 Child soldiers are often forced to engage in hard labor such as carrying large loads of arms, munitions, and equipment. n156 When a child fails at one of his tasks, he may be beaten or shot. n157 Child soldiers may also be forced to harm or even kill other children who break the group's rules. n158 New recruits are subjected to coercive indoctrination; for example, they may be forced to eat the flesh of other child soldiers who tried to escape or who were deemed &quot;traitors,&quot; and after killing fellow soldiers, they may be forced to smear themselves with the blood of their former colleague. n159 In spite of the terrible and violent acts that child<br />
soldiers may commit, their experience is unique and deserves special consideration.<br />

Boy soldiers are uniquely at risk to sexual violence due to gender mainstreaming<br />
Madsen 10 - LLM, JSD Intercultural Human Rights Candidate, Saint Thomas University; MA Social Worker, Rutgers (Jessia Nann, September 20, 2010, “Boy-Child Soldiers in the DRC: A Problem and Policy-Oriented Analaysis,” Worker Paper Series, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1679797" rel="nofollow">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1679797</a>, JAK)<br />
In the last decade, sexualized violence against boys including rape, sexual torture, sexual humiliation, mutilation of the genitals, sexual enslavement, and forced incest; has been reported in 25 armed conflicts throughout the globe.72 If this were to include the number of cases of sexual exploitation of boys that have been displaced by war, the list would encompass 59 armed conflicts.73 The problem of sexual exploitation against the boy-child soldier is not unfamiliar to the international community.74 Many international organizations, United Nations (UN) agencies, governmental and nongovernmental, and, international and national courts have acknowledged this issue.75 However, sexual exploitation of the boy-child soldier remains largely un- documented.76 When the international community began to pay particular attention to the topic of child soldiers and sexual exploitation, through the use of mainstreaming gender issues in the creation of its instruments, it began to lose sight of this major concern.<br />
Gender mainstreaming is the process of assessing the implications for both male and female individuals of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programs, in all areas and at all levels.77 It is a strategy for making women’s and men’s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design and implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs, in all political, economic, and societal spheres in an effort for both men and women to benefit equally, and, to ensure that inequality is not perpetuated.78 The goal is to achieve gender equality.79 However, beginning with the creation of international instruments such as the Vienna Declaration and Program of Action (VDPA), through to the more recent treaties such as the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict (CRCAC), the international community has imbued the world with a sense of gender inequality. The particular needs of the girl-child soldier are almost always emphasized in<br />
the media, UN resolutions, international treaties, and national legislation; however, the needs of the boy-child soldier are rarely addressed.<br />

[Assuming we are able to predict who or what are optimized humans, this entire resultant worldview smacks of eugenics and Nazi racial science. This would involve valuing people as means. Moreover, there would always be a superhuman more super than the current ones, humans would never be able to escape their treatment as means to an always further and distant end. This means-ends dispute is at the core of Montagu and Matson's treatise on the dehumanization of humanity. They warn: &quot;its destructive toll is already greater than that of any war, plague, famine, or natural calamity on record -- and its potential danger to the quality of life and the fabric of civilized society is beyond calculation. For that reason this sickness of the soul might well be called the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse.... Behind the genocide of the holocaust lay a dehumanized thought; beneath the menticide of deviants and dissidents... in the cuckoo's next of America, lies a dehumanized image of man... (Montagu &amp; Matson, 1983, p. xi-xii). While it may never be possible to quantify the impact dehumanizing ethics may have had on humanity, it is safe to conclude the foundations of humanness offer great opportunities which would be foregone. When we calculate the actual losses and the virtual benefits, we approach a nearly inestimable value greater than any tools which we can currently use to measure it. Dehumanization is nuclear war, environmental apocalypse, and international genocide. When people become things, they become dispensable. When people are dispensable, any and every atrocity can be justified. Once justified, they seem to be inevitable for every epoch has evil and dehumanization is evil's most powerful weapon.]<br />

While victims of injustice and poverty have always had trouble being heard, none have had more trouble, historically, than children. Whether exploited as child labourers or prostitutes, drafted as young teenagers into armed forces, forced as young girls into a lonely life as domestic workers, deprived of an education to work on the family farm, or denied adequate nutrition and health care, children need help and protection from an adult world that perpetrates most of the abuse.<br />

 Amending the TVPA creates the necessary international signal to solve<br />

Acknowledging primarily that child soldiering is a form of human trafficking is crucial to the recognition of the act as child exploitation and in the State’s obligations to prevent, protect, and prosecute. Once the international community is able to fully comprehend the nature and extent of sexual exploitation involved with each individual child attempting to be reintegrated into society, it can then adequately begin to dismantle the inappropriate preconceived notions about who is being sexually exploited during wartime, and, assist in the rescue, rehabilitation, and recovery process.<br />

Not only would such an approach provide greater protection to former child soldiers seeking asylum, but it also would be consistent with the United States' obligation under the Optional Protocol. As a party to the protocol, the United States committed itself to taking all feasible steps to promote the goals of the protocol, one of which is the successful reintegration of former child soldiers into society. The amendment would address the inadequacies that concerned the Committee in the United Nations' report and would provide the protection that the Committee recommended. Although judicially created exceptions would improve the current state of the asylum law, they would fail to provide the consistency that congressional action could provide. Further, they would not have the same wide-reaching effect for child soldiers. If the United States were to adopt such an amendment, it would reaffirm its dedication to not only stopping the use of child soldiers, but also to addressing the issues created by the continued use of child soldiers.<br />
<br />
That creates the necessary uniformity in international law<br />

The international community has a significant stake in ensuring the rights of our children are upheld and protected through the creation of effective measures outlined in the treaties. Children are our future and without providing each of them with their basic human rights, the outlook for tomorrow will not be promising. All of these international bodies and treaties have been instrumental in promoting the prohibition of the use and recruitment of children into the armed forces throughout the globe. Nevertheless, incorporation and implementation of these international guidelines into regional and domestic laws is as equally as important to the creation of the treaty and ratification. If international treaties and regional laws are conflicting as to the definition of a child and at what age a minor can lawfully enlist into the national military, it will be quite difficult to expect nations to ratify all of the these treaties, and, implement each of them into its own national laws in which it will be in conformity with all of them. Although there has been significant progress made with the creation of the CRCAC in an attempt to universalize a minimum age for direct participation and recruitment, there are remaining inconsistencies and implementation issues to be addressed globally.<br />

Without the recognition of this problem, there will be a significant lack of resources or services in place for boys attempting to be rehabilitated and reintegrated back into society. Boy-child soldiers should not have to live in further fear after demobilization due to social taboos and retaliation. The State must be required, through the assistance of human trafficking instruments, to provide boy-child soldiers with adequate protection and resources necessary for rehabilitation and reintegration.<br />

Congressional action would prevent child soldiers from being used in war<br />

Given that &quot;much control over immigration law has traditionally been vested in Congress,&quot; n185 the legislature is in the best position to make significant changes that will universally benefit child soldiers seeking asylum in the United States. If an exception is created for former child soldiers, they would be entitled to a nondiscretionary claim that does not currently exist. n186 Although they would still face the challenge of proving that they fit within the exception, child soldiers would have the legal right to assert the defenses that apply to their cases. The success of their claims would not depend as much on the differing applications that would be likely under judicially created exceptions. Rather, the INA would make clear that it does not intend to exclude child soldiers from asylum simply because they were forced, as part of their persecution, to commit atrocious acts.<br />
<br />
That specifically solves Liberia.<br />

In Liberia and Sierra Leone, where children were abducted and forcibly conscripted on a massive scale, the UNHCR looked to the CRC and the Child Soldiers Protocol rather than to exclusion practice in developing its policies toward former child soldiers. n195 These policies recognize that forced conscription represents a serious violation of children's rights, and that children, due to their age, should not be held responsible as adult combatants. n196 For example, whereas adult former combatants may not seek asylum until they have been demobilized and placed under observation for a period of time in an internment camp, former child soldiers are not interned, live with other refugees in a refugee camp, and may apply for asylum. n197 The U.N.'s Machel study also emphasized that the use of child soldiers is a problem created by adults, which should be eradicated by adults. n198 In addition, the treaty [*840] establishing the International Criminal Court makes the recruitment of children under age fifteen a war crime. n199 Recognizing that child soldiers are victims first and foremost, the ICC statute shields children under the age of eighteen from prosecution. n200<br />
While there are important policy reasons for prohibiting individuals who voluntarily commit serious crimes from enjoying the benefits of asylum, these policies, which serve to prohibit former Nazis and other perpetrators of serious crimes from seeking refuge in this country, were not intended, nor should they be extended, to exclude children. n201 To apply the bar to former child soldiers like Bernard Lukwago would fly in the face of the positive work that U.S. policymakers and the international community have undertaken to address this pernicious form of child abuse.<br />

Moreover, to allow more former child soldiers asylum in the United States could actually further our national security objectives. Studies indicate that if we deport former child soldiers back to their countries of origin, they are likely to be reassimilated into the rebel forces from which they escaped, adding to the number of our adversaries in the war against terror. n119 Most importantly, evidence suggests that &quot;many armed groups are [*299] sensitive to world opinion ... and heightened attention to the issue of child soldiers has prompted a growing number of non-governmental armed groups to make public commitments to end the use of child soldiers.&quot; n120 Therefore, the United States might, by supporting and offering aid to former child soldiers, contribute to the quelling of the forced conscription of minors while simultaneously improving its image as a leader in humanitarian aid. n121<br />

Amending TVPA is key. Its the only comprehensive legislation<br />
Tiefenbrun 8 - Professor of Law and the Director of the Center for Global Legal Studies at Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego (Susan, January 2008, “Women, Children, and Victims of Massive Crimes: Legal Developments in Africa: Article: Child Soldiers, Slavery and the Trafficking of Children,” 31 Fordham Int'l L.J. 415, Lexis, JAK)<br />
The TVPA is by far the most comprehensive piece of legislation to address the global problem of trafficking in persons, including children. Children trafficked abroad or into the United States from abroad for the purpose of child soldiering are arguably protected under this statute. The Trafficking in Persons Report (&quot;TIP Report&quot;) of 2006 specifically refers to child soldiering in Uganda as an example of one form of human trafficking. n198 While there is no significant incidence of child soldiering occurring [*451] in the United States, n199 the TVPA can help to educate parents in other countries about the dangers of child soldiering and serve as a good model statute for other nations where child soldiering is more prevalent. The TVPA expands U.S. involvement in prevention measures worldwide by increasing assistance and protection available to victims and by enhancing penalties for perpetrators. In other words, it takes the &quot;three P approach&quot; - prevention, protection, and prosecution - and adds the &quot;three R approach&quot; - rescue, rehabilitation, and reintegration - that has been advocated by human rights groups and legal scholars for the past decade.<br />

Creating the exceptions would lead to refugee resettlement programs which solves<br />

There are a couple different ways the admission of former child-soldiers would function. The proposed legislation could include the development of a federally-funded program inside the U.S. with the same objectives as the programs it<br />
has helped develop overseas. Similar to U.S. action taken in Colombia, safe houses or centers could be built in the U.S. with the federal funds. These would provide the necessary shelter, counseling and education for the child-soldier asylees and their families. The key is ensuring &quot;education and the opportunity to re-establish family life and productive livelihoods.&quot; n267<br />
The second suggestion is to utilize procedures already in place in the U.S. to care for the needs of a resettled refugee. As a matter of fact, most child-soldiers that desire to come to the U.S. do not have even a remote possibility of making it here on their own. n268 For those child-soldiers that are unable to reach the U.S. and apply for asylum, [*215] the Refugee Admissions Program (refugee resettlement program) could be utilized. n269 In fact, the U.S. is the largest resettlement country in the world. n270 For example, when a refugee first arrives he or she is given aid, like English lessons, money, medical assistance and employment services through the Office of Refugee Resettlement of the Department of Health and Human Services. n271 The purpose of the aid is to allow the refugee to establish a self-sufficient lifestyle. n272 Utilizing the refugee resettlement program would make these proposed changes to the law a reality.

Contention 3 is Judicial Independence<br />
<br />
African Democracy is at a crossroads - there are promising signs, but a large risk of backsliding due to illiberal transitions<br />
Prempeh 06 - Professor of Law at Seton Hall Law School, JD Yale Law School (H. Kwasi Prempeh, March 2006, &quot;Marbury in Africa: Judicial Review and the Challenge of Constitutionalism in Contemporary Africa,” 80 Tul. L. Rev. 1239, JAK)<br />
In contemporary Africa, democratization and constitutionalism are pursued in tandem. Although the results have been mixed and remain tentative, at least the movement to democratize politics in Africa has registered important successes. n170 The era of one-party regimes appears to be over in Africa, as is the coup d'etat as the normal method of regime change in countries like Ghana and Nigeria. Instead, throughout common law Africa, independently supervised competitive elections have become a fairly routine means of selecting and changing government, and, in combination with new presidential [*1278] term limits, have eliminated from the political landscape the phenomenon of &quot;president for life.&quot;<br />
While the breadth of political reform in Africa is widely acknowledged, doubts remain as to the depth or durability of its impact. n171 The doubts are strongest regarding progress toward constitutionalism. Even in the face of current political and constitutional reforms in Africa, presidential hegemony persists, political corruption and abuse of office are disturbingly rife, and the rule of law remains weakly institutionalized at best, n172 all of which prompt skeptics to query whether Africa's reforming polities can indeed graduate from electoral to liberal democracy or whether illiberal democracy - &quot;democracy without constitutionalism,&quot; that is - is a more likely prospect. Africa's common law states may have passed the &quot;elections&quot; bar, but is constitutionalism in their future?<br />
The &quot;default&quot; answer to this question, in light of Africa's past experience, is negative, implying that the burden is on those who believe otherwise to state their case and overcome the presumption of futility. The debate, however, need not proceed in the abstract; the terms of the debate have already been well framed by the pessimists.<br />
<br />
Two changes are necessary to successful African liberal democratization<br />
<br />
First, Judicial Review<br />
Robson 7 - Professor of Law &amp; University Distinguished Professor, City University of New York School of Law (Ruthann, Winter 2007, “Article: Judicial Review and Sexual Freedom,” 30 Hawaii L. Rev. 1, Lexis, JAK)<br />
At first glance, judicial review seems to be an inherent feature of constitutional democracy. Out of 193 independent nations, 164 have some form of [*5] judicial review. n18 New constitutions in new democracies, influenced by the United States, generally contain provisions for judicial review that give the judiciary the power to declare democratically promulgated laws void as unconstitutional. For example, under Afghanistan's new constitution, the &quot;Supreme Court, upon request of the Government or the Courts can review compliance with the Constitution of laws, legislative decrees, international treaties, and international conventions, and interpret them, in accordance with the law.&quot; n19 Similarly, the new constitution of Iraq announces that the constitution is the &quot;Supreme Law of the land,&quot; n20 that any legal provision that conflicts with it is void, n21 and grants the Federal Supreme Court original and exclusive jurisdiction to review claims that a law, regulation, or directive issued by the federal or regional governments is inconsistent with the constitution. n22 Likewise, new constitutions for nations from the former Soviet Union and on the continent of Africa favor provisions for judicial review. n23 Indeed, judicial review has been called one of the United States' &quot;chief contributions to world thought,&quot; n24 and &quot;one of the U.S.A.'s best-selling (and least remunerative) exports,&quot; n25 even as &quot;adopting&quot; nations have chosen to institutionalize judicial review through the different mechanism of specialized and designated constitutional courts. n26 [*6]<br />
Meanwhile, in the United States, this very power of the judiciary is incessantly and continuously contested. Best selling books such as Men in Black: How the Supreme Court is Destroying America, stridently advance the thesis concisely articulated in the title. n27 The more historical and less conservative approaches of legal scholars such as Larry Kramer and Mark Tushnet similarly argue that &quot;judicial supremacy&quot; should yield to a &quot;popular constitutionalism&quot; in which &quot;the Supreme Court is our servant and not our master.&quot; n28 Legal scholar Jeremy Waldron takes a similar view, articulating his &quot;opposition to American-style judicial review&quot; n29 and presenting a case against &quot;strong judicial review&quot; in which judges can declare legislative acts unconstitutional. n30 Certainly such concerns are not new. James Thayer's famous 1893 article sought to provide a guide to restrain courts from declaring acts unconstitutional. n31 The two- hundredth anniversary of the United States Supreme Court's 1803 opinion in Marbury v. Madison, n32 which reputedly n33 [*7] established judicial review, occasioned several symposia issues of law reviews devoted to the problems of judicial review. n34<br />
Abroad, Americans may not be promulgating judicial review as enthusiastically as it might appear. For example, regarding the drafting of the Iraqi constitution, at least one advisor from the George W. Bush administration argued that Iraq's constitution limit the power of judicial review, lest Iraq be faced with a situation of unacceptable judicial decisions comparable to those in the United States, such as those granting the right of abortion. n35 Further, the distrust of judicial review is not solely a preoccupation in the United States. Robert Martin's The Most Dangerous Branch: How the Supreme Court of Canada has Undermined Our Law and Our Democracy differs in its details and doctrine, but not in its ultimate conclusions. n36<br />
<br />
Second, Loose interpretations of stare decisis<br />
Prempeh 1 (H. Kwasi Prempeh, Professor of Law at Seton Hall Law School, former Director of Legal Policy and Governance at the Ghana Center for Democratic Development. In The Global Divergence Of Democracies, ed Larry Diamond 2001 p260-261)<br />
Africa's judiciaries are emerging at last from decades of powerlessness and marginalization at the hands of omnipotent executives and strongmen. Constitutional reforms that have accompanied democratic transitions in countries like Benin, Ghana, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are helping to redefine the role and enhance the stature of the judiciary in the contemporary African state. While past judiciaries served primarily as passive instruments of legitimation for authoritarian regimes, today’s African courts, like their counterparts in emerging democracies elsewhere, must enforce constitutional limitations on the exercise of governmental power, as well as protect the rights of citizens, the media, and civil society. The idea of judicial review is now enthusiastically embraced in a growing number of African countries. Establishing judicial review is, of course, the easy part; a clause or two in the national constitution is generally all that is required to bestow such awesome power on the courts. The challenge is to ensure that judges in newly democratizing states exercise their new power so as to advance and deepen the transition to constitutional democracy. This is indeed a matter of genuine concern, because judicial review, though widely celebrated by democrats and constitutional architects in transitional democracies, is not quite the unmitigated virtue it is frequently made out to be. As Alexander Bickel has reminded us, “judicial review means not only that the Court may strike down a legislative [or executive] action as unconstitutional but also that it may validate it as within constitutionally granted powers and as not violating constitutional &lt;Continued – no text deleted&gt; limitations.” Because judicial review “performs not only a checking function but also a legitimating function,” it is a double-edged sword. If exercised courageously (but prudently) to defend rights or hold the line against abuses of power, it could enhance constitutionalism in transitional democracies. In the hands of weak, insecure, or illiberal judges, however, judicial review could easily become an even more formidable instrument for legitimating authoritarianism. Thus Africa’s newly democratizing states must seek to minimize the risk that judicial review will become a curse rather than the blessing it was meant to be. Because it has generally been assumed that the African judiciary’s primary problem to date has been that lack of institutional autonomy and career security for judges, Africa’s contemporary constitutional architects have adopted that standard Hamiltonian solution: judicial independence. Thus Africa’s new constitutions all carry the standard provisions designed to secure judges in their jobs, salaries, jurisdiction, and judgments. Judges no longer hold their offices at the sufferance of the executive; judicial salaries and other benefits may not be varied to the judges’ detriment; jurisdiction of the courts may not be diminished at the pleasure of the executive or legislature; and, in general, at least two independent institutions must cooperate in making judicial appointments. In some cases, as in Ghana, the new constitution goes even further by giving the judiciary autonomy in the preparation, administration, and control of its own budget. Except in South Africa and Benin, where newly created “constitutional courts” have been laid over the preexisting judiciary, Africa’s newly refurbished judiciaries have generally consisted entirely of holdovers from the ancient regime “grandfathered” into the new constitutional arrangement in the name of institutional continuity. The assumption seems to have been that, given a new constitution with a host of rights-friendly provisions, limitations on governmental power, and guarantees of judicial independence, judicial review will lead to a liberal-democratic jurisprudence almost as a matter of course. Yet the evidence that is emerging, especially from the common-law jurisdictions, suggests that there is a significant risk that an asymmetrical jurisprudence will take hold, with the constitutional text contemplating a rights-friendly, liberal-democratic jurisprudence while that actual decisions and reasoning of the courts take a different course. Ghana’s experience under its new constitution is a case in point. The case of Ghana indicates that reliance on judicial review and formal guarantees of judicial independence as the exclusive mechanisms for liberating African courts from their authoritarian past may be futile, unless such reforms are considered as incidental to the more fundamental question of how to produce a paradigm shift in the jurisprudence of the judges. If the constitutions of Africa’s transitional democracies can be said to compel a new jurisprudence of constitutionalism, it also appears that recourse to tradition and longstanding common-law docrine, an ingrained deference to executive diktat, and the forse of stare decisis all propel Africa’s judges back toward a jurisprudence of executive supremacy. The trajectory of Africa’s democratic transitions will be adversely altered if Africa’s judiciaries fail to make a contemporaneous transition from the jurisprudence of executive supremacy to the jurisprudence of the constitutionalism.<br />

Democratic consolidation is key to African stability<br />
Diamond 98 - Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and co-editor of the Journal of Democracy (Larry Diamond, 1998, “Building a Democratic Africa,” Hoover Digest, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3532546.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3532546.html</a> ]<br />
THE PROBLEM<br />
The common root cause of economic decay, state collapse, ethnic violence, civil war, and humanitarian disaster in Africa is bad, abusive governance. Because most states lack any semblance of a rule of law and norms of accountability that bind the conduct of those in government, their societies have fallen prey to massive corruption, nepotism, and the personal whims of a tiny ruling elite.<br />
In such circumstances, every political clique and ethnic group struggles for control of a stagnant or diminishing stock of wealth. There are no institutions to facilitate trust, cooperation, or confidence in the future. Every competing faction tries to grab what it can for the moment while excluding other groups.<br />
THE SOLUTION<br />
The only real antidote to this decay is a constitutional framework that facilitates the limitation, separation, devolution, and sharing of power so that each group can have a stake in the system while checking the ruling elite and one another. In essence, this means a democratic political system, to one degree or another.<br />
Given Africa’s authoritarian history, many changes in beliefs and institutions will be necessary for democracy to emerge. A growing segment of African elites and the public realize that every type of dictatorship on the continent has been a disaster. Thus, there is increasing hunger for economic and political freedom and the predictability of a democratic constitution.<br />
As Hoover Institution senior fellow Barry Weingast pointed out in the American Political Science Review, ethnic groups will not trust and tolerate one another and cooperate for a larger national good unless there are credible limits on the state. Democracy cannot be stable unless rulers see that it is in their interest to abide by the rules. What makes it in their interest is the overriding commitment of all major ethnic groups, parties, and interest organizations to a constitution.<br />

African instability causes nuclear war.<br />
Deutsch 02 - economist, founder, Rabid Tiger Project (Jeffrey Deutsch, November 18, 2002, &quot;Rabid Tiger Newsletter, Vol. II, No. 9 - The Nuclear Family Has Become Over-Extended,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://list.webengr.com/pipermail/picoipo/2002-November/000208.html" rel="nofollow">http://list.webengr.com/pipermail/picoipo/2002-November/000208.html</a>, JAK)<br />
The Rabid Tiger Project believes that a nuclear war is most likely to start in Africa. Civil wars in the Congo (the country formerly known as Zaire), Rwanda, Somalia and Sierra Leone, and domestic instability in Zimbabwe, Sudan and other countries, as well as occasional brushfire and other wars (thanks in part to &quot;national&quot; borders that cut across tribal ones) turn into a really nasty stew. We've got all too many rabid tigers and potential rabid tigers, who are willing to push the button rather than risk being seen as wishy-washy in the face of a mortal threat and overthrown. Geopolitically speaking, Africa is open range. Very few countries in Africa are beholden to any particular power. South Africa is a major exception in this respect - not to mention in that she also probably already has the Bomb. Thus, outside powers can more easily find client states there than, say, in Europe where the political lines have long since been drawn, or Asia where many of the countries (China, India, Japan) are powers unto themselves and don't need any &quot;help,&quot; thank you. Thus, an African war can attract outside involvement very quickly. Of course, a proxy war alone may not induce the Great Powers to fight each other. But an African nuclear strike can ignite a much broader conflagration, if the other powers are interested in a fight. Certainly, such a strike would in the first place have been facilitated by outside help - financial, scientific, engineering, etc. Africa is an ocean of troubled waters, and some people love to go fishing.<br />

 <br />
Contention 1 is SB 1070<br />
<br />
SB 1070 wont be struck down, lack of precedent<br />
Fischer 11/2 - Capitol Media Services (Howard, November 2, 2010, “Will SB1070 remain on hold,” AZ Daily Sun, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/article_cfd0ac68-343a-5fc5-97d1-2464db66d7e8.html" rel="nofollow">http://azdailysun.com/news/state-and-regional/article_cfd0ac68-343a-5fc5-97d1-2464db66d7e8.html</a>, JAK)<br />
Federal appellate judges indicated Monday they might let Arizona start enforcing one of the most controversial sections of its new law aimed at illegal immigrants. Members of the three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out that the Obama administration is making a &quot;facial&quot; challenge to SB1070. That requires the federal government to prove it is impossible to enforce the disputed provisions of the statute in any constitutional way. But Judge Carlos Bea noted that one disputed provision says that when police have stopped someone they are required, when practicable, to make an effort to determine their immigration status with federal agencies if there is &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; they are in this country illegally.&quot; Bea questioned whether that, by itself, is unconstitutional. More to the point, Bea told Edwin Kneedler, the deputy federal solicitor general, he does not see how that is pre-empted by federal law. Kneedler conceded there is nothing wrong with police officers, on their own, making the checks. &quot;Our position is not that they're not authorized to&quot; check with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he said. &quot;Our objection is that the state statute mandates it.&quot; Bea was not impressed. &quot;It's up to the state how they want to use their people,&quot; the judge responded. Judge John Noonan added that if Congress doesn't want states requiring their officers to make such mandatory checks, there is a simple remedy: It can direct ICE to stop responding to the inquiries. PARSING FEDERAL INTENT The questions by the judges indicate they are giving serious consideration to arguments by John Bouma, attorney for Gov. Jan Brewer, that U.S. District Court Judge Susan Bolton was wrong in July when she blocked the state from enforcing this provision of SB1070.<br />
<br />
Scenario A is Racism<br />
<br />
We’ll isolate three internal links<br />
<br />
First, It fosters racial profiling<br />
Su 10 - Associate Professor of Law, State University of New York at Buffalo Law School (Rick, 2010, “The Overlooked Significance of Arizona’s New Immigration Law,” 108 Mich. L. Rev. First Impressions 76, JAK)<br />
The Arizona law at issue, S.B. 1070, is the state’s most recent effort to step up local immigration enforcement. Among its most controversial provisions is the requirement that all law enforcement officials take steps to verify the immigration status of any individual they encounter if there is reason to suspect that the individual is in violation of federal immigration law. Whereas immigration law enforcement has traditionally been a federal responsibility, and most local law enforcement agencies normally inquire about immigration status, if at all, only when an individual has been arrested for an unrelated criminal violation, S.B. 1070 directs law enforcement officials in Arizona to prioritize immigration enforcement in all contexts and whenever there is reasonable suspicion. With federal immigration policies as the backdrop, most of the debate surrounding S.B. 1070 has focused on the extent to which it “empowers” or “allows” state and local law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration laws. Defenders of the measure have justified it as an appropriate response given Arizona’s unique position as an immigration gateway and the lack of federal enforcement. Critics, on the other hand, have argued that such state legislation interferes with operation of federal law, and fear that this statue will ultimately lead to a patchwork of competing and inconsistent state immigration policies. In addition, critics question the expertise of state and local law enforcement officials, and are especially concerned that they may rely on abusive practices like racial profiling.<br />
<br />
Second, Its backed by White Supremacists<br />
O’Doherty 10 - Staff Writer (Cahir, August 2, 2010, “Arizona’s SB 1070 is racist to the core,” Irish Central, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.irishcentral.com/story/ent/manhattan_diary/arizonas-sb1070-is-racist-to-the-core-99735784.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.irishcentral.com/story/ent/manhattan_diary/arizonas-sb1070-is-racist-to-the-core-99735784.html</a>, JAK)<br />
And have you actually seen the comments written by so many of the state's own citizens in their online forums? To hear most of them tell it the undocumented have come to America to 'take our jobs, kill our citizens and rape our women.' Dehumanizing much? At a Republican County forum recently, in tune with the tenor of the times, primary candidate for Congress Pat Bertroche suggested that we microchip 'illegals.' Bertroche said, referring to undocumented immigrants who are detained and deported, 'I actually support microchipping them. I can microchip my dog so I can find it. Why can't I microchip an illegal?' And worst of all it’s no secret that the anti-immigrant movement in the United States has long and deep connections to white nationalist individuals and organizations. White supremacist political parties have made (and have advertised) a donation they made to the fund Brewer set in to prepare for the defense of SB 1070. Stormfront.org, the biggest white nationalist web forum online, has also called for donations to the SB 1070 defense fund. 'Money where you mouth is time,' they state. Jan, you might want to take a look at your most ardent supporters. Why? Because money talks, and here's what it's saying - SB 1070 is racist to the core.<br />
<br />
Third, it encourages the proliferation of racist state laws<br />
McKanders 10 - Associate Professor at University of Tennessee College of Law (Karla Mari, Spring 2010, “Identification of Race in the Law: Sustaining Tiered Personhood: Jim Crow and Anti-Immigrant Laws,” 26 Harv. BlackLetter J. 163, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Current state and local anti-immigrant laws should be examined in relation to Jim Crow laws because, as evidenced by the federal immigration system, laws that target immigrants are not free from the taint of racial discrimination. Viewing state and local activity against this historical backdrop, there should be heightened concerns over permitting states and localities to exercise unfettered discretion in enacting laws that target Latino immigrants. n120 As state and local entities begin enacting laws targeting immigrants, even more similarities to Jim Crow laws are arising. Currently there is a tension between the federal government and state and local entities, which claim anti-immigrant statutes and ordinances are valid exercises of the states' Tenth Amendment police powers, n121 which is similar to the tension that existed during the Jim Crow era. Jim Crow laws involved state [*187] and local refusal to adhere to the Reconstruction Amendments, while anti-immigrant laws involve the relationship between the federal, state, and local governments and the states and localities defiantly enacting laws in reaction to the federal government's failure to enact comprehensive immigration reforms. n122 Some state and local legislators allege that the federal government's inaction has adversely affected their citizens. For this reason, states and localities have exploited the federal government's failure to act and have enacted their own immigration policies. A second similarity is the speed and manner in which anti-immigrant laws are being enacted. Both Jim Crow and anti-immigrant laws quickly spread across the country, as the success of each new law emboldened state and local legislators to take action. In 2008, approximately 1,700 state and local immigration-related laws were passed. n123 In 2009, the National Conference of State Legislatures found that approximately 1,500 bills on immigrants and refugees were introduced in states across the country. n124 Also, like the federal courts during the Jim Crow era, some federal judges are similarly deferential to states and localities passing laws that target Latino immigrants. n125 Recent federal court decisions are signaling to states and localities that they have the authority to enact legislation that affects immigrants under states' Tenth Amendment police [*188] powers. n126 For example, in Arizona, the federal district court and Ninth Circuit upheld the Legal Arizona Workers Act n127 that targeted undocumented workers. n128 The Legal Arizona Workers Act revokes the business license of employers who hire undocumented immigrants. n129 The proliferation of state and local anti-immigrant laws mirrors the proliferation of Jim Crow laws. In both instances, there is a fundamental disagreement amongst the federal, state, and local government regarding authority over regulation of either immigration or, in the case of Jim Crow, prohibiting state and local discriminatory action. In both cases, the failure to resolve the disagreement results in the increase of state and local laws targeting vulnerable populations.<br />
<br />
That makes discrimination inevitable<br />
Wall 10 - JD Candidate 2010, Tulane; BS, Clemson (Adam Bryan, February 2010, “Comment: Justice for All?: The Equal Protection Clause and Its Not-So-Equal Application to Legal Aliens,” 84 Tul. L. Rev. 759, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Conversely, excluding nonimmigrant aliens from the protection afforded by strict scrutiny would have far-reaching consequences and &quot;could serve to erode the rights of nonimmigrants in other contexts.&quot; n165 Not only would it perpetuate the history of social discrimination against aliens in general, it could spark a new wave of discrimination against nonimmigrant aliens, both socially and politically. By differentiating between subclasses of aliens and giving preferential treatment to immigrant aliens over nonimmigrant aliens, it could create a social stigma for nonimmigrant aliens and create a political hierarchy within the general alien class. Even more detrimental, it would contravene one of the primary purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment by subjugating a disenfranchised minority to the unfettered discrimination of the majority - a majority that history has proven to vote and legislate unfavorably toward nonimmigrant aliens. n166 In essence, states would be able to discriminate freely against nonimmigrant aliens simply by claiming transience as justification. n167<br />
<br />
Rejecting racism through legal institutions prevents violence.<br />
Kenn 1 - Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse University College of Law (Deborah, Fall 2001 “Institutionalized, Legal Racism: Housing Segregation and Beyond.” 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35. p. lexis. // WPDU-JR)<br />
Until an effort equal to the efforts to create and maintain housing segregation and its consequences is initiated, supported, and perpetuated in our country, we can expect our racist legacy to continue and intensify. The effort must start with dismantling the racist institutions of housing segregation, white privilege, school segregation, and discrimination in the criminal justice system. The systemic problem of racism must be attacked systemically. Again, Professor Williams states: With regard to all these configurations, let me just say that I am certain that the solution to racism lies in our ability to see its ubiquity but not to concede its inevitability. It lies in the collective and institutional power to make change, at least as much as with the individual will to change. It also lies in the absolute moral imperative to break the childish, deadly circularity of centuries of blindness to the shimmering brilliance of our common, ordinary humanity. n203 Above all, each individual (and I'm speaking here to white people) needs to acknowledge that they can either be part of the problem or part of the solution. Continuing merrily along, enjoying our white privilege, oblivious to the negative impact we have on our black neighbors, makes us complicit in the centuries of racism that brought us to our racist present. Doing nothing is doing everything to [*72] be a part of the problem. In the eloquent words of Professor June Jordan: We need, each of us, to begin the awesome, difficult work of love: loving ourselves so that we become able to love other people without fear so that we can become powerful enough to enlarge the circle of our trust and our common striving for a safe, sunny afternoon near to flowering trees and under a very blue sky. n204 We can continue to travel the path of hatred and distrust or we can choose to begin dismantling the institutions borne of the distrust between races. Which kind of world do we want to live in - a world of hate or a world of love? Will we choose a world that isolates, separates, and wreaks unimaginable suffering on entire communities of people, or a world that celebrates the diversity of people and welcomes differences between people for the richness it brings to our lives<br />
<br />
Scenario B is US-Mexico Relations<br />
<br />
Relations are uniquely soured due to SB 1070<br />
Seelke 9/2 - Specialist in Latin American Affairs (Clare Ribando, September 2, 2010, “Mexico-US Relations: Issues for Congress,” Congressional Research Service, 7-5700, RL32724, JAK)<br />
On April 23, 2010, Arizona enacted S.B. 1070, which is designed to discourage and deter the entry to or presence of aliens in Arizona who lack lawful status under federal immigration law. Potentially sweeping in effect, the measure requires state and local law enforcement officials to facilitate the detection of unauthorized immigrants in their daily enforcement activities. The measure also establishes criminal penalties under state law, in addition to those already imposed under federal law, for alien smuggling offenses and failure to carry or complete alien registration documents. Further, it makes it a crime under Arizona law for an unauthorized alien to apply for or perform work in the state, either as an employee or an independent contractor.<br />
The enactment of S.B. 1070 has sparked significant legal and policy debate. Supporters argue that federal enforcement of immigration law has not adequately deterred the migration of unauthorized aliens into Arizona, and that state action is both necessary and appropriate to combat the negative effects of unauthorized immigration.85 Opponents argue, among other things, that S.B. 1070 will be expensive and disruptive, will be susceptible to uneven application, and can undermine community policing by discouraging cooperation with state and local law enforcement. President Obama publically criticized S.B. 1070, stating that the law threatened “to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.”86 In part to respond to these concerns, the Arizona State Legislature modified S.B. 1070 on April 30, 2010, through the approval of H.B. 2162.<br />
In the immediate aftermath of S.B. 1070’s enactment, Mexican President Felipe Calderón expressed his disapproval of the measure and stated that it “opens the door to intolerance and hatred.”87 On April 27, 2010, the Government of Mexico issued travel warnings to Mexicans planning to travel to Arizona and stated that Arizona’s recent immigration changes show “an adverse political atmosphere for migrant communities and for all Mexican visitors.”88 On May 20, 2010, President Calderón again criticized S.B.1070 during his address to a joint session of Congress by stating that it creates a dangerous precedent of “using racial profiling as a basis for law enforcement.”<br />

That prevent cooperation in solving global warming<br />
Seelke 9/2 - Specialist in Latin American Affairs (Clare Ribando, September 2, 2010, “Mexico-US Relations: Issues for Congress,” Congressional Research Service, 7-5700, RL32724, JAK)<br />
The U.S.-Mexico border region has been the focal point of bilateral conservation and environmental efforts, and some argue that it is an appropriate place to intensify U.S.-Mexican environmental cooperation.92 The 2,000 mile border region includes large deserts, numerous mountain ranges, rivers, wetlands, large estuaries, and shared aquifers. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, border residents “suffer disproportionately from many<br />
environmental health problems, including water-borne diseases and respiratory problems.”93 The United States and Mexico have been working to address many of these issues through bilateral programs like Border 2012, which relies on local level input, decision-making, and project implementation to address environmental challenges, such as water scarcity.<br />
The United States and Mexico have also been collaborating on geothermal energy projects since the 1970s, but the possibility of expanding joint efforts to produce renewable energy sources has just recently returned to the bilateral agenda. On April 16, 2009, President Obama and Mexican President Calderón announced the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change to jointly develop clean energy sources and encourage investment in climate-friendly technologies. Among others, its goals include enhancing renewable energy, further exploring the potential of carbon markets, and strengthening the reliability of cross-border electricity grids. On January 26, 2010, the U.S. Department of State hosted the framework’s first bilateral meeting, which was attended by officials from an array of agency officials from both countries. Some maintain that efforts to advance progress under the bilateral framework may hasten as Mexico prepares to host the Sixteenth U.N. Climate Change Conference in Cancún from November to December 2010, while others are less certain.<br />

Warming leads to extinction<br />
Henderson 6. Bill, Environmental Scientist, Aug 19, 2006 “Runaway Global Warming – Denial,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/cc-henderson190806.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/cc-henderson190806.htm</a>.<br />
The scientific debate about human induced global warming is over but policy makers - let alone the happily shopping general public - still seem to not understand the scope of the impending tragedy. Global warming isn't just warmer temperatures, heat waves, melting ice and threatened polar bears. Scientific understanding increasingly points to runaway global warming leading to human extinction. If impossibly Draconian security measures are not immediately put in place to keep further emissions of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere we are looking at the death of billions, the end of civilization as we know it and in all probability the end of man's several million year old existence, along with the extinction of most flora and fauna beloved to man in the world we share.<br />

Relations are key to prevent a depression<br />
Starr 9 - adjunct fellow specializing in Mexico at the Pacific Council on International Policy (Pamela K., “Mexico and the United States: A Window of Opportunity?”, Pacific Council on International Policy, April 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pacificcouncil.org/pdfs/Mexico_and_the_United_States.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacificcouncil.org/pdfs/Mexico_and_the_United_States.pdf</a>)<br />
The answer to these questions is of utmost importance to the United States. With a profound economic crisis dominating the agenda of the new Obama administration and two wars, China’s rise, and growing Russian belligerence demanding foreign policy attention, Mexico’s significance to the United States was largely overlooked during the 2008 presidential campaign. Yet no other country has more effect on the daily lives of Americans, a fact that extends well beyond the headline-grabbing problems associated with the drug trade and undocumented immigrants. Mexico has an impact on our ability to protect public health, provide environmental protection, and ensure energy security. It affects prices, salaries, and job creation in the U.S. economy, and it is a key driver of the evident demographic shift in the U.S. population. Mexico’s influence across this wide range of issues can be positive as well as negative, creating real opportunities as well as challenges not just for policymakers in Washington but also for those in state capitals and local communities throughout the nation. Mexico also matters to the United States as a<br />
reliable regional partner, albeit a prickly one at times. It shares, for example, the U.S. interest in limiting the reach of Venezuelan economic and political influence in the Americas. And good U.S. relations with the rest of Latin America begin, to a significant degree, with Mexico.<br />

Depression leads to nuclear war<br />
Mead 09 [Walter Russell, Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, “Only Makes You Stronger: Why the recession bolstered America.” New Republic, February 4]<br />
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />

Independently, a congressional panel announced in late 2008 that trouble looms. “Unless the world community acts decisively and with great urgency. It is more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013,” said the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism. “The Commission further believes that terrorists are more likely to be able to obtain and use a biological weapon than a nuclear weapon.” While the commisison conceded that highly specialized knowledge and equipment would be indispensable to mount a bio attack, it noted that trained biologists are relatively numerous. “Terrorists are trying to upgrade their capabilities and could do so by recruiting skilled scientists,” the commission said. Meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported in late 2008 that security is sub-par at two of the five U.S. laboratories authorized to handle deadly pathogens, the WMD commission said.

Of all the Weapons of Mass Destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause.<br />

The majority in Khrapunskiy erred in refusing to conduct an equal protection analysis. While engagement with such an analysis would have steered the court into uncertain doctrinal waters, the court should have confronted this challenge squarely through a careful, constitutionally adequate reinterpretation of Title IV. Such a reading would have reaffirmed the appropriateness of applying strict scrutiny to state alienage measures, turning the case for the plaintiffs.<br />
The majority erroneously disposed of the case by reasoning that &quot;levels of scrutiny are inapplicable and there is no basis for an equal [*804] protection challenge&quot; n38 because ASP is not a &quot;state program of aid.&quot; n39 The court's characterization or labeling of an indisputably governmental action does not permit the court to dispense with the requirements of the Constitution. The legislature's action was attributable either to the state, in which case the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied, n40 or to the federal government, in which case the action was subject to the similar requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. n41 In either case, an equal protection analysis was appropriate and necessary.<br />

While constitutional challenges to federal laws on behalf of undocumented immigrants have been largely unsuccessful, n104 several state laws have been [*833] successfully struck down as unconstitutional. n105 Aliessa v. Novello dealt with New York's state-funded Medicaid program, which included the same prohibitions as the Welfare Reform Act - specifically those banning legal immigrants from receiving Medicaid benefits for five years even after they entered the United States legally. n106 There, the Court of Appeals of New York applied a strict scrutiny analysis and held that the portion of the Welfare Reform Act allowing states to differentiate between different groups of immigrants when providing benefits funded by the state violated both federal and state constitutional guarantees of equal protection. n107 The inconsistency of this decision with Lewis - where the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found no constitutional violation in restricting Medicaid funds to undocumented immigrants n108 - is striking and thus-far unresolved. n109<br />

Ensuring access to medical services is critical to an effective defense against a bioterror attack<br />
Green 4 – PhD, Director, Outreach and Lead GE3LS Advisor, Ontario Genomics Institute (Shane, American Medical Association Journal of Ethics, May, Vol. 6, No. 5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2004/05/pfor2-0405.html" rel="nofollow">http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2004/05/pfor2-0405.html</a>)<br />
Consider the threat of bioterrorism: the potential use of biological weapons against this country raises the specter of a unique kind of war in which battles will be fought not against soldiers and artillery but against epidemics. Without significant reform to ensure access to health care for all Americans, the US will be unable to fight such battles effectively. Why Access?<br />
Using infectious diseases as weapons, bioterrorism threatens to weaken the civilian workforce and, hence, a nation's ability to go about its daily business. Moreover, in the case of diseases that are transmissible person to person, each infected individual becomes a human weapon, infecting others, who then infect others, and so on, tying up medical responders and overwhelming medical resources.<br />
A nation's greatest defense against bioterrorism, both in preparation for and in response to an attack, is a population in which an introduced biological agent cannot get a foothold, ie, healthy people with easy access to health care. Yet, in spite of spending significantly more per capita on health care than any other developed nation, the US is peppered with communities in which many people have little or no access to health care. This may be due to a lack of adequate health insurance—a fact of life for over 43 million demographically diverse Americans—or to cultural barriers that inhibit proper utilization of available services, or to inadequate distribution of health professionals and services. These communities are more vulnerable to infectious diseases [4] and therefore might be considered the nation's Achilles' heal in a bioterrorism attack. Take, for example, vaccination. A lack of access to health care among US citizens, particularly immigrant populations and those living in poverty, is associated with a failure to be vaccinated. This can have a serious impact on the spread of contagion, as evidenced by a rubella outbreak in 1997 in Westchester County, New York, in which a readily containable virus managed to infect a community composed largely of immigrants who had not been immunized [5]. Granted, US federal law permits all persons, including immigrants living here illegally, to receive emergency health care, immunizations and treatment of communicable diseases; those who are unable to pay can receive these services through Medicaid. Studies have shown, however, that immigrants are often disinclined to apply for Medicaid for fear that doing so will compromise their residency status or citizenship applications [6]. Still others avoid the health care system altogether due to mistrust or language barriers [7].<br />
<br />
The plan solves – convincing immigrants to seek preventive care from the government is critical to limit the number of deaths from a bioterrorist attack<br />
Murguia 5 –President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Council of La Raza, the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the U.S. (Janet, The Washington Post, “Injustice for Immigrants,” October 24th, Lexis-Nexis Academic)<br />
The success of disaster preparedness and relief depends on the ability to reach everyone who is at risk, to urge them to seek shelter, medical care and other lifesaving services. If there were an outbreak of communicable disease in Katrina's wake -- which is not unthinkable under the circumstances -- the last thing you want to do is convince a segment of the nation's largest minority that the government is not a safe source of preventive care and treatment. If, God forbid, the next crisis involves a biological weapon or an influenza outbreak, the government has just undermined its ability to keep us all safe. Lives are on the line, and not just the lives of the immigrants we too often find expendable.<br />

Minimizing the death toll is critical to avoid public backlash that forces nuclear retaliation<br />
Conley 3 – Chief of the Systems Analysis Branch, Directorate of Requirements, (Lt. Col Harry W. Headquarters Air Combat Command (ACC), Langley AFB, Virginia. Air &amp; Space Power Journal, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj03/spr03/conley.html</a>)<br />
The number of American casualties suffered due to a WMD attack may well be the most important variable in determining the nature of the US reprisal. A key question here is how many Americans would have to be killed to prompt a massive response by the United States. The bombing of marines in Lebanon, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 each resulted in a casualty count of roughly the same magnitude (150–300 deaths). Although these events caused anger and a desire for retaliation among the American public, they prompted no serious call for massive or nuclear retaliation. The body count from a single biological attack could easily be one or two orders of magnitude higher than the casualties caused by these events. Using the rule of proportionality as a guide, one could justifiably debate whether the United States should use massive force in responding to an event that resulted in only a few thousand deaths. However, what if the casualty count was around 300,000? Such an unthinkable result from a single CBW incident is not beyond the realm of possibility: “According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, 100 kg of anthrax spores delivered by an efficient aerosol generator on a large urban target would be between two and six times as lethal as a one megaton thermo-nuclear bomb.”46 Would the deaths of 300,000 Americans be enough to trigger a nuclear response? In this case, proportionality does not rule out the use of nuclear weapons. Besides simply the total number of casualties, the types of casualties- predominantly military versus civilian- will also affect the nature and scope of the US reprisal action. Military combat entails known risks, and the emotions resulting from a significant number of military casualties are not likely to be as forceful as they would be if the attack were against civilians. World War II provides perhaps the best examples for the kind of event or circumstance that would have to take place to trigger a nuclear response. A CBW event that produced a shock and death toll roughly equivalent to those arising from the attack on Pearl Harbor might be sufficient to prompt a nuclear retaliation. President Harry Truman’s decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki- based upon a calculation that up to one million casualties might be incurred in an invasion of the Japanese homeland47- is an example of the kind of thought process that would have to occur prior to a nuclear response to a CBW event. Victor Utgoff suggests that “if nuclear retaliation is seen at the time to offer the best prospects for suppressing further CB attacks and speeding the defeat of the aggressor, and if the original attacks had caused severe damage that had outraged American or allied publics, nuclear retaliation would be more than just a possibility, whatever promises had been made.”48 Even the “overwhelming and devastating” conventional response threatened by Secretary Perry would seem unlikely unless a large number of Americans or allies died.49 In any event, it is imperative that policy makers and planners consider that the number and types of casualties, as well as the attendant public opinion resulting from those casualties, will play a significant role in determining the nature of US reprisal actions.<br />

Retaliation will cause extinction<br />
Corsi 5 - PhD Political Science, Harvard (Jerome, phD in political science from Harvard, excerpt from Atomic Iran, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://911review.org/Wget/worldnetdaily.com/NYC_hit_by_terrorist_nuke.html" rel="nofollow">http://911review.org/Wget/worldnetdaily.com/NYC_hit_by_terrorist_nuke.html</a>)<br />
The combination of horror and outrage that will surge upon the nation will demand that the president retaliate for the incomprehensible damage done by the attack. The problem will be that the president will not immediately know how to respond or against whom. The perpetrators will have been incinerated by the explosion that destroyed New York City. Unlike 9-11, there will have been no interval during the attack when those hijacked could make phone calls to loved ones telling them before they died that the hijackers were radical Islamic extremists. There will be no such phone calls when the attack will not have been anticipated until the instant the terrorists detonate their improvised nuclear device inside the truck parked on a curb at the Empire State Building. Nor will there be any possibility of finding any clues, which either were vaporized instantly or are now lying physically inaccessible under tons of radioactive rubble. Still, the president, members of Congress, the military, and the public at large will suspect another attack by our known enemy – Islamic terrorists. The first impulse will be to launch a nuclear strike on Mecca, to destroy the whole religion of Islam. Medina could possibly be added to the target list just to make the point with crystal clarity. Yet what would we gain? The moment Mecca and Medina were wiped off the map, the Islamic world – more than 1 billion human beings in countless different nations – would feel attacked. Nothing would emerge intact after a war between the United States and Islam. The apocalypse would be upon us. Then, too, we would face an immediate threat from our long-term enemy, the former Soviet Union. Many in the Kremlin would see this as an opportunity to grasp the victory that had been snatched from them by Ronald Reagan when the Berlin Wall came down. A missile strike by the Russians on a score of American cities could possibly be pre-emptive. Would the U.S. strategic defense system be so in shock that immediate retaliation would not be possible? Hardliners in Moscow might argue that there was never a better opportunity to destroy America. In China, our newer Communist enemies might not care if we could retaliate. With a population already over 1.3 billion people and with their population not concentrated in a few major cities, the Chinese might calculate to initiate a nuclear blow on the United States. What if the United States retaliated with a nuclear counterattack upon China? The Chinese might be able to absorb the blow and recover. The North Koreans might calculate even more recklessly. Why not launch upon America the few missiles they have that could reach our soil? More confusion and chaos might only advance their position. If Russia, China, and the United States could be drawn into attacking one another, North Korea might emerge stronger just because it was overlooked while the great nations focus on attacking one another. So, too, our supposed allies in Europe might relish the immediate reduction in power suddenly inflicted upon America. Many of the great egos in Europe have never fully recovered from the disgrace of World War II, when in the last century the Americans a second time in just over two decades had been forced to come to their rescue. If the French did not start launching nuclear weapons themselves, they might be happy to fan the diplomatic fire beginning to burn under the Russians and the Chinese. Or the president might decide simply to launch a limited nuclear strike on Tehran itself. This might be the most rational option in the attempt to retaliate but still communicate restraint. The problem is that a strike on Tehran would add more nuclear devastation to the world calculation. Muslims around the world would still see the retaliation as an attack on Islam, especially when the United States had no positive proof that the destruction of New York City had been triggered by radical Islamic extremists with assistance from Iran. But for the president not to retaliate might be unacceptable to the American people. So weakened by the loss of New York, Americans would feel vulnerable in every city in the nation. &quot;Who is going to be next?&quot; would be the question on everyone's mind. For this there would be no effective answer. That the president might think politically at this instant seems almost petty, yet every president is by nature a politician. The political party in power at the time of the attack would be destroyed unless the president retaliated with a nuclear strike against somebody. The American people would feel a price had to be paid while the country was still capable of exacting revenge.<br />

Racial eligibilities are used to deny visas. Empirically true.<br />
Ogletree 2k - Jesse Climenko Professor of Law, Founder/Director of Harvard Criminal Justice Institute (Charles J. Ogletree Jr, July 2000, “Conference Paper: America’s Schizophrenic Immigration Policy: Race, Class, and Reason,” 41 B.C.L. Rev 755, Lexis, JAK)<br />
The visa eligibility process is characterized by extremely broad administrative discretion, as well as immunity from judicial review, [*762] which makes the process susceptible to racial discrepancies and biases. In a 1991 study of visa denials at U.S. consular offices, James Nafziger found considerable variation among acceptance rates in offices in different countries. n35 The highest acceptance rates were in Japan with 99.7%, while consular offices in Mexico accepted between 55% and 84% of applicants. n36 Nafziger speculated that the wide range of acceptance rates across Mexican offices might be due to &quot;demographic rather than administrative factors&quot;: n37<br />
The more prosperous and &quot;professional&quot; areas, such as Hermosillo and Mexico City, where trade and investment representatives and the intelligentsia tend to be concentrated, have higher rates of visa acceptances. Conversely, a higher rate of applications at the other posts came from poor, rural backgrounds. n38<br />
Some consular offices have used openly racist criteria in visa decisions. In Olsen v. Albright, a consular officer stationed in Brazil sued the State Department because he was fired for refusing to follow the consulate's racial visa eligibility policies. n39 The manual he refused to follow established fraud profiles which were based on factors such as race and national origin. n40 The manual instructed consular officers to scrutinize Korean and Chinese applicants for fraud and declared anyone from certain predominately black cities &quot;suspect unless older, well-traveled, etc.&quot; n41 The consular section head had further stated that &quot;Filipinos and Nigerians have high fraud rates, and their applications should be viewed with extreme suspicion, while British and Japanese citizens rarely overstay, and generally require less scrutiny.&quot; n42<br />
[*763] The so-called &quot;public charge&quot; ineligibility criterion, allowing visa denials where there is a likelihood that an immigrant will require public assistance, has been particularly subject to racial and ethnic stereotyping. This too is an area in which there is no judicial review. In 1978, a consular discretion study found that 61% of Mexican immigrant visa refusals were for public charge, while the criterion accounted for only 11% of Canadian visa refusals. n43 When interviewed, some consular officers openly admitted to using racial criteria:<br />
A number of consular officers think that certain ethnic groups are more likely to go on welfare than others. One officer believed that Canadians, Haitians, and Portuguese are not as likely to go on welfare as Latin Americans. Another officer stated that Chinese will not go on welfare . . . . Thus, he views Chinese with less suspicion than other groups under the public charge provision. n44<br />

Immigration law has been removed from judicial review<br />

Commentary 237, JAK)<br />
Fourth, the plenary power doctrine has largely removed the immigration issue from U.S. constitutional law, especially on entry decisions. The time-tested proposition is that &quot;in the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.&quot; n115 This is due to the uniqueness of the immigration field and its being interwoven with political questions and foreign affairs powers. In principle, the use of race, religion and nationality is more common in the context of persons seeking admission. In this context, U.S. courts have usually upheld the Government's broad scope of permissible authority to base decisions on race. As Kevin Johnson has written, race is central to the enforcement of U.S. immigration law, particularly near the borders. n116 Administrative policies are entitled to deference, although courts may require a rational basis showing to justify them. But when Congress passes an immigration law, courts grant a wider degree of deference and are inclined to find these laws constitutional. Nevertheless, one must ask whether courts would uphold the constitutionality of an immigration statute that clearly discriminates on the basis of race or religion. Some critics of U.S. immigration policy, such as Peter Brimelow, trace our woes to the 1965 Act that ended the national origins quota system. n117 Brimelow and like-minded restrictionists openly call on Congress to pass laws that would favor white Anglo-Saxon immigrants, and would bar the world's unwashed from being able to enter the United States. Although no court has explicitly held such discrimination to be a violation of the equal protection principles, it is significant that at least [*267] eight Supreme Court Justices have suggested that such legislation would be impermissible (although never in one opinion, and always in dissent). n118 As no such legislation has recently passed Congress, the closest we have come to a definitive answer is the question posed by Justice Marshall in his dissent in Jean v. Nelson. Justice Marshall rejected the possibility that the government may discriminate on the basis of race &quot;in the absence of any reasons closely related to immigration concerns.&quot; n119 He admitted that a constitutional claim would fail when it &quot;lies at the heart of immigration policy,&quot; and added that &quot;the individuality of the alien&quot; is a factor only when &quot;central immigration concerns are not at stake.&quot; n120 Yet, even Marshall's dissent is far more modest than the absolute prohibition under British law. In the Roma case, the House of Lords has ruled that &quot;if a person acts on racial grounds, the reason why he does so is irrelevant.&quot; n121<br />
<br />
<br />
And, this case is based on racist origins<br />
Scaperlanda 96 - Professor of Law, University of Oklahoma College of Law (Michael, March, 1996, “Partial Membership: Aliens and the Constitutional Community,” 81 Iowa L. Rev. 707, JAK)<br />
Plenary immigration power was founded on the back of blatant racial discrimination. The Chinese Exclusion Case, n89 which affirmed the exclusion of Chinese nationals from the United States, established within the political branches the absolute power to develop a profile of the &quot;desirable&quot; immigrant unfettered by any provision of our higher law. n90 As Professor Henkin has noted, &quot;whatever the Court intended [in the Chinese Exclusion Case], both its holding and its sweeping dictum have been taken to mean that there are no constitutional limitations on the power of Congress to regulate immigration.&quot; n91 From racial discrimination, plenary immigration power grew without bounds, allowing Congress to reflect the mood of an often anxious and fearful nation, unencumbered by the dictates of the Constitution. n92 During the &quot;red scare&quot; of McCarthyism, Congress wielded this power to deport long time resident aliens for their thoughts and associations. n93 Today it continues to stand as a sentry at our gates, allowing the political branches to formulate immigration policy without the restrictions that would otherwise be required by our constitutional traditions. n94<br />
<br />
And, nonimmigrant laws are held to a rational basis standard.<br />
Stumpf 8 - Associate Professor of Law, Lewis &amp; Clark Law School (Juliet P., September 2008, “Article: States of Confusion: The Rise of State and Local Power over Immigration,” 86 N.C.L. Rev. 1557, Lexis, JAK)<br />
A similar phenomenon has emerged in constitutional equal protection analysis. Domesticating immigration law muddies the existing equal protection dichotomy under which federal alienage laws receive rational basis review while state alienage laws usually trigger strict scrutiny. n257 That dichotomy is sustainable only so long as federal immigration law manifests as a facet of foreign policy and state and local legislation appears confined to domestic police powers.<br />
<br />
And, this standard makes discrimination and racism inevitable<br />
Wall 10 - JD Candidate 2010, Tulane; BS, Clemson (Adam Bryan, February 2010, “Comment: Justice for All?: The Equal Protection Clause and Its Not-So-Equal Application to Legal Aliens,” 84 Tul. L. Rev. 759, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Conversely, excluding nonimmigrant aliens from the protection afforded by strict scrutiny would have far-reaching consequences and &quot;could serve to erode the rights of nonimmigrants in other contexts.&quot; n165 Not only would it perpetuate the history of social discrimination against aliens in general, it could spark a new wave of discrimination against nonimmigrant aliens, both socially and politically. By differentiating between subclasses of aliens and giving preferential treatment to immigrant aliens over nonimmigrant aliens, it could create a social stigma for nonimmigrant aliens and create a political hierarchy within the general alien class. Even more detrimental, it would contravene one of the primary purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment by subjugating a disenfranchised minority to the unfettered discrimination of the majority - a majority that history has proven to vote and legislate unfavorably toward nonimmigrant aliens. n166 In essence, states would be able to discriminate freely against nonimmigrant aliens simply by claiming transience as justification. n167<br />
<br />
Discriminatory state laws are uniquely bad<br />
McKanders 10 - Associate Professor at University of Tennessee College of Law (Karla Mari, Spring 2010, “Identification of Race in the Law: Sustaining Tiered Personhood: Jim Crow and Anti-Immigrant Laws,” 26 Harv. BlackLetter J. 163, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Current state and local anti-immigrant laws should be examined in relation to Jim Crow laws because, as evidenced by the federal immigration system, laws that target immigrants are not free from the taint of racial discrimination. Viewing state and local activity against this historical backdrop, there should be heightened concerns over permitting states and localities to exercise unfettered discretion in enacting laws that target Latino immigrants. n120 As state and local entities begin enacting laws targeting immigrants, even more similarities to Jim Crow laws are arising. Currently there is a tension between the federal government and state and local entities, which claim anti-immigrant statutes and ordinances are valid exercises of the states' Tenth Amendment police powers, n121 which is similar to the tension that existed during the Jim Crow era. Jim Crow laws involved state [*187] and local refusal to adhere to the Reconstruction Amendments, while anti-immigrant laws involve the relationship between the federal, state, and local governments and the states and localities defiantly enacting laws in reaction to the federal government's failure to enact comprehensive immigration reforms. n122 Some state and local legislators allege that the federal government's inaction has adversely affected their citizens. For this reason, states and localities have exploited the federal government's failure to act and have enacted their own immigration policies. A second similarity is the speed and manner in which anti-immigrant laws are being enacted. Both Jim Crow and anti-immigrant laws quickly spread across the country, as the success of each new law emboldened state and local legislators to take action. In 2008, approximately 1,700 state and local immigration-related laws were passed. n123 In 2009, the National Conference of State Legislatures found that approximately 1,500 bills on immigrants and refugees were introduced in states across the country. n124 Also, like the federal courts during the Jim Crow era, some federal judges are similarly deferential to states and localities passing laws that target Latino immigrants. n125 Recent federal court decisions are signaling to states and localities that they have the authority to enact legislation that affects immigrants under states' Tenth Amendment police [*188] powers. n126 For example, in Arizona, the federal district court and Ninth Circuit upheld the Legal Arizona Workers Act n127 that targeted undocumented workers. n128 The Legal Arizona Workers Act revokes the business license of employers who hire undocumented immigrants. n129 The proliferation of state and local anti-immigrant laws mirrors the proliferation of Jim Crow laws. In both instances, there is a fundamental disagreement amongst the federal, state, and local government regarding authority over regulation of either immigration or, in the case of Jim Crow, prohibiting state and local discriminatory action. In both cases, the failure to resolve the disagreement results in the increase of state and local laws targeting vulnerable populations.<br />
<br />
And, only the use of legal institutions dismantles racism and prevents violence<br />
Kenn 1 - Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse University College of Law (Deborah, Fall 2001 “Institutionalized, Legal Racism: Housing Segregation and Beyond.” 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35. p. lexis. // WPDU-JR)<br />
Until an effort equal to the efforts to create and maintain housing segregation and its consequences is initiated, supported, and perpetuated in our country, we can expect our racist legacy to continue and intensify. The effort must start with dismantling the racist institutions of housing segregation, white privilege, school segregation, and discrimination in the criminal justice system. The systemic problem of racism must be attacked systemically. Again, Professor Williams states: With regard to all these configurations, let me just say that I am certain that the solution to racism lies in our ability to see its ubiquity but not to concede its inevitability. It lies in the collective and institutional power to make change, at least as much as with the individual will to change. It also lies in the absolute moral imperative to break the childish, deadly circularity of centuries of blindness to the shimmering brilliance of our common, ordinary humanity. n203 Above all, each individual (and I'm speaking here to white people) needs to acknowledge that they can either be part of the problem or part of the solution. Continuing merrily along, enjoying our white privilege, oblivious to the negative impact we have on our black neighbors, makes us complicit in the centuries of racism that brought us to our racist present. Doing nothing is doing everything to [*72] be a part of the problem. In the eloquent words of Professor June Jordan: We need, each of us, to begin the awesome, difficult work of love: loving ourselves so that we become able to love other people without fear so that we can become powerful enough to enlarge the circle of our trust and our common striving for a safe, sunny afternoon near to flowering trees and under a very blue sky. n204 We can continue to travel the path of hatred and distrust or we can choose to begin dismantling the institutions borne of the distrust between races. Which kind of world do we want to live in - a world of hate or a world of love? Will we choose a world that isolates, separates, and wreaks unimaginable suffering on entire communities of people, or a world that celebrates the diversity of people and welcomes differences between people for the richness it brings to our lives?<br />
<br />
And plenary power has prevented the courts from addressing these changes<br />
Olafson 99 - B.A., Northwestern University, 1997; J.D., Georgetown University Law Center, 2000 (Meredith, Spring 1999, “The Concept of Limited Sovereignty and the Immigration Law Plenary Power Doctrine,” 13 Geo. Immigr. L.J. 433, JAK)<br />
The plenary power doctrine is inconsistent with twentieth century concepts of state sovereignty as well as corresponding notions of legitimacy and the rule of law in a constitutional democracy. The notion of restrictive sovereignty and limited governmental powers depends in part upon judicial [*451] review. n150 Shielding an entire area of law from judicial review is not consistent with this notion of limited government. n151 Thus, the role of the judiciary in curtailing the plenary power doctrine is significant. Limiting the plenary power doctrine by subjecting immigration law to judicial review will strengthen the legitimacy of the courts in the constitutional system. The Supreme Court's refusal to review the constitutionality of immigration legislation threatens the rule of law because it obviates the established role of the judiciary in a constitutional system. n152 Since the Court's ruling in Marbury v. Madison, n153 it has been uniformly accepted that the exercise of power by any branch is subject to judicial review for constitutional validity. n154 The principle of judicial review ensures continuity and legitimacy: &quot;Whether one regards judicial review as a nuisance or a duty, it is a well-accepted part of the American constitutional landscape and one which the American people have come to rely upon.&quot; n155 Unexamined deference to the plenary power doctrine ultimately poses a threat to the rule of law through the court's reliance on a doctrine that no longer accords with constitutional norms and notions of limited government. n156<br />
<br />
And, plenary immigration law has been use to justify abuses in power<br />
Saito 7 – Professor of Law at Georgia State University, J.D. from Yale (Natsu Taylor. 2007. From Chinese Exclusion to Guantanamo Bay: Plenary Power and the Prerogative State. University Press of Colorado: Boulder, CO. pp. 10-1)<br />
As we have seen in the first few years of this war on terror, unconstrained executive action has not been limited to those officially under U.S. jurisdiction. Executive power has been extended in extremely harsh forms to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay; prisoners at Abu Ghraib and, apparently, at secret prisons across Europe and the Middle East; and to persons subjected to “extraordinary rendition,” captured by U.S. agents and sent to other countries to be interrogated and tortured in ways the United States claims to abhor.31 This book does not directly address the abuses of human rights taking place on a global scale; rather it articulates the domestic framework, legal and political, which sets the stage for such geographically unbounded assertions of plenary power.<br />
Congress’s reluctance to constrain the president’s war powers, its willingness to hastily pass measures such as the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as its long history of exercising its plenary power to deny fundamental rights to immigrants, American Indian nations, and externally colonized territories make it clear that relying on Congress to curb the exercise of unfettered governmental power is not the solution that Justice Brown believed it would be. We must, instead, look to more fundamental solutions and, I believe, that entails ensuring that the government that purports to represent us complies with the rule of law. The underlying principle that legitimated the war crime trials of German and Japanese leaders in the aftermath of World War II was that neither the provisions of domestic law, nor claims of national interest or sovereignty, nor the purported needs of a “higher race” can override the mandates of international law, law acknowledged by these tribunals to be universally binding and law that the U.S. Constitution identifies as part of the “supreme Law of the Land.” As Supreme Court justice Robert H. Jackson, acting as chief prosecutor for the Nuremberg Tribunal, stated: “If certain acts and violations of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them. We are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us.”32<br />

1. Foreignness and Unassimilability in the Construction of Race in the United States<br />
By reiterating the racial &quot;foreignness&quot; of Asians as a basis for exclusion, n110 Chae Chan Ping and Fong Yue Ting shaped the development of race in the United States. Although these two cases were some of the first constitutional decisions using foreignness as a factor to distinguish between groups, the notion of foreignness was already playing a prominent role in structuring social relations between racial groups in the United States. n111<br />
In the adaptation process of European immigrants, the idea that these immigrants could more easily assimilate into American culture was used to deflect the anti-immigrant hostilities directed toward them. Initially, those who had already acculturated into the American system saw almost all new immigrants, including Irish, Southern European, and Eastern European immigrants, as racially distinct and thus threatening to &quot;real&quot; Americans. n112 European immigrants, who were in all appearances White, were able to control their acculturation process by contrasting themselves against immigrants from Asia and non-European countries. n113 As Chang and Aoki propose, European immigrants successfully deflected xenophobia by engaging in &quot;identity [*571] politics&quot; by claiming a White identity; in defining themselves against the &quot;Other,&quot; they aligned themselves with mainstream culture and became &quot;American.&quot; n114 Racism aimed at new European immigrants &quot;was displaced onto the &quot;real' racial Other, Blacks,&quot; n115 while &quot;nativism, transformed into nativistic racism, was displaced onto the &quot;real' foreign Other, Asians.&quot; n116 Although Blacks and Asians also engaged in identity politics, Asians were unable to shed the label of foreignness.<br />

This nativist racism is a necessary condition for genocide and war.<br />

L. Rev. 1395, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Examining the immigrant's entry into and presence in the racialized space of the United States provides an opportunity to explore the racial structures that undergird and constitute this nation-state. We might question official state apparatuses such as the census, which might be described as an official identity producer, and its role in (re)producing racialized subjects. n10 We might question legal doctrines, such as equal protection, and their role in producing racialized identities while simultaneously mandating color-blindness on the part of public actors. n11 The point of the critique is not to abandon race, but rather to examine the political economy of race, the processes through which race is used to distribute power and maintain racial privilege. These processes produce and maintain both immigrant and native identities. Examination of the immigrant allows us to observe the dynamics of racial formation n12 as immigrants enter the political/cultural/legal space of the United States and &quot;become&quot; differentially racialized as Asian [*1400] American, Black, Latina/o, and White. n13 It is important to note, though, that this is not a one-way process - as immigrants &quot;become&quot; Asian American, Black, Latina/o, and White, these racial formations are themselves subject to reconfiguration and may become focal points around which one organizes a politics of identity.<br />
The differential racialization of immigrants is evident in the different treatment accorded White immigrants when compared with those from Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America. n14 Fear of immigration, often discussed in generalized terms, is colored so that only certain immigrant bodies excite fear. In the midst of cries to limit legal immigration, the Immigration Act of 1990 included legislation to encourage immigration from northwestern European countries such as Ireland. n15 In the midst of cries to limit illegal immigration, the figure of the Mexican border-crosser or of the Chinese boat person makes the evening news, whereas the fact that Italians constitute the largest group of undocumented immigrants in New York is obscured. n16 (After the Italians, the most numerous groups of undocumented immigrants in New York come from Ecuador, Poland, Ireland, and Russia. n17) These examples show how the &quot;problem&quot; of legal and illegal immigration is colored in the national imagination: fear over immigration is not [*1401] articulated solely around foreignness per se; it includes a strong racial dimension. n18<br />
Etienne Balibar, writing in the European context, describes the new racism, centered around the category of immigration, as: a racism of the era of &quot;decolonization,&quot; of the reversal of population movements between the old colonies and the old metropolises, and the division of humanity within a single political space....It is a racism whose dominant theme is not biological heredity but the insurmountability of cultural differences, a racism which, at first sight, does not postulate the superiority of certain groups or peoples in relation to others but &quot;only&quot; the harmfulness of abolishing frontiers, the incompatibility of life-styles and traditions; in short, it is what P.A. Taguieff has rightly called a differentialist racism. n19 In the United States, this differentialist racism might be termed nativistic racism. Nativistic racism is not just an intersectional term, but signifies that both nativism and racism are mutually constitutive of the other and operate in tandem to preserve a specific conception of the nation. n20 [*1402]<br />
The nativist movements directed against immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe, immigrants who were ostensibly White, reflect the constitutive relationship between nativism and racism. As John Higham demonstrates, nativism against those groups did not gain real currency until scientific racism provided a language that allowed them to become targets of nativistic racism. Southern and Eastern European immigrants were represented as racially other to &quot;White&quot; Americans and could therefore be discriminated against. n21 To combat this discrimination, these immigrants engaged in an identity politics in which they claimed a White identity. n22 This eventually proved to be a successful strategy - by claiming a White identity, they could become &quot;American&quot; and escape the animus of nativistic racism. n23<br />
Blacks, already present in the geographic space of the United States, posed a different problem. Ironically, the granting of freedom and formal national membership to Blacks provided the predicate for a new form of racial nationalism, the ideology underwriting &quot;the identification of American with White (and the colonization or, failing that, segregation of blacks).&quot; n24 The demise of the master/slave relationship and the formal ban against racial discrimination necessitated new technologies of racism to preserve White privilege. The Supreme Court provided a new technology in Plessy v. Ferguson, setting forth the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that marked a new development in racial thinking...[that] affirmed racial distinction as such; it affirmed, that is, racial distinction independent of any other legal consideration so that the relation between black and white was radically distinguished from the relation between master and slave. Slaves, in principle, could become free; blacks could never become white. n25<br />
Racial nationalism, or &quot;the identification of American with white,&quot; required that Blacks never become American. The doctrine of &quot;separate [*1403] but equal&quot; enabled the economic disempowerment, political disfranchisement, and physical terrorization of Blacks, preserving the national community as White.<br />
From these examples, we see that nativistic racism and racial nationalism helped to construct Black and White as racial and national formations. n26 In a similar fashion, nativistic racism and racial nationalism have helped to construct Asian American and Latina/o as racial and national formations. n27<br />
These formations, though, are not static. It is important to note that nativistic racism, which constructs &quot;immigrants&quot; as Asian American, Black, Latina/o, and White, is not a one-way process. These racial and national formations are themselves subject to reconfiguration. Stated more strongly, immigrants, in addition to introducing and representing diversity, remind us of the diversity already present - that Asian American, Black, Latina/o, and White communities are and have always been &quot;heterogenous, hybrid, and multiple.&quot; n28 While many scholars have commented on the tremendous diversity within the Asian American and Latina/o formulations, n29 relatively little attention has been paid to the new immigration that is bringing an increased diversity to Black communities. n30 Further, despite the growing literature on Whiteness as a racial phenomenon, n31 insufficient attention has been paid to the diversity encompassed within Whiteness. [*1404]<br />
Examination of the immigrant requires us to take pluralism seriously and creates the discursive space for an enriched discussion of what it means to be a nation. n32 It forces us to remember that multiculturalism is not just about recognizing and respecting the presence of minority cultures against the backdrop of a dominant, White Euro-American culture; multiculturalism requires us to recognize and respect the heterogeneity within minority and majority communities. n33<br />
Although nativistic racism tends to disguise the diversity within broad racial categories, it also creates the enabling condition for ethnic and racial identity politics. Despite the outlawing of formal discrimination, n34 the United States remains a hierarchical society that has failed to live up to its democratic principles. Responding to nativistic racism may help us develop an emancipatory politics that will move us toward what [*1405] Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe describe as &quot;a radical and plural democracy&quot;:<br />
In the face of the project for the reconstruction of a hierarchic society, the alternative of the Left should consist of locating itself fully in the field of the democratic revolution and expanding the chain of equivalents between the different struggles against oppression. The task of the Left therefore cannot be to renounce liberal-democratic ideology, but on the contrary, to deepen and expand it in the direction of a radical and plural democracy. n35<br />
Instead of advocating sameness, the &quot;concept of solidarity&quot; may be invoked to establish a &quot;chain of equivalents&quot; between the different groups and their struggles against oppression. n36<br />
For people of color in the United States, we might begin with the ideology of White supremacy which permitted the genocide of Native Americans, the enslavement of Africans, the conquest and dispossession of Mexicans, and the exclusion of Asians. But White supremacy located within the confines of the nation-state tells only part of the story. There is, unfortunately, a rich history of colonialism and imperialism in their traditional and contemporary forms. n37 Once we escape the confines of a national imagination, it becomes easier to deepen the chain of democratic equivalents, linking the struggles of those who have been in the United States for generations with the struggles of those who have arrived more recently. The difficulties for this project are brought into sharp focus when we consider in Part III the operation of nativistic racism and the political economy of race in the city of Monterey Park, California.<br />

US-Mexico relations are low now due to immigration policies<br />
Friedman 8/3 - CEO of Stratfor (George, August 3, 2010, “Arizona, Borderlands and US Mexican Relations,” Stratfor, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100802_arizona_borderlands_and_us_mexican_relations" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100802_arizona_borderlands_and_us_mexican_relations</a>)<br />
Ultimately, this is not about the Arizona question. It is about the relationship between Mexico and the United States on a range of issues, immigration merely being one of them. The problem as I see it is that the immigration issue is being treated as an internal debate among Americans when it is really about reaching an understanding with Mexico. Immigration has been treated as a subnational issue involving individuals. It is in fact a geopolitical issue between two nation-states. Over the past decades, Washington has tried to avoid turning immigration into an international matter, portraying it rather as an American law enforcement issue. In my view, it cannot be contained in that box any longer.<br />

The proliferation of stories in international media and in global forums about the Guantanamo-like problems in the country’s immigrant detention system- death, abuse and neglect at the hands of detention facility guards; prolonged and indefinite detention of immigrants (including children and families) denied habeas corpus and other fundamental rights; filthy, overcrowded and extremely unhealthy facilities; denial of basic health services – are again tarnishing the U.S. image abroad, according to several experts. As a result, reports from Arizona and immigrant detention facilities have created a unique problem: they are making it increasingly difficult for Obama to persuade the planet’s people that the United States is ready claim exceptional leadership on human rights in a soon-to-be-post-Guantanamo world. Consider the case of Mexico. Just last week, following news reports from Arizona, the Mexican government, which is traditionally silent or very tepid in its criticism of U.S. immigration and other policies, issued a statement in which it “energetically protested the undignified way in which the Mexicans were transferred to ‘Tent City’” in Maricopa County. David Brooks, U.S correspondent for Mexico’s La Jornada newspaper, believes that immigrant detention stories hit Mexicans closer to home because those reportedly being abused in detention are not from a far off country; they are family, friends, neighbors and fellow citizens. In the same way that Guantanamo erased the idea of U.S. leadership in human rights in the Bush era, says Brooks, who was born in Mexico, practices in immigrant detention facilities like those reported by global media in Maricopa County may begin to do so in the Obama era if something does not change. “Mexicans have never seen the U.S. as a great model for promotion of human rights. But with Obama we take him at his word. We’re expecting some change,” said Brooks. “But that will not last long if we see him continuing Bush’s [immigration] policies: raids, increasing detention, deportation. Regardless of his excuse, he will quickly become mas de lo mismo (more of the same) in terms of the experience down south.” If uncontested, the expression of such sentiments far beyond Mexico and Mexican immigrants could lead to the kind of American exceptionalism Obama doesn’t want.<br />

Immigration disputes prevent cooperation in solving global warming<br />
Seelke 9/2 - Specialist in Latin American Affairs (Clare Ribando, September 2, 2010, “Mexico-US Relations: Issues for Congress,” Congressional Research Service, 7-5700, RL32724, JAK)<br />
The U.S.-Mexico border region has been the focal point of bilateral conservation and environmental efforts, and some argue that it is an appropriate place to intensify U.S.-Mexican environmental cooperation.92 The 2,000 mile border region includes large deserts, numerous mountain ranges, rivers, wetlands, large estuaries, and shared aquifers. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, border residents “suffer disproportionately from many<br />
environmental health problems, including water-borne diseases and respiratory problems.”93 The United States and Mexico have been working to address many of these issues through bilateral programs like Border 2012, which relies on local level input, decision-making, and project implementation to address environmental challenges, such as water scarcity.<br />
The United States and Mexico have also been collaborating on geothermal energy projects since the 1970s, but the possibility of expanding joint efforts to produce renewable energy sources has just recently returned to the bilateral agenda. On April 16, 2009, President Obama and Mexican President Calderón announced the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change to jointly develop clean energy sources and encourage investment in climate-friendly technologies. Among others, its goals include enhancing renewable energy, further exploring the potential of carbon markets, and strengthening the reliability of cross-border electricity grids. On January 26, 2010, the U.S. Department of State hosted the framework’s first bilateral meeting, which was attended by officials from an array of agency officials from both countries. Some maintain that efforts to advance progress under the bilateral framework may hasten as Mexico prepares to host the Sixteenth U.N. Climate Change Conference in Cancún from November to December 2010, while others are less certain.<br />

Warming leads to extinction<br />

The scientific debate about human induced global warming is over but policy makers - let alone the happily shopping general public - still seem to not understand the scope of the impending tragedy. Global warming isn't just warmer temperatures, heat waves, melting ice and threatened polar bears. Scientific understanding increasingly points to runaway global warming leading to human extinction. If impossibly Draconian security measures are not immediately put in place to keep further emissions of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere we are looking at the death of billions, the end of civilization as we know it and in all probability the end of man's several million year old existence, along with the extinction of most flora and fauna beloved to man in the world we share.<br />

Relations are key to prevent a depression<br />
Starr, adjunct fellow specializing in Mexico at the Pacific Council on International Policy, 09 (Pamela K., “Mexico and the United States: A Window of Opportunity?”, Pacific Council on International Policy, April 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pacificcouncil.org/pdfs/Mexico_and_the_United_States.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pacificcouncil.org/pdfs/Mexico_and_the_United_States.pdf</a>)<br />
The answer to these questions is of utmost importance to the United States. With a profound economic crisis dominating the agenda of the new Obama administration and two wars, China’s rise, and growing Russian belligerence demanding foreign policy attention, Mexico’s significance to the United States was largely overlooked during the 2008 presidential campaign. Yet no other country has more effect on the daily lives of Americans, a fact that extends well beyond the headline-grabbing problems associated with the drug trade and undocumented immigrants. Mexico has an impact on our ability to protect public health, provide environmental protection, and ensure energy security. It affects prices, salaries, and job creation in the U.S. economy, and it is a key driver of the evident demographic shift in the U.S. population. Mexico’s influence across this wide range of issues can be positive as well as negative, creating real opportunities as well as challenges not just for policymakers in Washington but also for those in state capitals and local communities throughout the nation. Mexico also matters to the United States as a<br />
reliable regional partner, albeit a prickly one at times. It shares, for example, the U.S. interest in limiting the reach of Venezuelan economic and political influence in the Americas. And good U.S. relations with the rest of Latin America begin, to a significant degree, with Mexico.<br />

Depression leads to nuclear war<br />
Mead 09 [Walter Russell, Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, “Only Makes You Stronger: Why the recession bolstered America.” New Republic, February 4]<br />
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />
<br />
Scenario B is Health<br />
<br />
Court deference has made detention centers atrocious<br />
Resnik 10 - Arthur Liman Professor of Law, Yale Law School (Judith, March 2010, “Detention, the War on Terror, and the Federal Courts: An Essay in Honor of Henry Monaghan,” 110 Colum. L. Rev. 579, Lexis, JAK)<br />
One other set of detainees, technically falling on the civil side of the docket, requires consideration - those individuals alleged to have entered the United States unlawfully or otherwise subject to deportation. In 2008, more than 378,000 persons &quot;from 221 countries&quot; had been placed in custody or were otherwise being supervised by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement system. n323 On any given day, some 31,000 persons were detained in one of more than 300 facilities and some persons, including small children, were held for extended periods of time. n324<br />
In 1996, through the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), n325 Congress both imposed obligatory detention for certain categories of individuals facing removal and sought to limit federal courts' ability to oversee deportation decisions. n326 These actions paralleled congressional approaches to prisoners in AEDPA and in the PLRA, and foreshadowed the efforts to limit federal court jurisdiction in the DTA of 2005 and the MCA of 2006. Moreover, because IIRIRA did not detail a length of time for detention of those falling within its parameters, n327 [*657] it raised the specter of indefinite preventive detention, just as 9/11 detention did in the following decade.<br />
In 2001, the Supreme Court issued a decision that in some respects forecast Hamdi. The majority refused the paradigm of unrestrained executive authority to detain without any court oversight. Instead, the Court concluded it had authority to review decisions under particular provisions; further, when immigration authorities had determined a migrant was to be removed but that person had not been deported, the Court inferred a statutory presumption of a maximum stay of six months in detention. n328 Yet the Court subsequently authorized a good deal of deference to administrative authorities by concluding, for example, that individualized hearings were not required for detentions authorized through a different provision so long as aliens were confined for less than the six months. n329 According to immigrant advocates, the possibility of prolonged detention serves in some cases to induce unrepresented detainees to waive their rights to hearings (Miranda has no purchase in this context) and proceed directly to deportation by what are known as &quot;stipulated removal orders.&quot; n330<br />
[*658] The fact of confinement is one problem, and the conditions of confinement another. ICE operates immigration detention facilities in accordance with &quot;correctional detention standards designed for pre-trial felons,&quot; which is to say that many immigrant detainees are in jails or prisons imposing more restrictions than are needed. n331 In addition, a 2009 report commissioned by the federal Department of Homeland Security concluded that provisions for classification, health care, family needs, visitors, lawyers, recreation, and religious observances were inadequate. n332 Documentation of these concerns is ample. Between 2004 and 2007, an estimated sixty-nine persons died while in facilities run by ICE, n333 with new revelations in the summer of 2009 of previously unidentified individuals who had also lost their lives. n334 A series of lawsuits and congressional hearings have detailed problems of inadequate access to health care and deliberate indifference to known medical needs. n335 Materials produced through litigation were also compiled in a report, A Broken System - a &quot;first-ever system-wide&quot; overview of the government's &quot;failures&quot; to comply with its own standards for safekeeping of immigration detainees. n336<br />
<br />
Specifically detainees are deprived of medical care<br />
Kalhan 10 - Associate Professor of Law, Drexel University (Anil, July 21, 2010, “Rethinking Immigration Detention,” 110 Colum. L. Rev. Sidebar 42, Lexis, JAK)<br />
These deprivations have been exacerbated by a range of detention-related policies and practices, as several examples illustrate. First, detention has been worsened by inadequate conditions of confinement--particularly with ICE's expanded use of county jails, whose conditions long have been &quot;excoriat[ed]&quot; as the &quot;worst blight in American corrections.&quot; n38 Overcrowding and lack of adequate telephone access, visitation hours, ventilation, food, clean quarters, and functioning showers and toilets have long been documented, and verbal and physical abuse have also been common. n39 Inadequate health care has been a particularly serious problem. n40 Over 100 detainees have died in custody since 2003, often due to neglect of their health needs. n41 Conditions also have been severe for many detainees, who are frequently commingled with and subjected to the same treatment as criminal suspects and offenders; observers have frequently documented excessive use of physical restraints. n42<br />

Lack of medical care in detention centers results in disease spread<br />
McCarthy 8 - Director National Immigrant Justice Center (Mary Meg McCarthy, 2008, “DETAINEE MEDICAL CARE,” Testimony, National Immigrant Justice Center, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/McCarthy080604.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/McCarthy080604.pdf</a>)<br />
Last year, NIJC helped an African immigrant with infectious tuberculosis and AIDS seek much-needed medical treatment. This man was previously detained, but ICE released him on an order of supervision when it discovered he was HIV-positive. He was later diagnosed with AIDS. NIJC filed a motion for a stay of removal and expended extraordinary efforts to notify senior ICE officials that deportation would be inhumane in this case and could create a public health risk. The man was nonetheless put on a plane to Africa, an action that may have exposed other passengers to his infectious tuberculosis. NIJC strongly urges Congress to enact, and ICE to adopt, the provisions in the Detainee Basic Medical Care Act regarding continuity of care and development of discharge plans. As this case makes clear, such steps are not only critical for detainee health but also influence public safety.<br />

TB spread risks extinction.<br />
Biomedicine 7 (June 6, 2007 “The Dreaded Disease Tuberculosis Raises Its Ugly Head,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/The-Dreaded-Disease-Tuberculosis-Raises-Its-Ugly-Head-20674-1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/The-Dreaded-Disease-Tuberculosis-Raises-Its-Ugly-Head-20674-1/</a>)<br />
The Dreaded Disease Tuberculosis Raises Its Ugly Head When Mr. Andrew Speaker and his wife returned to United States from Europe they were immediately quarantined by the health officials . Speaker and his family have been fighting back ever since, disputing the accounts of government health officials who contended he had been warned not to fly because he posed an infection risk to others. The disease in Speaker came to fore when he went for a check up for a rib injury. His X-ray picked up shadow in his right lung and TB was suspected. Only after intense test it was realized that the TB was drug resistance. But Speaker was not aware of it till late. Until a few weeks ago, many Americans had never heard of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB. But Speaker got plenty of press as he was ordered into federal quarantine, having crisscrossed the Atlantic on commercial flights while infected with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). In the 1970s, eradicating TB appeared possible. Now, the drug-resistant strains are winning. Of the 9 million new TB cases each year, an estimated 450,000 are multi-drug resistant, or MDR. Only two-thirds of MDR TB patients are cured. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, there were 27,000 cases in 37 countries of XDR TB, which is resistant to at least three of the six second-line drugs used when the first drugs fail. The cure rate for XDR TB patients is just one-third. Scariest of all, two women in Italy recently died from a fully resistant type of TB that's officially incurable. (Scientists are dubbing it XXDR TB.) Today, TB terrorizes those whose immunity has been weakened by HIV, hunger, alcoholism or other diseases. If the new strains become dominant, everyone is at risk. The rising worldwide number of XDR-TB cases like Speaker's may herald the end of a glorious 60-year holiday from many common and highly contagious diseases -- such as polio, measles and cholera -- that once routinely ravaged vast swaths of humanity. Ironically, there has long been a disturbing tendency to romanticize the white plague, as tuberculosis is also known. But in real life, tuberculosis is a messy, agonizing and debilitating ordeal. Once the tubercle bacilli gain the momentum to proceed unchecked through the body, there is no romance to be found. The actual experience of tuberculosis is one of exhaustion, drenching bouts of sweating, groaning, a cough punctuated by uncontrollable spurts of blood. XDR TB is already too widespread to quarantine. We need to combat it globally before it becomes pandemic. Last week, the WHO asked governments worldwide to pay up the $3 billion a year needed to fund existing TB programs and an additional $1 billion a year to combat XDR TB. In the U.S., Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and others proposed spending $300 million on TB next year, much of it on research. Given that isolating and treating a single XDR patient can cost up to $250,000, the case for spending far more on prevention and control is self-evident. Today, more than one-third of the world's more than 6 billion people have been exposed to the tuberculosis germ. Five to 10 percent of them, or at least 100 million, will develop symptomatic TB. Each will infect 10 to 20 people before they are either successfully treated or they die. Last year, active -- and contagious -- tuberculosis was diagnosed in more than 8.8 million people. Approximately 420,000, or 5 percent, of them have a drug-resistant strain that requires several more medications than drug-sensitive cases do; about 30,000 of these 420,000 cases are even more difficult and expensive to treat, the highly lethal XDR-TB.<br />

Centers also increases the risk for AIDs mutation<br />
Washington Post 9 (5-11-09, “System of Neglect,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/immigration/cwc_d1p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/immigration/cwc_d1p1.html</a>)<br />
The overcrowding has created a petri dish for the spread of diseases. One mission of the Public Health Service is to detect infectious diseases and contain them before they spread, but last summer, the gigantic Willacy center was hit by a chicken pox outbreak. The illness spread because the facility did not have enough available isolation rooms and its large pods share recycled air, but also because security officers &quot;lack education about the disease and keep moving around detainees from different units without taking into consideration if the unit has been isolated due to heavy exposure,&quot; noted the DIHS's top specialist on infectious diseases, Carlos Duchesne. The staff was forced to vaccinate the entire population in mid-July. In one 2007 death, memos and confidential notes show how medical staff missed an infectious disease, meningitis, in their midst. Victor Alfonso Arellano, 23, a transgender Mexican detainee with AIDS, died in custody at the San Pedro center. The first three pages of Duchesne's internal review of the death leave the impression that Arellano's care was proper. But the last page, under the heading &quot;Off the record observations and recommendations,&quot; takes a decidedly critical tone: &quot;The clinical staff at all levels fails to recognize early signs and symptoms of meningitis. . . . Pt was evaluated multiple times and an effort to rule out those infections was not even mentioned.&quot; Arellano was given a &quot;completely useless&quot; antibiotic, Duchesne wrote. Lab work that should have been performed immediately took 22 days because San Pedro's clinical director had ordered staff members to withhold lab work for new detainees until they had been in detention there &quot;for more than 30 days,&quot; a violation of agency rules. &quot;I am sure that there must be a reason why this was mandated but that practice is particularly dangerous with chronic care cases and specially is particularly dangerous with . . . HIV/AIDS patients,&quot; Duchesne wrote. &quot;Labs for AIDS patients . . . must be performed ASAP to know their immune status and where you are standing in reference to disease control and meds.&quot;<br />

Nature's ability to adapt is amazing - but the consequences of that adaptation are that mutations of old diseases, we thought were long gone, may come back to haunt us. But of all these new and old diseases, AIDS poses the greatest threat. It has the capacity to mutate and evolve into new forms, and the treatments that are being developed have to take account of that. Yet the recent history of life-threatening and lethal diseases suggests that even if we conquer this disease, and all the others described here, there may be yet another dangerous micro-organism waiting in the wings. The golden age of conquering disease may be drawing to an end. Modern life, particularly increased mobility, is facilitating the spread of viruses. In fact, some experts believe it will be a virus that leads to the eventual extinction of the human race.<br />

Contention 1 is Racism<br />
<br />
Immigration law has been removed from judicial review<br />

Fourth, the plenary power doctrine has largely removed the immigration issue from U.S. constitutional law, especially on entry decisions. The time-tested proposition is that &quot;in the exercise of its broad power over naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly makes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to citizens.&quot; n115 This is due to the uniqueness of the immigration field and its being interwoven with political questions and foreign affairs powers. In principle, the use of race, religion and nationality is more common in the context of persons seeking admission. In this context, U.S. courts have usually upheld the Government's broad scope of permissible authority to base decisions on race. As Kevin Johnson has written, race is central to the enforcement of U.S. immigration law, particularly near the borders. n116 Administrative policies are entitled to deference, although courts may require a rational basis showing to justify them. But when Congress passes an immigration law, courts grant a wider degree of deference and are inclined to find these laws constitutional. Nevertheless, one must ask whether courts would uphold the constitutionality of an immigration statute that clearly discriminates on the basis of race or religion. Some critics of U.S. immigration policy, such as Peter Brimelow, trace our woes to the 1965 Act that ended the national origins quota system. n117 Brimelow and like-minded restrictionists openly call on Congress to pass laws that would favor white Anglo-Saxon immigrants, and would bar the world's unwashed from being able to enter the United States. Although no court has explicitly held such discrimination to be a violation of the equal protection principles, it is significant that at least [*267] eight Supreme Court Justices have suggested that such legislation would be impermissible (although never in one opinion, and always in dissent). n118 As no such legislation has recently passed Congress, the closest we have come to a definitive answer is the question posed by Justice Marshall in his dissent in Jean v. Nelson. Justice Marshall rejected the possibility that the government may discriminate on the basis of race &quot;in the absence of any reasons closely related to immigration concerns.&quot; n119 He admitted that a constitutional claim would fail when it &quot;lies at the heart of immigration policy,&quot; and added that &quot;the individuality of the alien&quot; is a factor only when &quot;central immigration concerns are not at stake.&quot; n120 Yet, even Marshall's dissent is far more modest than the absolute prohibition under British law. In the Roma case, the House of Lords has ruled that &quot;if a person acts on racial grounds, the reason why he does so is irrelevant.&quot; n121<br />
<br />
And, this case is based on racist origins<br />
Scaperlanda 96 - Professor of Law, University of Oklahoma College of Law (Michael, March, 1996, “Partial Membership: Aliens and the Constitutional Community,” 81 Iowa L. Rev. 707, JAK)<br />
Plenary immigration power was founded on the back of blatant racial discrimination. The Chinese Exclusion Case, n89 which affirmed the exclusion of Chinese nationals from the United States, established within the political branches the absolute power to develop a profile of the &quot;desirable&quot; immigrant unfettered by any provision of our higher law. n90 As Professor Henkin has noted, &quot;whatever the Court intended [in the Chinese Exclusion Case], both its holding and its sweeping dictum have been taken to mean that there are no constitutional limitations on the power of Congress to regulate immigration.&quot; n91 From racial discrimination, plenary immigration power grew without bounds, allowing Congress to reflect the mood of an often anxious and fearful nation, unencumbered by the dictates of the Constitution. n92 During the &quot;red scare&quot; of McCarthyism, Congress wielded this power to deport long time resident aliens for their thoughts and associations. n93 Today it continues to stand as a sentry at our gates, allowing the political branches to formulate immigration policy without the restrictions that would otherwise be required by our constitutional traditions. n94<br />
<br />
And, nonimmigrant laws are held to a rational basis standard.<br />
Stumpf 8 - Associate Professor of Law, Lewis &amp; Clark Law School (Juliet P., September 2008, “Article: States of Confusion: The Rise of State and Local Power over Immigration,” 86 N.C.L. Rev. 1557, Lexis, JAK)<br />
A similar phenomenon has emerged in constitutional equal protection analysis. Domesticating immigration law muddies the existing equal protection dichotomy under which federal alienage laws receive rational basis review while state alienage laws usually trigger strict scrutiny. n257 That dichotomy is sustainable only so long as federal immigration law manifests as a facet of foreign policy and state and local legislation appears confined to domestic police powers.<br />
<br />
And, this standard makes discrimination and racism inevitable<br />
Wall 10 - JD Candidate 2010, Tulane; BS, Clemson (Adam Bryan, February 2010, “Comment: Justice for All?: The Equal Protection Clause and Its Not-So-Equal Application to Legal Aliens,” 84 Tul. L. Rev. 759, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Conversely, excluding nonimmigrant aliens from the protection afforded by strict scrutiny would have far-reaching consequences and &quot;could serve to erode the rights of nonimmigrants in other contexts.&quot; n165 Not only would it perpetuate the history of social discrimination against aliens in general, it could spark a new wave of discrimination against nonimmigrant aliens, both socially and politically. By differentiating between subclasses of aliens and giving preferential treatment to immigrant aliens over nonimmigrant aliens, it could create a social stigma for nonimmigrant aliens and create a political hierarchy within the general alien class. Even more detrimental, it would contravene one of the primary purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment by subjugating a disenfranchised minority to the unfettered discrimination of the majority - a majority that history has proven to vote and legislate unfavorably toward nonimmigrant aliens. n166 In essence, states would be able to discriminate freely against nonimmigrant aliens simply by claiming transience as justification. n167<br />
<br />
And, only the use of legal institutions dismantles racism and prevents violence<br />
Kenn 1 - Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse University College of Law (Deborah, Fall 2001 “Institutionalized, Legal Racism: Housing Segregation and Beyond.” 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35. p. lexis. // WPDU-JR)<br />
Until an effort equal to the efforts to create and maintain housing segregation and its consequences is initiated, supported, and perpetuated in our country, we can expect our racist legacy to continue and intensify. The effort must start with dismantling the racist institutions of housing segregation, white privilege, school segregation, and discrimination in the criminal justice system. The systemic problem of racism must be attacked systemically. Again, Professor Williams states: With regard to all these configurations, let me just say that I am certain that the solution to racism lies in our ability to see its ubiquity but not to concede its inevitability. It lies in the collective and institutional power to make change, at least as much as with the individual will to change. It also lies in the absolute moral imperative to break the childish, deadly circularity of centuries of blindness to the shimmering brilliance of our common, ordinary humanity. n203 Above all, each individual (and I'm speaking here to white people) needs to acknowledge that they can either be part of the problem or part of the solution. Continuing merrily along, enjoying our white privilege, oblivious to the negative impact we have on our black neighbors, makes us complicit in the centuries of racism that brought us to our racist present. Doing nothing is doing everything to [*72] be a part of the problem. In the eloquent words of Professor June Jordan: We need, each of us, to begin the awesome, difficult work of love: loving ourselves so that we become able to love other people without fear so that we can become powerful enough to enlarge the circle of our trust and our common striving for a safe, sunny afternoon near to flowering trees and under a very blue sky. n204 We can continue to travel the path of hatred and distrust or we can choose to begin dismantling the institutions borne of the distrust between races. Which kind of world do we want to live in - a world of hate or a world of love? Will we choose a world that isolates, separates, and wreaks unimaginable suffering on entire communities of people, or a world that celebrates the diversity of people and welcomes differences between people for the richness it brings to our lives?<br />

<h3 id="toc91"><a name="Full Text Info-Advantages-Judicial Review"></a>Judicial Review</h3>
 <br />
The level of judicial deference for immigration law is extremely high<br />
Deng 8 - Design &amp; Layout Editor of Columbia Journal of Law and Social Problems (Yafang, Winter 2008, “When Procedure Equals Justice: Facing the Pressing Constitutional Needs of a Criminalized Immigration System,” 42 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 261, JAK)<br />
The level of judicial deference granted by the Supreme Court to federal immigration law is not justified or mandated by the Constitution. As a judicial construct, the plenary power doctrine is only weakly grounded in the text of the Constitution.145 Even assuming the correctness of the plenary power doctrine, the Supreme Court has not granted the same level of deference to other areas of the law where the government has “plenary power.” In the areas of national security, interstate commerce, Indian affairs, and even foreign affairs, the Court has wielded its power to interpret the constitutionality of federal legislation despite the existence of “plenary power.”146 The Court stated in Perez v. Brownell:<br />
Broad as the power in the National Government to regulate foreign affairs must necessarily be, it is not without limitation. The restrictions confining Congress in the exercise of any of the powers expressly delegated to it in the Constitution apply with equal vigor when that body seeks to regulate our relations with other nations.147<br />
Immigration statutes issued under the federal government’s plenary power should be equally subject to judicial review.<br />

And, we have a moral obligation to engage in institutional and collective transformations that dismantle the systemic effects of racism. Doing nothing is akin to being complicit with this ongoing violence.<br />

<br />
We’ll isolate three internal links to judicial review<br />
First, the legislative branch can override court decisions in immigration<br />
Yeh 9 - Attorney at Diodes Incorporated, BA from University of Michigan, JD from University of Detroit Mercy School of Law (Rick Fang-Chi, 2009, “Today’s Immigration Legal System: Flaw and Possible Reforms,” 10 Rutgers Race &amp; L. Rev. 441, JAK)<br />
[*457] Congress, for instance, frequently modifies immigration rules year after year. n70 Congress has a broad discretion through its plenary power to override and to limit Article I immigration adjudications or regulations by passing substitute legislative rules. n71 Although from time to time Congress has used the same tactic by passing certain legislative rules in an effort to control Article III courts, Article III courts have the authority to challenge and to rule on whether or not such Congressional legislative rules are valid. n72 If these rules are determined to be invalid, the rules may be deemed null and void by the final determination of the Article III courts. n73<br />
Article I immigration judges, however, do not have the power to rule or to challenge immigration laws passed by Congress. n74 Article I immigration judges must duly follow all Congress-made rules to adjudicate immigration cases. n75 The result is that Congress can easily override any disfavored practices or judicial decisions made within the immigration adjudication system by passing legislative rules over them.<br />
<br />
Second, so can the executive branch<br />
Yeh 9 - Attorney at Diodes Incorporated, BA from University of Michigan, JD from University of Detroit Mercy School of Law (Rick Fang-Chi, 2009, “Today’s Immigration Legal System: Flaw and Possible Reforms,” 10 Rutgers Race &amp; L. Rev. 441, JAK)<br />
The executive branch's powerful control over the adjudication of immigration cases can also be recognized in another example in which an immigration prosecuting official was displeased with an immigration judge's decision in an individual case. n83 Rather than appeal the decision to the BIA, the prosecuting official made an ex parte telephone call to the OCIJ's Chief Immigration Judge who supervised immigration judges nationwide and persuaded him to order the immigration judge to change the decision. n84 These examples of the executive branch's full power to override immigration adjudication system clearly show the importance of having separation of powers structured within an adjudication system so as to ensure judges' judicial independence so that they may adjudicate impartially and fairly. The present [*460] immigration legal system's non-conformity to separation of powers, therefore, greatly undermines the independence of the immigration judges to impartially determine pending immigration cases without subject to external influences. n85<br />
<br />
Third, the judicial branch does not have the power of judicial review for immigration cases<br />
Olafson 99 - B.A., Northwestern University, 1997; J.D., Georgetown University Law Center, 2000 (Meredith, Spring 1999, “The Concept of Limited Sovereignty and the Immigration Law Plenary Power Doctrine,” 13 Geo. Immigr. L.J. 433, JAK)<br />
The plenary power doctrine is inconsistent with twentieth century concepts of state sovereignty as well as corresponding notions of legitimacy and the rule of law in a constitutional democracy. The notion of restrictive sovereignty and limited governmental powers depends in part upon judicial [*451] review. n150 Shielding an entire area of law from judicial review is not consistent with this notion of limited government. n151 Thus, the role of the judiciary in curtailing the plenary power doctrine is significant.<br />
Limiting the plenary power doctrine by subjecting immigration law to judicial review will strengthen the legitimacy of the courts in the constitutional system. The Supreme Court's refusal to review the constitutionality of immigration legislation threatens the rule of law because it obviates the established role of the judiciary in a constitutional system. n152 Since the Court's ruling in Marbury v. Madison, n153 it has been uniformly accepted that the exercise of power by any branch is subject to judicial review for constitutional validity. n154 The principle of judicial review ensures continuity and legitimacy: &quot;Whether one regards judicial review as a nuisance or a duty, it is a well-accepted part of the American constitutional landscape and one which the American people have come to rely upon.&quot; n155 Unexamined deference to the plenary power doctrine ultimately poses a threat to the rule of law through the court's reliance on a doctrine that no longer accords with constitutional norms and notions of limited government. n156<br />
<br />
And, review is key to protecting minority rights<br />
Kline 99 - J.D. 1992, LL.M. in Law and Government 1998, The American University's Washington College of Law.; Public interest attorney in Washington, D.C., who has specialized in legislative issues relating to the federal courts (Stephan O., Spring 1998, “Judicial Independence: Rebuffing Congressional Attacks on the Third Branch,” 87 Ky. L.J. 679, JAK)<br />
Testifying before the ABA Commission on the Separation of Powers and Judicial Independence, Drucilla S.Ramey, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Bar Association of San Francisco, explained how judicial independence is integral in safeguarding the rights of minorities: [*687]<br />
[W]e as a class have had to depend on brave and independent judges and in an independent judiciary to measure and, when appropriate, strike down laws. . . . And while sometimes over the years, especially in the 1800s, judges have failed us as well in failing to find that it was unconstitutional to . . . bar women from juries or from the vote or lucrative jobs, more often the courts really have served as the last refuge for those without political or social power whose rights are too often trammeled upon by the tyranny of the majority. So it has really been the courts to whom we have turned to weigh statutes and voter initiatives and find them in appropriate cases wanting. n21<br />
<br />
And, Death is preferable to a life without rights<br />
Raz 86, Philosopher, 1986 (Joseph, The Morality of Freedom, page 307)<br />
One way to test the thesis of the primacy of action reasons is to think of a person who is entirely passive and is continuously led, cleaned, and pumped full with hash, so that he is perpetually content, and wants nothing but to stay in the same condition. It’s a familiar imaginary horror. How do we rank the success of such a life? It is not the worst life one can have. It is simply not a life at all. It lacks activity, it lacks goals. To the extent that one is tempted to judge it more harshly than that and to regard it as a ‘negative life’ this is because of the wasted potentiality. It is a life which could have been and was not. We can isolate this feature by imagining that the human being concerned is mentally and physically effected in a way which rules out the possibility of a life with any kind of meaningful pursuit in it. Now it is just not really a life at all. This does not preclude one from saying that it is better than human life. It is simply sufficiently unlike human life in the respects that matter that we regard it as only a degenerate case of human life. But clearly not being alive can be better than that life.<br />
<br />
And, the upcoming court term will decide the balance of executive power. The current balance is pro executive.<br />
Savage 10 - 2007 Pulitzer Prize for national reporting on Presidential Signing Statements (Charlie, May, 9, 2010, “New Justice Could Determine Scope of Presidential Powers,” New York Times, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/article_50ac3494-43f6-5338-885c-973b978326e2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stltoday.com/news/national/article_50ac3494-43f6-5338-885c-973b978326e2.html</a>, JAK)<br />
As President Barack Obama prepares to nominate somebody to succeed Justice John Paul Stevens, his administration appears to be on a collision course with the Supreme Court over the limits of executive power. Several legal disputes — involving issues like detainee rights and secrecy — throw into sharp relief the differences in the records of several leading contenders for the nomination, including Solicitor General Elena Kagan and two appeals court judges, Merrick Garland and Diane Wood. While any plausible Democratic nominee would probably rule the same way Stevens would have in many areas of law, including abortion rights and the new health care law, executive power may be an exception. Stevens was a critical vote in a five-justice faction that rejected expansive assertions of executive authority by former President George W. Bush. If his successor is more sympathetic to the vantage point of the Obama White House, the balance could shift to a majority that is more willing to uphold broad presidential powers. &quot;The issues in the legal battles over terrorism are going to look a lot as they have in the past for the indefinite future,&quot; said Harold Bruff, a University of Colorado law professor and co-author of a casebook on the separation of powers. &quot;We are likely on the razor's edge with the current balance in the court.&quot;<br />
There is little evidence that any of those Obama is considering would favor a view of presidential authority as limitless as that claimed by some on Bush's legal team, which sought to expand executive power systematically and sometimes argued that the president, as commander in chief, could bypass laws at his discretion.<br />
Some of those whose names have been floated for the court — like Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan — have executive experience but no record of expressing expansive views of presidential power. Others — like Judge Sidney R. Thomas of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco — have rarely dealt with major executive power cases, although they have a history of viewing government arguments with skepticism in other matters, like immigration appeals.<br />
Each of the three potential nominees who have received the greatest attention — Wood, Garland and Kagan — has criticized or ruled against aspects of the Bush administration's approach. But the context, timing and forcefulness of their objections varied widely.<br />
Of the three, Wood, of the appeals court in Chicago, has the clearest record in favor of protecting civil liberties and taking a skeptical stance toward executive power. In a 2003 essay, she spoke out against approaches to counterterrorism that she said posed &quot;a significant threat to the continued observance of the rule of law&quot; — like giving noncitizens fewer due process rights than citizens and sacrificing individual privacy to foster intelligence-gathering.<br />
&quot;In a democracy, those responsible for national security (principally, of course, the executive branch) must do more than say, 'trust us, we know best' when they are proposing significant intrusions on liberties protected by the Constitution,&quot; Wood wrote.<br />
In contrast, Garland, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, did not show early public signs of skepticism about the Bush administration approach. In 2003, he joined an opinion holding that courts had no jurisdiction to hear lawsuits by detainees at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A year later, a majority on the Supreme Court would reverse that ruling.<br />
Similarly, Garland gave no public sign of any disagreement with a 2005 panel ruling upholding Bush's military commissions when it came before the full appeals court. The following year, that decision, too, would be reversed by the Supreme Court in an opinion written by Stevens.<br />
Kagan also has a mixed record on executive powers, but one that suggests she might generally be more sympathetic toward the White House than Stevens.<br />
She worked as a White House lawyer during the Clinton administration, when it was facing off against a hostile Congress and seeking ways to act unilaterally. That experienced shaped her major scholarly work, a 2001 law review article in which she explained and defended efforts by the Clinton White House to impose greater centralized control over executive agencies.<br />
<br />
And, Judicial review is integral to the separation of powers<br />
Kline 99 - J.D. 1992, LL.M. in Law and Government 1998, The American University's Washington College of Law.; Public interest attorney in Washington, D.C., who has specialized in legislative issues relating to the federal courts (Stephan O., Spring 1998, “Judicial Independence: Rebuffing Congressional Attacks on the Third Branch,” 87 Ky. L.J. 679, JAK)<br />
Judicial independence is integral to the United States's unique notion of the separation of powers. The framers of the Constitution based many of their views of government on the British monarchy. Under the British system, judges were beholden to the monarch for salary protection and tenure in office. Under the system of government established in this country, the founders believed that the courts needed protection from the two political branches, the legislative and executive, which were responsive both to majoritarian rule and the voters. The courts were established, in part, to limit excesses of the popular branches and to preserve the rights of minorities. n16<br />
<br />
And, Separation of powers prevents tyranny and nuclear war<br />
Redish 91 - Professor of Law and Public Policy at Northwestern (Martin Redish, and Elizabeth Cisar, Law Clerk at the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, 1991 41 Duke L.J. 449, p. 472-3)<br />
In any event, the political history of which the Framers were aware tends to confirm that quite often concentration of political power ultimately leads to the loss of liberty. Indeed, if we have begun to take the value of separation of powers for granted, we need only look to modern American history to remind ourselves about both the general vulnerability of representative government, and the direct correlation between the concentration of political power and the threat to individual liberty. The widespread violations of individual rights that took place when President Lincoln assumed an inordinate level of power, for example, are well documented. Arguably as egregious were the threats to basic freedoms that arose during the Nixon administration, when the power of the executive branch reached what are widely deemed to have been intolerable levels. Although in neither instance did the executive's usurpations of power ultimately degenerate into complete and irreversible tyranny, the reason for that may well have been the resilience of our political traditions, among the most important of which is separation of powers itself. In any event, it would be political folly to be overly smug about the security of either representative government or individual liberty. Although it would be all but impossible to create an empirical proof to demonstrate that our constitutional tradition of separation of powers has been an essential catalyst in the avoidance of tyranny, common sense should tell us that the simultaneous division of power and the creation of interbranch checking play important roles toward that end. To underscore the point, one need imagine only a limited modification of the actual scenario surrounding the recent Persian Gulf War. In actuality, the war was an extremely popular endeavor, thought by many to be a politically and morally justified exercise. But imagine a situation in which a President, concerned about his failure to resolve significant social and economic problems at home, has callously decided to engage the nation in war, simply to defer public attention from his domestic failures. To be sure, the President was presumably elected by a majority of the electorate, and may have to stand for reelection in the future. However, at this particular point in time, but for the system established by separation of powers, his authority as Commander in Chief to engage the nation in war would be effectively dictatorial. Because the Constitution reserves to the arguably even more representative and accountable Congress the authority to declare war, the Constitution has attempted to prevent such misuses of power by the executive. It remains unproven whether any governmental structure other than one based on a system of separation of powers could avoid such harmful results. In summary, no defender of separation of powers can prove with certitude that, but for the existence of separation of powers, tyranny would be the inevitable outcome. But the question is whether we wish to take that risk, given the obvious severity of the harm that might result. Given both the relatively limited cost imposed by use of separation of powers and the great severity of the harm sought to be avoided, one should not demand a great showing of the likelihood that the feared harm would result. For just as in the case of the threat of nuclear war, no one wants to be forced into the position of saying, &quot;I told you so.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, plenary immigration law has justified all abuses in presidential powers<br />
Saito 7 – Professor of Law at Georgia State University, J.D. from Yale (Natsu Taylor. 2007. From Chinese Exclusion to Guantanamo Bay: Plenary Power and the Prerogative State. University Press of Colorado: Boulder, CO. pp. 10-1)<br />
As we have seen in the first few years of this war on terror, unconstrained executive action has not been limited to those officially under U.S. jurisdiction. Executive power has been extended in extremely harsh forms to the detainees at Guantanamo Bay; prisoners at Abu Ghraib and, apparently, at secret prisons across Europe and the Middle East; and to persons subjected to “extraordinary rendition,” captured by U.S. agents and sent to other countries to be interrogated and tortured in ways the United States claims to abhor.31 This book does not directly address the abuses of human rights taking place on a global scale; rather it articulates the domestic framework, legal and political, which sets the stage for such geographically unbounded assertions of plenary power.<br />
Congress’s reluctance to constrain the president’s war powers, its willingness to hastily pass measures such as the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as its long history of exercising its plenary power to deny fundamental rights to immigrants, American Indian nations, and externally colonized territories make it clear that relying on Congress to curb the exercise of unfettered governmental power is not the solution that Justice Brown believed it would be. We must, instead, look to more fundamental solutions and, I believe, that entails ensuring that the government that purports to represent us complies with the rule of law. The underlying principle that legitimated the war crime trials of German and Japanese leaders in the aftermath of World War II was that neither the provisions of domestic law, nor claims of national interest or sovereignty, nor the purported needs of a “higher race” can override the mandates of international law, law acknowledged by these tribunals to be universally binding and law that the U.S. Constitution identifies as part of the “supreme Law of the Land.” As Supreme Court justice Robert H. Jackson, acting as chief prosecutor for the Nuremberg Tribunal, stated: “If certain acts and violations of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them. We are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us.”32<br />

And, Unfettered presidential powers cause nuclear war<br />
Forrester 89 - Professor, Hastings College of the Law (Ray, August 1989, ESSAY: Presidential Wars in the Nuclear Age: An Unresolved Problem, 57 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1636)<br />
On the basis of this report, the startling fact is that one man alone has the ability to start a nuclear war. A basic theory--if not the basic theory of our Constitution--is that concentration of power in any one person, or one group, is dangerous to mankind. The Constitution, therefore, contains a strong system of checks and balances, starting with the separation of powers between the President, Congress, and the Supreme Court. The message is that no one of them is safe with unchecked power. Yet, in what is probably the most dangerous governmental power ever possessed, we find the potential for world destruction lodged in the discretion of one person. As a result of public indignation aroused by the Vietnam disaster, in which tens of thousands lost their lives in military actions initiated by a succession of Presidents, Congress in 1973 adopted, despite presidential veto, the War Powers Resolution. Congress finally asserted its checking and balancing duties in relation to the making of presidential wars. Congress declared in section 2(a) that its purpose was to fulfill the intent of the framers of the Constitution of the United States and insure that the collective judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, and to the continued use of such forces in hostilities or in such situations. The law also stated in section 3 that [t]he President in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated. . . . Other limitations not essential to this discussion are also provided. The intent of the law is clear. Congress undertook to check the President, at least by prior consultation, in any executive action that might lead to hostilities and war. [*1638] President Nixon, who initially vetoed the resolution, claimed that it was an unconstitutional restriction on his powers as Executive and Commander in Chief of the military. His successors have taken a similar view. Even so, some of them have at times complied with the law by prior consultation with representatives of Congress, but obedience to the law has been uncertain and a subject of continuing controversy between Congress and the President. Ordinarily, the issue of the constitutionality of a law would be decided by the Supreme Court. But, despite a series of cases in which such a decision has been sought, the Supreme Court has refused to settle the controversy. The usual ground for such a refusal is that a &quot;political question&quot; is involved. The rule is well established that the federal judiciary will decide only &quot;justiciable&quot; controversies. &quot;Political questions&quot; are not &quot;justiciable.&quot; However, the standards established by the Supreme Court in 1962 in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, to determine the distinction between &quot;justiciable controversies&quot; and &quot;political questions&quot; are far from clear. One writer observed that the term &quot;political question&quot; [a]pplies to all those matters of which the court, at a given time, will be of the opinion that it is impolitic or inexpedient to take jurisdiction. Sometimes this idea of inexpediency will result from the fear of the vastness of the consequences that a decision on the merits might entail. Finkelstein, Judicial Self-Limitation, 37 HARV. L. REV. 338, 344 (1924)(footnote omitted). It is difficult to defend the Court's refusal to assume the responsibility of decisionmaking on this most critical issue. The Court has been fearless in deciding other issues of &quot;vast consequences&quot; in many historic disputes, some involving executive war power. It is to be hoped that the Justices will finally do their duty here. But in the meantime the spectre of single-minded power persists, fraught with all of the frailties of human nature that each human possesses, including the President. World history is filled with tragic examples. Even if the Court assumed its responsibility to tell us whether the Constitution gives Congress the necessary power to check the President, the War Powers Resolution itself is unclear. Does the Resolution require the President to consult with Congress before launching a nuclear attack? It has been asserted that &quot;introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities&quot; refers only to military personnel and does not include the launching of nuclear missiles alone. In support of this interpretation, it has been argued that Congress was concerned about the human losses in Vietnam and in other presidential wars, rather than about the weaponry. Congress, of course, can amend the Resolution to state explicitly that &quot;the introduction of Armed Forces&quot; includes missiles as well as personnel. However, the President could continue to act without prior consultation by renewing the claim first made by President [*1639] Nixon that the Resolution is an unconstitutional invasion of the executive power. Therefore, the real solution, in the absence of a Supreme Court decision, would appear to be a constitutional amendment. All must obey a clear rule in the Constitution. The adoption of an amendment is very difficult. Wisely, Article V requires that an amendment may be proposed only by the vote of two-thirds of both houses of Congress or by the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states, and the proposal must be ratified by the legislatures or conventions of three-fourths of the states. Despite the difficulty, the Constitution has been amended twenty-six times. Amendment can be done when a problem is so important that it arouses the attention and concern of a preponderant majority of the American people. But the people must be made aware of the problem. It is hardly necessary to belabor the relative importance of the control of nuclear warfare. A constitutional amendment may be, indeed, the appropriate method. But the most difficult issue remains. What should the amendment provide? How can the problem be solved specifically? The Constitution in section 8 of Article I stipulates that &quot;[t]he Congress shall have power . . . To declare War. . . .&quot; The idea seems to be that only these many representatives of the people, reflecting the public will, should possess the power to commit the lives and the fortunes of the nation to warfare. This approach makes much more sense in a democratic republic than entrusting the decision to one person, even though he may be designated the &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; of the military forces. His power is to command the war after the people, through their representatives, have made the basic choice to submit themselves and their children to war. There is a recurring relevation of a paranoia of power throughout human history that has impelled one leader after another to draw their people into wars which, in hindsight, were foolish, unnecessary, and, in some instances, downright insane. Whatever may be the psychological influences that drive the single decisionmaker to these irrational commitments of the lives and fortunes of others, the fact remains that the behavior is a predictable one in any government that does not provide an effective check and balance against uncontrolled power in the hands of one human. We, naturally, like to think that our leaders are above such irrational behavior. Eventually, however, human nature, with all its weakness, asserts itself whatever the setting. At least that is the evidence that experience and history give us, even in our own relatively benign society, where the Executive is subject to the rule of law. [*1640] Vietnam and other more recent engagements show that it can happen and has happened here. But the &quot;nuclear football&quot;--the ominous &quot;black bag&quot; --remains in the sole possession of the President. And, most important, his decision to launch a nuclear missile would be, in fact if not in law, a declaration of nuclear war, one which the nation and, indeed, humanity in general, probably would be unable to survive.<br />

Despite the emerging judicial consensus that the Commerce Clause was the proper basis for the exercise of federal power over immigration policy, the rationale for that authority began to [*231] change in 1889. In the seminal Chinese Exclusion Case, which involved an 1888 Act of Congress that retroactively prohibited the re-entry of Chinese laborers who had left the United States, n35 the Court abandoned any suggestion that the power required an explicit constitutional justification, in the Commerce Clause or otherwise, and announced a stand-alone, inherent federal power that granted Congress the power to control the nation's borders and exclude particular aliens from entering the country. n36 This was not found in the enumerated powers of the Constitution, but rather inferred from the broad and largely undefined principles of national sovereignty. n37 Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Field described the risk posed by the entry of Chinese laborers as a national security concern: &quot;The presence of Chinese laborers had a baneful effect upon the material interests of the State, and upon public morals; that their immigration was in numbers approaching the character of an Oriental invasion, and was a menace to our civilization.&quot; n38 In describing the Chinese laborers in such a fashion, the Court made no effort to locate the federal power to prohibit Chinese laborers from entering the country within the Commerce Clause or any other constitutional provision. n39 Rather, the Court derived the authority from sweeping principles of sovereignty: [*232] That the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy. Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation. It is a part of its independence. If it could not exclude aliens it would be to that extent subject to the control of another power. n40 International principles of national sovereignty thus came to serve as the new basis for the federal power to regulate the entry of foreign nationals. In the years that followed, additional immigration cases reaffirmed and extended the national sovereignty argument utilized in The Chinese Exclusion Case. n41 Freed from the restrictions that came with tying the authority to regulate immigration to the text of the Constitution, the Court provided Congress with an expansive power that was both &quot;indefinite and dangerous,&quot; n42 giving it carte blanche to make laws regulating foreign nationals who were seeking admission. Additionally, as the Court was upholding increased federal power to exclude aliens, it simultaneously decreased the scope of judicial review in the area of immigration. As the Court stated, &quot;it is not within the province of the judiciary to order that foreigners who have never been naturalized, nor acquired any domicile or residence within the United States, nor even been admitted into the country pursuant to law, shall be [*233] permitted to enter.&quot; n43 This combination of increased congressional power, not limited by the Constitution's text, and decreased judicial oversight, marked a new reign of the plenary, inherent federal immigration power that continues today. n44<br />

Whiting will decide the future of SB 1070 and broader questions of devolution<br />

IMMIGRATION REFORM - Chamber of Commerce v. Whiting (09-115) (arguments Wednesday December 8)<br />
AT ISSUE: Do federal immigration laws trump state efforts to crack down on businesses that hire illegal aliens?<br />
THE CASE: In 2007, Arizona passed the Legal Arizona Workers Act, allowing the state to suspend the licenses of businesses that &quot;intentionally or knowingly&quot; violate work-eligibility verification requirements. Companies would be required under that law to use E-Verify, a federal database to check the documentation of current and prospective employees.<br />
THE ARGUMENTS: In its lawsuit, the Chamber of Commerce argues federal law prohibits Arizona and other states from making E-Verify use mandatory. The state argues its broad licensing authority gives it the right to monitor businesses within its jurisdiction. The Obama administration recommended review.<br />
IMPACT: This case could serve as a bellwether to a larger, more controversial state immigration law from Arizona. That statute was tossed out by a federal judge in August, and is currently pending at a federal appeals court. It would among other things, give police authority to check a person's immigration status if officers have a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that individual is in the country illegally.<br />
Newly appointed Justice Elena Kagan has withdrawn from the E-Verify case, after her earlier involvement in the appeal process while serving as solicitor general in the Obama administration. She has recused herself in 21 pending cases so far, leaving the possibility of a split 4-4 high court. When that happens, the lower court ruling prevails but no precedent is set.<br />

Application of strict scrutiny forces a ruling against Arizona because it prevents devolution of responsibility.<br />
Hartley 7 - Professor of Law, The Catholic University of America (Roger C., 2007, “Congressional Devolution of Immigration Policymaking: A Separation of Powers Critique,” 2 Duke J. Const. Law &amp; Pub. Pol'y 93, Lexis, JAK)<br />
For roughly a decade, federal legislation has devolved to the states some of Congress’s authority to adopt immigration policies that discriminate against permanent resident aliens.1 Equal protection challenges to discriminatory state policies so authorized by Congress raise the knotty issue of the appropriate scope of judicial review. Courts remain divided.2 The source of the difficulty is that the equal protection “congruence principle” is not applicable to alienage discrimination.3 Unlike equal protection cases throughout most of constitutional law, the judiciary deploys different standards of judicial review in alienage discrimination cases depending on whether the discrimination arises under federal or state law.4 Applying a highly deferential standard of review, courts normally uphold congressionally enacted immigration policies discriminating against aliens.5 By contrast, courts normally invoke strict judicial scrutiny to find state alienage discrimination unlawful.6 Congressional devolution legislation authorizing states to adopt policies that discriminate against aliens spawn equal protection challenges that do not fit neatly into either category of judicial review: the controversies entail state alienage discrimination but the discrimination being challenged is congressionally authorized. Devolution presents the question whether Congress should be able to immunize the states from strict judicial scrutiny by authorizing the states to adopt discriminatory immigration policies that Congress could itself adopt.<br />

A ruling against Arizona in Whiting would ensure SB 1070 is struck down<br />
Hing 9/9 - Professor of Law, University of San Francisco (Bill Ong Hing, September 9, 2010 “Understanding SB1070 From the Lens of Institutionalized Racism and Civil Rights,” The Race Equity Project, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.equity.lsnc.net/understanding-sb1070-from-the-lens-of-institutionalized-racism-and-civil-rights/" rel="nofollow">http://www.equity.lsnc.net/understanding-sb1070-from-the-lens-of-institutionalized-racism-and-civil-rights/</a> , JAK)<br />
Although discrimination issues have been raised in the current litigation over Arizona’s SB1070—especially with respect to the prospect of racial profiling that will likely occur if Arizona police are to target undocumented immigrants—the primary argument that the Department of Justice and others have advanced is that the field of immigration enforcement is preempted by federal law. In response, Arizona relies on DeCanas v. Bica,[11] a 1976 Supreme Court case that upheld a California employer sanction law making it illegal for employers to hire undocumented workers. However, in 1986, Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) that included a federal employer sanction law. One would presume, therefore, that a state’s effort to enact an employer sanction law today would be preempted. In fact, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals recently struck down Hazelton, Pennsylvania’s attempt to enact a local employer sanction law on preemption grounds.[12] However, last year the Ninth Circuit ruled that an earlier Arizona law creating potentially harsh employer sanctions was not impliedly preempted.[13] The state employer sanction issue is headed for the Supreme Court now.<br />

Several courts have upheld the federal government's authority to exclude immigrants from Medicaid. n154 For example, the court upheld the Welfare Reform Act's denial of prenatal care to unqualified immigrants in Lewis v. Thompson. n155 In Lewis, the Second Circuit reiterated the longstanding principle that the federal government has &quot;broad power over naturalization and immigration.&quot; n156 The Supreme Court has consistently held that rational basis scrutiny applies to &quot;immigration and naturalization issues.&quot; n157 The federal government, therefore, may make any law related to a non-suspect class so long as the law [*201] is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. n158 In Matthews v. Diaz, the Court specifically stated that &quot;responsibility for regulating the relationship between the United States and our alien visitors has been committed to the political branches.&quot; n159 The Second Circuit reiterated this view in Lake v. Reno, holding that a &quot;highly deferential standard is appropriate in matters of immigration.&quot; n160 Where rational basis scrutiny applies, the government &quot;has no obligation to produce evidence&quot; to prove rational basis. n161 The plaintiff has the burden of attacking the statute as unconstitutional to &quot;negative every conceivable basis which might support it.&quot; n162 Purposes found to satisfy rational basis review include deterrence of illegal immigration and cost savings n163 --despite the lack of evidence supporting the theory that immigrants consider obtaining social services when coming to the United States. n164 In fact, deprivation of other benefits to undocumented immigrants has also survived rational basis scrutiny. n165 Some critics question whether alienage classification warrants heightened scrutiny under the law. n166 In fact, some state courts have found that alienage classification must meet strict scrutiny, as in Aliessa v. Novello. n167 In that case, legal aliens challenged the New York law which implemented the Welfare Reform Act by prohibiting the use of state and federal social services for five years. n168 Using a heightened scrutiny standard, the court found that the statute violated the equal protection guarantees of the federal and state constitutions. n169 Also, the U.S. Supreme Court seemed to apply heightened rational basis scrutiny in Plyler v. Doe when ruling that states could not deny children of undocumented immigrants from attending public school. n170 The inability of the children of undocumented immigrants to change their status probably underlies the use of heightened scrutiny. Nonetheless, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld rational basis review consistently when dealing with the exclusion of non-citizens from federal programs.<br />

The standard of review set by Fiallo, however, is not entirely clear. Typically, when a statute or regulation differentiates between people on the basis of gender or legitimacy, the Court will require that the law serves some substantial government interest and that the classification is closely related to achieving that interest. n86 In Fiallo, the Court seems to contend that its &quot;limited judicial responsibility&quot; is restricted to a rational basis review and not to the same scrutiny as other domestic laws, even when the classification is based partly on an immutable characteristic of an American citizen. In 1993, the Court reaffirmed its stance declaring that immigration statutes &quot;must . . . meet the (unexacting) standard of rationality advancing some legitimate governmental purpose.&quot; n87 Several other lower courts have similarly interpreted the Court's holding and have limited their reviews of federal immigration laws to ensuring rationality. n88 In the 2001 case of Nguyen v. INS, the Court applied intermediate scrutiny to an immigration statute which differentiated between the illegitimate alien children of U.S. citizen fathers and mothers. n89 As the Court found no equal protection violation, it determined &quot;we need not assess the implications of statements in our earlier cases regarding the wide deference accorded to Congress in the exercise of its immigration and naturalization power.&quot; n90 Justice O'Connor, dissenting, acknowledged that Fiallo requires courts to give great deference to federal laws that regulate the admission of aliens, but contended that the statute at issue regulated citizenship, rather than admission, therefore making Fiallo not applicable. n91<br />
And, applying strict scrutiny would overrule Chae Chin Ping<br />
Romero 97 - Assistant Professor of Law, Dickinson School of Law; JD, USC (Victor C., Summer 1997, “Symposium: Citizenship and it Discontents: Centering the Immigrant in the inter/national Imgation (Part 1): Section One: Race, Citizenship, and Political Community within the Nation-State: Article: The Congruence Principle Applied: Rethinking Equal Protection Review of Federal Alienage Classifications After Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña,” 76 Or. L. Rev. 425, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Federal courts should apply the Court's current strict scrutiny of state alienage classifications to federal alienage classifications that affect immigrants' rights in the context of alienage law as well as those that affect fundamental rights in the context of immigration law. Aside from fairly ensuring that items such as tax burdens and welfare benefits are properly allocated between citizen and noncitizen whether imposed by the state or federal authorities, this congruence between alienage laws and immigration laws that affect fundamental rights adequately captures the essence of equal protection - the protection of discrete and insular minorities. n73<br />
First, as a starting point, the text of the Adarand opinion supports the idea that federal alienage classifications should be viewed with the same strict scrutiny to which state alienage laws are subject. Despite the Adarand majority's insistence that the congruence principle does not apply to laws within the expertise of the political branches of government, such as immigration, n74 alienage law - the law involving immigrants' rights - bears little constitutional relation for equal protection purposes to immigration law - the law governing noncitizens' entry into and exit from this country. Thus, under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress may appropriately distinguish between citizens and noncitizens in determining who is entitled to enter and leave the United States as part of its immigration power.<br />
However, one's citizenship may be of significantly less constitutional importance when Congress distributes public benefits. n75 Indeed, whether it [*443] is a state or a federal entity that decides to deny a noncitizen public benefits based on that person's status matters very little to the individual affected by the denial. n76<br />
In alienage law, a classification distinguishing between citizen and noncitizen onerously burdens the noncitizen, whether it is the state or the federal government that chooses to create it. Professor Kenneth Karst reminds us that it was not long ago that Congress pursued several well-meaning, but ultimately coercive, anti-immigrant measures within alienage law:<br />
In 1918 Congress doubled the income tax on &quot;non-resident aliens&quot;; although it was not clear who would be considered non-resident, thousands of [noncitizens] promptly declared their intention to become citizens. Other measures were proposed and even introduced in Congress, but failed to pass: ... &quot;suppression of the foreign-language press, mass internments, and the denial of industrial employment to [noncitizens].&quot; n77<br />
Last year's welfare reform bill that denies certain benefits even to documented immigrants closely mirrors the anti-immigrant measures of old. n78<br />
In addition, even within immigration law, strict scrutiny should be brought to bear on classifications that impair fundamental rights. Professor T. Alexander Aleinikoff suggests, for example, that critical examination should follow the enactment of immigration laws that burden family relationships; he provides the following example regarding the right to marry:<br />
Citizens and permanent [residents] do not enjoy similar opportunities for reuniting with immediate family members lo- [*444] cated outside the United States. The entry of the spouse or minor child of a [permanent resident] is subject to a numerical limitation (if the relationship was formed after the [noncitizen] entered the country), while the entry of the spouse or minor child of a U.S. citizen is not. The impact of the statutory scheme is dramatic because the numerical limits have created a waiting list of tens of thousands of [noncitizens]. Thus, if a permanent [resident] marries a Mexican national, the [noncitizen] spouse may have to wait as long as 10 years to be eligible for entry. However, if a U.S. citizen marries a Mexican national, the [noncitizen] spouse may enter as soon as immigration authorities process the paper work. n79<br />
Indeed, such an approach would be consistent with the &quot;fundamental rights&quot; strand n80 of equal protection analysis which, in Professor Aleinikoff's example invoking the constitutionally-based fundamental right to marry, n81 would sadly be subordinated to the plenary power of Congress over immigration matters.<br />
Second, as a practical matter, stricter scrutiny should apply to [*445] federal alienage classifications because the current rational basis test has not had much force when pitted against the ancient plenary power doctrine. n82 Although it has been invoked recently to strike a Colorado constitutional amendment that was patently anti-homosexual, n83 the existing rational basis test rarely has bite n84 to it, much less in its application to federal alienage classifications. In contrast, strict scrutiny will ensure parity in how laws are reviewed. n85 To do otherwise would be to effectively hold that the plenary power of the federal government trumps the rights of all noncitizens. In addition, to characterize the burdens on noncitizens as merely incidental denies the reality that the harm to the noncitizen is the same whether directly or indirectly inflicted. n86 Indeed, the government should be more vigilant when burdens are incidental so that it may properly assess the impact of such burdens on noncitizens' lives.<br />
Third, the dangerous intersection of race and alienage caution greater, rather than lesser, scrutiny of both federal and state alienage classifications. Professors Neil Gotanda and Robert [*446] Chang have written extensively about how Asian-Americans, unlike blacks or whites, have always been marked as &quot;foreign.&quot; Professor Gotanda points to the Court's decision to uphold the wartime internment of all persons of Japanese ancestry in United States v. Korematsu as an example of this presumption at work:<br />
The evacuated Japanese-Americans, including U.S. citizens, were presumed to be sufficiently foreign for an inference by the military that such racial-foreigners must be disloyal. Japanese-Americans were therefore characterized as different from the African-American racial minority. With the presence of racial foreignness, a presumption of disloyalty was reasonable and natural. n87<br />
Gotanda's words strike a bitter chord in the real world: Racist remarks directed against persons of Asian and Latino descent more likely command the victims to return to their homeland than slurs aimed at blacks. Indeed, immigrant blacks from the West Indies often find a cultural disconnect with native African- Americans and yet are often perceived as part of the indigenous black community. n88<br />
Affirming Gotanda's thesis, Chang points out the historical intersection of race and immigration law in the Chinese Exclusion Case, in which the Court affirmed Congress's ban on Chinese immigration:<br />
The Court begins by stating that the Chinese are foreigners of a different race, or what Neil Gotanda terms, racialized foreigners. n89 These racialized foreigners &quot;will not assimilate with us.&quot; Implicit in this is a notion of us or of we in &quot;We the People.&quot; The us the Court is talking about is the national community. They, the Chinese, are not us. Further, they will not assimilate with us. And therefore, we will not let them become us. This is justified because they are dangerous to our peace and security. They are the Yellow Peril, threatening our [*447] sense of the national community. Therefore, Congress must exclude them at the border. n90<br />
Chang concludes that Asian-Americans are &quot;perpetual foreigners&quot; whose &quot;foreign-ness is inscribed upon our bodies in such a way that Asian-Americans carry a figurative border with us.&quot; n91<br />
Latinos and Latinas, especially Mexican-Americans, also suffer the stigma of living with figurative borders. Professor Kevin Johnson notes that, despite public perception of the &quot;illegal alien&quot; as the unskilled, brown-skinned, Mexican male, Mexicans comprised only thirty-nine percent of all undocumented immigrants in the United States in 1992. n92 While many more Mexi- [*448] cans are legal immigrants to this country, n93 Mexicans, like Asian- Americans, are marked as perpetually foreign by the color of their skin. Further, just as Asian-Americans have been historically excluded through judicial and legislative action, Mexican- Americans have been similarly targeted by government action, most notably in California. n94<br />
ContinuedContinued<br />
More importantly, this intersection of race and alienage is not simply a theoretical construct, but is a genuine concern born of the recent influx of nonwhite immigrants. Since the National Origins quota system severely curtailing immigration from predominantly nonwhite nations n95 was abolished in 1965, n96 most recent immigrants have been from Asia and Latin America. n97 Indeed, the top five countries of birth for legal immigrants in 1990 were Mexico, El Salvador, the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic. n98 Because of the larger numbers of nonwhite immigrants, the more Congress and the states create alienage [*449] classifications, the greater the likelihood that nonwhite immigrants will be unduly burdened by such classifications.<br />
These large numbers make anti-immigration and anti-immigrants' rights law an easy proxy for racism. n99 Through the intersection of race and alienage, nativist sentiment reinforces racist beliefs and vice-versa, making it exceedingly more difficult to discern whether newer alienage classifications merely mask underlying racial prejudice. n100 By invoking strict scrutiny, courts will be able to better ferret out invidious racial discrimination or perhaps even benign neglect. n101 In addition, white and black noncitizens will benefit from the stricter standard even if the border of foreignness does not specifically bound them. n102<br />
[*450] Fourth, noncitizens have relatively little political power because they do not have the power to vote. n103 While other minority groups - blacks, women, gays and lesbians - may argue (whether correctly or incorrectly) that they have suffered more historically, these groups have had the benefit of the franchise and access to the political process, n104 while noncitizens have had to rely on the benevolence of citizen-advocacy groups. n105 Unfortunately, such advocacy is hampered by the reality that Congress largely has free rein to discriminate against noncitizens, even on the basis of activity that is not illegal. n106 Further, where Congress enacts laws that only incidentally burden immigrants' rights, the judiciary should be particularly alert because noncitizens' advocates may not act as swiftly as they would if the law directly targets noncitizens, notwithstanding the genuine impact on the affected group. n107<br />
[*451] Fifth, the United States has long taken pride in promoting the values of diversity, tolerance, and community. We experience diversity in the large influx of nonwhite immigrants into this country; it would be a shame if the salutary effects of the abolition of the National Origins quota system of immigration n108 - itself a triumph of the nation's commitment to diversity - continue to be diminished by the passing of ever more oppressive anti-immigrant laws subject to minimal judicial scrutiny. Moreover, tolerance is not only the touchstone of the First Amendment free speech right, n109 but also exemplifies the principle underlying the Declaration of Independence. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal.&quot; n110 A government that fails to appreciate the equal moral worth of all people n111 - citizen and noncitizen - fails to fully adhere to the historical imperative of tolerance of different people with different views and backgrounds. Finally, the United States has long believed in the principle of community. As stated in the introduction to this Article, the very words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty proclaim America as a welcoming community for those rejected by other nations. n112 To allow federal and state governments to divide the community of America between citi- [*452] zen and noncitizen in the conferral of benefits without good reason would be to undermine the historical principle of community symbolized so eloquently by Lady Liberty.<br />
In sum, the logic of the congruence principle, the inefficacy of the rational basis test in safeguarding immigrants' rights, the dangerous intersection between race and alienage, the political powerlessness of noncitizens, and America's historical adherence to principles of diversity, tolerance, and community combine to create a powerful case for strictly scrutinizing federal alienage classifications in the same manner as state classifications in the realm of alienage law and fundamental rights.<br />

B. Relevant Cases Holding that the Medical Rights of Detainees are not Protected by the Due Process<br />
While the Supreme Court and other federal courts have held that aliens are protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, these courts have limited the extent of protection these individuals can receive in the following cases. In 1889, the Supreme Court considered the case Chae Chan Ping v. United States. n149 The appellant was [*170] a citizen of China who worked as a day laborer in San Francisco. n150 He returned to China for one year and carried a certificate issued by the collector of customs of the port of San Francisco, allowing him to return to the United States pursuant to the immigration laws in force at that time. n151 When he returned to San Francisco, he was denied permission to land because, during his absence, Congress had passed an act that nullified the certificates permitting Chinese individuals to return to the United States. n152 The appellant was prohibited from entering the United States and filed a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that his due process rights had been violated. n153<br />
The Supreme Court of the United States found that it did not have the authority to consider the motives of Congress in passing legislation that would ban a certain group of citizens from immigrating to the United States. n154 The court stated &quot;[t]hat the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy.&quot; n155 The Supreme Court believed that the power to exclude aliens developed from the sovereign power of the nation. n156 Thus,<br />
[t]o preserve its independence, and give security against foreign aggression and encroachment, is the highest duty of every nation . . . It matters not in what form such aggression and encroachment come, whether from the foreign nation acting in its national character, or from vast hordes of its people crowding in upon us. n157<br />
Therefore, the Court held that the government had power to determine that certain people and groups should not be admitted and it was not the duty of the Court to question this finding. n158 This case is an early example of the [*171] plenary power doctrine that the Supreme Court and other federal courts have used to avoid determining the exact protection that the Due Process Clause provides for detainees. n159<br />

With the scant mention immigration receives in the text of the Constitution itself, the combination of both principles has caused the field of immigration law to veer far from the standards and rights upheld in other areas of constitutional law.

But these are hard questions, ones that necessitate careful thought and consideration of nuanced arguments about the proper role of our courts in our system of government. Unfortunately, it seems that politicians and pundits (and, in some cases, dissenting judges) have no patience for difficulty, care or nuance. It is a lot easier to simply lob the rhetorical grenade that a decision with which someone disagrees is an exercise in judicial activism.<br />
My suggestion is that we either eliminate judicial activism from our vocabulary about decisions of the courts or specify precisely what is meant by the term. Either way, it is clear that to complain that a decision is illegitimate because the court overturned a statute, or overruled a prior case, or recognized a right that is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution --the usual uses of the insult -- is simply not enough. Complaining about judicial activism on those familiar grounds is nothing more than an epithet, the verbal equivalent of a can of spray paint wielded by those who are unwilling or unable to engage in the rigorous and responsible discourse of citizenship. We can do better than that.<br />

And, The Chinese Exclusion Case isn’t overruled.<br />
Lee 5 - Articles Editor, COLUM. J.L. &amp; SOC. PROBS (Anne, Winter 2005, “The Unfettered Executive: Is There an Inherent Presidential Power to Exclude Aliens?” 39 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 223, JAK)<br />
Despite the emerging judicial consensus that the Commerce Clause was the proper basis for the exercise of federal power over immigration policy, the rationale for that authority began to [*231] change in 1889. In the seminal Chinese Exclusion Case, which involved an 1888 Act of Congress that retroactively prohibited the re-entry of Chinese laborers who had left the United States, n35 the Court abandoned any suggestion that the power required an explicit constitutional justification, in the Commerce Clause or otherwise, and announced a stand-alone, inherent federal power that granted Congress the power to control the nation's borders and exclude particular aliens from entering the country. n36 This was not found in the enumerated powers of the Constitution, but rather inferred from the broad and largely undefined principles of national sovereignty. n37 Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Field described the risk posed by the entry of Chinese laborers as a national security concern: &quot;The presence of Chinese laborers had a baneful effect upon the material interests of the State, and upon public morals; that their immigration was in numbers approaching the character of an Oriental invasion, and was a menace to our civilization.&quot; n38 In describing the Chinese laborers in such a fashion, the Court made no effort to locate the federal power to prohibit Chinese laborers from entering the country within the Commerce Clause or any other constitutional provision. n39 Rather, the Court derived the authority from sweeping principles of sovereignty: [*232] That the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy. Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation. It is a part of its independence. If it could not exclude aliens it would be to that extent subject to the control of another power. n40 International principles of national sovereignty thus came to serve as the new basis for the federal power to regulate the entry of foreign nationals. In the years that followed, additional immigration cases reaffirmed and extended the national sovereignty argument utilized in The Chinese Exclusion Case. n41 Freed from the restrictions that came with tying the authority to regulate immigration to the text of the Constitution, the Court provided Congress with an expansive power that was both &quot;indefinite and dangerous,&quot; n42 giving it carte blanche to make laws regulating foreign nationals who were seeking admission. Additionally, as the Court was upholding increased federal power to exclude aliens, it simultaneously decreased the scope of judicial review in the area of immigration. As the Court stated, &quot;it is not within the province of the judiciary to order that foreigners who have never been naturalized, nor acquired any domicile or residence within the United States, nor even been admitted into the country pursuant to law, shall be [*233] permitted to enter.&quot; n43 This combination of increased congressional power, not limited by the Constitution's text, and decreased judicial oversight, marked a new reign of the plenary, inherent federal immigration power that continues today. n44<br />

And, Overruling Chinese Exclusion expands beneficiary eligibility<br />

Congress prohibited Asian immigration from Asian and non-Asian countries in a series of statutes and treaties referred to here as the Asian Exclusion Laws. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882,81 upheld in Chae Chan Ping, was the first express racial restriction. The beginning of Japanese immigration around 1900 resulted in the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907-08 under which Japan promised not to issue travel documents to those planning to come to America.82 In 1917, after Indians began immigrating in quantity, Congress adopted a more comprehensive solution, prohibiting immigration of all races indigenous to the so-called Asiatic Barred Zone.83 This process culminated in the Immigration Act of 1924,84 which tied immigration to the right to naturalization. &quot;Aliens ineligible to citizenship&quot; were excluded entirely under the 1924 law. This phrase was a euphemism for Asians because the act defined an alien &quot;ineligible to citizenship&quot; as one covered by the Chinese Exclusion Act or racially ineligible to naturalize.85 After 1924, then, most Asians could not immigrate,86 and almost all who were already here were barred from becoming naturalized citizens. The Asian Exclusion Laws operated on the basis of race, not nationality or place of birth. Thus, a person of Japanese ancestry born and raised in Brazil would be treated as Japanese, not Brazilian.87<br />
<br />
And, The court can overrule the case using the rational basis test<br />
Chin 98 - Professor of Law at University of Cincinnati, J.D. from Yale University (Gabriel J., “Segregation’s Last Stronghold: Race Discrimination and the Constitutional Law of Immigration,” 46 UCLA L. Rev. 1 1998-1999, JAK)<br />
The Court applied a notion similar to the Stevens formulation in Plyler v. Doe,339 explaining that “classifications treated as suspect tend to be irrelevant to any proper legislative goal.”340 Taken seriously, the idea that race is ordinarily irrelevant to a legitimate or proper state interest suggests that racial classifications would not pass even rational basis review. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that all decisions to exclude aliens can be said to serve an important national policy. The Court has “often recognized that a 'primary purpose in restricting immigration is to preserve jobs for American workers.”341 Excluding any alien or class of aliens, including, for example, all Lutherans, Mexicans, Koreans, or Libertarians, promotes that goal to some degree.342 If this is sufficient, then any conceivable immigration restriction would be rational. Moreover, in a world in which people and groups are not identical, if the Court applies the most deferential form of rational basis review, there would always be a rational, though spurious, basis for excluding any particular group.343 For example, the Welsh could be excluded on the ground of preventing the spread of a disease one percent more prevalent in Great Britain than in other parts of the world or because of the high or low educational status or relative youth or maturity of the Welsh population.344 Given the expansiveness of the kinds of rationales the Court has held to be rational, this kind of one-size-fits-all justification could also be applied to every other nationality and racial group, and probably every other group of humans sufficiently identifiable that they could be named in legislation. But in recent rational basis cases, the Court has not resorted to the broadest possible reading of the many precedents. In Romer v. Evans,345 rational basis review was sufficient to invalidate a classification motivated by &quot;animus toward the class it affects.346 The Court held irrational a Colorado constitutional amendment designed to exclude homosexuals from the protection of antidiscrimination statutes. The Court explained that, “by requiring that the classification bear a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end, we ensure that classifications are not drawn for the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.”347 When a classification is supported only by “animosity toward the class of persons affected,” it will not be founded on a legitimate government interest. 348 This understanding of rational basis review should serve to invalidate racial classifications in the immigration context. In Cleburne Living Center,349 the Court said that classifications by race, alienage, or national origin “are so seldom relevant to the achievement of any legitimate state interest that laws grounded in such considerations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy-a view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or deserving as others.”350 In Palmore v. Sidoti,351 the Court observed that “classifying persons according to their race is more likely to reflect racial prejudice than legitimate public concerns; the race, not the person, dictates the category.”352 This kind of inquiry is appropriate even within the premises of rational basis review. If, for example, Congress prohibited all Central Americans from immigrating, it might argue that it acted not out of any animosity toward that group, but because of the higher incidence of, say, malaria, in Central America than in other regions of the world. But, as in Romer, it would be obvious to a reviewing court why the classification was not more tightly crafted, for example, by excluding only aliens with malaria or even providing that all Central Americans had to prove their freedom from disease.353<br />
<br />
And, The aff strikes a balance for Congressional and Executive powers by preventing abuses and racism but allowing enough to avoid any turns<br />
Ancheta 6 –Assistant Professor of Law at Santa Clara, Attorney specializing in Immigration law (Angelo, October 2006, Race, Rights and the Asian American Experience, Rutgers University Press, p.92, JAK)<br />
The Supreme Court has not had a recent opportunity to address a challenge to an immigration law that discriminates on the basis of race or national origin. But if the occasion arises to revisit the plenary power doctrine, the Supreme Court would be wise to overrule it, or at least to modify the doctrine so that anachronisms such as the racial exclusion laws can never again go into effect. It would not tie the hands of Congress or the president to make the immigration and naturalization laws subject to constitutional limits and to judicial review. There is no constitutional right to immigrate to the United States, nor is there a constitutional right to become a naturalized citizen. If Congress chose to pass legislation to end all immigration, that law would be constitutional. But the Constitution embodies particular values— such as equal protection of the laws and freedom of expression and religion— that should not be simply thrown out the window because Congress is legislating in the area of immigration and naturalization. Immigration legislation should be subject to the same review by the courts as other national legislation. And the courts should at least recognize that racially discriminatory immigration laws serve no rational purpose.<br />
<br />
And, It must be Chinese Exclusion.<br />

Under current law, no races are explicitly favored in the awarding of immigrant or nonimmigrant visas, and many believe that no particular nations are advantaged or disadvantaged as an indirect means of racial preference.9 Yet, the power to select immigrants on the basis of race is said to remain at the ready. Chae Chan Ping and Fong Yue Ting continue to be cited in modern decisions of the Supreme Court;94 because all constitutional immigration law flows from these cases, even decisions that do not cite them must rely on cases that do.95<br />

Despite a radically changed political and legal environment, the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education perhaps best exemplifies the symbolic importance of the judiciary. Even today that case stands as a beacon of hope to the poor and the disadvantaged.4 Brown’s significance involves more than even its remarkable willingness to say no to one of the great shames of American history. Brown was an occasion for the ideological rebirth of America, an an occasion that tells a story of struggle and liberation and points the way for a new engagement with the problem of how men and women of different backgrounds and race might live together as equals. But Brown is also a story of how courts apparently can be mobilized in the service of social transformation. J. Haarvie Wilkinson contends that “Brown may be the most important political, social, and legal event in America’s twentieth-century history. Its greatness lay in the enormity of the injustice it condemned, in the entrenched sentiment it challenged, in the immensity of law it both created and overthrew.”5 It showed that courts could and would use their power to address, if not undo, injustice even if that injustice was sown deeply into the fabric of American life.<br />
<br />
And, An infinite ethics requires universalization through the law and institutions.<br />
Simmons 99 - Bethany College, Department of History and Political Science (William Paul, 1999 “The Third: Levinas’ Theoretical Move From An-archical Ethics to the Realm of Justice and Politics.” Philosophy and Social Criticism. Vol 25 no 6. 96-8)<br />
We should also say that all those who attack us with such venom have no right to do so . . . along with this feeling of unbounded responsibility, there is certainly a place for defence, for it is not always a question of ‘me’ but of those close to me, who are also my neighbors. I’d call such a defence a politics, but a politics that’s ethically necessary. Alongside ethics, there is a place for politics.55 Levinas argues for a place for both ethics and politics, or, to employ his metaphor, a place for both the Jewish tradition of ethics and responsibility and, along with it, the Greek tradition of language, justice and politics. This section will analyze the mutual necessity of both ethics and politics. According to Levinas, ethics and politics can both be needed only if there is separation, that is, if each has its own justification. Neither ethics nor politics should be taken to their extremes; each must be moderated by the other. ‘I think there’s a direct contradiction between ethics and politics, if both these demands are taken to the extreme.‘56 Ethics must temper the political because politics unbounded leads to tyranny, absolute power of the strongest. Politics ignores the individuality of each citizen, treating each as a cipher, a member of a species. Further, without a norm outside of the scope of the said, there is no standard to judge political regimes. The call for a standard by which to judge regimes is what Levinas means by a return to Platonism. Plato, in the Republic, had used the good beyond being as his standard. A return to Platonism would be necessary to restore ‘the independence of ethics in relation to history’ and trace ‘a limit to the comprehension of the real by history’.57 Levinas finds a standard in the ethical relationship with the Other. The norm that must continue to inspire and direct the moral order is the ethical norm of the interhuman. If the moral-political order totally relinquishes its ethical foundation, it must accept all forms of society, including the fascist or totalitarian, for it can no longer evaluate or discriminate between them. The state is usually better than anarchy – but not always. In some instances, – fascism or totalitarianism, for example – the political order of the state may have to be challenged in the name of our ethical responsibility to the other. This is why ethical philosophy must remain the first philosophy.58 At the same time, ethics needs politics. To reach those others who are far away, ethics must be transfixed into language, justice and politics. ‘As prima philosophia, ethics cannot itself legislate for society or produce rules of conduct whereby society might be revolutionized or transformed.’59 Although this universalization distances the ego from the Other, it must be done to reach the others. We must, out of respect for the categorical imperative or the other’s right as expressed by his face, un-face human beings, sternly reducing each one’s uniqueness to his individuality in the unity of the genre, and let universality rule. Thus we need laws, and – yes – courts of law, institutions and the state to render justice.60 Further, politics is necessary because there are those who will refuse to heed the new law, ‘Thou shall not kill.’ Levinas is well aware that this commandment is not an ontological impossibility. Many will take Cain’s position and shun the responsibility for the Other. Thus, politics is necessary to prohibit murder, in all its forms. ‘A place had to be foreseen and kept warm for all eternity for Hitler and his followers.‘61 Both ethics and politics have their own justification. The justification for ethics is found in the face-to-face relationship with the Other. The justification for politics is to restrain those who follow Cain’s position and ignore the responsibility for the Other. Politics does not subsume ethics, but rather it serves ethics. Politics is necessary but it must be continually checked by ethics. Levinas calls for a state that is as ethical as possible, one which is perpetually becoming more just. Levinas calls for the liberal state.<br />
<br />
And, Eliminating normative questions destroys all ethics and perpetually maintains the status quo<br />
Habermas 98 - Professor of Philosophy, University of Frankfurt (Jurgen, 1998, Between Facts and Norms: Contributions to a Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy, Trans. William Rehg, Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, pp.309-10)<br />
However, if neutrality were in addition to require that ethical questions be bracketed out of political discourse in general, then such discourse would forfeit its power to rationally change prepolitical attitudes, need interpretations, and value orientations. According to this reading of “conversational restraint,” practical questions that are prima facie controversial should simply not be pursued any further.30 This amounts to treating questions of the good as “private” affairs. On this premise, however, the neutrality of procedure could be secured only be rules of avoidance (or “gag rules”31) and would depend on received distinctions between private and public spheres, delimitations that for their part are excluded from discussion. Such a rigid constraint, which a fortiori excludes ethical questions, would at least implicitly prejudice the agenda in favor of an inherited background of settled traditions. If we do not even present our different ethical views for discussion, then we cannot sound out the possibilities for reaching consensus through discourse. This leads Charles Larmore to propose a different reading of neutrality: In particular, the ideal of political neutrality does not deny that such discussion should encompass not only determining what are the probable consequences of alternative decisions and whether certain decisions can be neutrally justified, but also clarifying one’s notion of the good life and trying to convince others of the superiority of various aspects of one’s view of human flourishing. This ideal demands only that so long as some view about the good life remains disputed, no decision of the state can be justified on the basis of its supposed intrinsic superiority or inferiority.32<br />

Peña 515 U.S. 200 (1995) to overrule Chae Chan Ping v. United States, 130 U.S. 581 (1889) on the grounds that denying temporary nonimmigrant worker visas to individuals due to their race fails the strict scrutiny test.<br />
<br />
And, The Chinese Exclusion Case isn’t overruled.<br />
Lee 5 - Articles Editor, COLUM. J.L. &amp; SOC. PROBS (Anne, Winter 2005, “The Unfettered Executive: Is There an Inherent Presidential Power to Exclude Aliens?” 39 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 223, JAK)<br />
Despite the emerging judicial consensus that the Commerce Clause was the proper basis for the exercise of federal power over immigration policy, the rationale for that authority began to [*231] change in 1889. In the seminal Chinese Exclusion Case, which involved an 1888 Act of Congress that retroactively prohibited the re-entry of Chinese laborers who had left the United States, n35 the Court abandoned any suggestion that the power required an explicit constitutional justification, in the Commerce Clause or otherwise, and announced a stand-alone, inherent federal power that granted Congress the power to control the nation's borders and exclude particular aliens from entering the country. n36 This was not found in the enumerated powers of the Constitution, but rather inferred from the broad and largely undefined principles of national sovereignty. n37 Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Field described the risk posed by the entry of Chinese laborers as a national security concern: &quot;The presence of Chinese laborers had a baneful effect upon the material interests of the State, and upon public morals; that their immigration was in numbers approaching the character of an Oriental invasion, and was a menace to our civilization.&quot; n38 In describing the Chinese laborers in such a fashion, the Court made no effort to locate the federal power to prohibit Chinese laborers from entering the country within the Commerce Clause or any other constitutional provision. n39 Rather, the Court derived the authority from sweeping principles of sovereignty: [*232] That the government of the United States, through the action of the legislative department, can exclude aliens from its territory is a proposition which we do not think open to controversy. Jurisdiction over its own territory to that extent is an incident of every independent nation. It is a part of its independence. If it could not exclude aliens it would be to that extent subject to the control of another power. n40 International principles of national sovereignty thus came to serve as the new basis for the federal power to regulate the entry of foreign nationals. In the years that followed, additional immigration cases reaffirmed and extended the national sovereignty argument utilized in The Chinese Exclusion Case. n41 Freed from the restrictions that came with tying the authority to regulate immigration to the text of the Constitution, the Court provided Congress with an expansive power that was both &quot;indefinite and dangerous,&quot; n42 giving it carte blanche to make laws regulating foreign nationals who were seeking admission. Additionally, as the Court was upholding increased federal power to exclude aliens, it simultaneously decreased the scope of judicial review in the area of immigration. As the Court stated, &quot;it is not within the province of the judiciary to order that foreigners who have never been naturalized, nor acquired any domicile or residence within the United States, nor even been admitted into the country pursuant to law, shall be [*233] permitted to enter.&quot; n43 This combination of increased congressional power, not limited by the Constitution's text, and decreased judicial oversight, marked a new reign of the plenary, inherent federal immigration power that continues today. n44<br />

09-5801 FLORES-VILLAR V. UNITED STATES<br />
DECISION BELOW: 536 F.3d 990<br />
LOWER COURT CASE NUMBER: 07-50445<br />
QUESTION PRESENTED:<br />
WHETHER THE COURT'S DECISION IN NGUYEN V. INS, 533 U.S. 53 (2001), PERMITS GENDER DISCRIMINATION THAT HAS NO BIOLOGICAL BASIS?<br />
<br />
And, That requires addressing how equal protection applies to potential immigrants<br />

The standard of review set by Fiallo, however, is not entirely clear. Typically, when a statute or regulation differentiates between people on the basis of gender or legitimacy, the Court will require that the law serves some substantial government interest and that the classification is closely related to achieving that interest. n86 In Fiallo, the Court seems to contend that its &quot;limited judicial responsibility&quot; is restricted to a rational basis review and not to the same scrutiny as other domestic laws, even when the classification is based partly on an immutable characteristic of an American citizen. In 1993, the Court reaffirmed its stance declaring that immigration statutes &quot;must . . . meet the (unexacting) standard of rationality advancing some legitimate governmental purpose.&quot; n87 Several other lower courts have similarly interpreted the Court's holding and have limited their reviews of federal immigration laws to ensuring rationality. n88 In the 2001 case of Nguyen v. INS, the Court applied intermediate scrutiny to an immigration statute which differentiated between the illegitimate alien children of U.S. citizen fathers and mothers. n89 As the Court found no equal protection violation, it determined &quot;we need not assess the implications of statements in our earlier cases regarding the wide deference accorded to Congress in the exercise of its immigration and naturalization power.&quot; n90 Justice O'Connor, dissenting, acknowledged that Fiallo requires courts to give great deference to federal laws that regulate the admission of aliens, but contended that the statute at issue regulated citizenship, rather than admission, therefore making Fiallo not applicable. n91<br />
<br />
And, applying the congruence principle from Adarand resolved these questions and overrules Chae Chin Ping<br />
Romero 97 - Assistant Professor of Law, Dickinson School of Law; JD, USC (Victor C., Summer 1997, “Symposium: Citizenship and it Discontents: Centering the Immigrant in the inter/national Imgation (Part 1): Section One: Race, Citizenship, and Political Community within the Nation-State: Article: The Congruence Principle Applied: Rethinking Equal Protection Review of Federal Alienage Classifications After Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña,” 76 Or. L. Rev. 425, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Federal courts should apply the Court's current strict scrutiny of state alienage classifications to federal alienage classifications that affect immigrants' rights in the context of alienage law as well as those that affect fundamental rights in the context of immigration law. Aside from fairly ensuring that items such as tax burdens and welfare benefits are properly allocated between citizen and noncitizen whether imposed by the state or federal authorities, this congruence between alienage laws and immigration laws that affect fundamental rights adequately captures the essence of equal protection - the protection of discrete and insular minorities. n73<br />
First, as a starting point, the text of the Adarand opinion supports the idea that federal alienage classifications should be viewed with the same strict scrutiny to which state alienage laws are subject. Despite the Adarand majority's insistence that the congruence principle does not apply to laws within the expertise of the political branches of government, such as immigration, n74 alienage law - the law involving immigrants' rights - bears little constitutional relation for equal protection purposes to immigration law - the law governing noncitizens' entry into and exit from this country. Thus, under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, Congress may appropriately distinguish between citizens and noncitizens in determining who is entitled to enter and leave the United States as part of its immigration power.<br />
However, one's citizenship may be of significantly less constitutional importance when Congress distributes public benefits. n75 Indeed, whether it [*443] is a state or a federal entity that decides to deny a noncitizen public benefits based on that person's status matters very little to the individual affected by the denial. n76<br />
In alienage law, a classification distinguishing between citizen and noncitizen onerously burdens the noncitizen, whether it is the state or the federal government that chooses to create it. Professor Kenneth Karst reminds us that it was not long ago that Congress pursued several well-meaning, but ultimately coercive, anti-immigrant measures within alienage law:<br />
In 1918 Congress doubled the income tax on &quot;non-resident aliens&quot;; although it was not clear who would be considered non-resident, thousands of [noncitizens] promptly declared their intention to become citizens. Other measures were proposed and even introduced in Congress, but failed to pass: ... &quot;suppression of the foreign-language press, mass internments, and the denial of industrial employment to [noncitizens].&quot; n77<br />
Last year's welfare reform bill that denies certain benefits even to documented immigrants closely mirrors the anti-immigrant measures of old. n78<br />
In addition, even within immigration law, strict scrutiny should be brought to bear on classifications that impair fundamental rights. Professor T. Alexander Aleinikoff suggests, for example, that critical examination should follow the enactment of immigration laws that burden family relationships; he provides the following example regarding the right to marry:<br />
Citizens and permanent [residents] do not enjoy similar opportunities for reuniting with immediate family members lo- [*444] cated outside the United States. The entry of the spouse or minor child of a [permanent resident] is subject to a numerical limitation (if the relationship was formed after the [noncitizen] entered the country), while the entry of the spouse or minor child of a U.S. citizen is not. The impact of the statutory scheme is dramatic because the numerical limits have created a waiting list of tens of thousands of [noncitizens]. Thus, if a permanent [resident] marries a Mexican national, the [noncitizen] spouse may have to wait as long as 10 years to be eligible for entry. However, if a U.S. citizen marries a Mexican national, the [noncitizen] spouse may enter as soon as immigration authorities process the paper work. n79<br />
Indeed, such an approach would be consistent with the &quot;fundamental rights&quot; strand n80 of equal protection analysis which, in Professor Aleinikoff's example invoking the constitutionally-based fundamental right to marry, n81 would sadly be subordinated to the plenary power of Congress over immigration matters.<br />
Second, as a practical matter, stricter scrutiny should apply to [*445] federal alienage classifications because the current rational basis test has not had much force when pitted against the ancient plenary power doctrine. n82 Although it has been invoked recently to strike a Colorado constitutional amendment that was patently anti-homosexual, n83 the existing rational basis test rarely has bite n84 to it, much less in its application to federal alienage classifications. In contrast, strict scrutiny will ensure parity in how laws are reviewed. n85 To do otherwise would be to effectively hold that the plenary power of the federal government trumps the rights of all noncitizens. In addition, to characterize the burdens on noncitizens as merely incidental denies the reality that the harm to the noncitizen is the same whether directly or indirectly inflicted. n86 Indeed, the government should be more vigilant when burdens are incidental so that it may properly assess the impact of such burdens on noncitizens' lives.<br />
Third, the dangerous intersection of race and alienage caution greater, rather than lesser, scrutiny of both federal and state alienage classifications. Professors Neil Gotanda and Robert [*446] Chang have written extensively about how Asian-Americans, unlike blacks or whites, have always been marked as &quot;foreign.&quot; Professor Gotanda points to the Court's decision to uphold the wartime internment of all persons of Japanese ancestry in United States v. Korematsu as an example of this presumption at work:<br />
The evacuated Japanese-Americans, including U.S. citizens, were presumed to be sufficiently foreign for an inference by the military that such racial-foreigners must be disloyal. Japanese-Americans were therefore characterized as different from the African-American racial minority. With the presence of racial foreignness, a presumption of disloyalty was reasonable and natural. n87<br />
Gotanda's words strike a bitter chord in the real world: Racist remarks directed against persons of Asian and Latino descent more likely command the victims to return to their homeland than slurs aimed at blacks. Indeed, immigrant blacks from the West Indies often find a cultural disconnect with native African- Americans and yet are often perceived as part of the indigenous black community. n88<br />
Affirming Gotanda's thesis, Chang points out the historical intersection of race and immigration law in the Chinese Exclusion Case, in which the Court affirmed Congress's ban on Chinese immigration:<br />
The Court begins by stating that the Chinese are foreigners of a different race, or what Neil Gotanda terms, racialized foreigners. n89 These racialized foreigners &quot;will not assimilate with us.&quot; Implicit in this is a notion of us or of we in &quot;We the People.&quot; The us the Court is talking about is the national community. They, the Chinese, are not us. Further, they will not assimilate with us. And therefore, we will not let them become us. This is justified because they are dangerous to our peace and security. They are the Yellow Peril, threatening our [*447] sense of the national community. Therefore, Congress must exclude them at the border. n90<br />
Chang concludes that Asian-Americans are &quot;perpetual foreigners&quot; whose &quot;foreign-ness is inscribed upon our bodies in such a way that Asian-Americans carry a figurative border with us.&quot; n91<br />
Latinos and Latinas, especially Mexican-Americans, also suffer the stigma of living with figurative borders. Professor Kevin Johnson notes that, despite public perception of the &quot;illegal alien&quot; as the unskilled, brown-skinned, Mexican male, Mexicans comprised only thirty-nine percent of all undocumented immigrants in the United States in 1992. n92 While many more Mexi- [*448] cans are legal immigrants to this country, n93 Mexicans, like Asian- Americans, are marked as perpetually foreign by the color of their skin. Further, just as Asian-Americans have been historically excluded through judicial and legislative action, Mexican- Americans have been similarly targeted by government action, most notably in California. n94<br />
More importantly, this intersection of race and alienage is not simply a theoretical construct, but is a genuine concern born of the recent influx of nonwhite immigrants. Since the National Origins quota system severely curtailing immigration from predominantly nonwhite nations n95 was abolished in 1965, n96 most recent immigrants have been from Asia and Latin America. n97 Indeed, the top five countries of birth for legal immigrants in 1990 were Mexico, El Salvador, the Philippines, Vietnam, and the Dominican Republic. n98 Because of the larger numbers of nonwhite immigrants, the more Congress and the states create alienage [*449] classifications, the greater the likelihood that nonwhite immigrants will be unduly burdened by such classifications.<br />
These large numbers make anti-immigration and anti-immigrants' rights law an easy proxy for racism. n99 Through the intersection of race and alienage, nativist sentiment reinforces racist beliefs and vice-versa, making it exceedingly more difficult to discern whether newer alienage classifications merely mask underlying racial prejudice. n100 By invoking strict scrutiny, courts will be able to better ferret out invidious racial discrimination or perhaps even benign neglect. n101 In addition, white and black noncitizens will benefit from the stricter standard even if the border of foreignness does not specifically bound them. n102<br />
[*450] Fourth, noncitizens have relatively little political power because they do not have the power to vote. n103 While other minority groups - blacks, women, gays and lesbians - may argue (whether correctly or incorrectly) that they have suffered more historically, these groups have had the benefit of the franchise and access to the political process, n104 while noncitizens have had to rely on the benevolence of citizen-advocacy groups. n105 Unfortunately, such advocacy is hampered by the reality that Congress largely has free rein to discriminate against noncitizens, even on the basis of activity that is not illegal. n106 Further, where Congress enacts laws that only incidentally burden immigrants' rights, the judiciary should be particularly alert because noncitizens' advocates may not act as swiftly as they would if the law directly targets noncitizens, notwithstanding the genuine impact on the affected group. n107<br />
[*451] Fifth, the United States has long taken pride in promoting the values of diversity, tolerance, and community. We experience diversity in the large influx of nonwhite immigrants into this country; it would be a shame if the salutary effects of the abolition of the National Origins quota system of immigration n108 - itself a triumph of the nation's commitment to diversity - continue to be diminished by the passing of ever more oppressive anti-immigrant laws subject to minimal judicial scrutiny. Moreover, tolerance is not only the touchstone of the First Amendment free speech right, n109 but also exemplifies the principle underlying the Declaration of Independence. As Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal.&quot; n110 A government that fails to appreciate the equal moral worth of all people n111 - citizen and noncitizen - fails to fully adhere to the historical imperative of tolerance of different people with different views and backgrounds. Finally, the United States has long believed in the principle of community. As stated in the introduction to this Article, the very words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty proclaim America as a welcoming community for those rejected by other nations. n112 To allow federal and state governments to divide the community of America between citi- [*452] zen and noncitizen in the conferral of benefits without good reason would be to undermine the historical principle of community symbolized so eloquently by Lady Liberty.<br />
In sum, the logic of the congruence principle, the inefficacy of the rational basis test in safeguarding immigrants' rights, the dangerous intersection between race and alienage, the political powerlessness of noncitizens, and America's historical adherence to principles of diversity, tolerance, and community combine to create a powerful case for strictly scrutinizing federal alienage classifications in the same manner as state classifications in the realm of alienage law and fundamental rights.
