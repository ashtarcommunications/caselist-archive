<strong>Hark, the Other speaks!</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Re-joice in arousal!</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bruised, battered, and broken – the voice of Otherness fell victim at the hands of difference!</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I stiffen as any good soldier would…</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Those strong hands - distantly divided by a series of lenses and gadgetry recording every trite exactness as they wrap tighter around my neck …</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Time passes - grasping for air, vessels constrict, blood rushes elsewhere - colonial engagements drowned out as the sound of desire’s tide washes away</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond,serif; line-height: 18px;"><strong>&lt;</strong> we then cut to a scene from the film Teen Thailand 3 by Asian Eyes and Third World Media, Release Date: 12/16/2010&gt;</span><br />

<strong>One asks, <em>Can the subaltern speak?</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It is through this series of representations - and debate is always a series of representations – but as Gayatri Spivak argues, there are multiple ways to (re)present the resolution: either through representation (through plans and policy) or re-presentation (in the realm of art and philosophy)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In this round, we affirm this year’s topic though a (re)presentation of nexus of the Southeast Asian prostitute and the gonzo pornography of sex tourism – Spivak explains these different but integrally related affirmative strategies:</strong><br />

 <br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">The topic committee tells us: the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of and/or substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its visas for one or more of the following: employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family-based visas, human trafficking-based visas.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">Like the shout, “Hey you!” we all turn as if they were speaking to us. “Hey you? You mean me?”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Every day I wake to the same sound - bells – ringing, stinging, bringing… light (the) dawn, twilight, height of high noon. In bloom … soon … at sea, like the Vietnamese: boat people. Because “No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent … If a clod be washed away by the sea, [America] is the less … any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">for whom the bell tolls</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">; it tolls for thee.”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">An Indian grad, fresh out of school, applying for an H1B visa, a Mexican day laborer applies for an H2A, “I work hard! … Fornicate the judges. … I don't say 'your honor' to no judge. They don't work as hard as I do. They're not honorable!”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">But that work, in one moment, is rendered irrelevant: Visa denied. Sorry, the bell wasn't tolling for you, but for her over there. Maybe we shouldn't fornicate the judges.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">This hail – whether the topical hail of NDT/CEDA or the Americanizing hail of the INS – founds the individual as subject. When we respond to the hail, when we recognize our name and turn to greet our caller, we found ourselves </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;"><em><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">as subject</span></em></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">, like the migrant with a Visa, who is created as a US citizen. Yoshihko Ichida explains that:</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">In any case, the conceptual figure of Malebranche's rain allows us to perceive a similarity between Schmitt's subject of decision and Althusser's subject of ideology. This ideological subject is supposedly constructed after a Pascalian logic - &quot;Kneel down, move your lips in prayer, and you will believe&quot; (Althusser 1971: 158) - through a 180 degree turn performed when he is &quot;hailed,&quot; the individual becomes a subject; he does not turn because he is a subject, but becomes a subject when he turns.”</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">This 180 degree turn is a magical, alchemical, moment. Before the turn, we are nothing, destitute, the tired, poor, huddled masses yearning to breathe free; after, we are a subject, American, fount of creativity and autonomy, deserving of respect and protection, all because of those crucial 180 degrees.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;"> Similarly, last June the CEDA topic committee announced this topic which interpolated us as debaters. They gave us the topic we would spend thousands of hours researching and hundreds debating over the next year. More importantly, they gave us a purpose and vision for the year ahead.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">Yet this topical hail returns to us, and every round we are awoken to the same vision: Resolved! We've debated it, discarded it, affirmed it, and it's nothing, but: Resolved! We're resolved, we're interpellated, we're debaters and so we are debating, yet still: RESOLVED! We don't even need to topic committee anymore, at least not for a few more months.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Result: caught in this quadruple system of interpellation as subjects, of subjection to the Subject, of universal recognition and of absolute guarantee, the subjects ‘work’, they ‘work by themselves’ in the vast majority of cases, with the exception of the ‘bad subjects’ who on occasion provoke the intervention of one of the detachments of the (Repressive) [Framework] Apparatus. But the vast majority of (good) subjects work all right ‘all by themselves’, i.e. by ideology (whose concrete forms are realized in the Ideological State Apparatuses). They are inserted into practices governed by the rituals of the ISAs. They ‘recognize’ the existing state of affairs (</span> </span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">das Bestehende</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">), that ‘it really is true that it is so and not otherwise’, and that they must be obedient to God, to their conscience, to the [topic committee], to [framework], to the boss, to the engineer, that thou shalt ‘love thy neighbour as thyself’, etc. Their concrete, material behaviour is simply the inscription in life of the admirable words of the prayer: ‘</span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">Amen – So be it</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">’.”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">The entire year, and every debate, was decided for us by the topic committee the moment our Resolve was announced. From that moment we were debaters, from that moment we were subjects, yet Althusser explains that:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; page-break-after: auto; page-break-before: auto;"><span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">Yes, the subjects ‘work by themselves’. The whole mystery of this effect lies in the first two moments of the quadruple system I have just discussed, or, if you prefer, in the ambiguity of the term </span> </span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">subject.</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"> In the ordinary use of the term, subject in fact means: (1) a free subjectivity, a centre of initiatives, author of and responsible for its actions; (2) a subjected being, who submits to a higher authority, and is therefore stripped of all freedom except that of freely accepting his submission. This last note gives us the meaning of this ambiguity, which is merely a reflection of the effect which produces it: the individual </span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">is interpellated as a</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"> (</span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">free) subject in order that he shall submit freely to the commandments of the Subject</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">, </span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">i.e. in order that he shall</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"> (</span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">freely)</span></em> <em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">accept his subjection</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">, i.e. in order that he shall make the gestures and actions of his subjection ‘all by himself’. </span><em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">There are no subjects except by and for their subjection.</span></em><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"> That is why they ‘work all by themselves’.”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">In debate, we have one choice, debate about the topic or you can git out. Accept the topic or leave. Yet every year we have longer and longer topics, entailing more and more. We went from affirming value statements to affirming whole resolution policies to affirming an area within the topic area to being given a list of topical aff's to pick from. Now we have topics upwards of 50 words, carefully crafted to ensure the maximum of education. At all costs, we must prevent bi-directionality, limit the ground, and ensure predictable ground to the negative.</span> <span style="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none;">We offer justifications of predictability and learning about a new topic, and with this certainty – as Foucault says – we become the bearers of our own oppression. However, Ichida says of this hailing:</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">The reading of Malebranche/Schmitt leads us to change the question's direction: Is it really so important to know whether the hailing can succeed or not and under which circumstances it can succeed? Or is not already a condition for its success that it can fail, that the individual possesses every freedom to answer to the caller or not, that all is a question of free decision? Because this problem is constructed more sharply if the freedom of the individual is placed in the center of subject constitution; in short, if one allows for the individual to decide ex nihilo, preparing the theatrical device of freedom for the individual's process of becoming-subject. Not in spite but because of its freedom, the power to refuse the obedience to the caller, the individual turns around.”</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">A slew of critical aff's, non-topical aff's, and basically every aff we have ever read prove this to be the case. Yet every aff grapples with the same problem: How to take an active and affirmative stance towards the resolution, rather than reactive and negative, if language, morality, subjectivity, and the resolution always comes to us from elsewhere? As Althusser says, the hail offers us a unique moment, one moment, the first moment in which we are a subject – able to freely choose – and the last moment – that we are free of the regime of ideology. This is the first and last moment of freedom available to us. Yet this isn't as great a problem as it seems. Indeed, every morning I awake to those same bells. Every round I hear the same topical hail. And every round we have the choice of how we will respond. Ichida explains:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">And indeed Althusser writes &quot;...[he] is free to obey or disobey the appeal.&quot; (Althusser 1971, 166) The freedom of the individual, the possibility that the hailing can fail, transforms the ideological initiative to an &quot;occasion&quot;. The calling offers to the individual an occasion for this transformation: it is called and it answers by chance. To say it again in other words: the Schmittian subject of decision needs a theatrical device for its decision, which seemingly occurs ex nihilo. Just as Althusser's subject has to be hailed to become the subject. Both subjects are subject to the &quot;occasion&quot;.”</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman,serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in; text-decoration: none;">Althusser imagines that we must answer the hail. The policeman shouts “Hey you!” and we turn. Judith Butler stepped beyond this: We may also turn away from the hail, refuse to answer. Yet this inversion remains just as much beholden to the state. Instead, we take a third option, a free option: One which, of course, decides. It turns or does not turn. But it turns freely, refusing all the offers of citizenship, democracy, topic education, fairness and ground. Because, honestly, we don't want your ground. We'll make our own ground.</span><br />

Immigrants are often placed into precarious situations where they are paradoxically valued and simultaneously exploited – these double binds allow for exploitation.<br />

We need new forms of viewing politics outside of merely instrumental policy debate which reduces the complexities of the world to a manageable, crisis driven picture that ensures domination and conflict<br />

“…<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">this is what has made … deepen conflict” </span></span><br />
<br />
It is in spaces like debate that we can take the time to get beyond the one-sentence plan texts, the advantage/disad scenerios with grossly alarmist, exaggerated impacts and the kind of flogocentrism where, as shanahan says “ink passes as argument, and a drop’s as good as a kill” – debate is a space where we can make time for politics<br />

Strict adherence to policy proposals has empirically failed at best but is more likely to replicate the violence done to immigrants by producing them as exploited forms of life <br />

 <span style="color: #cc0000;">in the modern nation there are 2 principles: demand for immigrants and crimininalization</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">this maintains purity of the self and create a radical destruction of the self through the idea of the pure and this is because of power and struggle </span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">and this is because of the identity that is bounded upon us</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">We continue to assimilate and/or criminialize the &quot;other&quot; which is bad and creates our regime</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">we force them to join us and become the &quot;model citizen&quot; and this is the general way to reaffirm our national identity </span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;"><a class="wiki_link" href="arnold.html">arnold</a></span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">and we don't actually look at the other</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">we use this round to find the simplification of &quot;assimilate or annihilate&quot; is bad and we must reorient our politics </span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;"> exclusive focus of policy is the same thing as the cold war policies and it is spun as &quot;pragmatic&quot;</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">is this wise? Does this make sense? We believe this deepens conflict [said]</span><br />

<span style="color: #cc0000;">when you affirm the topic as a mobius strip it's a way to relate to borders, and borders will continue to exist but we should understand the world as all different</span><br />
<span style="color: #cc0000;">we must use a brush and draw differences between things like jews, non-jews, non-non jews [dorash]</span><br />

<span style="color: #0000cc;">our aff is strong enough - it's a non-capitalism, non-sovereign politics, zizek and agamben make an argument of ethical ontology to use critical skeptical politics which is radical enough [card]</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we are not the mediation of the state, we oppose the state this is kritik to solve the most egregious form of politics [agamben] </span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">this is what [arnold] talks about - it's also the LANGUAGE we use in the debate to break the state down and break down the concept that ethics and the institution as a given</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we break the systems they criticize [dejourve 6]</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we can agree with their kritik except the part that rejects the 1ac because the yhave no links (PERM)</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we should build coalitions and temporary alliances to solve [arendt]</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">instead of their argument we should render the resolution irrelevant and we key to breaking down soverign power [dejourve 6] --&gt;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">their ethics are already answered by c-x because we don't believe in a certain type of ethics</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">so their hersheck evidence doesn't apply for us because we don't call for outside mediation. We don't have hands on the levers of power and we're content affirming the topic here</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">[arnold] and [honen] justify this this because we continue to understand the immigrants as being in the wrong</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">their hershel evidence is only an indict to calculative thought, we don't link</span><br />

<span style="color: #0000cc;">the state has already constructed our identity and we can't account for it because protests go on right now</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">their evidence about israel is specifically show; to reinscribe borders is evil</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we must break down the state using the opposition as the subject against the object [numen '00]</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">this is ressentiment so they link to their kritik</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">[franco] and [debourve] lets us twist the border and we can recognize that as creating a time for politics</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">they create the rule based ethics which means the neg is the only one linking to the kritik</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we imagine ourselves as god and it allows us to do things because we can create coalitions - this is the 3rd option</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we should not say the state is good or bad; but we bring together what [manning] calls the non-jew, the jew, and the non-non jew</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">there's no material change after this round - it's only as debaters and a question of ontology here in this debate that actually matters</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we don't shift our aff; we include the aff and agree with the kritik, but don't like them excluding us</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">they eliminate thinking because they try to impose some rules upon us</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">they read zupancic incorrectly; zupancic only talks about tehics</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we can't escape the mobius strip but we must recognize it</span><br />

<span style="color: #0000cc;">we must recognize we're not just a self-contained unit, but one thing in a world of many</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">the ability to take any position means the neg does not care about individuals. </span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">A. it's a yes/no consistency for the neg</span><br />

<span style="color: #0000cc;">this is the uniqueness argument that we can't return to traditional politics and recognize that borders are fluid [that's franco]</span><br />
<span style="color: #0000cc;">we don't think we an solve all the problems to solve all problems with debate, but we try tro get rid of the bad binaries going on and we respect difference</span><br />

<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Our 1AC affirms the topic from the zero zone which is produced by the fulfillment of the resolution. The argument is that whenever any logic, mission statement or even resolution is carried through to its fulfillment we find these places where logic reverses itself.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">There is a discussion in the aff of what happened in Edmond, the way that we were forced out of UCO when we said no to the sexual abuse and cover up by</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">I wasn’t - yet - recall that of someone incommensurably akin to myself there that day.. reduced to no-thing. Where? I don’t really know, nor possibly could, but it is</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">this place I will un-doubtably never forget. It was there – standing upon the doorstep of a year to come and a final season, fulfilling my journey as debater, I was confronted with a leveling event of absolute</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">singularity - one which debate itself had rendered me unable to comprehend and entirely unprepared… for it was only with the very fulfillment of debate as an activity</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">that I was revealed the entire make up of its cast of characters – the custodians and cohorts – attending to debates cultural memory - constantly at work to preserve</span><br />

<span style="font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">names. I can never be that person I was at UCO, but in speaking of that debater, recanting his encounters I retrieve a portion of his spirit which, even if</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">momentarily, affirm life itself absent all the vicitudes of a logic that seeks to save it.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">I am ashamed of what I tell them: that they should indeed worry about making an accusation because what they fear is likely to come true. Not one of the women I have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed out of the school by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control. Once you have been sexually encroached upon by a professor, your faith in your work corrodes. If the administration knew and did nothing—because the teacher was valuable to them—they had made a conscious calculation about his and our respective futures: It was okay to do nothing because I—and other young women who could be expected to remain silent—would never be worth what someone like Bloom was worth. … Then, more women began to call me, several of whom had followed the university’s grievance procedures and were dismayed with what they felt to be bureaucratic stonewalling, and even the use of the procedures to protect faculty and the university at the student’s expense. …. But sexual encroachment in an educational context or a workplace is, most seriously, a corruption of meritocracy; it is in this sense parallel to bribery. I was not traumatized personally, but my educational experience was corrupted. If we rephrase sexual transgression in school and work as a civil-rights and civil-society issue, everything becomes less emotional, less personal. If we see this as a systemic-corruption issue, then when people bring allegations, the focus will be on whether the institution has been damaged in its larger mission. The Catholic Church is a good example: The public understood that church leaders’ maintaining silence about systemic sexual transgressions corrupted the mission of an organization that had a great responsibility to society as a whole. Even the military is starting to understand that systemic sexual harassment of cadets corrupts its social mission. If we change the framework to this kind of transparency and accountability question, then instead of asking, “What were you wearing?” or “Why disrupt this man’s life?” we would ask: “What are we—together—going to do about it?”</span><br />
