Plan: The United States Federal Government should exempt foreign nationals with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and/or mathematics from numerical limits on the total number of available employment-based visas.<br />
<br />
Advantage One is Economic Leadership<br />
EB visa backlogs are driving the cost and delay of high skilled immigration inhibiting business activity &amp; retention<br />

<br />
The major problem faced by U.S. companies as a result of the EB immigrant visa backlogs is that many current and future employees are being deterred from working in the United States ? AND ?a delay ranging anywhere from a few days to several months could result.<br />
<br />
Retention is critical to U.S. economic leadership. Inevitable shortages in STEM workforce will destroy competitiveness and hinder every internal link to recovery and growth.<br />

Many indicators suggest that receiving countries? AND ? Canada?s liberal immigration laws made it easier for them to recruit qualified workers from around the globe.225<br />

<br />
But the growing pace of this power shift should be a cause of major concern for Americans, and it should raise serious questions about our economic policies at the highest level?AND ? and regaining our international leadership.<br />

Economic leadership prevents global economic collapse ? resiliency is only possible if US influence is sustained.<br />

<br />
Although the spread of nuclear weapons, with the corresponding increase in the likelihood that a nuclear shot would be fired in anger somewhere in the world? AND ? A world without the United States would in this way resemble a fleet of cars without gasoline.<br />
<br />
Collapse of the economy guarantees war and global instability.<br />

<br />
Comprehensive reform of the immigration scheme must also tackle the problems of the employment-based immigrant visa system? This creates a remarkably inefficient immigration scheme that profoundly inhibits the nation?s ability to retain the immigrants it needs to compete in the global economy.<br />
<br />
Advantage Two is Hegemony<br />
Competitiveness is critical to power projection. International developments in R&amp;D will decimate U.S. leadership if left behind.<br />

<br />
The United States' global primacy depends in large part on its ability to develop new technologies and industries faster than anyone else? the United States must get better at fostering technological entrepreneurship at home.<br />
<br />
Skilled immigration key to military dominance in R&amp;D?prevents tech diffusion from undermining hegemony.<br />

<br />
The key to this revolution in military affairs (RMA) has been the application of modern science and engineering?particularly in fields such as physics, chemistry, and information technology (IT)?to weapons design and use. ?AND ?The current Fortress America approach risks undercutting the nation's lead in science by keeping too many talented foreigners out.<br />
<br />
&lt;CARD CONTINUES SEVERAL PAGES LATER&gt;<br />
<br />
First, a great deal of American science remains autonomous despite increased international linkages?AND?, given the notorious weakness of the PLA in areas such as command, control, communications, and intelligence. [End Page 142]<br />

<br />
A Reverse Brain-Drain? AND?, the potential exists for a reverse brain-drain of skilled workers who contribute to U.S. global competitiveness.<br />

Science and Tech leadership allows for effective diplomacy which limits potential for conflict &amp; global threats.<br />

<br />
A second consequence of U.S. primacy is a decreased danger of great-power rivalry and a higher level of overall international tranquility? AND ? that being number one is a luxury they should try very hard to keep.<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is Clean Technology<br />
<br />
Limits on temporary workers &amp; students are collapsing business confidence in clean tech sectors. This is preventing start-up and innovation.<br />

<br />
Clean technology companies in the U.S. may find themselves in the unusual position of receiving federal stimulus funding while at the same time not being able to hire and retain key employees?AND? What are your hiring needs going into the balance of the calendar year?<br />
<br />
Increasing status quo numerical allocation encourages retention of all temporary workers and student &amp; sustains capital investment.<br />

STEM graduates of U.S. colleges and universities These results broadly describe how the federal budget and the economy are affected by caps on employment-based green cards and H-1B visas that keep foreign STEM graduates of American colleges and universities from remaining in the United States. ? AND ? Using estimating parameters over a wider range, the loss to federal revenues in 2008 was $2.3 to $11.1 billion.<br />
<br />
U.S. is running far behind in the clean tech race. Energy leadership facilitates international competition to meet energy demand and accelerates transition to an affordable cleaner world. This prevents warming?s most catastrophic consequences.<br />

The Clean Energy Race. What?s the biggest new industry that can boost America?s exports, grow the economy, create better jobs, and tap our innovative potential? ? AND ? which understands the importance of controlling its energy future. China?s commitment to developing clean energy technologies and markets is breathtaking.?<br />

Some uncertainty still exists about the magnitude of the changes under way? AND? He thinks the IPCC reports are far too conservative and that changes are coming much faster than suggested.<br />

<br />
HIV is a pandemic killer without a cure, and viruses such as Ebola-Zaire are merely a plane ride away from the population centers of the developed world ? AND ? They should be taken every bit as seriously as the concern for deliberate use of weapons of mass destruction.<br />
