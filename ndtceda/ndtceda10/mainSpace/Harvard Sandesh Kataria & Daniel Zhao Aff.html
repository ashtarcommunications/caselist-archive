Contention One is Science Diplomacy <br />
<br />
First-status quo efforts to buttress U.S. science diplomacy are growing but largely ineffective; reforming H-1B visa policy is the key internal link to actualizing the benefits of science diplomacy <br />

And, the lack of skilled immigration is driving the U.S. leadership decline while simultaneously fueling the growth of hegemonic challengers<br />

U.S. conventional weapons development and hegemony are at risk due to restrictions on foreign S&amp;T talent-the impact is loss of primacy and war<br />

Nationalism in all its forms …competition among nations and nationalist movements.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two is Science Diplomacy<br />
<br />
First-status quo efforts to buttress U.S. science diplomacy are growing but largely ineffective; reforming H-1B visa policy is the key internal link to actualizing the benefits of science diplomacy<br />

Contention Three is Solvency<br />
<br />
Exempting graduate students from the H-1B cap attracts the best S&amp;T talent, solving competitiveness<br />
Ante ’04 (Spencer, computers editor for Business Week, Business Week, March 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2004/nf2004032_4623_PG2_db047.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2004/nf2004032_4623_PG2_db047.htm</a>)<br />
KEEPING THE BEST. One of the strongest arguments …not counted against the cap.<br />
<br />
Moreover the plan sends a signal to prospective H-1B beneficiaries, attracting foreign S&amp;T youth to U.S. universities, buttressing overall research systems<br />
Ed Frauenheim, Staff Writer CNET News, 6 August ’04 (Brain drain in tech's future?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.cnet.com/Brain-drain-in-techs-future/2100-1008_3-5299249.html?tag=mncol;txt" rel="nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/Brain-drain-in-techs-future/2100-1008_3-5299249.html?tag=mncol;txt</a>)<br />
Discussion about … exempt from the program's annual cap.<br />
<br />
And, even if current H-1B caps aren’t being met now is a critical time to send this signal to current and prospective foreign advanced degree candidates in the U.S.<br />

Schupf Professor of Economics and Far Eastern Studies, Colgate University, May ’10 (Quotas and Quality: The Eﬀect of H-1B Visa Restrictions on the Pool of Prospective Undergraduate Students from Abroad)<br />
The H-1B visa oﬀers many … distribution has changed in response to policy.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the plan sends a signal to businesses necessary to S&amp;T innovation to continue basing in the U.S.-the alternative is rampant offshoring risking competitiveness decline<br />

The emergine global race for talent; Journal of International Business Studies 40)<br />
However, in this paper we argue that talent is a … advanced and complex PD projects.<br />
<br />
And, even massively expanding the H-1B cap won’t solve-eliminating the advanced degree cap is necessary to avoid cumbersome stop-gap measures that only further delay gains in S&amp;T competitiveness<br />

This Note proposes the liberalization … of potential adverse consequences.<br />
<br />
These foreign-born U.S. educated workers are comparatively more innovative and critical to competitiveness than U.S. born students; expanding the H-1B cap is key<br />

More sanguine views of highly-… most were educated in the US.8<br />
<br />
Empirically studies demonstrate the plan is necessary to attract highly capable S&amp;T talent to U.S. industry-signaling to U.S. trained students is key<br />
