 Perm: The United States federal government should make EB visas available for nurses that requires the recipient to post bond with a regulated crediting institution in their home country. The United States federal government should ensure the value of migrant bonds and should instruct relevant law enforcement programs to cooperatively yield enforcement to bounty hunters. Relevant immigration and customs agencies should assist migrants in the bonding process and create a uniform streamlined process to help migrants navigate the bonding program. <br />
