3. Expectation of future amnesty and family reunification<br />
Orrenius and Zavodny, Federal Reserve Bank senior economist and policy advisor (respectively), Spring 2004<br />
[Pia Orrenius is a Senior Economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. She holds a Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California at Los Angeles, Her research focuses on Mexico-US migration, with particular emphasis on the effect of US immigration policy on unauthorized immigration; Madeline Zavodny is a Research Economist and Associate Policy Advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

Public Pol'y Rev. 21, l/n, accessed 8-6-10, mss]<br />
<br />
Amnesty should be viewed as part of a comprehensive reform of immigration policy, not as sufficient in and of itself. A fundamental problem with an amnesty is that it creates an expectation of future amnesties. Hopes of gaining legal status conditional on living or working in the U.S. for a certain period of time would likely encourage more undocumented immigration. In addition, an amnesty is likely to lead to larger undocumented flows as families reunify in the U.S. with members who qualified for legal status. If the U.S. goal is to discourage undocumented immigration, then policymakers need to consider other policies as well, including a guest worker program and tougher workplace enforcement.<br />

DADT repeal will pass-<br />
1. Extend the 1NC Maddow and Fehrenbach evidence- repeal will pass now- 2 reasons:<br />
A. Obama’s political capital- just as it looked like repeal would fail, Obama stepped into the breach to keep alive the possibility of repeal. His PC ensures passage- multiple positive signs- the vote being scheduled, Levin’s change-of-heart, placing it at the top of the December docket, all prove repeal will pass now.<br />
B. Late-breaking developments- political winds for DADT changed mid-day on the 18th with Obama’s new push - our evidence is from 11-18 or later and takes this into account- discount their old evidence.<br />
<br />
2. Will pass- repeal has momentum and support but PC is key- AND their evidence exaggerates<br />

<br />
Contention One: Our Interpretation<br />
<br />
A. Interpretation: Debate should be a site for contest over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a resolutional plan of action for the United States federal government to reform visa policy and defend that their policy should be adopted.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Our interpretation is Grounded in the Resolution<br />
1. The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon—the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters<br />
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing 2k<br />
<br />
Use of a colon before a AND the colon with a capital letter.<br />
<br />
2. The United States Federal Government is the one in D.C.<br />

<br />
should (shd) AND You should send her a note.<br />
<br />
C. Violation –<br />
1. Having a plan is necessary but not sufficient-the plan must be defended for the entirety of the round and debate should ONLY be a contest about the implementation and adoption of a clear policy proposal. The affirmative fails to defend the consequences of implementation of a plan carried out by the United States federal government to reform visa policy.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Reasons to Prefer<br />
<br />
Resolution centered debate is critical to a fair debate – it’s a voting issue.<br />
<br />
1. Predictability-<br />
A. the resolution sets the topic for discussion- allowing the aff to choose their ground outside of the resolution makes it impossible for the negative to engage the affirmative. There are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies unrelated to the topic which are impossible to predict<br />
<br />
B. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, enabling the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Implementation-the aff will always win the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract- we can only debate the merits of arguments if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Harvard Carr Center for Human Rights Policy director and human rights practices professor, 04 (The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror, 20-21)<br />
There are two problems with a perfectionist AND human right, and thus respect for one right might lead us to betray another.<br />
<br />
D. Unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that allows us to critically examine their approach- this prevents informed clash which outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously examining it.<br />
<br />
E. The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion<br />
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 181-2)<br />
<br />
The requirements given thus far are primarily AND <span style="background-color: yellow;"> it</span>. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
2. Education- our framework solves fundamentalism and orthodoxy. Debate is progressive and not committed to an unethical ideology<br />
English et al, Schenley Park Debate Authors Working Group scholar, 7<br />
(Eric, Stephen Lano, Gordon Mitchell, University of Pittsburg communications professor, Catherine Morrison, John Reif, and Carly Woods, “Debate as a Weapon of Mass Destruction,” June 2007, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Egordonm/JPubs/EnglishDAWG.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/EnglishDAWG.pdf</a>) atw<br />
<br />
It is our position, however, that rather than AND age of orthodoxy, and reflexivity in the face of fundamentalism.<br />
<br />
B. Exploding predictable limits neutralizes the discursive benefits to debate and renders their advocacy meaningless—only our interpretation preserves the revolutionary potential of a deliberative activity<br />
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 180)<br />
<br />

C. Policy debate strategies are necessary to solve oppression- voting affirmative would be an empty symbol<br />

C. STANDARDS<br />

2. Ground. Takes away the best ground on the topic by forcing the neg to defend current policy as opposed to negating the positive expansion of eligibility<br />
<br />
3. Extratopicality. The USCIS lists visa name-number categories according to the 4 groups in the topic. If the aff grows one of those government-listed categories, they are topical. Their interpretation would allow them to remove admissibility standards that relate to any category of visa. This is extratopical, and makes it impossible for the judge to make an objective determination of jurisdiction, which is unfair to both sides.<br />

D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and communication. It’s a game of competing interpretations<br />

Counterplan: The United States Federal Government should allow noncitizens to purchase Legal Permanent Residence or temporary residence from United States citizens, requiring that:<br />
where citizenship is sold, the seller loses United States citizenship and the buyer becomes a Legal Permanent Resident, including the right to live and work in the United States for the rest of the buyer’s life, but not the rights exclusively reserved for citizens such as the right to vote or sit on a jury;<br />
where temporary residence is sold, the seller abdicates residency rights and leaves the United States for the period of the exchange, and the buyer receives the benefits due a nonimmigrant temporary worker;<br />
the seller must receive the payment at a United States embassy in the country where the seller relocates;<br />
a Citizenship Exchange Bureau be established to facilitate the exchange and interaction of participants with brokers;<br />
and, buyers have the option of obtaining a loan for residency purchase if and only if they can demonstrate they have sufficient skills and/or knowledge to repay the purchase.<br />
