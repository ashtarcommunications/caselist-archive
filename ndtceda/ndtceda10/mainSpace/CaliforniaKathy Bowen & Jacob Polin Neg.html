The central question in this year’s topic is one of hospitality. The affirmative’s expression of this gesture is banal and conditional – Their political affirmation is contingent on the law, economic exchange, and cultural differences. This is incompatible with true hospitality, resulting in violence.<br />

The United States federal government should lower the cap on H1B visas to zero<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer provisional visas to foreign specialty occupation workers and fashion models who aren’t considered inadmissible under §212(a) of the I.N.A. and U.S.C.I.S. regulations. The number should be equivalent to a lifting of the cap on H-1B visas. A worker with a provisional visa would be admitted to the United States for three years, and could renew his or her visa one time by demonstrating payment of all direct and indirect taxes; the maintenance of a clean criminal record; and acquisition of English language ability during the initial visa period. At the end of the second period the worker would have the option to transition to permanent status by applying for an available green card, without employer sponsorship. Twelve months after the worker initially took up employment, the visa would be portable, allowing him or her to change employers without applying for a new visa.<br />

Provisional visas solve the case and avoid the disads – they are more attractive to the best and brightest international workers without the inefficiencies of H1B’s<br />

The United States federal government should allocate visas to graduates from universities in the United States who hold an advanced degree in science or technology who are ineligible or otherwise excluded because of numerical quotas on employment based visas from those given to family members who receive employment based visas because of a relative’s profession beginning with married adult siblings, then married adult children, then adult siblings, then adult children.<br />

The United States federal government should not eliminate the cap on advance degree exemptions for specialty occupation temporary worker visas unless the government of India agrees to substantially reduce its tariffs on cars imported from the United States. The amount of the tariff reduction should be determined using Matoo’s economic values ratio of 375 workers making 40,000 to 1,000 cars worth $15,000 adjusted for inflation and changes in relative economic status as a guidline. The United States federal government should advocate this position in negotiations with India. <br />
