Nothing new, other than different alt texts and alternative cards that have been read:<br />
<br />
Most recent alternatives for the Visa K:<br />
The alternative is to vote negative to refuse the affirmatives endorsement of EB visa’s in favor of the methodological criticism of the 1NC. <br />
Banerjee 2010 (Payal, ass’t prof in sociology at Smith College, Women’s Studies Quarterly 38 1&amp;2 project muse, MB)<br />
Given the visa-related life circumstances…. and manipulation encoded within the visas. <br />
We must refuse the biopolitical tattooing of the body required by the visa system, if we do not than it will guarantee the destruction of humanity through administrative rationality and the camp.<br />
Agamben 2008 (Giorgio, “No to biopolitical tattooing” Communication and Critical studies, Vol. 5, No. 2, 2008, 201-202, MB)<br />
The newspapers have made it clear… this is why we must oppose it. <br />
The alternative is to refuse the affirmatives attempt to categorize, this is necessary interruption into the discourse of immigration that attempts to divide the population into the worthy and the unworthy.<br />
Ajana 06 (Btihaj, Journal for Cultural Research, Volume 10, Issue 3 July 2006, pages 259-273, “Immigration Interrupted.” MB)<br />
In recent years, the issue of immigration … intentionality of absolute separation. <br />
