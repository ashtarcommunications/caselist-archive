B. Violation --- they claim advantages that are independent of the plan<br />

C. Reasons to prefer:<br />
<br />
1. Predictable limits --- the grammar of the resolution is based upon enacting a policy. They justify arbitrarily changing the question of the debate to an infinite number of potential frameworks, ensuring the Aff always wins. Grammar is the only predictable basis for determining meaning; it’s the foundation for how words interact. Ignoring it justifies changing the focus of the debate, mooting the resolution altogether.<br />
<br />
2. Ground --- advantages that aren’t linked to the outcome of the plan are impossible to negate. They can claim “critical” arguments outweigh disads linked to the plan or shift their advocacy to avoid impact-turns.<br />
<br />
3. Plan-focus --- critical frameworks change the role of the ballot from a yes / no question about the desirability of the plan to something else. This undermines the singular logical purpose of debate: the search for the best policy. Logical policymaking is the biggest educational impact --- any other learning is worthless because it can’t be applied to the real world.<br />

D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness and outweighs all other issues because without it, debate is impossible<br />

The United States Supreme Court should rule on substantive due process grounds that ex post facto deportation of immigrants is unconstitutional. The United States Congress should declare that the state has no compelling interest in defining “the family” in order to restrict beneficiary eligibility for family based visas and eliminate all definitions of “the family” that restrict beneficiary eligibility for family based visas. We’ll clarify.<br />

Now, the conventional wisdom is that the world is rapidly approaching the end of the unipolar system with the United States as the sole superpower. A dispassionate look at the facts shows that this view understates<br />
…<br />
productivity in the foreseeable future. The world is and will long remain a 1 + x world, with one superpower and x number of major powers. A shift from 1 + 3 to 1 + 4 or 5 or 6 would have many important consequences, but it would not change the fact<br />

Other proponents of U.S. political and military leadership do not point to particular benefits; instead, they warn of near-certain disaster if the United States relinquishes its leadership role. Christopher paints a bleak picture: Just consider what the world would be like without American leadership in the last two years<br />

interests are not at stake, instability itself becomes a serious problem only if the United States blunders into it, as it did in Somalia and Bosnia. [59<br />

Competitiveness is strong and resilient<br />
Engardio 8 (Pete, Senior Writer – Business Week, “Is U.S. Innovation Headed Offshore?”, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, 5-8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/may2008/id2008057_518979.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/may2008/id2008057_518979.htm</a>)<br />

To those worried about America's ability to compete in the 21st century, the trend is alarming: Just as key manufacturing industries fled offshore in the 1970s and '80s, U.S. companies are now shifting more<br />
…<br />
more, industry clusters involving companies, universities, and venture capital are so well-established—such as San Diego and Cambridge, Mass., in biotech—that it will take many years for other nations to replicate them.<br />

Not key to heg or the economy<br />
Krugman 94 (Paul, Professor of Economics – Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “Competitiveness: A Dangerous Obession”, Foreign Affairs, March / April, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, his diagnosis was deeply misleading as a guide to what ails Europe, and similar diagnoses in the United States are equally misleading. The idea that a country's economic fortunes are largely determined by its success on world markets is a hypothesis, not a necessary truth; and as a practical, empirical matter, that hypothesis is flatly wrong. That is, it is simply not the case that the world's leading<br />

public policy. Thinking in terms of competitiveness leads, directly and indirectly, to bad economic policies on a wide range of issues, domestic and foreign, whether it be in health care or trade.<br />

Current high-skilled workers solve<br />
Lowell 10 (Lindsay, Director of Research – Institute for Study of International Migration – Georgetown University, “A Long View of America’s Immigration Policy and the Supply of Foreign-Born STEM Workers in the United States”, American Behavioral Scientist, 53(7), p. 1029-1044, Ebsco)<br />
<br />
This is not the place for elaborating on the hotly debated issues of the supply of natives, but suffice it to say that there are solid reasons to believe, pace concerns about the educational pipeline, that America is producing a large crop of natives quite able to pursue STEM careers (Lowell &amp; Salzman, 2007). The same<br />

immigration. America should be courting the “best and the brightest,” and that will take carefully thought out and new admission processes. That goal will not be met by insisting, given their evident ample supply, that ever more immigrants are required.<br />

No tech labor shortage<br />
Matloff 7 (Norm, Professor of Computer Science – UC Davis, “Fixing Our Badly Broken H-1B Visa and Employer-Sponsored Green Card Programs”, 9-19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cwalocal4250.org/outsourcing/binarydata/PrevWage.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cwalocal4250.org/outsourcing/binarydata/PrevWage.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The H-1Bs Are NOT Hired to Remedy a Tech Labor Shortage The constant cry of the industry lobbyists that the tech industry cannot find qualified workers is clearly false: • No government or private study (other<br />

than the longest job held or occupation in which he or she trained and is actually looking for work. This means an individual with experience as a computer programmer who is seeking a programming job, but who last worked as a cashier, is classified as an unemployed cashier, not an unemployed programmer... Of course, the same is true if the person is currently working as a cashier too.<br />

Alt causes ---<br />

<br />
The US has also ceded the high ground to Europe and Japan in a broad range of other sustainable technologies. For instance, 11 companies produce 96% of medium to large wind turbines; only one, GE, is based in the United States, with a<br />

based on military and fossil fuel production to one based on electric transportation and the generation of renewable electricity.<br />

B) Broadband<br />
Wagner 9 (Mitch, Executive Editor – Information Weekly, Quoting Kevin Werbach, Leading Expert on Business Implications of Internet and Communications Technologies, “Internet Faces Threat of Breaking Apart”, Information Week, 6-11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/06/internet_faces.html;jsessionid=YIHLF" rel="nofollow">http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/06/internet_faces.html;jsessionid=YIHLF</a> WMXHUZTIQSNDLRSKHSCJUNN2JVN)<br />

Also during the brief time Werbach got to speak, he talked about the U.S. lagging other developed countries in broadband penetration. Like net neutrality, the U.S. lag in broadband penetration has been<br />

Turn --- leaks --- plan causes them --- crushes our tech advantage<br />

<br />
There are also potential benefits to the U.S. when the foreign students graduate from their science-based programs of study. If they return to their country of origin or to a third country, they carry with them links<br />
…<br />
whether or not there are foreign students. These ideas get disseminated rapidly in international conferences, working papers, technical journals, and most recently, electronic publication.<br />

<br />
Problems with the Bubble-Driven Growth of the Past<br />
Despite the American economy's historic strength, our economic growth has rested for too long on an unstable foundation. Time and again, explosive growth in one sector of our economy provided a short-term boost while masking long-term weaknesses. In the 1990s, the technology sector climbed to unprecedented<br />
