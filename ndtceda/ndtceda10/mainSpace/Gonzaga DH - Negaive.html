 Immigration policy is biopolitical in essence because it decides on the question of which bodies are or are not desirable for living within the borders of the US. The origin of this biopolitical configuration is our relationship to life and the political: the very process by which the affirmative justifies itself against the status quo is violent because it operates via the reduction of Life to instrumental value. A politics of integration quickly becomes a politics of consumption whereby we commodify and distribute the difference of immigrants into the smooth functioning of the biopolitical machine.<br />
<br />
Rather than their conception of life as a force to be controlled, we propose to problematize the normative regime whereby life is drained of its ethical significance.<br />
