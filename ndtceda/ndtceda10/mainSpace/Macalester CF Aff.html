<strong><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Despite its Practical Non-Existence and its Theoretical Inadequacy, Immigration Law is Focused Around a Specific Definition of Family Structure—Its Priority is the Sustenance and Support of a Problematic Model Which Demonizes All Other Attempts at Definition—Current Challenges Focus on the Question of the Specific Family, Rather than the General Category of Family Crucial to Produce Any Real Opposition </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">These Immigration Restrictions are a Not-So-Subtle Attempt to Regulate the Function and Structure of the Family Unit—Maintaining Such Definitions Prevents Us From Adequately Investigating the Notion of Definition that Decides What Relationships Are or Are Not Valid </span></strong><br />
