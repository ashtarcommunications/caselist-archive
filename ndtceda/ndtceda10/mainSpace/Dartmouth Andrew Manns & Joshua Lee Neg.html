<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> </span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;">Topicality is essential for deliberative debate. If the affirmative is not tied to a plan and its effects, then there is no limit on their potential advocacy. The negative could never be prepared to debate all the possibilities, and good debate becomes impossible.</span><br />

The requirements given thus far are ...on some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"> </span><br />
Decision calculus becomes unstable without the policy issues. Policy debates always involve the stock issues and those are the basis for decisions. What are the stock issues in non-policy debates? What are the lines of argument? How are the debates to be decided? Without a basis for argument and decision, debate is impossible.<br />

Attempts to fashion proposals and programs ...vehicle for federal corporate governance initiatives.<br />
<br />
Stable advocacy – Stable advocacy is essential for clash. More concrete ideas like a plan can be debated, but the aff position is unclear and amorphous. It can become a moving target that the affirmative can use to avoid clash. Permitting the affirmative to endorse ideas other than a plan lets the affirmative explain, distinguish, and otherwise formulate their claims so as to avoid arguments no matter what we say. This essentially gives the aff infinite intrinsicness arguments. There can be no debate.<br />
<br />
Balance – Debate about a topical plan limits the affirmative to what the government might be able to do. There can be balanced debate about the desirability of policy action. Absent this focus, there is a shift to individual and social perspective, and balanced debate becomes impossible . There isn't much the negative can say against considering other perspectives, taking more ideas into account, experiencing more, or being a better person. The same is true at a social level. Who would deny that we should be more considerate of others or of our environment. Ultimately, these calls are nothing more that use of private fiat, and the affirmative can advocate our all loving one another and living in perfect harmony. <br />

C. The affirmative interpretation is bad for debate<br />
Limits are necessary for negative preparation and clash. Small increases like the affirmative make the topic too big. The negative can never have case specific answers and links on all the possible cases they would permit. Our competing interpretation is superior.<br />

 <br />
_(scream)_<br />
The horrors the affirmative identifies are not isolated incidents but are manifestations of a world system that cannot be named but has gone terribly awry. Unspeakable miseries are so prevalent as to remind us that particular solutions are no longer sufficient. We can no longer comfortably seek remedy to global injustice in familiar institutions, political strategies, or modes of thought. Rather, the beginning point for any radically revolutionary reflection must be absolute negativity – dissonance finds expression in a scream.<br />
<strong>Holloway, 2005.</strong> John <strong>,</strong>lawyer, Marxist-oriented sociologist and philosopher, [<em>Changing the World Without Taking Power.</em> Libcom.]<br />
In the beginning is the scream...is what we must cling to.<br />
<br />
Therefore, vote negative to embrace to the scream as the only starting point for an alternative to a world so wrong. The scream is simultaneously an expression of horror and that of hope. It reveals the wrongness of the world while also hinting at the possibility of another. The scream reveals the contingent existence of alternative worlds within the status quo. It reveals and exploits the tension between what is and what ought to be. Though it depends on no guarantee of success, it is this critical and negative gesture toward the non-identity of the present, the possibility of a more just future contained within the very DNA of the status quo that marks the critical potential of the absolute refusal symbolized by the scream.<br />

 <br />
1. The 1AC’s introduction of death impacts into debate is bad.<br />
A) Trivialization. Death debating causes an aesthetic fascination with the spectacle of death. This turns debate into a death cult and denies the choice to avoid death impacts.<br />
Jean <strong>Baudrillard</strong>, Dartmouth BM Hack, ’<strong>93</strong> (Symbolic Exchange and Death trans Iain Grant, p. 185-7)<br />
Pursued and censured everywhere, death ...put an end to political economy.<br />
<br />
B) Body Counts. Death debating reduces peoples’ lives to mere numbers for debaters to consume in their game.<br />
Jean <strong>Baudrillard</strong>, Dartmouth BM Hack, ’<strong>93</strong> (Symbolic Exchange and Death trans Iain Grant, 162-3, 173-5, “manpower” is left deliberately in)<br />
2. More importantly, that ...consumption in social input and output?<br />
<br />
2. Vote neg because the aff introduced death impacts into the debate.<br />
Austin <strong>Kutscher</strong>, President of the Foundation of Thanatology and Professor – Columbia University, ’<strong>80</strong> (Death &amp; Existence, p. Foreward)<br />
Within the educational setting, interdisciplinary ...to humankind, collectively and individually.<br />

3. This is a gateway argument about how we should be allowed to debate. If they win that we can use death impacts, then the rest of the 1NC applies. We will not make cross-applications from other flows to prove the link.<br />
