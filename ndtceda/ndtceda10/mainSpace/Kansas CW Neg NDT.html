 <span style="display: block; text-align: left;">The borderland represents a site of anxiety about foreignness.

<strong>The Opression of Women and relegation of reproduction to the private sphere are not ahistorical products of sexism or patriarchy, but rather are historical productions of the emergence of a classed society founded on the logic of surplus accumulation. This shift from necessity to surplus solidified the pre-existing division of labor based on need and then sexed it to justify inequality</strong><br />
Cloud, 2003<br />
(Dana, “Talk for regional socialist Conference”, “Marxism and Opression”, 4.19)<br />
<br />

<strong>THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A FUNDAMENTAL MISREADING OF POLITICS AND THE REPRODUCTION OF SOCIAL RELATIONS. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ‘BIOPOLITICAL STATE’ THAT SEEKS TO MANAGE AND CONTROL POPULATIONS FOR THE SAKE OF POWER. THE STATE AND CAPITAL MOVE HAND IN GLOVE—ONE CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT THE OTHER. ONLY A TOTAL DISTANCE FROM THE MODERN STATE CAN ALLOW FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF CAPITAL. OTHERWISE WHAT IS PUSHED OUT THE DOOR ONLY COMES BACK IN THROUGH THE WINDOW</strong><br />
MESZAROS (Prof. Emeritus @ Univ. Sussex) 1995<br />

The modern state … remaining faithful to the Marxian concern with the ‘withering away’ of the state.<br />
<br />
<strong>First, this is just liberalism the sequal, even if you change some of the coordinates of liberal politics, your method still replicates a liberal ontology of autonomous individuals free to self-determine, but also free to exploit the working class.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Second, you don’t emancipate people, you just expand the capitalist class – this neoliberal world in which everyone has the right to be an ‘entrepreneurial actor’ levels everything to the instrumental logic of the market</strong><br />
Brown, 03<br />
(Wendy, “Neo-Liberalism and the end of liberal democracy”) <br />
<br />
3) The extension of economic rationality to formerly…indeed no meaning outside the market.<br />
<br />
<strong>Further more, the absence of structural historicism is no mere oversight, nor is it enough to simply mention economics in a few of your cards – the reliance on identity based politics is not an accidental instance of ignoring class. The demand arises out of the crisis of liberalism – such politics particularize the oppression of capitalism to the point of the universal system is naturalized. Attaining white, male bourgeoisse privilege becomes the bench mark of political success, re-entrenching the very foundation of the system</strong><br />
Brown, 93<br />
(Wendy, “wounded attachments”, )<br />
<br />
Although this détente between…to the explicitly politicized marking<br />

<strong>FINALLY, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN ETHICAL ACTION THAT STANDS OUTSIDE OF POLITICS—YOUR ETHICAL DEMAND TO COME PRIOR TO THE STRUCTURAL NEGATION OF CAPITAL IS THE LARGEST VIOLATION OF ETHICS</strong><br />

 <strong>The aff may talk a good game on the permutation, but their appropriations is merely an attempt to disarm Marxism of its radical potential as well as masking the fundamental contradiction of surplus-labor – this is why you cannot permute a method – it strips out all of the conceptual theory that allows us both to understand the world and create a praxis to end opression</strong><br />
TUMINO (Prof. English @ Pitt) 2001<br />

<strong>Particularization of Identity localizes knowledge which erases any system theory that allows us to see how many different contextualized oppressions are subordinated to the same framework – we must abandon this method of knowledge in favor of a historical lens that renders capitalism visible</strong><br />
