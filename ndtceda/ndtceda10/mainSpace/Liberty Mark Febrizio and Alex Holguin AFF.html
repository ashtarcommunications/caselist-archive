Observation 3: The Iconic Victim<br />
<br />
1. Current TVPA envisions an iconic victim which requires cooperation with law enforcement<br />

<br />
The regulations and agency implementation of the … requirement of the LEA endorsement. 170<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The requirement to cooperate with law enforcement forms the concept of a passive iconic victim. The current legislation only provides for completely blameless victims. This focus leaves no room for victims of psychological coercion, who may take measures to deal with their situation.<br />

<br />
The iconic victim concept is shaped not only by … or psychological, exerted by the trafficker.<br />

4. Focusing on only sex trafficking and the iconic female victim excludes male victims and entrenches patriarchy.<br />

Patriarchy, as an Up-Down system of power-over relationships … connections in regional, national, and global contexts.<br />

<br />
THE HUMAN TENDENCY toward, and preparations for … it is by far our most serious flaw.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan Text:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should eliminate the cap on T-1 visas and expand the beneficiary eligibility of the T-1 visa by removing the “extreme hardship” requirement, the requirement to prove the applicant was subject to “severe” forms of trafficking, and the requirement to cooperate with law enforcement for persons who have been trafficked.<br />
<br />
Observation 1: The Iconic Victim<br />
<br />
1. Current TVPA envisions an iconic victim which requires cooperation with law enforcement<br />
Srikantiah, Stanford Law School Associate Professor, 2007<br />
(Jayashri, Associate Professor of Law and Director Immigrants’ Rights Clinic Stanford Law School, &quot;Perfect Victims And Real Survivors: The Iconic Victim In Domestic Human Trafficking Law,&quot; Boston University Law Review Vol. 87:157, 2-1-2007, accessed 12-28-2010, mtf)<br />
<br />
The regulations and agency implementation of the … requirement of the LEA endorsement. 170<br />
<br />
<br />
2. The requirement to cooperate with law enforcement forms the concept of a passive iconic victim. The current legislation only provides for completely blameless victims. This focus leaves no room for victims of psychological coercion, who may take measures to deal with their situation.<br />
Srikantiah, Stanford Law School Associate Professor, 2007<br />
(Jayashri, Associate Professor of Law and Director Immigrants’ Rights Clinic Stanford Law School, &quot;Perfect Victims And Real Survivors: The Iconic Victim In Domestic Human Trafficking Law,&quot; Boston University Law Review Vol. 87:157, 2-1-2007, accessed 12-28-2010, mtf)<br />
<br />
The iconic victim concept is shaped … psychological, exerted by the trafficker.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. The iconic victim concept distorts the proper view of trafficking victims. The plan alters the concept through its provisions, creating a more complete anti-trafficking approach.<br />
Srikantiah, Stanford Law School Associate Professor, 2007<br />
(Jayashri, Associate Professor of Law and Director Immigrants’ Rights Clinic Stanford Law School, &quot;Perfect Victims And Real Survivors: The Iconic Victim In Domestic Human Trafficking Law,&quot; Boston University Law Review Vol. 87:157, 2-1-2007, accessed 12-28-2010, mtf)<br />
<br />
Domestic anti-trafficking efforts are currently … trafficking victims from immigration relief.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Focusing on only sex trafficking and the iconic female victim excludes male victims and entrenches patriarchy.<br />
Chuang, Assistant Professor of Law, 2010<br />
(Janie A., American University and Washington College of Law, &quot;Rescuing Trafficking From Ideological Capture: Prostitution Reform And Anti-Trafficking Law And Policy,&quot; University of Pennsylvania Law Review Vol. 158:1655, 5-1-2010, accessed 12-29-2010, mtf)<br />
<br />
The neo-abolitionist focus on sex-sector … more commonly seen as irregular migrants.<br />

5. Political change is critical to eliminate the hierarchical order perpetuated by trafficking.<br />

Balfour and Cadava, 2004<br />
(Ian and Eduardo, “The Claims of Human Rights: An Introduction.” South Atlantic Quarterly Spring/Summer 2004 pg. 279 Project Muse) ajc<br />
<br />
If the challenge of human rights is … therefore permanently urgent and necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. Dismantling patriarchy is a precondition to world peace – we have a moral obligation to oppose it in every instance <br />
Bergoffen, 2008<br />
(Debra B., Professor of Philosophy and a member of the Women's Studies and Cultural Studies programs at George Mason University, &quot;The Just War Tradition: Translating the Ethics of Human Dignity into Political Practices,&quot; Hypatia Vol 23.2, Spring 2008, Project Muse, accessed 3-3-11, mtf)<br />
<br />
Watching this postmodern turn to global … war tradition will remain elusive.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. Patriarchy is a “dysfunctional social system,” which leads to militarism and warfare<br />
Warren and Cady, 1994<br />
(Karen J. is a Ph.D. and Macalester College professor and Duane L. is a Professor of Philosophy at Hamline University, &quot;Feminism and Peace: Seeing Connections,&quot; Hypatia, Vol. 9, No. 2, Spring 1994, p. 4-20, accessed 12-29-2010, mtf)<br />
<br />
Patriarchy, as an Up-Down system of power-over … in regional, national, and global contexts.<br />
<br />
8. A World without Dignity is not one Worth living in. <br />
Callahan, 1973<br />
(Daniel, director of Institute of Society, Ethics, and the Life Sciences, The Tyranny of Survival, p.99-101)<br />
<br />
At the same time, however, we will … even survival will be taken away.<br />
