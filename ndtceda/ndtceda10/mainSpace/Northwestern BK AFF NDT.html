1AC--set up as a preempt to Emporia's usual arg; 2AC goes into much deeper explanation of these pieces of evidence<br />
<br />
First link is xenophobia<br />
H1B restrictions signral a xenophobic climate that deters migration and collapses the global trading system<br />
(Wadhwa 2009-Senior research associate @ Labor and Worklife Program, Harvard Law School, AMerica's Perilous Anti-Immigration Protectionism, Bloomberg, Business Week, April 15 2009, www.businessweek.com/technology/content/apr2009/tc20090415_771803.htm<br />
the xenophobia..technological innovation<br />
<br />
Excluding migrants on the basis of &quot;compassionate racism&quot; is ineffective and destroys their agency<br />
(Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?ID=324" rel="nofollow">http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?ID=324</a>)<br />

<br />
Plan=transnational economic diaspora--TURNS THEIR NATIONALISM ARGS<br />
(Jim Chen 2001, University of Minnesota Law School winter 2001, 10 Minn J. Global Trade 1)<br />
democracy should not...lack of heart<br />
<br />
Increasing US economic nationalism will collapse trade--prevents massive infusions of global capital that solves xenophobic nationalism and war<br />
(Jefferey E. Garten 2009, march 5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123577692593997401.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123577692593997401.html</a>)<br />
in the next...sustain itself<br />
<br />
Circular migration from the US diffuses ideas norms and institutions---challenges repression, corruption, and ineffective market governance globally<br />
(Michael Clemens 2009, &quot;skill flow: a fundamental reconsideration of skilled worker mobility and development&quot; CGD working paper 180)<br />
but cash gifts...for thirty years<br />
<br />
Second link is transnational circulation<br />
<br />
Increase h1bs are crucial to brain circulation--temporary migration fosters economic ties to home countries and information cycling that boosts the global econ<br />
(Annaless Saxenian 2002 &quot;Brain circulation: how high skill immigration makes everyone better off&quot; the brookings review, winter 2002, vol 20 no1 pp 28-31<br />

<br />
Labor mobility enables people to vote with their feet<br />
(Somain 2008, George Mason University School of Law, Mo. L Rev. 1247 Fall, 2008, B. Democracy. Foot voting, and the case for expanded right to entry, lexis)<br />
From the standpoint...valuable migrants<br />
<br />
H1B limitations are enacted by relatively priviliged racial elites who sustain their privileged postion by masking their selfishness<br />
(Paula Chakravartty, aapi nexus Vol 3, No. 2 Winter 2005)<br />
<br />
Engaging in policy making about immigration is key to achieving progressive immigration advances<br />
(Lahav and Guiraudon 2006, Actors and venues in immigration control: Closing the gap between political demands and policy outcomes&quot; West European Politics, 29:2, 201-223)<br />
the need for a...of immigration bureaucracies<br />
<br />
Topic engagement good<br />
(Boswell 2007, Theorizing migration policy: &quot;is there a third way?&quot; International Migration Review, Volume 41, Issue 1, pages 75-100, march 2007)<br />
the fragility of commitment..social explanation<br />
<br />
Protectionist barriers to labor mobility will become politically sticky<br />
(Lucie Cerna and William Hynes, 2-5-10, Globalization Backlash? The Influence of Global Governance in trade and immigration)<br />

<br />
h1b restrictions are based on claims that migrants are passive victims in need of rescue and threats to american wages and workers<br />
(Paula Chakravartty, aapi nexus Vol 3, No. 2 Winter 2005)<br />
the decline in the...american workers<br />
<br />
Students debating liberaling visa policy is good<br />

&quot;The economic crisis has led many Americans, including some lawmakers, to turn inward, preferring what they perceive as &quot; AND &quot;American companies rather than forcing them to locate their businesses elsewhere in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Foreign innovation is the linchpin of US military, economic, and diplomatic power—<br />

&quot;Power is what it always has been. It is the ability to get someone to do something they do not want to do by means of your &quot; AND &quot;American economy. A big problem for us in the last few years has been the perception that our economy is in decline. &quot;<br />
