Richmond Round 2 - Neg vs Mary Washington H1-B<br />
<br />
<br />
A. Link – Citizenship Law is a boundary dividing control that creates identity around American power.<br />
Duziak &amp; Volpp 5 (American Quarterly 57.3 593-594)<br />
<br />
On the coast, at the California-Mexico border …. Power in other parts of the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Borderlands constantly confront us not only geographically, but psychologically as well<br />
Feminist Studies ’87 (Borderlands, Preface)<br />
The actual physical borderland that I’m dealing …. Borders, life in the shadows.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the issue of the Borderlands to be worked through we must talk about it<br />
Anzaldua 87 (Borderlands pg. 73)<br />
Living in a state of psychic unrest …. A path/state to something else.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Impact – The narrative of the American identity as “the nation of Immigrants”/”melting pot” that welcomes and assimulates immigrants into American citizens is empirically contrasted by a history of racial oppression. Considering some persons as citizens and some as aliens or terrorists, the American identity is a paradox that creates a dehumanizing multi-racial hierarchy<br />
Duziak &amp; Volpp 5 (American Quarterly 57.3 593-610<br />
The shackled foot on the back cover of this volume …. “binds us as a nation in a multiracial hierarchy.”<br />
<br />
This dehumanization leads to an ever more destructive self hate and fear in mestizos<br />
Anzaldua ’87 (Borderlands, pg 45)<br />
There are many defense strategies …. Registers in our consciousness.<br />
<br />
In the borderlands there is no middle ground of harmony. At all times mestizos are put below that which is “normal”<br />
Ramlow ‘6 (“Bodies in the Borderlands: Gloria Anzaluda’s and David Wojnarowicz’s Mobility Machines” MELUS, Volume 31 (3), Fall p. 176-77)<br />
Anzaldua’s Latina women figuratively are …. Assert the connected crip- queer-mestiza/o consciousness.<br />
<br />
C. Alternative – Reject the duality of aff immigration and embrace the mestiza consciousness to break down duality between races, sexes, etc. within a new value system embedded in a culture of harmony<br />
Perez 5 (NWSA Journal 17.2)<br />
Decades ago Gloria Anzaldua …. in the borderlands.<br />
<br />
The Stories we tell in this debate round are our alternative coming alive<br />
Anzaldua (Borderlands pg. 67)<br />
My “stories” are acts encapsulated in time … towards a search for validation.<br />
<br />
Our switching of codes in this debate is a step towards affirming our mestizoness<br />
Anzaldua (Borderlands preface)<br />
The switching of “codes” …. From the new mestizas.<br />
<br />
<br />
We must speak about the history of mestizaje, for mestizos to become visible to white culture.<br />
Anzaldua 87 (Borderlands pg. 86-87)<br />
I am visable—see this Indian face …. In the images in our heads.<br />
<br />
They view globalization as an even flow around the world that can spread equally like a soft ocean tide. Its more like a violent WHITE water rapid, flowing only to certain white places and churning up all brown bodies that fall. Their naturalization of globalization cements it in our minds as inevitable, glossing over all the violence executed in the name of “helping” brown people take part in it. This impact turns all their “getting away from nationalism solves violence” stuff<br />
Ferguson 6 (Global Shadows, p. 48)<br />
This is assuredly not to say that … inequalities seen in human history to date.
