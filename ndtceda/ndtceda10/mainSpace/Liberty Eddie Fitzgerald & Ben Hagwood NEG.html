We begin our discussion by allowing Olaudah Equiano to describe his first experience with<br />
chattel slavery – America’s first example of immigration policy that still reverberates into today’s<br />
institutionalized society of White Supremacy using his own words and writings.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first object which… whipped for not eating…’<br />

<br />
This forgotten narrative of chattel slavery is critical to the current understanding of immigration law and<br />
policy – without it the notion of a permanent, quasi-citizen underclass and white privilege is reinforced,<br />
transporting the racism of our past into the present.<br />
<br />
Magee a Professor of Law at the University of San Francisco writes in 2009 (Rhonda V., “Slavery as Immigration?”, 9/22, http://<br />

<br />
Several questions, both… artificially low economic cost.<br />
<br />
And we can never see or act upon the present moment correctly until we analyze the ways in which<br />
the history of America has provided a veil of ignorance over the systematic investment of whiteness.<br />
Through this historical “presence of mind” we will be able correctly oppose the destructive consequences<br />
of whiteness. Therefore, we present the framework for this round as who best subverts white supremacy.<br />
<br />

Whiteness”, taken from White Privilege, pg 61-64). ef<br />
<br />
Whiteness is everywhere… the past half century.<br />
<br />
And not only is the broader political, cultural and socio-economic context in which we live White<br />
Supremacist, but also the debate community. We are taught to argue as if the world is given the luxury<br />
of treating life and death as a game. This abstraction from systematic problems teaches us to ignore the<br />
voices of the marginalized. The only solution is to infuse the debate community with perspectives and<br />
voices form the underside of history.<br />

Race From a Privileged Son., pg 32-36). ef<br />
<br />
The reason I call this…. other words, that I was white.<br />
<br />
And simply calling for change where we disprove of policy will not be enough to change them. The<br />
initial recognition of and criticism of White Privilege in our White Supremacist society is essential to<br />
reconstruct power on a broader base.<br />
<br />
McIntosh, feminist and anti-racist activist, 1988. (Peggy., associate director of the Wellesley Centers for Women, and a speaker and<br />
the founder and co-director of the National S.E.E.D. Project on Inclusive Curriculum (Seeking Educational Equity and Diversity)<br />
“White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack”, taken from White Privilege edited by Paula S. Rothenerg., pg. 101). ef<br />
<br />
One factor seems clear… systems on a broader base.
