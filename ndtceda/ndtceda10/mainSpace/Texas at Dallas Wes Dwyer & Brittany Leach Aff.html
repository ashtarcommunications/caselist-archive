<strong>The current federal framework allows law enforcement to control definitions of trafficking for T-visas, resulting in a narrow interpretation of beneficiary eligibility that excludes any survivors of trafficking or migrant sex workers who express agency, thus failing to conform to traditional discourses of disempowered victims</strong><br />

<strong><u>Subpoint B is Monstrosity</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The current anti-trafficking framework marks both victims and perpetrators for extrajudicial violence based on the rhetoric of criminalization which necessitates raids intended to “rescue” the de-humanized victims from the superlatively monstrous figure of the “trafficker”</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The root of this exclusionary discourse which conflates sex work and human trafficking is the inscription of monstrosity onto the bodies of marginalized subjects defined as inherently risky - neo-liberal and neo-colonial discourses of disease spread and women’s purity conceptually bind sex work, trafficking, and migration with risk, legitimating state-sponsored violence and biopolitical regulation which figures these “monsters” as only as transgressors and not as subjects of the law</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This discourse of monstrosity constitutes a normative basis for the right to kill the monster – criminalization rhetoric conjures a sexualized, gendered, and racialized spectacle of the enemy in contrast to the body politic in need of protection, justifying the state of exception and the exercise of absolute disciplinary power against the fictionalized enemy</span></strong><br />

<strong>The endpoint of the logic of the state of exception is that bare life becomes the rule and the law everywhere will suspend itself. This means the human body becomes a nomadic target for violence, reinscribing the sovereign power over life and death.</strong><br />

<u>Subpoint C is the Discourse of Immigration</u><br />
<br />
<strong>The dominant representations of transnational human trafficking have hardened into a ubiquitous anti-immigrant narrative that ultimately influences policy and its implementation – fantasmic fears of a foreign Other are constructed in contrast to the image of the innocent population in need of protection.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The portrayal of human trafficking through the paradigm of criminalization obfuscates the double rhetorical move behind the anti-trafficking narrative which prevents comprehensive assistance to exploited migrants – on the one hand, trafficked persons are cast as helpless victims of a horrific crime, robbing them of their agency; on the other, they are absorbed into the rising tide of xenophobic anti-immigrant rhetoric as dangerous foreign others who pose a threat to the labor market, social welfare system, and international security.</strong><br />
