 <br />
The President of the United States should issue an executive order that establishes a Standing Commission on Immigration and Labor. The Commission should be empowered to submit to Congress annual recommendations for adjustments to level, composition, and eligibility requirements for visas. Upon submission of a recommendation, Congress will have 90 days to reject or accept the recommendation, and adjust legislation accordingly. The Standing Commission should recommend to Congress that [The the US Government should adjust the cap on H1-B visas]. We’ll clarify.<br />
And the counterplan competes – the plan only happens if the recommendation is accepted and it makes visa allocations flexible, making any permutation severance. <br />
<br />
And the counterplan solves – it would allow for visas to be flexible according to labor levels, which best protects wages, competiveness, and economic growth<br />
