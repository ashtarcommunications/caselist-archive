Observation One: The Status Quo<br />
<br />
Family visa law reflects a biological nuclear family model which excludes all alternative family formations.<br />
<br />
King 10 (Shari M., Professor, University of Florida Levin College of Law; Co-Director, Center on Children and Families, Columbia Human Rights Law Review, Winter, 41 Colum. Human Rights L. Rev. 509)<br />
Although the paramount …the Americas. n6<br />
<br />
Furthermore, same-sex partners are excluded from spousal reunification, reinforcing hierarchies based on sexual orientation.<br />
<br />
Chacon ‘7 (Jennifer Marie, Acting Professor of Law- UC Davis, “Loving Across Borders: Immigration Law and the Limits of Loving”, Wisconsin Law Review, 2007 Wis. L. Rev. 345, GAL)<br />
The most readily …basis of sexual orientation.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, reunification for lawful permanent residents is subject to numerical caps, requiring some families to wait for over 15 years for reunification. Although facially neutral, these caps disproportionately affect the families of Asian and Latin immigrants.<br />
<br />
Chacon ‘7 (Jennifer Marie, Acting Professor of Law- UC Davis, “Loving Across Borders: Immigration Law and the Limits of Loving”, Wisconsin Law Review, 2007 Wis. L. Rev. 345, GAL)<br />
Immigration laws are not … by Congress.&quot; n111<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Family Reunification<br />
<br />
The destruction of familial bonds was a hallmark of slave status- breaking up families served to dehumanize slaves and destroy sources of social value other than the slavemaster. Contemporary U.S. immigration law mirrors this process by stratifying family reunification efforts according to citizenship status.<br />
<br />
Chacon 2008 (Jennifer M., Acting Professor, UC Davis, School of Law. “Citizenship and Family: Revisiting Dred Scott”, Washington University Journal of Law and Public Policy, 27 Wash. U. J.L. &amp; Pol'y 45, GAL)<br />
Of course, the theme … the Dred Scott decision.<br />
<br />
And, the status quo heteronormative governance of migrants is an assault on human dignity which endangers families and legitimizes racialized homophobia.<br />
<br />

(Eithne Luibhéid, “An Unruly Body of Scholarship”, A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Volume 14, Number 2-3, 2008 CB)<br />
The heteronormative governance of …immigration control is laid bare.<br />
<br />
This regulation of family formation devalues the family unit of the migrant, which is both historically and currently a critical element in perpetuating racial hierarchy.<br />
<br />
Chacon ‘7 (Jennifer Marie, Acting Professor of Law- UC Davis, “Loving Across Borders: Immigration Law and the Limits of Loving”, Wisconsin Law Review, 2007 Wis. L. Rev. 345, GAL)<br />
Contemporary immigration law …more subtle forms today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Devaluation of the migrant family unit fuels negative stereotypes which are used to justify even more restrictive measures. Barriers to family reunification have the effect of maintaining white supremacy.<br />
<br />
Chacon ‘7 (Jennifer Marie, Acting Professor of Law- UC Davis, “Loving Across Borders: Immigration Law and the Limits of Loving”, Wisconsin Law Review, 2007 Wis. L. Rev. 345, GAL)<br />
In Loving, the Supreme…difficult to love across borders.<br />
<br />
White supremacy is an ordering principle that produces hierarchies of difference, which are enforced through widespread violence and extermination of the other.<br />
<br />
Dylan Rodriguez, Professor, Dept. of Ethnic Studies @ University of California Riverside, November 2007<br />
(Kritika Kultura, Issue 9, “AMERICAN GLOBALITY AND THE U. S. PRISON REGIME: STATE VIOLENCE AND WHITE SUPREMACY FROM ABU GHRAIB TO STOCKTON TO BAGONG DIWA”, Available online at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ateneo.edu/ateneo/www/UserFiles/121/docs/kkissue09.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ateneo.edu/ateneo/www/UserFiles/121/docs/kkissue09.pdf</a>, Accessed 7/7/2009)<br />
<br />
Variable, overlapping, and … organic to its ordering.<br />
<br />
The modern world is dominated and controlled through a master logic of heteronormative whiteness. This privileges white, masculine, heterosexual men and maintains itself through war and imperialist domination.<br />
<br />
Winnubst 6, Shannon (Ph.D. in philosophy from The Pennsylvania State) Queering Freedom. p 5 AJM<br />
This is the domination …that this text moves.<br />
<br />
Finally, our advantage outweighs all other impacts: Racism must be rejected from both an ethical and utilitarian perspective- injustice makes violence and death inevitable.<br />
<br />
Memmi 2000 (Albert, Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ U of Paris, Naiteire, Racism, transl. Steve Martinot, p. 164, GAL)<br />
The struggle against …the stakes are irresistible.<br />
<br />
Plan Text: The Supreme Court of the United States will rule that spousal reunification provisions for family visas must include beneficiary eligibility for same-sex partners. The Supreme Court will rule that family reunification visas should be allocated to individuals who can demonstrate a status relationship with U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents akin to currently existing family-based categories. The Supreme Court will instruct relevant executive agencies to eliminate any backlog for immediate family members of citizens and lawful permanent residents, and rule that steps should be taken to ensure backlogs do not develop again. These rulings will be made on 14th amendment equal protection and due process grounds.<br />
<br />
Observation Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
Finally, recognizing a right to family integrity does not require totally open borders- it is about creating a baseline of rights protections for all persons in the United States.<br />
<br />
Chacon 2008 (Jennifer M., Acting Professor, UC Davis, School of Law. “Citizenship and Family: Revisiting Dred Scott”, Washington University Journal of Law and Public Policy, 27 Wash. U. J.L. &amp; Pol'y 45, GAL)<br />
Conclusions<br />
To date, the courts have rejected …character of such regulations.
