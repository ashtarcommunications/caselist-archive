VISA K<br />
US immigration policy is the lynchpin of the Empire. WHile the aff presents the myth of a mutually beneficial, win-win, situation between immigratnts and their countries- this is an oversimplification that serves to mystify the nature of US imperialism. Rather than benefirtting the immigrant, the primary consideration of the aff is how to extract value from the immigrant while maintaining national homogenity.<br />
Maria, 2008 (Sunaina, &quot;Flexible Citizenship/Flexible EMpire: South Asian Muslim Youth in Post 9/11 America&quot; American Quarterly, V.60 No. 3, Sept 2008)<br />
Visas are made conditional to protect the homeland from the possibility that strangers could be dangerous- this relies on an idealized construction of national identity that is inevitably turned outward against the other<br />
Kelly ‘6<br />
(Elaine, Media, Music &amp; Cultural Studies Macquarie U., Dec., Continuum, “White Hospitality: a Critique of Political Responsibility in the Context of Australia's Anti-asylum-seeker Laws,” Vol. 20 # 4)<br />
To be ready to welcome or to authorize … protect one's own hospitality. (Derrida, 2000, p. 53)<br />
The logic that we must protect a homogeneous social space culminates in the whole-scale elimination of populations and global warfare to maintain the sanctity of America<br />
Hoffmann ‘7<br />

In modern processes of government … Gypsies, homosexuals, Bolsheviks and other inassimilable elements.<br />
D. Vote negative to reject the use of visas as a starting point for inclusion and instead extend a negotiated welcome to those to whom the affirmative appeals.<br />
Our alternative seeks pure hospitality but recognizes the necessity and inevitability of its conditional opposite. We reject the violent conditional ethics of the plan and current visa system in favor of a struggle to bridge the aporia between conditional and unconditional hospitality.<br />
Bulley ‘6<br />
(Dan-, Review of International Studies, “Negotiating ethics: Campbell, ontopology, and hospitality”, Vol. 32)<br />
So far, a definition of hospitality has … understood in the inside/outside logic of IR.<br />

<br />
2. severance is a VI<br />

3. the inclusion of the aff with its nameable finite and specific conceptions of what the future should look like, forsakes messianic openness for messianim. there is no middle ground -- such a move inexorably collapses into fascist absolutism in the name of the just<br />

debate is a violent forum - the 1ac's use of irony is a joke but the subaltern isn't let in on it - calling it your performance allows the privileged to determine the truth of the world<br />
