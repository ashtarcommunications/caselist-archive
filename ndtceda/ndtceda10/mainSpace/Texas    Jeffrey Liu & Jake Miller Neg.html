a. interp: the aff must deliberate on teh resolution offering a reaction to its substance - the negatieve contests the choices of the 1ac.<br />
Resolved is an analytical reduction<br />
Should demands emotional reaction to past or present fact<br />
substantially means essential<br />
<br />
b. fiat is a voting issue<br />
1. explodes predictable limits - they defend a narrow example of the resolution - their refusal to deliberate on its essentials justifies an infinite number of plans<br />
2. fiate stifles deliberation- restricting debate to a referendum on the plan inhibits the creativity of political argumentation<br />
chambers 2006<br />
3. fiat gives them extra-topical ground - this is a voting issue because it allows them to bypass the realities of political deliberation<br />
4. extra t justifies neg counterplaning out the extra t plan parts. we no claim the plan as negative ground and kritiks of the rest of the 1ac as net benefits<br />
<br />
c. this is a voter for education<br />
fiat distorts rhetoric, which is the lynchpin of immigration policy deliberation. they subordinate the discussion to policy outcome<br />

 The word of the day is “attunement.”<br />
It is a frame of mind, a process of thinking-feeling-acting.<br />
How should you be in the world?<br />
How should you make policy?<br />
You are not a spectator. Deciding is thinking-feeling-valuing. You must first choose an orientation.<br />
What are you? Where are you? When is now?<br />
How and why should you decide?<br />
The outcome of that decision is the value of this debate.<br />
Question 1: Where are you?<br />
NOT AT THE CENTER. You float along the edge of a minor galaxy. A mass of rock hold you fast as you fly through space. You are part of an intergalactic ecosystem.<br />
Attune your ballot to this moment of wonder from Robinson Jeffers.<br />

Question 5: Why are you?<br />
Do you live to work, or work to live? Do you survive to exist, or exist to survive?<br />

Consequentialism is in a double-bind:<br />

<span style="font-family: Georgia;"> Or</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;"> B. They make distinctions about what kind of beings are more valuable than others, which allows our speciest assumptions to come through the back door.</span><br />

The capacity of nature to be different from us precedes all other sources of value. If humans survive, we will re-engineer everything—atoms, cells, ourselves, and even other planets. All natural Otherness from the molecular to the extra-terrestrial will be systematically eliminated. This the biggest impact.<br />
