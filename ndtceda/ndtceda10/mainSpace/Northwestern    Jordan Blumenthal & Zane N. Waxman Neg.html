<strong>We affirm that “Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude” should be interpreted solely as convictions of crimes of aggravated sexual assault for the purpose of restricting the eligibility of visa applicants</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
Our counter-advocacy solves the sovereign exclusion by providing a clear bright-line that limits “crimes of moral turpitude” solely to crimes involving aggravated sexual assault – this eliminates the arbitrary application of sovereign exclusions for all other “crimes of turpitude” and deters applications from those who have commited aggravated sexual assaults<br />

 The plan solves nothing –there are two times the U.S. uses moral turpitude to exclude immigrants – one is at the time fo the initial visa application. Two is deportat of immigrants that commit crimes of moral turpitude once they’ve been granted a visa. The aff only affects the first one, admissions decisions. <br />
<br />
This is true because of the topic---eligibility only refers to the immigrants’ ability to receive visas at the time of application --- particularly true of their plan because it only removes turpitude as a restriction on visa applicants, not visa holders<br />

The word “eligible,”…Parker v. Oliver, 84 N. E. 860, 862, 198 Mass. 488<br />
<br />
And true in the context of the plan---there’s a distinction between denying admission because of moral turpitude and deportation on those grounds<br />

<br />
This means they solve none of their case---moral turpitude can just be used to exclude people once they’re here – vote on presumption<br />
<br />
The “Moral Turpitude” restriction applies to both the application and removal process – the Aff only eliminates “moral turpitude” at the point of admission – proves zero solvency for the Aff because their advocacy is effecticely results in deportation<br />

 Crimes involving moral turpitude include felonies involving moral turpitude – the blanket term “crimes” in the plan means that they eliminate the exclusion on any crime defined as having an element of moral turpitude—which includes certain felonies—thus the plan eliminates felony restricts for felonies involving moral turpitude<br />

A defendant’s request…involving moral turpitude.<br />

The felony exclusion and the moral turpitude exclusion overlap---certain felonies are defined as felonies involving moral turpitude---which means the plan rolls back those felony exclusions too<br />

 The Neg’s exclusion does not produce a state of exception – by refusing to incorporate sex offenders into the sovereign grasp of the U.S. the Neg prevents the formation of a state of exception around the incarceration, castration, and registration of immigrant sex offenders.<br />
<br />
The CP blocks expansion of the state of exception – Harms proves that the CP limits the scope of “moral turpitude” exclusions to thte singular instance of sex offenders – that prevents expansion of the exclusion to include other groups<br />
<br />
Unconditional openness is not an ideal that can adjudicate between competing courses of action – true unconditional hospitality would be an openness so radical that it would cede any claim on responsibility and the Aff’s openness exposes itself to absolute violence at the hands of the stranger<br />

The distribution of visas as a political strategy for inclusion injects soverign adjucation into migration – turns the case by making all inclusion temporary and fleeting<br />
Mark Salter 08 – “When the exception becomees the rule: borders, sovereignty, and citizenship” Citizenship Studies v. 12 n. 4 August 2008 365-380 EBSCO<br />
Sovereignty is performed dialogically and reconstituted … citizenship claims grounded is capricious sovereignity.<br />
<br />
And, the use of sovereignty to regulate mobility condistions political community on a set of norms that are a pecondition for inclusion – causes war and geoncide in an effort to regulate and cleanse the population<br />
Andrew Norris 00 “Jean-Luc Nancy and the Myth of the Common” Constellations v. 7 i. 2 p. 272-95<br />
Nancy, however, is deeply suspicious … “This is what philosophy calls “finatutde.”<br />
<br />
Interrogating the affs strategy for political inclusion is a prior question to policy proposals. Delinking soverign from mobility and questioning the ontological suppositions of the plan solve the case better by creating an avenue for true emancipation for migrants.<br />
Welcha dn Panelli 07 “Questioning community as collecive antidote to fear: Jean-Luc Nancy’s ‘singularity’ and ‘being singlar plural’” Area v. 39 i. 3 p. 349-56 August 2007<br />
