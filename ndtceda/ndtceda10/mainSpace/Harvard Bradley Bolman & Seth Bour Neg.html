<strong>WESTERN MARXISM HAS FAILED AND CAPITALISTS EVERYWHERE ECHO THIS FAILURE. IT IS IN THIS STATE OF ABSOLUTE DESPAIR THAT WE MUST REASSERT THE COMMUNIST HYPOTHESIS – NOT AS AN END GOAL FOR NEW POLITICS, BUT AS THE STARTING POINT FOR A NEW PHILOSOPHICAL PROJECT. OUR ETHICAL OBLIGATION IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE STRUCTURAL CONTRADICTIONS OF CAPITALISM, EMPHASIZING THE EXCLUSION OF THOSE PARTS-OF-NO-PART OF SOCIETY LIKE THE IMMIGRANT INCLUDED ONLY IN THE BASEST TERMS.</strong><br />
Žižek ‘10 (Slavoj, Prof. of European Graduate School, Intl. Director of the Birkbeck Inst. for Humanities, U. of London, and Senior Researcher @ Inst. of Sociology, U. of Ljubljiana, The Idea of Communism, “How to Begin from the Beginning,” pgs. 209-224 bb) <br />
After enumerating the achievements and the failures of the Soviet state ... dynamic of capitalist power and the dynamic of resistance.6 <br />
<br />
<strong>TO ACT ACCORDING TO THE COMMUNIST HYPOTHESIS IS NEITHER TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STATE NOR MAKE SMALL LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. ONLY A POLITICS THAT ALTERS THE FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS OF THE STATE WILL AVOID BEING RECOMMODIFIED BY CAPITALISM</strong><br />
Žižek ‘10 (Slavoj, Prof. of European Graduate School, Intl. Director of the Birkbeck Inst. for Humanities, U. of London, and Senior Researcher @ Inst. of Sociology, U. of Ljubljiana, The Idea of Communism, “How to Begin from the Beginning,” pgs. 209-224 bb) <br />
Throughout the age of Really Existing Socialism, the secret hope ... of the social, of establishing new enclosures.<br />
<br />
<strong>CAPITALIST GROWTH IS NOT SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT GLOBAL REPRESSION, STARVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL DEVASTATION, AND VIOLENT WARS. THE TIMEFRAME IS FIVE YEARS, THE TIME TO FIND VIABLE ALTERNATIVES IS NOW.</strong><br />
Harvey ‘10 (David, Distinguished Prof. of Anthropology @ Graduate Center of City U. of New York, Top-20 Most Cited Authors in the Humanities, The Enigma of Capital, pgs. 215-223 bb) <br />
At times of crisis, the irrationality ... 2008 alone). So what, then, are the alternatives?<br />
<br />
<strong>BECAUSE OF CAPITAL, DREAM AND COUNTLESS ATTEMPTS AT AMNESTY HAVE FAILED. THE LIBERAL RESPONSE THAT SOME VISAS IS “GOOD ENOUGH” HAS ALREADY LOST. THE TRULY RADICAL GESTURE IS AN ABSOLUTE OPENNESS TO IMMIGRANTS</strong><br />
Žižek ‘9 (Slavoj, Prof. of European Graduate School, Intl. Director of the Birkbeck Inst. for Humanities, U. of London, and Senior Researcher @ Inst. of Sociology, U. of Ljubljiana, First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, pgs. 118-120) <br />
Furthermore, when we talk about anti-immigration ... monopoly on defining their own tradition.<br />
<br />
<strong>VISAS ARE VIOLENCE AGAINST ALTERITY PAR EXCELLANCE – THEY TURN THE US INTO A MASS PENITENTIARY. ANYONE WHO ENTERS IS MARKED FOR CONTROL AND DEPORTATION, SUBJECTED TO PERMANENT BIOPOLITICAL MANIPULATION.</strong><br />
Bigo ‘6 (Didier, Maître de Conférences des Universités IEP Paris, Visiting Prof. @ King's College War Studies, Scientific Coordinator of Challenge for CERI, Translation, Biopolitics, Colonial Difference, “Globalized (in)Security: the Field and the Ban-opticon” p. 5ff) <br />
For quite some time, the field of (in)security ... most mobile groups: the diasporas, migrants and, if the argument holds, tourists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>THE VISA MAINTAINS DIFFERENTIATIONS BETWEEN NOT JUST PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, BUT THE WORLDS THEMSELVES. THESE DIFFERENTIATIONS ARE CENTRAL TO VIOLENCE AND EXTERMINATION – THE ABILITY TO RENDER A GROUP DISPOSABLE IS THE BASIS OF POLITICS THAT NECESSITATES UNENDING WAR</strong><br />
Balibar ‘1 (Etienne, Emeritus Prof. of Philosophy @ U. of Paris X Nanterre and U. of Cal., Irvine, “Outlines of a Topography of Cruelty: Citizenship and Civility in the Era of Global Violence,” Constellations, Vol. 8.1) <br />
This paper is based on a talk which I was ... in the first instance, seem to be mainly “economic.”<br />
<br />
<strong>OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO REFUSE TO CATEGORIZE THE IMMIGRANT IN ORDER TO EMBRACE THE UNIVERSALITY OF ONE WORLD.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE VIOLENCE OF MODERN STATEHOOD, FROM STREET CHAOS IN PARIS TO DEMOCRACY-BY-FORCE IN IRAQ, DRAWS ITS ROOTS FROM DIVIDING EXISTENCE INTO DISTINCT WORLDS. THE VISA REGIME REGULATES ON A PRIOR ONTOLOGICAL LEVEL, AND OUR POLITICS MUST FIRST ANSWER THE QUESTION: WHAT WORLD ARE WE ACTING UPON AND WHO IS THE WE THAT ACTS? THE IMPERATIVE OF ONE WORLD MUST BECOME THE PRIOR AXIOM FOR ALL POLITICAL MOVEMENTS</strong><br />
Badiou ‘9 (Alain, Prof. @ European Graduate School, Former chair of Philosophy @ École Normale Supérieure, The Meaning of Sarkozy, pgs. 57-70 bb) <br />
Why has what the politicians and the servile press ... let us greet the foreignness of tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<strong>YOU SHOULD VOTE NEGATIVE AS AN AFFIRMATION OF THE COMMUNIST HYPOTHESIS. THIS IS A PREREQUISITE TO CALCULATIONS, A STRATEGY THAT REJECTS THE COMMUNIST HYPOTHESIS REJECTS THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE AND POSSIBILITIES FOR EQUALITY.</strong><br />
Badiou ‘9 (Alain, Prof. @ European Graduate School, Former chair of Philosophy @ École Normale Supérieure, The Meaning of Sarkozy, pgs. 97-103 bb) <br />
I would like to situate the Sarkozy episode ... we find ourselves in the history of this hypothesis.<br />
<br />
<strong>EQUALITY IS NOT A GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED BUT AN UNCONDITIONAL AXIOM FROM WHICH POLITICS MUST BEGIN</strong><br />
Barbour ‘10 (Charles, Department of Sociology @ U. of Alberta, “Militants of Truth, Communities of Equality: Badiou and the ignorant schoolmaster,” Educational Philosophy and Theory, Vol. 42, No. 2 th) <br />
While his work is often polemical, in considering ... it can never be practiced if it is axiomatically denied.<br />
<br />
<strong>THIS ROUND IS KEY – LET THE FIVE PERSON DISCUSSION BECOME A METAPHORIC CONDENSATION FOR THE HISTORICAL STRUGGLE FOR COMMUNISM. VOTING NEGATIVE MEANS THE BATTLE IS ALREADY WON.</strong><br />
Badiou ‘10 (Alain, Prof. @ European Graduate School, Former chair of Philosophy @ École Normale Supérieure, The Idea of Communism, pgs. 11-13 bb) <br />
We will now ask: why is it necessary to resort to this ... and the eternal consequences of an event.<br />

<strong>THE AFFIRMATIVE IS A CARNIVAL OF DIFFERENCE THAT WILL BE COMMODIFIED AND SOLD AS A NEW MARKET FOR CAPITAL’S INFILTRATION. DIFFERENCE AND IDENTITY CAN AND MUST ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD FROM A CLASS-BASED PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS KEY TO CREATING A SUCCESSFUL MOVEMENT</strong><br />
D’Annibale and McLaren ‘4 (Valerie Catamburio, PhD, chairs the Graduate Program in Communication and Social Justice at the University of Windsor, and Peter, professor in the Division of Urban Schooling, Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, UCLA, “The Strategic Centrality of Class in the Politics of &quot;Race&quot; and &quot;Difference”,” Cultural Studies &lt;=&gt; Critical Methodologies, Vol. 3, No. 2, 148-175 2003) <br />
Because post-al theories of difference often ... cultures and genuine toleration of differences?” (pp. 232- 233).<br />
<br />
<strong>THEIR MOVEMENT REFUSES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILTIY FOR POWER AND WILL ENDLESSLY OSCILLATE BETWEEN REPRESSION AND LIBERATION – ONLY THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT SOLVES</strong><br />
Badiou ‘10 (Alain, Prof. @ European Graduate School, Former chair of Philosophy @ École Normale Supérieure, pgs. 30-35 bb) <br />
We can see from all this that 'failing' ... study in this volume is devoted to it.<br />
<br />
<strong>RESIST THE URGE TO ACT, PARTICIPATION ENSURES THE SYSTEM IS REPRODUCED. OUR WITHDRAWAL CLEARS THE WAY FOR REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY.</strong><br />
Vighi &amp; Feldner ‘9 (Fabio, PhD, lecturer in Italian at the School of European Studies at Cardiff University, and Heiko, PhD, Lecturer in Modern German History at Cardiff University, “Pathological Attachments: Slavoj Zizek on Anticapitalism and Liberal Democracy,” Rethinking Marxism Volume 21 Number 2, April, p. 295-296) <br />
From this viewpoint, Zizek highlights what ... according to Zizek, politics proper comes into play.<br />
<br />
<strong>THE AFFIRMATIVE’S ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN FRAMEWORK OUTSIDE THE RESOLUTION IS AN INVESTMENT IN FANTASY. THE TRANSGRESSION OF CHEATING REINFORCES THE RULES’ PURPOSE AND HEGEMONY – YOU SHOULD ENDORSE THE CRITICISM TO OVER-IDENTIFY WITH DEBATE AND IN DOING SO, CREATE SPACE FOR THE CHANGES OF THE 1AC</strong><br />
Pelletier ‘5 (Caroline, @ Institute of Education @ University of London, “Reconfiguring Interactivity, Agency and Pleasure in the Education and Computer Games Debate – using Žižek’s concept of interpassivity to analyse educational play,” E–Learning, Volume 2, Number 4) <br />
Interpassivity in cyberspace is different from ... fantasmic basis, of real life is made apparent.
