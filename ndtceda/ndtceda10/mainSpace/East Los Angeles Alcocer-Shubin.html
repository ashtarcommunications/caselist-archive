<span style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.5in;">I. interp – debate should be a site for contestation over socio-political analyses and proposals, structural descriptions and political prescriptions.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.5in;">II. Specifically, the Affirmative should present and defend an analysis of “structural harms,” a description of and (potential) prescription to the structuring forces of social and political relations. The Negative should present and defend either an alternative structural analysis of the harms and/or alternative competitive political methodology.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.5in;">III. Moreover, before we discuss the questions of prescriptions and methodologies we should make explicit our understandings and analyses of structuring forces of socio-political harms, oppression or grammars of suffering. We cannot take power relations for granted or assume that we al have a shared understanding or acceptance of structural power relations that are necessary preconditions for the facilitation of these academic debates.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in;">As Dr. Frank Wilderson tells us the civil society’s power: “we are dealing here with….its own gene pool” (Wilderson R, W, B, 370)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.5in;">IV. We must ask what ensemble of questions animates the current order of Policy Debate. What characterizes the current repertoire of possible and pose-able questions? What type of subjects, knowledge bases, ethics, people [sic], scholars, individuals, activists, artists, revolutionaries, teachers, politics does debate produce? What are debaters training to teach and do after undergrad college debate? Now of course individuals go on to divergent flights but there are still structural trends and waves that require attention.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Everyone must be prepared to discuss these issues.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Switch side assumes that a switch takes place, there is no switch</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Predictability/fairness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in;">Topic</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in;">We acknowledge that the best way to debate is not everyone free for all.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.5in;">V. So in light of this realization we argue that debate should orient political and philosophical mediations and dialogues toward a whole host of the fundamental/crucial questions that address the power politics of the contemporary moment. Dr. Wilderson states: “What are we to make of a world that responds to the most lucid enunciation of ethics with violence? What are the foundational questions of the ethico-political? Why are these questions so scandalous that they are rarely posed politically, [and] intellectually, and cinematically, - unless they are posed obliquely and unconsciously, asif by accident?”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.5in;">VI. In the wake of the brutal, repressive, and Genocidal (cointelpro) backlash against the ethical revolutionary work of the black panthers, American Indian movement, and other …</span><br />

Prescription: Return Turtle Island to the “Savage.” Return life itself back to the “Slave.” (ALT)<br />

Focus on the Visa debate evades questioning the structure of immigration, further reinforcing the current immigration policy – consequently consenting for anti-immigrant discourse.<br />

At the same time, I argue that my experience reveals…I believe this point is most salient for the overall<br />
<br />
Civil society is preconditioned upon anti-blackness that underwrites most political approaches. This anti-blackness produces slaves &amp; slaves on waiting and requires new ethical engagement. The apocalyptic destruction of civil society is new engagement black personhood and positional.<br />

There is something organic to black positionality that makes it essential…are underwritten by a supplemental antiblackness.<br />
