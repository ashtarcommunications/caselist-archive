 <br />
Interpretation-Admissibility is distinct from eligibility under INA §212(a), eligibility is what qualifies an immigrant for a visa whereas admissibility is what allows them entrance to the country <br />
Hasche 05, <br />
(Tilman, &quot;An Overview of Immigration Law,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc</a>) bct <br />
<br />
The Act establishes a two check system ...“lawfully admitted for permanent residence.” <br />
<br />
Violation- The affirmative removes an admissibility requirement which is distinct from an expansion of eligibility. <br />

<br />
C. STANDARDS <br />
<br />
1. Limits. Our Interpretation limits out an infinite number of cases that merely change the admissibility requirements for visas exploding the neg research burden killing fairness <br />
<br />
2. Ground. Takes away the best ground on the topic by forcing the neg to defend current policy as opposed to negating the positive expansion of eligibility <br />
<br />
3. Extratopicality. The USCIS lists visa name-number categories according to the 4 groups in the topic. If the aff grows one of those government-listed categories, they are topical. Their interpretation would allow them to remove admissibility standards that relate of any category of visa. This is extratopical, and makes it impossible for the judge to make an objective determination of jurisdiction, which is unfair to both sides. <br />
<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and communication. It’s a game of competing interpretations. <br />

A. The plan’s globalization of athletic labor props up the masculinzed nexus of contemporary sports.

An alternative gender order is possible- the current era makes challenging the artificial limitations of the patriarchal order possible, BUT the sports culture ensures the co-option of new movements back into the patriarchal fold- any challenges to the dominant ideology are thwarted by the maintenance of sports.<br />
