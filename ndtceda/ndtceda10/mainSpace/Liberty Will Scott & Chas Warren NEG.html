Positive Peace<br />
<br />
The affirmative represents peace as an absence of war, endorsing a worldview that manages outbreaks of violence from flashpoint to flashpoint ignoring the violence present in the status quo.<br />
Ha Poong Kim Philosophy Department, <span style="color: black;">Eastern Illinois University</span>, USA Bulletin of Peace Proposals, Vol. 18, No. 1, 1987<br />
<br />
Peace denotes … humanity is fully capable of.<br />
<br />
<br />
Focusing on war as an event produces politics of crises and control that attempt to manage outbreaks of violence. This reproduces militarism and perpetuates the structural violence of “peacetime militarism”<br />
Chris Cuomo, Ph.D., 1992, University of Wisconsin-Madison Department and Professor of Philosophy at University of Georgia, 1996 (War is not just an event: Reflections on the significance of everyday violence, <span style="color: black;">Hypatia</span>. Bloomington: <span style="color: black;">Fall 1996</span>. Vol.11, Iss.4;pg. 30)<br />
<br />
Philosophical attention to … inevitability of war and militarism.<br />
<br />
<br />
The representations of the 1AC inculcate a norm of negative peace. Our alternative is to engage in positive nonviolent discourse.<br />
William C Gay. Ph.D. in Philosophy from Boston College, Prof. UNC, Peace Review, Dec 1998.Vol.10, Iss. 4; pg. 545-8<br />
<br />
Many times the first … the violence of the situation.<br />

Order 66<br />
Contention One: Extinction is Forever<br />
<br />
Nuclear war causes extinction-climate change, ozone depletion, ocean destruction<br />
Scientists for Global Responsibility 2003<br />
(“Does Anybody Remember the Nuclear Winter” SGR, July, Newsletter 27, <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sgr.org.uk/climate/NuclearWinter_NL27.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgr.org.uk/climate/NuclearWinter_NL27.htm</a></span><br />
<br />
Obviously, when a nuclear bomb …years of evolution.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – We’re Not Alone<br />
<br />
A) The best estimates put the number of extraterrestrial civilizations at 10,000<br />
Drake, Chairman of the SETI Institute, 02<br />

<br />
Chris McKay: There is no … in the stellar neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Contention Three – The Calculus<br />
<br />
A) Humanity must acknowledge the equality of alien life to prevent universal genocide<br />
Packer, Master in Communication Wake Forest, 07<br />
&lt;Joe, Alien Life in Search of Acknowledgment, pg 62-63&gt;<br />
<br />
Once we hold alien … to life beyond this planet.<br />
<br />
B) There is no justification to exclude other beings from our moral calculation<br />
Singer, a chair in bioethics at Princeton University's Center for Human Values, 01<br />
&lt;Peter, “To: Richard A. Posner” June 11, <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/interviews-debates/200106--.htm</a></span> &gt;<br />

Contention Four – The Scenarios<br />
<br />
Scenario One – Lasers<br />
<br />
A) New military technology will use lasers that exceed cosmic energy<br />
Leslie, Univ. of Guelph Philosophy Professor, 96<br />
(John, The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction, pages 113-114)<br />
<br />
Among the sources … at the higher frequencies.<br />
<br />
B) These energies will disturb the vacuum<br />
Leslie, 96<br />
(John, Univ. of Guelph Philosophy Professor, The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction, page 109)<br />
<br />
How could … a region absolutely empty.<br />
<br />
C) Vacuum destabilization destroys the universe<br />
Leslie, 96 (John, Univ. of Guelph Philosophy Professor, The End of the World: The Science and Ethics of Human Extinction, page 110)<br />
<br />
As Hut and Rees commented… 'microseconds or less'.<br />
<br />
Scenario Two – Particle Accelerators<br />
<br />
A) Advances in particle accelerator technology ensure the destruction of the entire universe<br />
CR4.com, 8-13-07 (“Concern that the LHC might destroy the universe,” <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/11070/Concern-that-the-LHC-might-destroy-the-universe" rel="nofollow">http://cr4.globalspec.com/thread/11070/Concern-that-the-LHC-might-destroy-the-universe</a></span>)<br />
<br />
People both … Anyone want to discuss this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario Three – Time Travel<br />
<br />
Time travel will occur in the future – new advances ensure it<br />
Highfield, editor of the New Scientist, 8-8-07<br />
(Roger, “Time travel could be possible ... in the future,” <span style="color: black;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/08/08/scitime108.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/08/08/scitime108.xml</a></span>)<br />

<br />
Despite these restraints, … who would rush in&quot; (p. 32).<br />
<br />
Scenario Four – Zero Point Energy<br />
<br />
A) Zero point energy is coming now<br />
Scott, editor of Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, 3-1-04 (William, “To the stars,” Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, p. lexis)<br />
<br />
At least two… ZPE-related efforts underway.<br />
<br />
B) Zero point energy will destroy the universe<br />
Page, 8-7-07<br />
(Lewis, “Boffins flick Quantum vacuum switch from suck to blow<br />

The culture of fear is a product of liberalism that finds its culmination in the fear of death. This culture of fear sustains the politics of being-for-death which creates the very insecurity and perpetual war the affirmative attempts to solve. Just like the call to &quot;die for God/9 the call to &quot;die for nothing&quot; defines life in relation to death which gives death permanence and traps us in the politics of being-for-death.<br />
Daniel M. Bell, Jr., Associate Professor of Theological Ethics, Lutheran Theological Southern Seminary, 2007<br />

<br />
Thus, as we examine the culture … redemptive necessity of sacrifice and suffering.<br />
<br />
We advocate that the judge vote for the neg to create a space for a new political order. That political order is affirmed through the politics of being-for-life found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The truth-event of the resurrection is a radical act of affirmation that denies death meaning and ruptures the politics we have critiqued. Our ethic replaces the logic of reductive sacrifice (in the name of God or people) with the relentless affirmation of life that overcomes the politics of fear and allows ceaseless giving in the face of terror.<br />

Queer Theory<br />
The calculated management of migrant populations relies on a sexualized notion of citizenship. Even as they take steps towards equality, there is always a violent underbelly to immigration policy that is steeped in heteronormativity.<br />
Luibhéid, associate professor of women's studies at the University of Arizona, 2008. (Eithne,. Ph.D., director of the Institute for LGBT Studies at Arizona University., “Queer/Migration: An Unruly Body of Scholarship”, GLQ Journal, Vol. 14, No 2-3, 2008). Jt<br />
Queer migration scholarship has been enabled by and … local, regional, national, transnational, and imperial arrangements of power.<br />
<br />
We must delink “rights” talk from the heteronormative institutions of state and marriage and thereby create a space for a sexuality beyond dominant terms.<br />
Chambers, Assistant Professor of Political Science at St. Mary's College, 2003. (Samuel A., &quot;Ghostly Rights,&quot; Cultural Critique 54, Spring 2003, Project Muse). Jt<br />
Following Warner, Butler wishes to illuminate the dangers … “the reiteration of sexuality beyond the dominant terms” (Butler, 177).<br />
<br />
Those sexual regulations create an invisible center around which abnormal ways of life are organized and violently, systemically eliminated in the name of normalization.<br />
Yep, Professor of Communication Studies at San Francisco State University, 2004. (Gust A., Ph.D. in Communication., Queer Theory and Communication: From Disciplining Queers to Queering the Discipline(s), pg. 18). Jt<br />
In this passage, Simmons vividly describes the devastating … at the intersections of race, class, gender, and sexuality.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to refuse participation in this production of sexualized citizenship in the name of immigration reform. Embrace queerness as the anticitizen. There can be no compromise or reform, we must queer citizenship to undermine the foundations of the oppressive nation-state.<br />
Brandzel, PhD candidate at the U of Minnesota, 2005. (Amy L., “Queering Citizenship”, GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Vol 11, No. 2). Jt<br />
I describe such events as conferring gay and lesbian … peoples, groups, or individuals; it would refuse citizenship altogether.<br />
