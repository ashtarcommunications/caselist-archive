<span class="tagChar">Current understanding of immigration in the US is understood as a reaction to a threat to national heterosexual purity. Family is a core site from which heteronormative lines of delineation between the normal, pure citizen, and the deviant are created, displacing recognition of structural inequalities and organizing a hegemonic public around sex to which the immigrant must assimilate. </span><br />

<strong>And,</strong> <strong>we must not separate the war on homosexuality from the war on terror. The aesthetic of national identity, mediated by the figure of the heterosexual family was the condition of possibility for the sexualized violence of the war on terror.</strong> <br />
