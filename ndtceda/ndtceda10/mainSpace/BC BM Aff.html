Subpoint C) Solvency<br />
<br />
Exempting foreign-born STEM graduate students from the employment caps will solve for the brain drain and boost the US economy. A study by the Technology Policy Institute concludes that lifting the employment cap will cause 38, 600 students per year to remain in the US, which will increase the U.S. gross domestic product by 13.6 billion and federal revenue by 2.7 to 3.8 billion per year.<br />
Holen, Technology Policy Institute, 2009:<br />
[THE BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF HIGH-SKILLED IMMIGRATION REFORM, March [Arlene], p. 10-11]<br />

Claims that admitting more foreign students will displace US students are empirically denied and refuted by numerous studies.<br />
