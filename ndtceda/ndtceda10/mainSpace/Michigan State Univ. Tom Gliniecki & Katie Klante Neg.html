Reasons to Prefer and Voter<br />
First – Precision and Topic Education – our ev is astonishingly good at impacting this. <br />
Second – Limits – they explode the topic to amnesty Affs. There’s an huge body of literature about illegal immigration and the community voted against those topics for clash and predictability.<br />
Third -- Extra-T is voter – even if they also deal with some parties outside the US, plan is still extra-topical. Extra-T is a voter for reasonable 2NR’s and fairness. <br />
Last – it is infinitely de-limiting to say that “calling it a visa makes it a visa”. It remedies none of our ground claims about undocumented worker Affs and it makes the Aff which gives US citizens a visa topical. <br />

Plan mobilizes GOP base voters<br />
USA Today, 9/16/10<br />
But another part of the Republican revolt has little to do with fiscal policy. It's a generalized sense among conservatives that social and economic currents are taking the nation in the wrong direction -- that elites in government, academia, media and big business wield too much influence; that people with modest levels of education can't get ahead; that the nation's growing diversity, brought on in part through illegal immigration, is robbing the U.S. of its heritage; and that growing acceptance of same-sex relationships and the continued legality of abortion are undermining its moral values.<br />
<br />
But not the dem base<br />
Gay Immigration Rights, 10 (1/8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gayimmigration.blogspot.com/2010/01/will-uafa-become-public-option-of-cir.html" rel="nofollow">http://gayimmigration.blogspot.com/2010/01/will-uafa-become-public-option-of-cir.html</a>)<br />
So if UAFA is not in the Senate bill, chances are it wouldn't be in the final bill either. Rep. Nadler has indicated that he'd try very hard to get UAFA in the CIR bill, but if liberals (after threatening multiple times &quot;no public option no deal&quot;) can swallow a health care reform bill without the public option for the sake of passing the bill, UAFA stands very little chance since it doesn't even have the kind of passionate support the public option enjoys, so it'd be easy for liberal Democrats to turn the other cheek. <br />
