Contention I—Eugenics:<br />

Contention II—Narrative Analysis:<br />
<br />
No person should be subject to forced cooperation in order to attain a T visa. The aff calls for a narrative analysis of the cooperation requirement. It is impossible to separate analysis of trafficking from narratives—the law and order approach treats trafficking as a linear and episodic event that has a clear beginning and clear end. This approach is inadequate because the material, institutional, and symbolic factors can only be understood in relation to eachother. The way we come to understand those relations are through narratives—the aff’s narrative analysis disrupts the dominant trafficking representations and helps us understand that people’s behaviour is guided by the stories they believe about the events in which they are embedded. What is important is how we orient ourselves towards narratives.<br />

&quot;E. Cultural Effect on Understandings of Human Trafficking The term “human trafficking” has only entered our cultural lexicon in the last decade. A shift in legal and &quot; <br />
AND <br />
&quot;discourse and future legal decisions regarding trafficking victims.257&quot; <br />
<br />
It is impossible to separate analysis of trafficking from narratives—the law and order approach treats trafficking as a linear and episodic event that has a clear beginning and clear end. This approach is inadequate because the material, institutional, and symbolic factors can only be understood in relation to eachother. The way we come to understand those relations are through narratives—A narrative view helps us understand that people’s behaviour is guided by the stories they believe about the events in which they are embedded. What is important is how we orient ourselves towards narratives. <br />
Mona Baker, ‘5 (Professor at Centre for Translation &amp; Intercultural Studies School of Languages, Linguistics and Cultures University of Manchester, “Narratives in and of Translation”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://manchester.academia.edu/documents/0075/2237/Baker_2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://manchester.academia.edu/documents/0075/2237/Baker_2005.pdf</a>) <br />
&quot;More recent and equally pernicious conceptual narratives which have had considerable impact beyond their disciplinary boundaries include Samuel &quot; <br />
AND <br />
&quot;on the world. Or at least so this narrative goes.&quot; <br />
<br />
We must orient the ballot towards including the other in trafficking policy—bridging the gap in understanding is key to transformative trafficking politics <br />
Jonathan Todres, ‘9 (Associate Professor of Law, Georgia State University College of Law, “LAW, OTHERNESS, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING”, 49 Santa Clara L. Rev. 605) <br />
&quot;Human trafficking needs to be understood in the larger context of movement of persons globally, as &quot;in most cases [*667] (including most cases of trafficking) this &quot; <br />
AND <br />
&quot;systemic issues, including the operation of otherness, will we see a significant reduction in the incidence of human trafficking.&quot; <br />

Challenging meta-narratives is vital to change trafficking politics <br />
