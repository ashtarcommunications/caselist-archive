Despite multi-million dollar programs, victim identification has been extremely slow, and federal agencies have recognized [*392] that they are not finding victims at an &quot;acceptable rate.&quot; n67 There is a &quot;significant difference between the estimated number of people trafficked into the United States annually and the number of victims that the U.S. government has reached.&quot; n68 The nature of this crime - underground and often under-acknowledged - contributes to an inability to determine the precise number of people victimized by traffickers. Even different parts of the U.S. government do not agree on the number of victims granted benefits. n69 Given the large number of victims, Congress estimated that 5000 temporary visas would be needed per year and placed an annual cap on T-visas at that number. n70 Similarly, the number of permanent residence grants based on trafficking victim status are capped at 5000 per year. n71 The T-visa cap has not come close to being reached in any of the three years reported so far. n72 In fact, of the estimated tens of thousands of victims in the United States annually, only a few hundred have been identified and protected since the TVPA became law. n73 By March 2005, fewer than 500 victim-witnesses had been granted temporary trafficking victim T visas since the law went into effect in 2000. n74 On March 23, 2005, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Vermont Service Center, which adjudicates all T visa applications, reported [*393] that a total of 478 T-1 visas had been granted and 496 denied. n75 Additionally, by the end of fiscal year 2003, the ICE reported that a total of 374 victim-witnesses had been granted temporary &quot;continued presence&quot; status in order to assist law enforcement with trafficking prosecutions. n76 It is likely that many of those granted continued presence were the same victims later granted T-visa status; thus, the actual number of victims protected may be lower than the totals would suggest. In the same fiscal year, the Department of Justice reported that it had 153 ongoing human trafficking investigations, had filed 12 human trafficking cases under the TVPA, charged 31 defendants under the criminal provisions of the TVPA, and secured 26 convictions for human trafficking. n77 Furthermore, 151 trafficking victims were provided certification and benefit eligibility letters by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in fiscal year 2003. n78 As of March 2005, HHS reported a total of 651 letters of certification issued to human trafficking victims. n79 Thus, over the course of four years, the law granted benefits to several hundred victims out of a pool of tens of thousands. Something is not working. Unfortunately, the government statistics do not provide enough detail to allow analysis of why there have been so few grants of benefits to trafficking victims. More precise information is needed about how the victims were identified, who identified them, how many identified victims were unable or unwilling to assist law enforcement, and how many of those victims were deported without receiving any assistance. Law enforcement agents who applied for legal status on behalf of a victim had more than one-fourth of their continued presence requests denied in 2003. n80 Similarly, many of the T-visa applications were denied. We do not know whether the applications were denied for inability to meet the immigration eligibility requirements or for other reasons. More detailed statistics will give a better understanding of the barriers to receiving victim benefits. While each of these grants of benefits surely represents a life saved, there are thousands more that could be saved if the TVPA were a more effective protection tool for victims. It is obvious that most of the tens of thousands of victims trafficked into the country each year are not found or protected by this law, despite the multi-million dollar anti-trafficking programs. The government reports suggest several explanations for the large gaps between the numbers of estimated victims and those identified and protected: the law is new; law enforcement personnel and community groups need training to understand and recognize the existence of human trafficking; and prosecutions of this type are [*394] extremely complex and require tremendous resources. n81 We would argue, however, that it is the law itself - the TVPA - which, despite its &quot;victim protection&quot; language, actually promulgated eligibility standards for benefits that not only burden victims, but also hamper law enforcement. Although the TVPRA attempted to ameliorate the TVPA, it did not effectively address its main shortcomings.</span></span><br />

The answer to this foundational question is informed by one‘s personal, or even legal, framework.116 Varying viewpoints invariably lead to varying definitions. In legislating the scope and boundaries of human trafficking as a crime, <strong>much hinges</strong> on the arrangement of<strong><span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">particular wording</span> in definitional provisions</strong>.117 Anti-trafficking laws impacting the United States exist at three levels— state, federal, international.118 Although these pieces of legislation cast ―a kind of definitional anchor, none ―define human trafficking or trafficking victimization in exactly the same way.‖119 The definitional provisions at each level have triggered ongoing lengthy political debate120 and vigorous disagreement,121 which tends to delay the enactment process.122 Beyond slowing the legislative process, the implications of these definitional debates—and the differences between statutory provisions— are far reaching, impacting not only a victim‘s ability to receive appropriate relief and government benefits,123 but also methodologies for victim screening protocols124 and gathering statistical research data.125 Overall, <strong>differences in definitions</strong> make it <strong>difficult</strong> to standardize certain tools that are <strong><span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">vital</span> to fighting the war on human trafficking</strong>.

First, the use of human rights treaties and discourse creates <strong>links to the international movement to protect human rights</strong>. These links can strengthen protections at home in two ways: by drawing international attention and <strong>pressure</strong> to bear on <strong>domestic efforts</strong> 46 and providing a shared language and understanding for domestic advocates to interact with, and learn from, international experiences. 47 As many countries face similar immigration issues, the<strong>shared wisdom of an international approach</strong> may be particularly useful in this area. Such international interactions might also facilitate the transmission of human rights assessments and impact statements throughout the world. Human rights review might complement U.N. efforts to <strong><span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">mainstream human rights</span> and integrate them at an operational level</strong>. 48 <strong>The visibility and leadership capabilities</strong> of the <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>nited<span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>tates make it particularly able to promote the use of human rights assessments. 49 Just as the <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>tates' development and implementation of environmental impact statements has shaped environmental policy in a significant number of countries, 50 the <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>tates could also <strong>reinvigorate its human rights policy through its leadership and assist other countries in developing a stronger commitment to human rights</strong>. 51 Impact assessment provides other countries with an opportunity [*292] to embrace the importance of human rights without making a strong commitment to a treaty regime they might be unwilling to or be incapable of enforcing. Human rights impact statements and other review mechanisms might also be used as evidence of good faith domestic treaty compliance. To the extent that the United States already implicitly complies with reporting requirements under the human rights treaties it has ratified and implemented, foreign countries find America's disinclination to use human rights language problematic. 52 Thus, instead of using a constitutional metric to determine violations when collecting information on police brutality, for example, U.S. states could do so instead by documenting the issue in terms of human rights. By adding treaty language to the assessment process, transmitting our efforts at compliance across the globe becomes<strong>easier</strong>. Enhancing our reputation for human rights compliance is especially important given current political realities. Many countries hold a declining opinion of the <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>tates. 53 The international community would welcome America's <strong>affirmation of the continuing importance of human rights</strong> in the wake of many post-September 11th actions such as torture, extraordinary rendition, increased domestic surveillance, and harsher and more frequent detention of immigrants. Moreover, the international community would benefit from the assurance that the concept of &quot;human rights&quot; means more than a justification for regime change. 54 American exceptionalism to human rights law <strong>angers our allies and complicates efforts to secure their cooperation</strong>. 55 Not surprisingly, many countries view the United States' silence about its own human rights failings as hypocritical. 56 In particular, the international community strongly criticizes the State Department's annual human rights reports for omitting an assessment of domestic performance as well as omitting &quot;actions by governments taken at the request of the United States or with the expressed support of the United States . . . .&quot; 57 Human rights advocates suggest that U.S. leadership on human rights faces a <strong><span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">severe</span></strong> [*293] <strong><span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">credibility gap</span></strong>--for instance, other countries perceive the<span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>tates as a laggard on human rights treaty compliance in <strong>regards to migrants</strong> 58 --but that repudiation of past abuses and<strong>momentum for policy changes could <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">restore its leadership</span></strong>. 59 As many have suggested, good international relations are vital to winning the War on Terror. 60 Moreover, international cooperation is essential to address <strong>immigration related issues such as human trafficking</strong>.

All agree that climate change is an existential threat to humankind. Yet agreement on what to do still eludes us. How can this be? The issues are complex, affecting everything from national economies to individual lifestyles. They involve political trade-offs and commitments of resources no leader can undertake lightly. We could see all that at recent climate negotiations in Bangkok. Where we needed progress, we saw gridlock. Yet the elements of a deal are on the table. <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">All we require</span> to put them in place <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">is political will</span>. We need to step back from narrow national interest and engage in frank and constructive discussion in a spirit of global common cause. In this, we can be optimistic. Meeting in London earlier this week, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told the leaders of 17 major economies (responsible for some 80 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions) that success in Copenhagen is within reach—if they themselves engage, and especially if they themselves go to Copenhagen to push an agenda for change. <strong>U.S. leadership is crucial</strong>. That is why I am encouraged by the spirit of compromise shown in the bipartisan initiative announced last week by John Kerry and Lindsey Graham. Here was a pair of U.S. senators — one Republican, the other Democratic — coming together to bridge their parties’ differences to address climate change in a spirit of genuine give-and-take.

Leaders across the globe are increasingly showing the engagement and leadership we need. Last month, President Barack Obama joined more than 100 others at a climate change summit at U.N. headquarters in New York — sending a clear message of solidarity and commitment. So did the leaders of China, Japan and South Korea, all of whom pledged to promote the development of clean energy technologies and ensure that Copenhagen is a success. Japan’s prime minister promised a 25 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020, laying down a marker for other industrialized nations. The European Union, too, has pledged to make a 30 percent reduction as part of a global agreement. Norway has announced its readiness for a 40 percent cut in emissions. Brazil has unveiled plans to substantially cut emissions from deforestation. India and China are implanting programs to curb emissions as well. Looking forward to Copenhagen, I have four benchmarks for success: Every country must do its utmost to reduce emissions from all major sources, including from deforestation and emissions from shipping and aviation. Developed countries must strengthen their mid-term mitigation targets, which are currently nowhere close to the cuts that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says are needed. Developing countries must slow the rise in their emissions and accelerate green growth as part of their strategies to reduce poverty. A successful deal must strengthen the world’s ability to cope with an already changing climate. In particular, it must provide comprehensive support to those who bear the heaviest climate impacts. Support for adaptation is not only an ethical imperative; it is a smart investment in a more stable, secure world. A deal needs to be backed by money and the means to deliver it. Developing countries need funding and technology so they can move more quickly toward green growth. The solutions we discuss cannot be realized without substantial additional financing, including through carbon markets and private investment. A deal must include an equitable global governance structure. All countries must have a voice in how resources are deployed and managed. That is how trust will be built. Can we seal a comprehensive, equitable and ambitious deal in Copenhagen that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global temperature rise to a <strong>scientifically safe level</strong>? Can we catalyze clean energy growth? Can we help to protect the most vulnerable nations from the effects of climate change? Can we expect the United States to play a leading role? The best answer to all these questions was given last week by Senators Kerry and Graham: “Yes, we can.”</span></span><br />

Key factors to consider include whether the substance and application of the U.S. minimum standards comply with the definitions set forth in international instruments and the interpretations and recommendations of international bodies.142 As Cleveland notes, “[s]tates are much more likely to voluntarily comply with international norms that they perceive to be <strong>fair, and reliable interpretation and application of international norms</strong> by transnational actors is critical to encouraging nations to recognize, internalize, and obey international law.”143 Given the struggles over the trafficking definition,<strong>consistency with international norms is <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">crucial</span></strong> to the successful operation of the international anti-trafficking legal framework. As the legislative guide to the Protocol makes clear, “[t]he main reason for defining the term ‘trafficking in persons’ in international law was to provide some degree of consensus-based standardization of concepts” to undergird “<strong>efficient international cooperation</strong> in investigating and prosecuting cases.”144 An agreed definition would also <strong>standardize research and other activities</strong>, allowing for better comparison of national and re145 gional data and a clearer global picture of the problem. By substituting <strong>its own trafficking definition</strong> for that of the Protocol and failing to apply more comprehensive human rights standards in its country assessments, however, the U.S. sanctions regime currently <strong>diverges in critical respects</strong> from the evolving international anti-trafficking framework.</span></span></span></span><br />

As immigrants suffer a wide variety of human rights abuses and possess an extensive array of international human rights protections, they <strong>provide a helpful test case</strong> for the [*304] development of a human rights review process. Immigrants are subject to various and often overlapping government authorities and policies, so designers can compare different federal, state, and local approaches to human rights review. Moreover, such a model <strong>tests the limits of human rights review</strong> as immigrants are a relatively unpopular, politically powerless social group.</span></span></span></span><br />

The framework is there to shatter the myth of the superiority [*72] of the U.S. version of rights, to rebuild popular expectations, and to help develop a culture and jurisprudence of indivisible human rights. Indeed, in the face of systemic inequality and crushing poverty, violence by official and private actors, globalization of the market economy, and military and environmental depredation, the human rights framework is gaining new force and new dimensions. It is being broadened today by the movements of people in different parts of the world, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere and significantly of women, who understand the protection of human rights as a matter of individual and <strong><span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">collective human survival</span></strong> and betterment. Also emerging is a notion of third-generation rights, encompassing collective rights that cannot be solved on a state-by-state basis and that call for new mechanisms of accountability, particularly affecting Northern countries. The emerging rights include human-centered sustainable development, environmental protection, peace, and security. 38 Given the poverty and inequality in the United States as well as our role in the world, it is <strong>imperative</strong> that we bring the human rights framework to bear on both domestic and foreign policy.</span></span></span></span><br />

The poor wish to put priority on economic development. By contrast, the rich have a vested interest in the status quo. Hence, for example, the United States and most other developed countries have a vital interest in preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction, especially the new generation of chemical and biological weapons. Conventions to restrict their development have been negotiated and adopted through the General Assembly process, clumsy and slow though it may be. But </span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the only real way to prevent their proliferation</span></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">is by creating a global consensus where all the countries feel that they have a common stake in global peace and prosperity.

Both psychologically and materially, all nations must feel that they have a say in the management of the globe. Just as democracy elicits the commitment of the citizen to respect the results of elections and the subsequent decisions of the elected government, a vote in the UN delivers a similar commitment from the nation-state. These processes do not work perfectly, either nationally or internationally, but the crucial role that the UN plays in making stakeholders out of each nation is neither well understood nor appreciated.</span></span></span><br />

Nuclear and chemical weapons do not reproduce themselves and do not independently engage in adaptive behavior; pathogens do both of these things. That deceptively simple observation has immense implications. The use of a manufactured weapon is a singular event. Most of the damage occurs immediately. The aftereffects, whatever they may be, decay rapidly over time and distance in a reasonably predictable manner. Even before a nuclear warhead is detonated, for instance, it is possible to estimate the extent of the subsequent damage and the likely level of radioactive fallout. Such predictability is an essential component for tactical military planning. The use of a pathogen, by contrast, is an extended process whose scope and timing cannot be precisely controlled. For most potential biological agents, the predominant drawback is that they would not act swiftly or decisively enough to be an effective weapon. But for a few pathogens - ones most likely to have a decisive effect and therefore the ones most likely to be contemplated for deliberately hostile use - the risk runs in the other direction. A lethal pathogen that could efficiently spread from one victim to another would be capable of initiating an intensifying cascade of disease </span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that might ultimately threaten the entire world population.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The 1918 influenza epidemic demonstrated the potential for a global contagion of this sort but not necessarily its outer limit.</span></span></span><br />

For that reason, measuring performance by the standard of prediction is unrealistic and can damage the standing, morale, and performance of intelligence agencies. They are engaged not in winning a war against terrorism but in managing it — restricting the activities and options of hostile forces. However, in waging this campaign the administration talks of discarding deterrence and various forms of passive defense in favor of a strategy of preemption. In that case, prediction would have to become the measure of performance, because a preemption- based strategy would require sustained and timely collection of the kind of intelligence that is rarely available, least of all in a form that connects all the dots. Effective intelligence collection must be conducted bilaterally but <strong>with a wide array of countries</strong>. Terrorism can be contained if intelligence services and police agencies acquire the habit of<strong>cooperating closely</strong> with each other and suppressing their competitive instincts and preference for acting alone. The United States would be the chief beneficiary of such activity, first, because it appears to be the primary target of various nonstate terrorists; second, because it lacks adequate human resources for gathering the intelligence it needs, notably in Central Asia; and third, because its ability to eavesdrop on global communications is declining. The rapid growth of commercially available technologies is allowing for the creation of all but unbreakable computer codes. Fiber-optic lines give off no electronic signals that can be monitored.46 The <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">S</span>tates needs help, especially from allies and other friendly regimes that have productive relationships with countries in this region and in the Middle East. (America has never been good at old-fashioned spying or penetrating the intelligence services of unfriendly countries.) The 1984 summer Olympics in Los Angeles may have produced a model of <strong>diligent cooperation</strong> among intelligence services operating at both the national and multilateral levels. Well in advance of the games, the U.S. intelligence community felt certain that the possibility of a terrorist action in Los Angeles had been virtually eliminated. Subsequent Olympic events have been equally insulated against terrorism. More impressive was what did not happen during Y2K, when planned attacks by terrorists were thwarted by the combined efforts of intelligence services.</span></span></span><br />

Very little material is necessary to construct a highly destructive nuclear weapon. 41 Although nuclear devices are extraordinarily complex, the technical barriers to constructing a workable weapon are not <strong>significant</strong>. 42 Moreover, <strong>the sheer number of methods</strong> that could be used to deliver a nuclear device into the United States makes it incredibly likely that terrorists could <strong>successfully employ a nuclear weapon</strong> once it was built. 43 Accordingly, supply-side controls that are aimed at preventing terrorists from acquiring nuclear material in the first place are the most effective means of countering the risk of nuclear terrorism. 44 Moreover, the end of the Cold War eliminated the rationale for maintaining a large military-industrial complex in Russia, and the nuclear cities were closed. 45 This resulted in at least 35,000 nuclear scientists becoming unemployed in an economy that was collapsing. 46 Although the economy has stabilized somewhat, there [*1439] are still at least 20,000 former scientists who are unemployed or underpaid and who are too young to retire, 47 raising the chilling prospect that these scientists will be tempted to sell their nuclear knowledge, or steal nuclear material to sell, to states or terrorist organizations with nuclear ambitions. 48 The potential consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge and material to terrorist groups that seek to cause mass destruction in the United States are truly horrifying.

A statement made by one of the Act's sponsors evidences the prioritization of the Act as a crime bill. &quot;The legislation further includes the creation of a new form of visa for trafficking victims.

International human rights authorities and non-governmental organizations have<strong>expressed skepticism</strong> about a crime control approach <strong>adequately protecting the human rights of victims of trafficking</strong>. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, wrote regarding the U.N.

Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women expressed concern that the international instrument dealing with trafficking, the U.N.

Starting from a partial approach by addressing one victim-group (i.e. white women) and one type of labor exploitation (e.g. sex trafficking), the international community expanded its understanding of this issue and with this the ability to take action to reduce its scope. Over the past one hundred years, the international community has slowly put together the pieces of the human trafficking puzzle. It has led anti human trafficking efforts since the abolition of institutional slavery and influenced national legislation in the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. After decades of slow evolution the international policy framework has progressed from a rough block of metal and emerged as a sharpened needle. The impetus of national efforts to define and stem human trafficking has drawn from the international community’s long-term efforts to build a comprehensive anti trafficking policy framework. Yet this instrument is not perfect. This highly developed policy tool should continue to be improved. At the national level, government and societal <strong>responses to human trafficking</strong> are <strong>a <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">litmus test </span>of the strength and quality of our democracies</strong>. This analysis has shown that both the German and American Governments have made earnest efforts to address the problem of human trafficking by creating robust anti human trafficking policy frameworks. Both have learned from their engagement with this issue at the international level. Yet in the national context, the sharpened anti human trafficking policy-needle has been <strong>dulled</strong> <strong>by policy gaps and hidden agendas.</strong> Hence national human trafficking policies are subordinated to competing and incompatible policy objectives that jeopardize the primary goal. These policy gaps and hidden agendas <strong>cast doubt</strong> on the <strong>commitment</strong> of both governments to <strong>stopping human trafficking and to doing so by means of a <span style="border-bottom-color: windowtext; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-width: 1pt; border-left-color: windowtext; border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1pt; border-right-color: windowtext; border-right-style: solid; border-right-width: 1pt; border-top-color: windowtext; border-top-style: solid; border-top-width: 1pt; padding-bottom: 0in; padding-left: 0in; padding-right: 0in; padding-top: 0in;">human rights approach</span></strong>. The recommendations made in this analysis not only shed light on these hidden political agendas and gaps in policy in the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany, they also propose how to improve policy in both countries. The suggested changes could <strong>increase the protection of human trafficking victims</strong>, improve information on the scope and nature of human trafficking, as well as<strong>enhance</strong> the ability of governments to prosecute perpetrators. Both the German and the US Governments could profit from a closer comparison and exchange of their anti human trafficking policies and initiatives. This analysis could in turn act as a springboard for increased exchange and learning. Combating human trafficking is not an isolated policy niche that concerns only a few select experts. Although the immediate consequences of human trafficking are felt most intensely by the victims of the crime, it is nonetheless an issue that concerns the whole of society.</span></span><br />

Human trafficking, like corruption, has become a global obsession of the international community in the past decade and the Balkans a key target in their antitrafficking efforts. Policies to combat trafficking have also been followed a top-down pattern, where international organizations rely on a combination of incentives and sanctions to pressure governments toconform to common legal standards and policy procedures. An expanding network of local nongovernmental, state, and transnational actors are directly involved in every stage of the policy making process. Like in the case of corruption, we can also observe efforts to better measure the scope of trafficking, as well as governments’ compliance with anti-trafficking policies. While global anti-trafficking policies interact with different domestic conditions, to date anti-trafficking policy in the Balkans, like anticorruption policies, has appeared to follow a one-size-fits-all pattern. Anti-trafficking policy, like anti-corruption, exemplifies a “transnational” policy by Orenstein’s definition, one that is “developed, diffused, and implemented with the direct involvement of global policy actors and coalitions at or across the international, national, or local levels of governance.” 3 In the case of anti-trafficking in the Balkans, transnational policy actors have not only been involved directly in all stages of the policy process; one could argue that anti-trafficking policy would not exist without the involvement of transnational actors. That is, transnational actors have placed human trafficking high on the policy agenda, developed policies to combat it, and have overseen implementation of these policies. However, by viewing anti-trafficking policy in the Balkans as a strictly top-down process, backed by a consensus among the transnational policy community, we neglect other interesting questions. For one, what are the different ways in which transnational actors frame the problem of trafficking and how have these ideas shaped the development of different policy strategies? Why might one frame and related policy strategy prevail over another? Finally, what can we learn from the implementation of antitrafficking policies in the Balkans to date, specifically some of the unintended consequences?</span></span><br />

Efforts to prevent, suppress and prosecute traffickers have resulted in increased trans-border cooperation among law enforcement agencies as well as high-profile operations such as Mirage. The law enforcement approach has resulted in numerous traffickers being apprehended, convicted and prosecuted. Yet critics argue that the law enforcement approach has failed to significantly reduce the trade, with traffickers demonstrating great flexibility and ingenuity in eluding police by quickly changing transportation and distribution routes or moving the trade further underground. Critics also argue that the law enforcement approach has also resulted in a re-victimization of trafficked persons. For one, they suggest that operations like Mirage result in more women being apprehended and charged on illegal migration or prostitution charges than identifying and assisting trafficked women and their traffickers. Moreover, aggressive policing has the unintended consequence of moving much of the prostitution trade to private apartments, often on the outskirts of cities and towns, where women are further isolated and vulnerable to violent abuse. 39 HelgaKonrad, Chair of the Stability Pact Task Force on Trafficking in Human Beings, referring to the declining RCP numbers, states: The [RCP] figures show that the trafficking in human beings is going underground. It shows that the traffickers rapidly react to our responses in the fight against human trafficking. And it shows that the victims are no longer found in bars and brothels. Brothel raids caused traffickers to shift the victims to private locations where, of course, access is more difficult and where it becomes more difficult to provide assistance. 40 Finally, because the law enforcement approach rests on convicting and prosecuting individual traffickers (a condition of the UN Protocol) prosecutors must rely largely on the willingness of victims to testify against their traffickers. 41 Since designated “victims of trafficking” are granted immunity from illegal migration or prostitution charges, refusing to testify can make them more vulnerable to threats of immediate deportation or prosecution. Moreover, as victim assistance programs, including emergency and short-term shelters, are being increasingly being managed and funded by state agencies, assistance can be made conditional on the women cooperating with the prosecution. If a person does agree to testify governments are legally required to provide witness protection. Yet in many cases the very same government and law enforcement agencies tasked with providing this protection have themselves been implicated with being involved in the trafficking trade. In sum, critics of the law enforcement approach argue that when the principal concern of this approach is to stop criminals, the interests of their victims become of secondary concern, often leading to their further exploitation C. Re-trafficking as a failure of migration and law enforcement approaches Re-trafficking has been identified as an increasingly prevalent problem. The 2005 RCP report documents that anywhere from three percent to 50 percent of women repatriated from destination countries to their home countries from 2003 to 2005 were re-trafficked within a year. The IOM attributes the high rates of re-trafficking to the predatory strategies of recruiters, who target highly vulnerable repatriated persons. Recruiters, unlike traffickers, are often embedded in particular cities and towns and thus less vulnerable to being apprehended at border crossings or brothel raids. Yet the IOM also acknowledges serious gaps in the repatriation and reintegration process, where women are returned home to face poverty, shame, and often abuse without adequate social support. 42 IOM’s critics, however, argue that the high rates of re-trafficking raise fundamental questions about the long-term effectiveness of its migration approach to anti-trafficking that makes repatriation and preventing illegal migration its central aim. Local and transnational networks of NGOs have taken the lead in addressing the re-trafficking issue, creating assistance and referral networks that track women being repatriated to their home countries. While informal monitoring and referral networks can provide some short-term assistance to repatriated women, advocates of an economic approach to anti-trafficking argue that the ongoing cycle of trafficking illuminates the underlying structural or economic nature of the problem. As the EU fortifies its borders against the migrant and crime exporting states to its south and east, and funds increased law enforcement initiatives in its bordering regions like the Balkans, traffickers continue to profit on the limitless supply of the unemployed and dislocated persons who become trapped in the trafficking cycle. Concluding remarks We can draw several conclusions from this analysis. First, anti-trafficking policy has become an “obsession” of the international community, with a wide range of transnational actors coordinating efforts to develop, diffuse and implement anti-trafficking policy. Yet differences exist in how transnational actors frame the nature of the trafficking problem, pointing to the need to investigate points of conflict as well as “consensus” in emerging transnational policy areas. Whether trafficking is portrayed as a migration, law enforcement, human rights or economic problem shapes the kind of policy strategies created to address the issue. Second, what frame prevails over another depends, in part, on the positional advantages and material resources of its main proponents. As the two most powerful actors in the region, the United States and the European Union exert disproportionate influence in promoting a more migration and law enforcement approach to anti-trafficking efforts. Finally, some unintended consequences of implementing anti-trafficking policies to date may be leading to undermining theauthority and legitimacy of the prevailing policy paradigms. Migration and law enforcement approaches can have the unintended effect of exacerbating the vulnerability and exploitation of trafficked persons. To create more effective transnational anti-trafficking policies we might consider the following <strong>shift in focus</strong>. For one, including a wide range of relevant actors can make transnational anti-trafficking policy less top-down. For instance, creating mechanisms in which trafficked persons can be given a direct voice in policy-making can help overcome potential conflicts of interest when service providers, whether local NGOs, governments, or transnational actors, have incentives to interpret their first hand accounts to further a particular agenda. This could assist in resolving disputes between the IOM, which claims that declining shelter numbers can be attributed to law enforcement policies, and their critics who argue the IOM’s migration approach is to blame. Second, the increasing awareness of re-trafficking highlights the limitations of policing, whether of borders or sex work, and turns our attention towards the underlying economic and social causes of trafficking<strong>. Easing strict visa regimes or granting extended</strong> or even permanent <strong>resident status</strong> to <strong>trafficked persons</strong> are two immediate solutions to reduce retrafficking.</span></span><br />

The intertwined issues of human trafficking and prostitution, and the deep divide among transnational moral entrepreneurs as well as governments over the latter’s prohibition in both policy and practice, lead Andreas and Nadelmann to see limited possibilities for success in the global prohibition regime against human trafficki<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; url(http: //www.wikispaces.com/i/a.gif); background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; cursor: pointer; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/1/0/2/8/pages210282/apsa07_proceeding_210282-26.html" rel="nofollow">ng.</a></span></span> <span class="ft1"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; url(http: //www.wikispaces.com/i/a.gif); background-origin: initial; background-position: 100% 50%; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; cursor: pointer; padding-right: 10px;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/1/0/2/8/pages210282/apsa07_proceeding_210282-26.html" rel="nofollow">108</a></span></span> <span class="ft0">Yet a human security approach, by its multifaceted nature, holds out a potential </span><span class="ft3">path to address human trafficking without necessarily becoming paralyzed by the debate over prostitution.

Like the horrible images of injuries to children and noncombatants by land mines, the images and stories of trafficked children, women and men have the potential to create pariahs among those who fail to act. To date, however, the human security approach remains underutilized and its potential unrealized. The Western Balkans offers insights as to why a multifaceted, integrated approach to human trafficking is necessary, and why efforts towards such an approach have fallen short.</span></span></span><br />

Since the early part of the twentieth century, when instability in the Balkans drew in the great powers and provided the spark that ignited World War I, the region has been widely known as a powderkeg. In 1947, for instance, members of the International Court of Justice noted that the Balkans had been &quot;so often described as the `powder-keg' of Europe.&quot;51 Today, the term continues to be attached to the region's politics, conjuring up memories of the origins of World War I. The meaning of the powderkeg metaphor is straightforward: the Balkans can explode at any time, and the resulting conflagration can spread to the rest of Europe; preventing such an explosion is vital to the continent's, and perhaps even to American, security. When Clinton described Kosovo as a powderkeg, he warned that the Kosovo conflict might spill over not only to surrounding Balkan states, but to Europe as a whole; and he insinuated that the United States could be compelled to fight in such a pan-European conflict, just as it did in World Wars I and II. &quot;</span></span><br />

Slave traffickers around the world have rediscovered how profitable it is to buy and sell people. The United Nations believes that the trafficking of human beings is now the third largest source of money for organized crime, after arms and drugs. 9 It has become the world’s fastest growing criminal enterprise, an estimated $9.5 billion per year. The commodities involved in this illicit trade are men, women, and children and the trafficker’s goal is to maximize profits. The sale and distribution of trafficked humans in the U.S. is a global, regional, and national problem. 10 Attracted by huge profits made at minimal risks to the trafficker, criminal organizations at all levels are now involved with this heinous crime. The fall of communism, coupled with deteriorating third world economies, has fueled the dramatic rise of this form of commerce. 11 An ounce of cocaine wholesale is $1200 but you can only sell it once, a woman or child $50-$1000 but you can sell them each day over and over and over again (30 to 40 customers a day), and the markup is unbelievable. 12 Trafficking humans – especially children…enables these international mobsters to play in the wider field…of trafficking drugs, weapons, arms, chemicals, toxic waste, and even piracy on the high seas. Research substantiates indisputable links between human trafficking and organized criminal syndicates the world over. 13</span></span><br />

Ungovernability is defined as &quot;the declining ability of governments worldwide, but particularly in the Third World, to govern and carry out the many and various responsibilities of managing a modern state in an increasingly complex environment.&quot; Ungovernability is characterized by a decline in the rule of law, stagnating economies, and deteriorating infrastructures. The result has been an increasing burden on the international community to take action in support of &quot;failed&quot; states, such as Somalia and Rwanda, when the situation reaches the appropriate moral, legal, humanitarian, and/or security threshold.</span></span><br />

They serve as an incubator for international terrorist groups, such as al Qaeda. Their lack of stable government authority allows them to become transshipment points for illicit drugs, human trafficking, or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (―WMD‖) technologies. In Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, and the former Yugoslavia, failed states have produced catastrophic human rights disasters. Since the end of World War II, far more lives have been lost due to internal wars—many of which occurred in failed states— than to international armed conflicts. Military intervention in response, often led by the United States and its allies, incurs high costs in terms of money, supplies, and lives. Finding a comprehensive and effective solution to the challenges of terrorism, human rights violations, or poverty and economic development requires some understanding of how to restore failed states.</span></span><br />

Conflict creates cover for illicit enrichment - whether it be drugs, natural resources, or the trafficking of weapons and people. It also creates profitable new markets for smuggled goods. In the absence of the rule of law and licit competition, criminal groups fill a lucrative vacuum. Since they profit from instability they have few incentives for peace. Organized crime is therefore a major threat to keeping and building peace, and - because of its transnational nature - has an impact on regional security. As a result, conflicts which may seem tractable drag on for years. &quot;Peacekeepers, peacemakers, and peace-builders are starting to wake up to the impact of crime on conflict, and UNODC has a unique skill set that can address this urgent problem&quot;, says UNODC Spokesman Walter Kemp, &quot;The establishment of the UN Peacebuilding Commission, an ever-expanding number of peacekeeping operations that include a rule of law component, an increased emphasis on conflict prevention, and greater attention to the political economy of conflict all demonstrate the need for expertise in dealing with organized crime in fragile situations&quot;, says Mark Shaw, Chief of UNODC's Integrated Programming Unit. Yet expertise is relatively limited. As the Executive Director of UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa has pointed out, &quot;we need more specialists to fight organized crime. Under the UN flag, there are more than 130,000 soldiers and 10,000 police. Yet, the UN has less than a dozen experts on organized crime. How can we answer the calls for help when we have few people to send?&quot; UNODC is taking steps to rectify this problem, both within the UN system and among Member States. &quot;UNODC is well-positioned to play a key role in this area since we are the guardian of the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the developer of a number of key tools to strengthen criminal justice in post-conflict settings&quot;, says UNODC Director of Operations Francis Maertens. One such tool was launched in New York on 11 February - Model Codes for Post-Conflict Criminal Justice which was produced in partnership with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the US Institute for Peace, and the Irish Centre for Human Rights. &quot;Blue helmets get most of the attention when people think about building peace and security&quot;, said Mr. Costa at the launch, &quot;but long-term security depends first and foremost on the creation or restoration of the rule of law, and that is what this Model Code is for&quot;.</span></span><br />

The owner of the [spa] . . . was charged with human trafficking and maintaining a place of prostitution. Employee Min Ye was charged with solicitation. Another employee, Dan Kim, was charged with two counts of indecent exposure.&quot; n297 Even though the owner was charged with human trafficking, those he had victimized were not treated as victims, but rather charged with the crimes of solicitation and indecent exposure. n298 The market for human trafficking will not be shut down by charging the owner with human trafficking but failing to identify victims like Min Ye and Dan Kim as true victims of trafficking. As discussed in Section I, to close down the market for human trafficking requires efforts to address both the demand and supply for victims. n299 In this case the trafficker was charged with human trafficking, thus increasing the cost of operation and deterring his future demand to utilized victims of trafficking in his business. n300 However, the victims were not identified as victims; rather they were treated as criminals and not provided rehabilitation services. Thus, the supply of victims has not been decreased because their likelihood of being trafficked again for the purposes of sexual exploitation is increased. n301 As illustrated by this example, the failure to identify victims of trafficking as victims leads to several consequences influencing both supply and demand for human trafficking. First, if trafficked persons are not identified as victims, they may be precluded from accessing needed medical assistance, counseling, educational, financial, or other services provided to assist victims in the [*714] reintegration process. n302 If victims are treated as criminals and not provided access to rehabilitation services, the probability that they will not successfully reintegrate into society is in-creased. Thus, these non-identified victims will be more susceptible to being re-trafficked, increasing the supply of victims. n303 Furthermore, if victims are not identified as such it increases the probability that traffickers will not be charged with human trafficking. This failure to increase the potential penalties for traffickers leads to no change in the cost of operation for traffickers, which in turn does make any impact on demand for victims. n304 For these reasons, <strong>the inclusion of the definition of a victim of human trafficking in national legislation and international agreements is essential to influencing both the supply and demand for trafficking victims</strong>. In addition to including a victim definition, it is necessary to educate law enforcement personnel, individuals providing rehabilitation services, and other persons who may come in contact with trafficking victims on the definition and the rights of victims under the law. A beneficial aspect of the agreements and legislation discussed above is their inclusion of provisions regarding educational efforts for these professionals. n305 Further, these agreements and legislation contain education and awareness campaigns targeted at informing potential victims of tactics used by traffickers and the dangers inherent in trafficking. n306 However, there is a need to increase the awareness of the general public in both countries of origin and destination, and of the consumers of sexual services in countries of destination, that trafficking is not a victimless crime.</span></span><br />

 Plan: The United States federal government should remove cooperation with prosecution and the &quot;severe&quot; qualifier as requirements of T-visa recipients.<br />
<br />
Currently, there is a low number of t-visa applicants due to stiff eligibility requirements<br />

(Hussein Sadruddin, Natalia Walter, Jose Hidalgo, ?SYMPOSIUM: GLOBALIZATION, SECURITY &amp; HUMAN RIGHTS: IMMIGRTATION IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY: HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THE UNITED STATES: EXPANDING VICTIM PROTECTION BEYOND PROSECUTION WITNESSES?, 16 Stan. L. &amp; Pol'y Rev 379, Lexis Law, Stanford Law &amp; Policy Review)<br />
<br />
Because we in the United States tend to think of slavery as something relegated to the past, the numbers are as shocking as the nature of the crime - between 600,000 and 800,000 victims trafficked internationally, with tens of thousands trafficked into or within the United States every year. n66 What is almost as disturbing is the shockingly low numbers of victims that have been granted protection in the more than three years since this broad anti-trafficking law went into effect. Despite multi-million dollar programs, victim identification has been extremely slow, and federal agencies have recognized [*392] that they are not finding victims at an &quot;acceptable rate.&quot; n67 There is a &quot;significant difference between the estimated number of people trafficked into the United States annually and the number of victims that the U.S. government has reached.&quot; n68 The nature of this crime - underground and often under-acknowledged - contributes to an inability to determine the precise number of people victimized by traffickers. Even different parts of the U.S. government do not agree on the number of victims granted benefits. n69 Given the large number of victims, Congress estimated that 5000 temporary visas would be needed per year and placed an annual cap on T-visas at that number. n70 Similarly, the number of permanent residence grants based on trafficking victim status are capped at 5000 per year. n71 The T-visa cap has not come close to being reached in any of the three years reported so far. n72 In fact, of the estimated tens of thousands of victims in the United States annually, only a few hundred have been identified and protected since the TVPA became law. n73 By March 2005, fewer than 500 victim-witnesses had been granted temporary trafficking victim T visas since the law went into effect in 2000. n74 On March 23, 2005, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Vermont Service Center, which adjudicates all T visa applications, reported [*393] that a total of 478 T-1 visas had been granted and 496 denied. n75 Additionally, by the end of fiscal year 2003, the ICE reported that a total of 374 victim-witnesses had been granted temporary &quot;continued presence&quot; status in order to assist law enforcement with trafficking prosecutions. n76 It is likely that many of those granted continued presence were the same victims later granted T-visa status; thus, the actual number of victims protected may be lower than the totals would suggest. In the same fiscal year, the Department of Justice reported that it had 153 ongoing human trafficking investigations, had filed 12 human trafficking cases under the TVPA, charged 31 defendants under the criminal provisions of the TVPA, and secured 26 convictions for human trafficking. n77 Furthermore, 151 trafficking victims were provided certification and benefit eligibility letters by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in fiscal year 2003. n78 As of March 2005, HHS reported a total of 651 letters of certification issued to human trafficking victims. n79 Thus, over the course of four years, the law granted benefits to several hundred victims out of a pool of tens of thousands. Something is not working. Unfortunately, the government statistics do not provide enough detail to allow analysis of why there have been so few grants of benefits to trafficking victims. More precise information is needed about how the victims were identified, who identified them, how many identified victims were unable or unwilling to assist law enforcement, and how many of those victims were deported without receiving any assistance. Law enforcement agents who applied for legal status on behalf of a victim had more than one-fourth of their continued presence requests denied in 2003. n80 Similarly, many of the T-visa applications were denied. We do not know whether the applications were denied for inability to meet the immigration eligibility requirements or for other reasons. More detailed statistics will give a better understanding of the barriers to receiving victim benefits. While each of these grants of benefits surely represents a life saved, there are thousands more that could be saved if the TVPA were a more effective protection tool for victims. It is obvious that most of the tens of thousands of victims trafficked into the country each year are not found or protected by this law, despite the multi-million dollar anti-trafficking programs. The government reports suggest several explanations for the large gaps between the numbers of estimated victims and those identified and protected: the law is new; law enforcement personnel and community groups need training to understand and recognize the existence of human trafficking; and prosecutions of this type are [*394] extremely complex and require tremendous resources. n81 We would argue, however, that it is the law itself - the TVPA - which, despite its &quot;victim protection&quot; language, actually promulgated eligibility standards for benefits that not only burden victims, but also hamper law enforcement. Although the TVPRA attempted to ameliorate the TVPA, it did not effectively address its main shortcomings.<br />

Advantage 1 is Human Rights Credibility<br />
<br />
American HR cred is currently being devastated by inability to prescribe to international norms<br />
<br />
Koh ?9, (Harold Hongju, professor of international law and dean at Yale Law School, ?Speech: Repairing Our Human Rights Reputation,? Lexis)<br />
When I was a diplomat for the United States government, I was always struck by how seriously other countries would listen to what Americans had to say. They listened to us because we were powerful, sure, but they thought us powerful because they thought we were principled. Our commitments to human rights and the rule of law were seen a major source of our soft power. But in the last few years, sadly, much of this has changed. I travel a lot. Maybe you do too. And if you have traveled abroad in the last few years, you cannot help but notice the steady decline of our global human rights reputation. In the last six years, we have gone from being viewed as the major supporter of the international human rights system to its major target. Our obsessive focus on the War on Terror has taken an extraordinary toll upon our global human rights policy. Seven years of defining our human rights policy through the lens of the War on Terror have clouded our human rights reputation, given cover to abuses committed by our allies in that &quot;war&quot; and have blunted our ability to criticize and deter gross violators elsewhere in the world. After September 11, we were viewed with universal sympathy as victims of a brutal attack. But we have responded with a series of unnecessary, self-inflicted wounds, which have gravely diminished America's standing as the world's human rights leader. You know the list as well as I do: The horror of Abu Ghraib Our disastrous policy on Guantanamo Our tolerance of torture and cruel treatment for detainees Our counterproductive decision to create military commissions Warrantless government wiretapping Our attack on the U.N. and its human rights bodies, including the International Criminal Court FWhatever you may think of these policies, there can be little doubt that the impact on our human rights reputation has been devastating. A recent survey showed that in 1998, a vast majority of our European allies thought thought the United States was doing a good job in the area of human rights leadership. Today, a vast majority feel the opposite, and most Europeans believe that our policies on Guantanamo are illegal. In a recent Pew Global Attitudes survey, favorable opinions of the United States had fallen in most of our 15 closest allies -including Spain, India and Indonesia-even though those polled largely shared our views as to the greatest dangers in the world. And in these countries, amazingly, America's continuing presence in Iraq is cited as a danger to world peace at least as often as the growing threat of Iran.<br />

Now is the key time to boost HR cred by supporting international systems ? alt causes don?t matter, we can reverse the pendulum<br />

Koh ?9, (Harold Hongju, professor of international law and dean at Yale Law School, ?Speech: Repairing Our Human Rights Reputation,? Lexis)<br />
Fourth and finally, we need to support, not attack the institutions and tools of international law. I know that international law and the U.N. are imperfect; but frankly, they are all we've got. We need to support the International Criminal Court, and to endorse universal standards by ratifying such human rights treaties as the Convention on Disability Rights, the Convention Against Forced Disappearances, the UN Treaty for Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Right now, amazingly, we are one of only two countries in the world that is not a party to the Children's Rights treaty. The other is Somalia, whose excuse is that they have no organized government. We have no excuse. I know that the last eight years since 9/11 have been tiring. But in fact, the last eight years are far less important than the next 8 years: For the next eight years will determine whether the pendulum of American policy will swing back from where it has been pushed, or whether it will stay stuck in the direction in which it has been pushed for the last 8 years? In the next eight years, we simply cannot allow our policy toward international law and human rights be subsumed entirely under the War on Terror. There are simply too many other global issues that demand our country's attention. And believe me, this should not be a partisan point: One presidential candidate recently wrote: &quot;We Americans recall the words of our founders in the declaration of independence, that we must pay &quot;decent respect to the opinions of mankind&quot;. .. We all have to live up to our own high standards of morality and international responsibility. We cannot torture or treat inhumanely the suspected terrorists that we have captured. We will fight the terrorists and at the same time defend the rights that are the foundations of our society.&quot; The speaker was John McCain, but the same views have been expressed just as strongly by Senator Obama, who said: &quot;We are going to lead by example, by maintaining the highest standards of civil liberties and human rights, which is why I will close Guantanamo and restore habeas corpus and say no to torture. ... Because if you are ready for change, then you can elect a president who has taught the Constitution, and believes in the Constitution, and will obey the Constitution of the USA.&quot; Obviously, we must ask our government officials to speak up for these steps-to tell the truth, to end double standards, to put our own house in order, and to support law and institutions. But the truth is, whatever Administration is elected next year, its leaders will have their own reasons why they cannot change course immediately.<br />

Focus on crime control and the emphasis on protecting only the ?severely? trafficked devastates our human rights credibility<br />
Hartsough 02 JD Candidate @ Hastings College of Law,<br />
(Tala, ?Asylum for Trafficked Women: Escape Strategies Beyond the T Visa? Hastings Women?s Law Journal, 13 Hastings Women?s L.J. 77)<br />
<br />
Although the legislative history of the Act indicates concern for the victims of trafficking and recognizes that trafficking violates women's human rights, the T visa is a limited option. It limits the class of people who are eligible n253 and places a numerical limit on the number of visas granted each year. n254 At most, 5000 people per year will be granted T visas. n255 In addition to providing relief for a limited number of trafficked persons, the Act focuses on crime-fighting, ignoring prevalent human rights issues. A statement made by one of the Act's sponsors evidences the prioritization of the Act as a crime bill. &quot;The legislation further includes the creation of a new form of visa for trafficking victims. This will substantially allow for more aggressive prosecution, as well as the protection of these witness victims.&quot; n256 The relief from deportation is inexorably linked to the crime-fighting mechanism of requiring cooperation and testimony. International human rights authorities and non-governmental organizations have expressed skepticism about a crime control approach adequately protecting the human rights of victims of trafficking. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, wrote regarding the U.N. Trafficking Protocol: &quot;it is important in this context to note that victim protection must be considered separately from witness protection, as not all victims of trafficking will be selected by [*102] investigating and prosecuting agencies to act as witnesses in criminal pro-ceedings.&quot; n257 The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women expressed concern that the international instrument dealing with trafficking, the U.N. Trafficking Protocol, &quot;is being elaborated in the context of crime control, rather than with a focus on human rights.&quot; n258 The Special Rapporteur's report on trafficking also highlighted concern about individual countries adopting this crime-fighting approach. &quot;On the issue of trafficking, Governments overwhelmingly adopt a law and order approach, with an accompanying strong anti-immigration policy. Such an approach is often at odds with the protection of human rights.&quot; n259 The Act's emphasis on protecting only those subject to &quot;severe&quot; forms of trafficking and facing &quot;extreme hardship&quot; upon removal, as well as its crime-fighting requirements, compromise the protection that should be afforded all people trafficked into the United States. Excluding some victims of trafficking from removal protection amounts to forced repatriation and is inconsistent with human rights norms. n260 Those women who are granted temporary stays in the United States should not have their rights violated by being detained and prosecuted. n261<br />

Responses to human trafficking are the litmus test of our credibility ? only shifting to a human rights based approach solves<br />
Dr. Christal Morehouse completed her Ph.D. in political science at Humboldt University in Berlin, ?Combating human trafficking: policy gaps and hidden political agendas in the USA and Germany?, VS Verlag, 2009 p262-263<br />
<br />
Since 1904, the international community has formalized its work to understand what human trafficking encompasses. Starting from a partial approach by addressing one victim-group (i.e. white women) and one type of labor exploitation (e.g. sex trafficking), the international community expanded its understanding of this issue and with this the ability to take action to reduce its scope. Over the past one hundred years, the international community has slowly put together the pieces of the human trafficking puzzle. It has led anti human trafficking efforts since the abolition of institutional slavery and influenced national legislation in the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany. After decades of slow evolution the international policy framework has progressed from a rough block of metal and emerged as a sharpened needle. The impetus of national efforts to define and stem human trafficking has drawn from the international community?s long-term efforts to build a comprehensive anti trafficking policy framework. Yet this instrument is not perfect. This highly developed policy tool should continue to be improved. At the national level, government and societal responses to human trafficking are a litmus test of the strength and quality of our democracies. This analysis has shown that both the German and American Governments have made earnest efforts to address the problem of human trafficking by creating robust anti human trafficking policy frameworks. Both have learned from their engagement with this issue at the international level. Yet in the national context, the sharpened anti human trafficking policy-needle has been dulled by policy gaps and hidden agendas. Hence national human trafficking policies are subordinated to competing and incompatible policy objectives that jeopardize the primary goal. These policy gaps and hidden agendas cast doubt on the commitment of both governments to stopping human trafficking and to doing so by means of a human rights approach. The recommendations made in this analysis not only shed light on these hidden political agendas and gaps in policy in the United States of America and the Federal Republic of Germany, they also propose how to improve policy in both countries. The suggested changes could increase the protection of human trafficking victims, improve information on the scope and nature of human trafficking, as well as enhance the ability of governments to prosecute perpetrators. Both the German and the US Governments could profit from a closer comparison and exchange of their anti human trafficking policies and initiatives. This analysis could in turn act as a springboard for increased exchange and learning. Combating human trafficking is not an isolated policy niche that concerns only a few select experts. Although the immediate consequences of human trafficking are felt most intensely by the victims of the crime, it is nonetheless an issue that concerns the whole of society.<br />

Rights spill over ? plan is key first step<br />
<br />
Powell ?8 (Catherine, Associate Professor of Law, Fordham Law School, Human Rights at Home: A Domestic Policy Blueprint for the New Administration, American Constitution Society for Law and Policy, Oct)<br />
One of the bedrock principles of the human rights framework is the interdependence of rights. Eschewing debates over whether the United States has achieved more progress in racial justice or gender justice, for example, a human rights perspective views all forms of justice and all forms of rights as inter-related. Therefore, just as the struggle for racial equality has been a key engine fueling gains in women?s equality, so too the movement for gender equality has broadened the constituency and support for racial justice (going back to the abolition movement). Likewise, rights in one area, such as the right to health care, depend on rights in other areas, such as the right to equality. With home foreclosures, we have seen how the right to vote (and therefore to political empowerment) depends on the right to housing, since registering to vote may depend on providing proof of residence.20 Similarly, Hurricane Katrina exposed the stark connections between race and poverty. The right to food (and the component rights to be free of hunger, malnutrition, and famine) is dependent on rights to free speech, a free press, and an open political system ? all of which help prevent shortages caused by poor economic choices and policies.21 A stronger embrace of human rights ideals and practices could assist in the development of strategies that seek to address the inter-related nature of many of our social justice problems.22<br />

Current attempts to reform China?s HR policies will inevitably fail, now is the key time for the US to take action and avoid the worst impacts of Chinese military and economic competition<br />

Currie ?10 (Kelley, Senior Fellow at the Project 2049 Institute working on issues related to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the Asia-Pacific region, Time for new dialogue for China human rights, The Daily Caller, 5/13, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/05/13/time-for-new-dialogue-for-china-human-rights/" rel="nofollow">http://dailycaller.com/2010/05/13/time-for-new-dialogue-for-china-human-rights/</a>)<br />
The latest session of the U.S.-China bilateral human rights dialogue is taking place in Washington this week, the first such meeting since May 2008. These sporadic, formulaic meetings long ceased to be useful in addressing China?s most serious human rights offenses. They have degenerated into surreal exchanges that give equal time and weight to Chinese critiques of America?s human rights ?problems? and Chinese filibusters on the ?progress? China is making in developing the ?rule of law.? There is little reason to expect this upcoming dialogue will see any improvement, particularly given the low priority that the Obama administration has placed on human rights issues in the larger context of the U.S.-China relationship. The Obama team is anyway looking ahead to the ?more important? Strategic and Economic Dialogue that is scheduled to take place in Beijing later this month. The U.S. and other Western democracies have long struggled with the challenge of finding a meaningful and effective means of engaging China on issues of human rights and political reform. As China has become more powerful and influential on the world stage, its illiberal policies at home and abroad have created new challenges for human rights advocates on a global scale. While there has long been a segment of the China policy community that dismissed or minimized concerns about China?s human rights record, even some long-time activists became discouraged in recent years by Beijing?s seeming imperviousness to international and domestic human rights critiques, as well as the steady diminution of protests from Western democracies. Using a combination of incentives, coercion and cooptation, China has been incredibly successful in its long-running efforts to reshape the international discourse on its human rights record, and marginalize human rights advocacy directed at it. In addition, over the past three decades, as global perceptions of China became more positive and relations between China and democratic countries evolved, criticism of China?s human rights practices has receded in both importance and volume relative to other countries? overall discourse on China. China and other leading countries now engage each other in a radical different fashion than they did 10 years ago. There have been several landmark events and particular dynamics that have fundamentally altered the landscape. For American activists and advocacy organizations, the establishment of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with China marked a critical turning point. Prior to PNTR, the annual debate on renewal of China?s Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status in the United States Congress provided a unique annual opportunity to discuss China?s human rights record. Because there had to be a vote on MFN every year, there was a guaranteed public, meaningful, high-level, inter-branch policy debate about the nature of the Chinese regime and U.S. response to it. Efforts to develop alternative venues for continuing meaningful debate about human rights in China largely fizzled after the passage of PNTR, and advocates of human rights in China have never recovered from the loss of this important forum. The deterioration of United Nations human rights mechanisms and abdication of leadership on human rights issues by the UN has further weakened international efforts to support human rights in China. After China easily turned back several UN Human Rights Commission resolutions condemning its human rights practices, Western governments stopped pursuing such resolutions altogether. The Commission?s successor organization, the UN Human Rights Council, has proven even more feckless ? an intentional feature as a result of heavy Chinese involvement in its design. China has also engaged in a sustained and successful effort to block non-government organizations? (NGO) advocacy efforts at various UN forums, using the UN NGO credentialing system to restrict critics? access to meetings, treaty bodies and committees. Western governments have done little to fight back. As the utility of UN mechanisms collapsed, many Western countries pinned their hopes on engagement with China through bilateral human rights dialogues of the sort taking place this week. These dialogues initially proliferated between Western governments and the PRC. Some advocacy groups and NGOs found them to be useful forums for both pushing their own governments to focus on China?s poor human rights practices and, in some cases, a venue for direct contact with Chinese officials who would otherwise never directly encounter Western human rights campaigners. At a time when there were few other bilateral dialogues with China, the human rights channel was a major feature of Western democracies? interactions with the Chinese government. After initially scoring some successes, such as political prisoner releases and changes to PRC laws criminalizing certain political behavior, however, these dialogues increasingly became empty bureaucratic exercises. The cramped agendas proceed on the basis of the ?equality? of the human rights practices of the two sides, and with an out-sized focus on legalistic issues where China could claim substantial gains and sharpen its critiques of its dialogue partner. Dialogues with European countries increasingly focused on their ?technical assistance? programs, and some of the most useful dialogues with formerly communist Eastern European countries were shut down altogether. China successfully pressured dialogue partners to exclude critical NGO voices that had previously participated in talks, and certainly never engaged its own growing grassroots NGO sector in the dialogue process. As a result, the dialogues were transformed into heavily scripted government-to-government exchanges that relegate human rights issues to a bilateral backwater. Several recent events, however, have demonstrated the serious dangers posed by a China that achieves economic preeminence and military parity with the developed West while resisting political liberalization at home, and exposed the need for a renewal of international human rights strategies on China. As a result, there is growing interest among advocates?and new potential partners outside the human rights community?in identifying and employing a more effective approach to human rights in China. This opening has, in a real sense, been created by China?s increasing intransigence and belligerence on the world stage, and the Chinese authorities? severe retrenchment on human rights issues at home. The long-time mantra of the human rights community ? that the authoritarian nature of China?s regime has consequences beyond the fate of a few dissidents and Tibetans ? is starting to resonate. The convergence of these forces can be seen most vividly in the Google spying and censorship case. Google?s announcement that it would no longer censor its search engine results in China as required by the government, and its concurrent charge that Chinese hackers had penetrated its secure servers, both to steal proprietary code and to snoop into human rights activists? private email accounts, was a perfect illustration of how China?s illiberal government policies and practices impact those hoping to do business under this regime. More broadly, recent opinion polls have shown increasing dissatisfaction with Chinese economic policies among multi-national corporations, and China?s approval ratings dropping in other countries. The willingness of some businesses to go public with their concerns and even explicitly link the harm their business suffers to China?s political model is a sea change from the past. The challenge for the human rights community now is to take maximum advantage of this potential opening to rebuild a more durable, effective coalition in support of human rights in China. They should do this through vigorous outreach to groups outside the traditional human rights community who are increasingly attuned to the downside of Chinese autarky: the business community, security analysts, internet freedom advocates, faith communities, environmental activists, and especially local and regional activists in Asia. Once the coalition has been expanded, it needs to be more strategic and targeted in its approach. This means developing strategies that play to the strengths of a loose-knit, diverse group working across open societies, and similarly exploits the weaknesses of China?s brittle, top-down authoritarian structure and political culture. There also needs to be a considered effort to find ways of supporting the most vulnerable activists working for change inside China.<br />

Trafficking is a key point at which the US can engage China on HR ? past resistance can be overcome by increasing HR cred and supporting like interests<br />
<br />
Schulz ?9 (William F., Senior Fellow at Center for American Progress, ?Strategic Persistence: How the United States Can Help Improve Human Rights in China,? Center for American Progress, January 29, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/01/china_human_rights.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2009/01/china_human_rights.html</a>)<br />
The relationship between the United States and China may well be the most important bilateral relationship in the world. In recognition of that fact, the Center for American Progress released a comprehensive report in August 2008, entitled ?A Global Imperative: A Progressive Approach to U.S.-China Relations in the 21st Century,? that addressed all aspects of U.S.-China relations. Building upon that report, ?Strategic Persistence: How the United States Can Help Improve Human Rights in China? is designed to provide both fundamental principles that should guide U.S. policymakers in their efforts to effect positive change in China?s human rights practices and concrete recommendations to advance those efforts. Despite significant progress in realizing social and economic rights and even some increases in individual freedoms, China remains responsible for profound violations of its people?s civil and political rights. In its foreign policy, China has often backed repressive regimes around the world and watered down international sanctions against them. None of this is in the United States? best interests. Given the high degree of economic interdependence between the United States and China and China?s growing military reach, American interests are best served by a stable China with a robust commitment to the rule of law?conditions that are undermined by a failure to respect human rights. U.S. approaches to human rights in China have ranged from confrontation to passivity and have rarely reflected a coordinated strategy across government entities. The key to U.S. efforts to promote human rights in China is to take a coherent, pragmatic, non-ideological approach that goes beyond easy rhetoric, taking advantage of strategic openings and recognizing the value of persistence. Ultimately, China must be persuaded that greater democracy and human rights are in its own best interests, integral to its becoming the highly respected global leader it aspires to be. This paper outlines eight principles that should inform the U.S. approach to improving human rights in China: Calibrate our strategy to China?s unique circumstances. China is a major power and the United States has a multiplicity of interests in relation to it. Human rights policy must take those facts into account. Develop separate strategies for democracy promotion and human rights. The two are related, but they are not identical. Each deserves its own carefully designed approach. Opt preferentially for carrots over sticks. The United States? capacity to ?punish? China is limited and generally ineffective. The United States should not hesitate to criticize China as appropriate, but our preference should be for reinforcing positive changes. Understanding is not condoning. China faces an array of profound challenges. The United States should acknowledge them in order to know better how to influence the Chinese government. Appeal to China?s interests and connect the dots. Human rights are in China?s own best interests, but the Chinese government rarely perceives that to be the case and often misjudges how others will respond to its actions. Wherever possible, the United States should base its appeals on China?s own needs. Globalize the pressure and encourage China to play by the world?s rules. The United States cannot change China?s human rights practices by itself. Some of the most effective pressure will come from other nations encouraging China to live up to the global standards expected of a world leader. Seek common ground but take advantage of internal divisions over human rights. In some areas, such as trafficking of persons, China?s interests and those of the United States are fully aligned. On other issues, such as the utility of ?reeducation through labor? camps, the Chinese are themselves divided. The United States should be alert to both circumstances. Ignore the rhetoric, don?t be distracted and never give up. China is not immutable to pressure despite its occasionally extreme rhetoric. The United States must speak with one voice and recognize that improvement in China?s human rights practices may be a long time coming. This paper then applies these principles in a series of recommendations designed to increase the coherence of U.S. strategy and address openings provided by U.S. efforts to boost: Trade and investment Access to the Internet by Chinese citizens Labor rights Efforts to combat trafficking in persons Religious freedom Human rights in Tibet and Xinjiang Chinese foreign policy with respect to repressive regimes These eight principles and the recommendations that follow will, we believe, enable the new Obama administration and the 111th Congress to make substantial progress on human rights in China and in China?s human rights-related foreign policy. This paper concludes, however, by recognizing that persistence above all is required of those who seek to advance human rights.<br />

Economic cooperation dominates the US-Sino relationship but current HR pressure will derail progress. Matching policy to rhetoric and strengthening UN cred is critical to ensure cohesion and peaceful rise<br />

Dalpino ?8 (Catharin, Visiting Associate Professor @ Asian Studies Program at Georgetown University Human Rights, ?Asia and the New Administration: Can Multilateralism Work This Time?,? Brookings, December, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/12_multilateralism_dalpino.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/12_multilateralism_dalpino.aspx</a>)<br />
Despite this continuity, the incoming administration will face unprecedented challenges in the promotion of human rights in Asia. However, it will also find new opportunities and even the potential for a fresh approach to this issue area. The ongoing economic crisis will affect several, if not all, areas of U.S. relations with Asia, particularly with China. The global economic powers, which now obviously include China, will need to work closely to avert further downturns. Beijing?s status as the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, combined with the world?s increasing dependence on Chinese economic growth, ensure that economics will play a central, if not totally dominant, role in bilateral relations early in the new administration. Raising the profile of human rights problems with Beijing at this time could make coordination in other policy areas more difficult. Moreover, if Asia is able to weather the economic storm better than the West, a second round of the ?Asian values? debate could easily commence if the U.S. takes too strident a position on rights. Given the perception of the United States as the epicenter of the crisis, combined with current large-scale government intervention in the U.S. economy, the free market ideology and the linkages between political and economic freedoms that the West trumpeted in the 1990s will strike many Asians as suspect, if not laughable. In addition, the like-minded countries that had been willing to join the United States in human rights demarches and other policy initiatives ? many of them European Union countries ? face a similar dilemma in their relations with the Asian economic powers, especially China. In human rights policy, the new administration could offset some of this negativity by moving quickly to address the abuses that have resulted from the war against terrorism and the Iraq war. Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, rendition and the debate over torture have taken a serious toll on the image of the United States as a defender of rights in the past seven years. Doing so will improve the U.S. image worldwide and may increase Washington?s influence on human rights issues. In Asia, it will have even greater impact countries with significant Muslim populations, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand President-Elect Obama?s commitment to multilateralism could also be a major asset, in broader U.S. relations with Asia and in the more specific area of rights. However, the structure and content of this new multilateralism will be important determinants. Attempts to organize multinational coalitions to criticize China, as with the mid-1990s efforts with the UN Human Rights Commission, are not likely to succeed. Asian countries have long resisted efforts to circle the wagons around China on rights issues and could be even less inclined toward this approach in the current economic environment. Repeated proposals for a ?Helsinki Process? in Asia over the past two decades have foundered because of resistance from Asian governments. More broadly, the bureaucratic process to handle human rights issues in United Nations and other international institutions has changed in recent years. In 2006 the UN Commission on Human Rights was replaced with the UN Human Rights Council, which reports directly to the General Assembly. The United States has maintained an arms-length distance from the new Council, primarily because of its negative focus on Israel and relative neglect of such countries as Burma and Cuba. However, the UN also fields a number of Special Rapporteurs to some countries with problematic rights records, one of which is Burma. At this juncture, the better prospects for multilateral cooperation on rights may be those that include, rather than target, China and focus on countries where rights abuses are of epic proportions. Building on the view of China as a ?global stakeholder,? the new administration should seek to draw China more closely into efforts to address ongoing gross human rights abuse in the Sudan, as well as to seek new approaches ? from China and other Asian powers ? that might help move the Burmese regime off its longstanding political intransigence. If the Six-Party process on North Korea proves to be effective, a multilateral approach to promoting human rights in North Korea may also be appropriate. This is probably a distant goal: Pyongyang is not likely to realize the same political benefits in a rights framework that it does in a non-proliferation process and could well resist. However, if and when human rights in North Korea becomes a multilateral issue, China will again be a critical player. Human rights advocacy resists relativism and some will oppose the idea of putting greater effort into gaining Chinese cooperation on problems in other countries than in pointing out human rights abuses within China. However, this should not be confused with more traditional tradeoffs, in which human rights concerns are sometimes downplayed for the sake of security or economic policy. This approach is itself grounded in human rights, with the possible (but not guaranteed) long-term outcome that cooperating with the international community on rights initiatives could have a positive spillover effect on the Chinese domestic environment. An informal international coalition on Burma policy has developed in recent years. It includes the United States, European Union, Japan, China, ASEAN and India, although New Delhi is uncomfortable with pushing Burma if it undermines India?s new ?Look East? policy in Southeast Asia. The new administration will have the opportunity to fill the new position of U.S. Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma, which will hold the rank of Ambassador, and it should do so at an early opportunity. However, this new position should be a gate which swings both ways, in which the Special Representative not only pursues U.S. policy interests vigorously but also educates the U.S. policy community on the views of the coalition partners. There is a growing consensus among Asian governments that the West?s policy on Burma is morally correct but outdated and ineffective. If the United States automatically rejects ideas for new avenues to promote greater freedom in Burma from this coalition, it will lose credibility in Asia as an international partner. Lastly, the new administration should take up new opportunities to encourage Asian regional institutions to develop human rights frameworks and dialogues. The new ASEAN Charter includes a commitment for ASEAN to establish a human rights body, although its responsibilities are not specified. Washington should take care not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good in this case, and should support any movement toward a credible regional human rights framework, however incremental. The newly-established position of U.S. Ambassador for ASEAN Affairs should make the United States more acceptable as an interlocutor on this issue. Signing the ASEAN Treaty of Amity and Cooperation early in the new administration would strengthen U.S. bona fides further. The United States should also consider ways to support the new Bali Democratic Forum, founded by Indonesia in concert with Australia, which seeks to promote political liberalization in the region but does not take the ideological approach of excluding countries that do not meet the criteria of a formal democracy. A more open-minded and multilateral approach to human rights in Asia early in the new administration will help to counter the negative image of the United States that has arisen in recent years in some Asian quarters ? particularly in Muslim Southeast Asia ? of a tone-deaf, unilateralist superpower. Beyond the potential gains for U.S. ?soft power,? a more multilateral approach may also yield dividends in the promotion of rights, both in Asia and on a more global scale. However, this should be a shift in emphasis rather than a complete renunciation of all other policy approaches. The United States should not abandon human rights in its bilateral relations, nor should it view multilateralism as a panacea. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is aspirational. It sets out a comprehensive list of rights but does not prescribe a path by which to pursue them. On the 60th anniversary of the Declaration, with a new administration in the wings, the United States has a unique opportunity for serious contemplation of its role in that profound effort.<br />

Advantage 2 is the Ethics of Trafficking<br />
<br />
Trafficking represents the upmost violation of human dignity<br />

<br />
&quot;Human trafficking is an offense against human dignity, a crime in which human beings, many of them teenagers and young children, are bought and sold and often sexually abused by violent criminals.&quot; n10 It affects a disproportionate number of women and children from some of the poorest nations. n11 These victims have little power to combat their captors, as they are extremely vulnerable, often choosing the better of two desolate situations. n12 The most common victims of trafficking are citizens of countries that cannot provide the basic necessities of life whose only chance of survival is to leave to pursue a better life in the United States or elsewhere. n13 A trafficker may be able to offer them this chance, but at a very high cost. Trafficking may occur across borders or within a nation, and may not involve any movement at all, as long as it involves holding a victim against their will - usually through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. n14 Most often the victims, lured by promises of employment, are held against their will, and through the use of force or threats, are sexually exploited or put to forced labor. n15 The compelled labor may involve prostitution, field labor, work in sweatshops or garment [*854] factories, exotic dancing, and street peddling. n16 The victims are deprived of all of their rights, including their opportunity to leave and return home. n17 One of the most egregious cases of trafficking and forced prostitution took place in Florida in 1997. n18 Leading the prostitution ring was the Cardenas-Sosa family - a close-knit extended family from Mexico who preyed on young Mexican girls and women, smuggling them across the border and into one of six brothels, where they were forced to have sex with migrant workers. n19 The women were lured by promises of work in the United States as waitresses, landscapers and nannies. n20 They were held by the Cadenas under threats that their families would be killed, and they were beaten, raped, or confined in the dark at gunpoint for several days if they resisted in any way. n21 They worked six days a week, twelve hours a day, servicing as many as thirty-five clients in one shift. n22 The ringleader and six other men were eventually caught, convicted, and sentenced to up to a mere fifteen years of incarceration. n23 Many others involved in the trafficking ring escaped safely to Mexico without prosecution. n24 This is clearly an unsatisfactory ending to such a terrible story; however, the case is ongoing and the Department of Justice (DOJ) has reported that several other Cardenas family members have been found in Mexico and eventually prosecuted. n25 Not all victims of trafficking are forced to work as prostitutes or in other forms of sexual exploitation. n26 Many victims are brought to the United States in the same manner as described above, but instead are forced to perform hard labor for little or no compensation. n27 In a [*855] more recent New York case, United States v. Sabhani, et al., two defendants held their victims as slaves in their luxurious home in Long Island. n28 The victims were forced to sleep on mats on the floor, barely fed, threatened with violence, and were frequently beaten. n29 The couple was eventually convicted of forced labor and harboring illegal aliens for keeping the two Indonesian women in their home. n30 There is, however, no mention of the length of the sentence that they received. n31 Trafficking is indeed a &quot; &quot;form of modern day slavery' and has become&quot; more profitable as a result of globalization, which has increased the ease of moving goods and services in the international market. n32 Although state sanctioned slavery no longer exists, the demand for cheap labor and prostitutes continues. As a result, a black market of trafficking of human beings has arisen to fill that demand. n33<br />

Takes the value to life<br />
Machan, professor of philosophy at Auburn, 1995<br />
(Tibor, Private Rights and Public Illusions, pg 65)<br />
The legal system that promotes human dignity most successfully is the one that supports every individual?s natural human rights. That is because such human rights, when fully respected, secure for everyone the full opportunity (within the bounds of nature) to act as a moral agent rather than as a subject of another moral agent. The most vital social condition for any person is the honoring of his or her dignity. If someone?s dignity is destroyed, all other benefits that person reaps from others amount to very little and certainly serve as no compensation. Trading one?s dignity is akin to selling one?s soul: it takes away one?s essential identity as the human being one is.<br />

Side constraint<br />
Petro, Wake Forest Professor in Toledo Law Review, 1974<br />
(Sylvester, Spring, page 480)<br />
However, one may still insist, echoing Ernest Hemingway - &quot;I believe in only one thing: liberty.&quot; And it is always well to bear in mind David Hume's observation: &quot;It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once.&quot; Thus, it is unacceptable to say that the invasion of one aspect of freedom is of no import because there have been invasions of so many other aspects. That road leads to chaos, tyranny, despotism, and the end of all human aspiration. Ask Solzhenitsyn. Ask Milovan Dijas. In sum, if one believed in freedom as a supreme value and the proper ordering principle for any society aiming to maximize spiritual and material welfare, then every invasion of freedom must be emphatically identified and resisted with undying spirit.<br />
<br />
Specifically, the ?severe? qualifier within the TVPA implies that there is a lesser kind of trafficking that is permissible ? expanding the scope of eligibility is key to solving this moral inconsistancy<br />
Giampolo 2006 (Angela D., J.D. @ Temple, ?THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2005: THE LATEST WEAPON IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING,? 16 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 195, Lexis)BB<br />
<br />
The TVPRA falls short of international efforts by not expanding the reach and scope of the existing TVPA, which is limited by its narrow definition of &quot;severe forms of trafficking.&quot; The controversy surrounding the limited definition of human trafficking is significant because the definition sets the parameters for (a) who will be eligible for relief and/or services; (b) the kind of relief and services that will be open to victims and; (c) the manner in which law enforcement and government agencies implement law and procedure. n194 International bodies and international human rights organizations define human trafficking more broadly because their purpose is to address the needs of individuals whose human rights have been violated as holistically as possible. The trafficking definition in the Trafficking Protocol discussed earlier lists several means of exploitation such as abuse of power and use of a persons' vulnerability that at a minimum, constitute human trafficking. n195 The inclusion of the phrase, &quot;at a minimum,&quot; suggests there are unenumerated means and forms of trafficking that should not go unpunished and that Signatories should simply utilize the framework as a starting point in delineating a definition. Human Rights Watch, an international human rights organization, defines the crime of trafficking more comprehensively than the Trafficking Protocol. It defines human trafficking to include all acts and attempted acts related to the recruitment, transport, transfer, sale or purchase of human beings for the purpose of placing them into conditions of servitude, including forced marriage, in which labor is extracted through physical and/or nonphysical means of coercion including debt bondage, blackmail, fraud, deceit, isolation, threat or use of physical force and psychological pressure. n196 The U.S. definition is not nearly this broad, and as a result, regrettably, women are left unprotected. One reason for this is that the purpose behind the U.S. definition is not solely motivated by rights-protection. n197 The U.S. government's purpose is in part to limit services, including immigration relief, so as to minimize [*217] potential exploitation of immigration relief by victims. n198 The U.S. definition of &quot;severe forms of trafficking&quot; requires an element of force, fraud or coercion. n199 One can imply in the definition of coercion that non-physical threats or psychological pressure are included, but they are not explicitly enumerated. n200 Furthermore, having the word severe qualify &quot;forms of trafficking&quot; implies that there is a lesser kind of human trafficking that is permissible. Finally, there are no provisions in the TVPA that establish how the determination is to be made regarding who falls within the ambit of statutory protections, making the definition almost impossible for law enforcement officials and agents to deconstruct and apply effectively and uniformly. n201 In sum, the United States' definition of human trafficking is inconsistent with its declared purpose of protecting human trafficking victims. The definition should at least meet the minimum standard set by the Trafficking Protocol and above and beyond that, it should set an example to the international community by including an exhaustive list of additional means of exploitation. In addition, the definition should contain an all-inclusive phrase that incorporates &quot;all other forms of exploitation that violate the rights of citizens as protected by the state.&quot; n202 This way, if a prosecutor is confronted with a form of exploitation that is not explicitly delineated in law, there is a catch-all phrase in the law itself to assist in upholding a trafficking charge instead of having to depend on another crime, which would perhaps mandate a lower sentence. Moreover, an expanded definition would ensure that all human trafficking victims, regardless of the method utilized, benefit from desperately needed protection, social services and immigration relief.<br />

Pure utilitarianism fails when dealing with trafficking because of increased uncertainty<br />
Blum, 2008 [Gabriella, Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard, ?The Laws of War and the ?Lesser Evil,?? Harvard Law School Faculty Scholarship Series, Paper 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lsr.nellco.org/harvard/faculty/papers/24" rel="nofollow">http://lsr.nellco.org/harvard/faculty/papers/24</a>]<br />
A pure consequentialist framework judges actions exclusively on the basis of their outcomes in terms of the ?good? they promote.155 Naturally, defining what ?good? outcomes are requires some preceding normative determination, especially one that would define the ?good? independently from specific prohibitions or prescriptions. This is true in any consequentialist analysis, whether we apply it to the necessity defense in domestic criminal law or to the humanitarian necessity paradigm in IHL. But while domestic law reflects a compromise among competing ideologies, interests, preferences and resources, IHL seems to lend itself more easily to a utilitarian, teleological analysis on the basis of its normative grundnorm: The maximization of humanitarian protections from harms of inevitable wars ? the quintessential lesser evil. If we accept the domestic necessity defense under a consequentialist framework, why should we then reject it in IHL? In the following analysis I suggest three possible considerations for the rejection of a cost-benefit analysis, or at least for suspicion of it, and ask whether these considerations are more pertinent in the world of armed conflict than in domestic interactions. These considerations are uncertainty, a concern about slippery slopes, and spillover effects. A few clarifications are in order. First, the analysis generally ignores the problem of incommensurability of values,156 assuming, instead, that we can determine what a lesser evil is in much the same way we determine it in domestic law. It is nonetheless limited to harms and benefits which IHL seeks to minimize and maximize, correspondingly, rather than any selfinterest of the party violating the rule. Still, the caveat remains that where consequences cannot be weighed along a definite and agreed measurement a utilitarian analysis would be rejected. In addition, I follow the distinction between act-consequentialism and rule-consequentialism. The former assesses the outcomes of every particular act; the necessity defense in criminal law is believed to be actconsequentialist. The latter weighs the effects of having a particular rule in place (and therefore the average outcome of acts that follow the rule). In our context, it is the difference between weighing the particular effects of any lesser-evil act to the weighing of the overall impact of introducing a rule that would recognize a lesser-evil justification. This current analysis focuses on the latter. At first glance, a pure consequentialist analysis would justify, by definition, a lesser-evil act, as defined here. This might even be true in the case of the torture or the killing of one innocent person intended to save two others. But as we move towards a rule-consequentialist paradigm, the average assessment of any instance that depends on the recognition of a humanitarian necessity justification requires the inclusion of indirect costs and benefits in addition to those of the immediate outcome. As the benefits of a humanitarian necessity justification are relatively clear, I focus here on the risks of recognizing the justification as a rule. a). Uncertainty The great difficulty in the ex-ante assessment in the IHL context lies in that any operation on the battlefield is necessarily mired in uncertainty. Anything from a change in weather conditions, faulty munitions, an unforeseen change on the ground, the collapse of lines of communication, to simple human errors could lead to an outcome very different from the one intended. The IDF soldiers who rely on a local resident to call on a suspect to surrender can never be certain that the resident will remain unharmed, that the suspect will in fact surrender, or whether they would end up needing, instead, to employ more force and endanger more people by executing the arrest themselves. Torturing a terrorist may or may not be effective; he or she may provide information, or they might not; once gotten, information may be useful, even sufficient to avert the danger; or altogether irrelevant. The direct attack on civilians may induce a change in the government's behavior ? in Japan's case, induce the Emperor to surrender ? but it is also possible, as in the case of the Blitzkrieg on London, that it would backfire and cause the population and the leadership to dig in their heels and form a stronger, more entrenched national unity. Given the uncertainty factor involved in what Clausewitz had termed &quot;the fog of war,&quot; the determination of lesser-evil is bound to be speculative and often inaccurate. IHL rules, it may well be argued, have been devised with the problem of uncertainty in mind. Like any other rules, they were installed precisely in order to eliminate the need to assess consequences in any particular case. In alternating between specific rules, such as an absolute prohibition on the intentional targeting of civilians, and standards, such as the prohibition on the destruction of civilian property where not absolutely necessary, IHL was designed to produce the best humanitarian outcome on average. But whether or not IHL as it currently stands does produce the best humanitarian outcome is questionable. The hundreds of instances in which the Early Warning Procedure was implemented resulted in only one civilian casualty. Although it is impossible to assert how many Palestinians have been spared as a direct consequence of the procedure, the 2007 casualty reports - 19 people who were not the intended target of arrest - suggest that in this case, uncertainty should not have warranted absolutism. The domestic world too is not immune to uncertainty. Dudley and Stephens157 might be picked up by a boat a minute before they choose to eat the young cabin boy, or left afloat to die, or as it turned out, saved on the following day. Their ability to foresee possible outcomes is not better ? and probably worse ? than many decisions taken on the battlefield. The domestic law deals with the problem of uncertainty by requiring a post-facto showing that breaking the law under the necessity defense resulted in a lesser-evil harm. It thus transfers the risk of uncertainty onto the actor.<br />
<br />
You should adopt critical consequentialism- when evaluating a policy, you should consider every possible alternative to violence. This is the only way to avoid atrocities.<br />
Blum, 2008 [Gabriella, Assistant Professor of Law at Harvard, ?The Laws of War and the ?Lesser Evil,?? Harvard Law School Faculty Scholarship Series, Paper 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lsr.nellco.org/harvard/faculty/papers/24" rel="nofollow">http://lsr.nellco.org/harvard/faculty/papers/24</a>]<br />
To be truly justified, a net utilitarian calculation is insufficient; the actor, instead, must be able to show that she had chosen the least possible harmful mean that could avert the greater evil, without jeopardizing the success of the military mission. This further condition is intended to supplement the causal connection between the violation and the aversion of harm and to ensure that the lesser evil justification is not used to mask unnecessary atrocities. The domestic necessity defense does not require this condition; instead, it offers only a vague proportionality test. The joint necessity-duress clause in the ICC Rome Statute includes a similarly broader test, namely that ?the person acts necessarily and reasonably to avoid this threat.? Both the domestic necessity and the ICC necessity operate only when the defendant has acted against an imminent threat. But where a government chooses in an non-imminent, premeditated decision to break the law, it supposedly can and should assess the full ramifications of the violation, including by considering less harmful means, whether legal or illegal themselves. In the Early Warning case, the High Court of Justice addressed the possible use of loudspeakers as an alternative to the reliance on civilians. The IDF?s position, to recall, was that the use of loudspeakers would call attention to the forces operating, thereby increasing the risk of all-round escalation. It is unclear to what extent this alternative affected the final decision of the judges, and whether the Court ultimately struck down the procedure despite deferring to the IDF?s judgment on this particular issue. The use of torture, so it is commonly agreed by those who are willing to accept it as necessary under certain circumstances, must be restricted to those cases where a similar outcome could not be achieved by any other means. Consequently, if any less harmful measure (for instance, detention, the taking of hostages, or even the threat of using torture) would have had a similar probability of success, torture would be unjustifiable. This requirement would also exclude certain atrocities from consideration under the humanitarian necessity paradigm altogether. Consider, for instance, the crime of rape: It is impossible to imagine any scenario in which the raping of an individual would be the least harmful way to achieve a certain goal. If anything less than killing is possible, there must be a range of less harmful means to avert the harm the infliction of which is allowed under the law. The less harmful means requirement casts the largest shadow over the attacks on Hiroshima, and particularly, Nagasaki. Was it indeed impossible to avert Operation Downfall by using less disastrous means? Or were some scientists, who argued that inviting UN representatives for a live demonstration of the explosion in the desert, correct in arguing that this option had to be tried out first, before dropping the bomb on densely populated cities? Does the insistence of the Emperor on conditional surrender even after the widespread firebombing of Tokyo and the invasion of Okinawa prove that there were no other options? Did the conditions set by the Emperor warrant the continuation of the war? Could the use of nuclear weapons ever be justified under the ?least harmful requirement? condition? 8) Burden and Standard of Proof Operating as a justification, rather than a source of obligation, the burden of proof of the various elements of the necessity justification should be placed on the actor seeking to invoke it.194 This is the requirement of the ICC Rome Statute as well, with regard to all claims for excluding culpability. This allocation of responsibility should guard not only against disingenuous claims, but would also place the problem of uncertainty on the shoulders of the actor. In case of doubt, the rule should be upheld against the justification. A more complicated question is the standard of proof. If we condition the justification upon a post-facto determination of lesser-evil, this determination would be subject to an empirical test. The same empirical test should be applied to the determination of ex-ante good intentions. The determination of a causal connection and even more so, the weighing of less harmful alternatives, in contrast, would be impossible to put to a concrete empirical test. Instead, both would have to rely on the weighing of probabilities and be put to a test of reasonableness. In case of doubt, the rule should be upheld against the justification.<br />

Failing to look at reasonable alternatives to violence rips you from your connection with the world and ensures planetary destruction.<br />
O?Brien, 2000 [Mary, Ph. D, environmental scientist and activist, ?Making Better Environmental Decisions,? Pg-xvii-xviii]<br />
This book is based on the understanding that it is not acceptable for people to tell you that the harms to which they will subject you and the world are safe or insignificant. You deserve to know good alternative to those harms, and you deserve to help decide which alternative will be chosen. Underlying this book, however, is a less explicitly stated personal belief, namely that we humans will never dredge up enough will to alter our habitual, destructive ways of behaving toward each other and the world unless we simultaneously employ information and emotion and a sense of relationship to others?other species, other cultures, and other generations. Using this information while divorced from emotion and using information while insulated from connection to a wide net of others are how destruction of the Earth is being accomplished. Risk assessment of narrow options is a classic example of using certain bits of information in such a way as to exclude feeling and to artificially sever connections of parts to the whole. Risk assessment rips you (and others) out of connection to the rest of the world and reduces you (if you are even considered at all in the risk assessment) to a number. You are then consigned to damage or death or ?risk,? depending on how your number is shuffled around in models, assumptions, and formulas enduring ?risk management.? Assessment of the pros and cons of a range of reasonable alternatives allows the connection to remain. The cultural emotions connected to a given alternative, for instance, can be a pro or a con, and may be both, depending on which sector of the community you inhabit. An advantage or a disadvantage of a given alternative can be social, religious, economic, scientific, or political. Risk assessment is one of the major methods by which parts (corporations such as Monsanto or Hyundai, ?private land owners,? industrial nations) can act on their wants at the expense of wholes (eg, whole communities and countries, or the seventh generation from now) without appearing to be doing so. Risk assessment lets them appear simply ?scientific? or ?rational? as they numerically estimate whether or how many deaths or what birth defects will be caused, and ignore other regions of human experience that also matter to people. Always, some groups of humans will be trying to exercise their power at the expense of the whole. Decisions arrived at from risk assessment can be homicidal, biocidal, and suicidal, but they are made every day. Risk assessment is a premier process by which illegitimate exercise of power is justified. The stakes of installing alternatives to risk assessment, therefore, are the whole Earth (just as are the stakes of fashioning democratic control over corporations, or of requiring changes in behavior of those who have wreaked irreparable damage). Installing alternatives assessment is one step in the struggle to use information, feeling, and a sense of relationship to others to stop social-environmental madness.<br />

<br />
What is human trafficking? The answer to this foundational question is informed by one?s personal, or even legal, framework.116 Varying viewpoints invariably lead to varying definitions. In legislating the scope and boundaries of human trafficking as a crime, much hinges on the arrangement of particular wording in definitional provisions.117 Anti-trafficking laws impacting the United States exist at three levels? state, federal, international.118 Although these pieces of legislation cast ?a kind of definitional anchor, none ?define human trafficking or trafficking victimization in exactly the same way.?119 The definitional provisions at each level have triggered ongoing lengthy political debate120 and vigorous disagreement,121 which tends to delay the enactment process.122 Beyond slowing the legislative process, the implications of these definitional debates?and the differences between statutory provisions? are far reaching, impacting not only a victim?s ability to receive appropriate relief and government benefits,123 but also methodologies for victim screening protocols124 and gathering statistical research data.125 Overall, differences in definitions make it difficult to standardize certain tools that are vital to fighting the war on human trafficking. Just as it is difficult to fight a war against an enemy who is not clearly defined, lack of uniformity among statutory definitions can lead to confusion that impedes effectiveness in the war on human trafficking.<br />

DHS should eliminate the LEA endorsement restriction and locate the victim-identification function solely with trained DHS adjudicators. This would eliminate the uniformity challenge posed by the current system in which thousands of law enforcement agents and prosecutors serve as gatekeepers to the visa. A much smaller group of highly trained DHS adjudicators could respond more uniformly and rapidly to changes in trafficking patterns and new trafficker methods. 258 These adjudicators would also be advantageously positioned to decide victim eligibility divorced from any investigation or prosecution duties. By de-coupling victim status determinations from prosecutorial involvement, the proposed model focuses on the credibility of victim narratives, not law enforcement assessments of victim suitability to serve as a witness. This de-coupling would also reduce the effect of the prosecutorial and investigative focus on sex trafficking victims, as long as DHS adjudicators were trained to recognize victims of trafficking for both labor and sex. A centralized model based solely on victim demonstration of compliance with statutory standards is similar to that used to adjudicate petitions under the VAWA from non-citizen survivors of domestic violence. Domestic violence survivors typically submit evidence of abuse, including declarations, police reports, letters, and psychological evaluations. 259 Similarly, T visa applicants should be able to demonstrate attempts at cooperation solely through their own evidence and narratives. 260 In cases where the DHS intends to deny a T visa application because of the paucity of corroborating evidence, it should first interview the T visa applicant and judge her credibility firsthand. 261 If, after this interview, the victim is judged not to be credible, then her T visa application can be denied. Although centralizing victim identification with DHS reduces prosecutorial control over T visas, it may actually result in additional victim participation in prosecutions. When the T visa is de-coupled from the LEA endorsement and prosecutorial approval, victims control the timing of their participation in any investigation. Additional time for reflection may result in more victim participation. In Belgium and the Netherlands, as trafficking survivors begin to recover from their experience with the assistance of social service agencies, they are granted a reflection period in which to make an informed decision about cooperation. 262 During this period (forty-five days in Belgium and three months in the Netherlands), survivors are granted temporary immigration status. 263 In both countries, more victims report their traffickers now than did before there was a reflection period. 264 These results are consistent with psychological understandings of trauma survivors. According to psychologist Judith Herman, trauma victims may actually be more stable witnesses if they are empowered to choose to participate in the investigation or prosecution of their persecutors. 265 Once a victim?s life and psychological state have stabilized somewhat, she may be a more meaningful and directed participant in investigation or prosecution. An approach that relies solely on a victim?s own demonstration of compliance with the statute is consistent with encouraging survivor participation in the political struggle against human trafficking. Thus far, this struggle has been defined by feminists and religious leaders opposed to sex work, prosecutors and law enforcement agents interested in convicting traffickers, and advocates seeking to protect victims? rights in the current framework. The inclusion of survivor voices is crucial to re-examining and redefining the United States? anti-trafficking efforts. If a range of victims? voices becomes part of the anti-trafficking debate, our conception of trafficking victims will surely expand to encompass a wide range of experiences from a diverse group of victims.<br />

The plan is a crucial first step to curbing the supply and demand of human trafficking<br />

An essential component of effective anti-trafficking legislation that addresses both the supply and demand factors for trafficking in persons is to define trafficked persons as &quot;victims.&quot; n289 The Convention already does so. n290 The Convention states that a &quot;'[v]ictim' shall mean any natural person who is subject to trafficking in human beings as defined&quot; in the Convention. n291 However, while the Protocol and the TVPA use the term &quot;victim,&quot; neither includes language defining who is a victim of trafficking. n292 If legislation or international agreements do not define who constitutes a &quot;victim&quot; of trafficking it creates the danger that victims of trafficking in persons will not be identified as victims, but rather punished for being in the destination country illegally or for violating the laws of the destination country by engaging in prostitution. n293 Dr. Mohammed Mattar, Executive Director of the Protection Project at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, observed that in the United States trafficking victims are simply not being identified. n294 In 2005, the [*713] United States had only identified 700 victims of trafficking n295 despite estimates by the government that 18,000-20,000 persons are trafficked into the United States each year. n296 For example, in 2008, a North Carolina &quot;[m]assage parlor [was] shut down after a three-month undercover investigation . . . . The owner of the [spa] . . . was charged with human trafficking and maintaining a place of prostitution. Employee Min Ye was charged with solicitation. Another employee, Dan Kim, was charged with two counts of indecent exposure.&quot; n297 Even though the owner was charged with human trafficking, those he had victimized were not treated as victims, but rather charged with the crimes of solicitation and indecent exposure. n298 The market for human trafficking will not be shut down by charging the owner with human trafficking but failing to identify victims like Min Ye and Dan Kim as true victims of trafficking. As discussed in Section I, to close down the market for human trafficking requires efforts to address both the demand and supply for victims. n299 In this case the trafficker was charged with human trafficking, thus increasing the cost of operation and deterring his future demand to utilized victims of trafficking in his business. n300 However, the victims were not identified as victims; rather they were treated as criminals and not provided rehabilitation services. Thus, the supply of victims has not been decreased because their likelihood of being trafficked again for the purposes of sexual exploitation is increased. n301 As illustrated by this example, the failure to identify victims of trafficking as victims leads to several consequences influencing both supply and demand for human trafficking. First, if trafficked persons are not identified as victims, they may be precluded from accessing needed medical assistance, counseling, educational, financial, or other services provided to assist victims in the [*714] reintegration process. n302 If victims are treated as criminals and not provided access to rehabilitation services, the probability that they will not successfully reintegrate into society is in-creased. Thus, these non-identified victims will be more susceptible to being re-trafficked, increasing the supply of victims. n303 Furthermore, if victims are not identified as such it increases the probability that traffickers will not be charged with human trafficking. This failure to increase the potential penalties for traffickers leads to no change in the cost of operation for traffickers, which in turn does make any impact on demand for victims. n304 For these reasons, the inclusion of the definition of a victim of human trafficking in national legislation and international agreements is essential to influencing both the supply and demand for trafficking victims. In addition to including a victim definition, it is necessary to educate law enforcement personnel, individuals providing rehabilitation services, and other persons who may come in contact with trafficking victims on the definition and the rights of victims under the law. A beneficial aspect of the agreements and legislation discussed above is their inclusion of provisions regarding educational efforts for these professionals. n305 Further, these agreements and legislation contain education and awareness campaigns targeted at informing potential victims of tactics used by traffickers and the dangers inherent in trafficking. n306 However, there is a need to increase the awareness of the general public in both countries of origin and destination, and of the consumers of sexual services in countries of destination, that trafficking is not a victimless crime.
