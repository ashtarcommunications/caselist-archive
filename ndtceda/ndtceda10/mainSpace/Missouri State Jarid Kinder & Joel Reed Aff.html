 Centralization skews questions of immigration by attempting to universalize costs and benefits, ensuring conflict. These decisions are best made on a small scale where the true benefits to any given to any community can be fairly evaluated by its members.<br />
Rozeff 2005 <br />
Michael S. December 14, &quot;Communities, Immigration, and Decentralization&quot; (Professor, University at Buffalo) &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/rozeff/rozeff51.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lewrockwell.com/rozeff/rozeff51.html</a>&gt;<br />
“Clearly a community gives its members access to diverse skills”, … “the costs of immigration may become burdensome to citizens.”<br />
<br />
A massive reversal of the size and structure of governments is vital to prevent human extinction.<br />
John Papworth 2001 &quot;THE GENERAL DECLARATION OF THE FOURTH WORLD&quot; pg. 10 &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cesc.net/adobeweb/radcon/radical.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesc.net/adobeweb/radcon/radical.pdf</a>&gt;<br />
“ In the light of this conclusion we are confronted with a challenge to effect the most thoroughgoing revolution in human affairs ever undertaken” “Where are those empires today?”<br />
<br />
The mere desire for peace by reacting to specific government actions is not enough. Only by working to eliminate mass democracy can we hope to achieve peace and liberty.<br />
John Papworth May 14, 2007 &quot;People’s Power for Peace&quot; &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gandhifoundation.org/2007/05/14/people%e2%80%99s-power-for-peace-by-john-papworth/" rel="nofollow">http://gandhifoundation.org/2007/05/14/people%e2%80%99s-power-for-peace-by-john-papworth/</a>&gt;<br />
“The Mahatma was not opposed to technology, was not his spinning wheel one example of it?” “which will tend to have almost identical policies.”<br />
Mass democracy makes extinction inevitable only by changing the structure of government can peace be achieved.<br />

“Peace activists have been banging their heads against the war makers with no understanding that what” … “has ever been, even as the danger of increasingly destructive war continues to dominate the human outlook.”<br />

“The lesson here is surely that without some unified theoretical basis on which we can act we are unable to mount” … “readers of the posh dailies and Sundays and those of the intellectual weeklies.”<br />

Mass society should be rejected to end dehumanization and restore individual liberty.<br />
John Papworth 11/08/2007 (last modified) &quot;Shut Up and Listen&quot; ac: 2/21/09 &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aislingmagazine.com/aislingmagazine/articles/TAM23/ShutUp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aislingmagazine.com/aislingmagazine/articles/TAM23/ShutUp.html</a>&gt;<br />
“The larger the political unit the smaller the significance of the individual member” … “it means government BY the people.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To shut down the war machine and eliminate the need for nuclear weapons we must first eliminate the structure that requires their existence. The more the state grows the more its power becomes concentrated in the center. Restoring individual freedom and village sovereignty must be the first priority.<br />
John Papworth 2001 &quot;PEACE THROUGH SOCIAL EMPOWERMENT&quot; (An Address to THE WORLD FUTURE STUDIES’ FEDERATION XVII WORLD CONFERENCE BRASOV - ROMANIA) pg. 16 &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cesc.net/adobeweb/radcon/radical.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesc.net/adobeweb/radcon/radical.pdf</a>&gt;<br />
“A great deal of anti-war propaganda tends to rest on the premise that since war is evil”… “The price of your diminished power is the tribute you pay to the swollen octopus of power at the centre.”<br />
<br />
The trend in the United States is shifting rapidly to nationalization and centralization.<br />
KIRKPATRICK SALE 2007 &quot;TAKING STOCK&quot; (THE FOURTHWORLD REVIEW PROJECT) pg.5 &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.williamfranklin.com/4thworld/adobe/fwr146.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.williamfranklin.com/4thworld/adobe/fwr146.pdf</a>&gt;<br />
“That said, there is another side to the Fourth World project that has not been so successful: the extension of real democracy to small” “America, a reaction to the seemingly ever-growing role of Washington not only in state but in municipal matters as well.”<br />
<br />
Thus Joel and I support a revolution to end the super state starting with a removal of all national immigration restrictions. <br />

Either the CP supersedes a bunch of unrelated immigration law (accessing their net benefits) or it doesn't solve. Ambiguity means uncertainty about omission, suppressing solvency fo the same reasons that uncertainty about the cap is relevant.<br />

 The United States Supreme Court should strike down TITLE 8, CHAPTER 12, SUBCHAPTER II, Part II, Section 1182(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the U.S. legal code in a case related to beneficiary eligibility for family based visas.<br />

<br />
1182 lacks sufficient clarity and leaves too much discretion to those enforcing it and should be ruled void for vagueness.<br />

And, the immigration act of 1999 allows for this stigmatization and exclusion of the mentally ill on the basis that they pose a threat to society.<br />

This exclusion of mentally disabled immigrants creates a ‘stone wall’ within society. This societal wall spurs violence against the disabled strangers. Those left in exclusion of society are forced to live in a state of suspended extinction.<br />

And, this ‘wall’ creates unique conditions for the mass murder of disabled people. Only the plan can resolve the issues of state totalitarian action. Utilitarian Justifications only allow this ongoing genocide to take place.<br />

The current stigmatization of the mentally ill is based on societies need to cleanse itself of imperfections. Only by solving for exlusion can we overcome this.<br />

And this stigmatization leads to the monstrous power of the ocular. This violent gaze of society creates a slave mentality where the only alternative is perfection.<br />

The plan is uniquely transformative. Voting aff imancipates the mentally disabled in a literal and physical sense. This action sends a signal of the end of the war on difference.<br />

<br />
In order to reach a consensus on morality and remove society’s stigmatization, inclusion of the mentally ill is the first step. Not only does the plan act as a transformative message to society, the radical speech act of the 1AC is enough to solve for status qou prejudices.<br />
