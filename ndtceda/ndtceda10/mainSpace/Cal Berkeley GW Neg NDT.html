Resolution A legislative instrument that generally ...resolution made by a deliberative body.<br />
<br />
C – Vote neg<br />
1 – Predictability- The resolution proposes the question the negative is prepared to answer. Even if it is good to talk about their 1AC, they must prove we could have logically anticipated it. This question comes prior to the merits of the aff because it implicates our ability to debate.<br />
Ruth Lessl <u>Shively</u>, Assoc Prof Polisci at Texas A&amp;M, <u>2000</u> <em>Political Theory and Partisan Politics</em> p. 181-2<br />
Debate has unique potential to change attitudes and grow critical thinking skills <em>because</em> it forces pre-round internal deliberation on a of a focused, common ground of debate<br />

What happened in this particular case...for each of those key features.<br />
2 – Limits- the aff interpretation explodes the number of potential affirmatives to anything that has a loose relationship to immigration- They have functionally made their own resolution which at best turns debates into immigration good/bad<br />
Limits are an inevitable part of living in society, but learning to exercise creativity within limits celebrates life- constant attempts to un-limit ourselves creante an unbearable burden and empties out the value to life<br />
Ramaekers 2001<br />

The nature of morality inspires us ...least four aspects of Nietzsche's writings.<br />
3 – Education-<br />
A focus on policy is necessary to learn the pragmatic details of powerful institutions – acting without this knowledge is doomed to fail in the face of policy pros who know what they’re talking about<br />
<u>McClean, Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at Molloy College in New York, ‘1</u> (David E., “The Cultural Left and the Limits of Social Hope”, Conference of the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanphilosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2001/" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanphilosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2001/</a>)<br />
Or we might take Foucault who...so-called &quot;managerial class.&quot;<br />
Only a focus on legal changes to immigration policy can do anything – revealing the practices of state violence fails<br />

You have functionally decided to write your own resolution instead of affirming the one we already have- even if the resolution is wrong, having a devil’s advocate in deliberation is vitally important to critical thinking skills and avoiding groupthink<br />
Hugo <u>Mercier and</u> Hélène <u>Landemore</u>- <u>2011</u> (in press)<br />

<br />
You assume that limits are some infinite capacity to do whatever you want- this radical liberalism turns into the domination of the weak by the strong and is the same logic as Bush exceptionalism and Tea Partiers- freedom should be bounded by the limits of responsibility within a community- your responsibility in this case is to answer the question of the resolution affirmatively so that we can have a productive discussion<br />
Anthony <u>Burke</u>- School of Politics and International Relations, The University of New South Wales- <u>2005</u>, Freedom’s Freedom: American Enlightenment and Permanent War, Social Identities Vol. 11, No. 4, July 2005, pp. 315/343, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/256400_915549761_727339818.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://pdfserve.informaworld.com/256400_915549761_727339818.pdf</a><br />
Freedom can no longer be thought ...levels of politics and organisational power.<br />
<br />
<strong>Only formal, pre-agreed rules can ensure openness and equal access—throwing away limits doesn’t mean debate becomes more egalitarian; it means those with the most power dominate the discussion- turns the aff</strong><br />

Working outside of political institutions fails - politically based reforms is productive to eliminate discrimination against minorities because demographic shifts will empower minority voters<br />

Judge Comments: <span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">2nr functions as an education critique, rather than a procedural. Internal inks are predicated upon research but 2nr does not explain how they make bad research happen. Predictability functions as a practice- their hype about predictabilty are not intrinsic to k-affs but rather to new affs in general. I only look to see they affirm the topic. They do have a plan, they do talk about the topic. OU wins some defense here. Aff does not stop policy debate, only makes the topic critical. 2nr is weak on the internal link and solvency question of details/educaiton k. Devil's Advocacy doesn't necessarily teach us to deal with the Tea Party or other right wing threats.</span><br />

 <span style="background-color: yellow;">The United States federal government should use section 212 (a) (3) (b) of the immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the eligibility of all applicants for topically designated visas. All visa applicants found ineligible on the grounds of section 212 (a) (3) (B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act should be admitted without condition. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The CP has two net benefits</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> First, Whitewashing</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Voting aff glorifies us as the heroes who “delink our life from the operation of the law and its violent moralistic standards” without acknowledging our complicity in the system which gave rise to exclusionary sovereignty</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Jenny <u>Edkins</u>, International Politics—University of Wales, <u>2003</u>. (Trauma and the Memory of Politics, p. 172-4)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> It is not a remembering… <span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">, not outside the trauma.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Even the “empty” symbolic gesture of finding every applicant ineligible encircles the trauma of exclusion without neutralizing it as a past, depoliticized event—the counterplan makes criticism of sovereignty<em><span style="font-family: Arial;">relevant</span></em> to discursive practice and <em><span style="font-family: Arial;">renders visible</span></em> its fragility</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Jenny <u>Edkins</u>, Senior Lecturer in International Politics at the University of Wales Aberystwyth,<em><span style="font-family: Arial;">Postructuralism and International Relations: Bringing the Political Back In</span></em>, <u>1999</u>, p. 141-2</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> This recalls the discussion in Chapter ...we are not lulled into forgetfulness.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Second, the conditional invitation</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> The affirmative’s expression of inclusion through visas is banal and <em><span style="font-family: Arial;">conditional</span></em> – Their political affirmation is contingent on the <u>law</u> and e<u>conomic exchange</u>. This is incompatible with true hospitality, resulting in violence.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> <u>Westmoreland, ‘8</u> (Mark W. June 2008 “Interruptions: Derrida and Hospitality” KRITIKE VOLUME TWO NUMBER ONE <u><span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/21957039/Derrida-and-Hospitality" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/ 21957039/Derrida-and- Hospitality</a></span></u>)-mikee</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> On the one hand, the ...; there is always some violence.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> The distribution of visas as a political strategy for inclusion injects <em><span style="font-family: Arial;">sovereign</span></em> authority into migration – turns the case by making all <em><span style="font-family: Arial;">inclusion</span></em> temporary and fleeting.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Sovereignty is performed dialogically and reconstituted ...citizenship claims grounded in capricious sovereignty.</span><br />
