<h3 id="toc3"><a name="x1NC: Citizenship Kritik-SCENE 1: Papers-Visas are an acute symptom of the yellow paper syndrome—they literally determine what bodies can enter the United States and what can’t. What is more, visas only grant partial citizenship. While migrants are subject to the laws of the United States, they have no rights under the law. Visas grant partial citizenship and turn human beings into partial, second-class citizens; they are quite literally yellow papers that mark the foreigner as other and less-than the good American subject. According to Giorgio Agamben in 1998, this process quite literally transforms migrant workers into “bare life.”"></a>Visas are an acute symptom of the yellow paper syndrome—they literally determine what bodies can enter the United States and what can’t.

<h3 id="toc6"><a name="x1NC: Citizenship Kritik-Scene 2: Alternative-On November 30, 1999, activists from around the globe descended on Seattle to protest the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999. On the streets of Seattle, Teamsters united with Turtles to issue a new demand for fair, democratic global trade. As noted ecofeminist and seed activist Vandana Shiva argues, “when labour joins hands with environmentalists, when farmers from the North and farmers from the South make a common commitment to say ‘no’ to genetically engineered crops, they are not acting in their special interests. They are defending the common interests and common rights of all people, everywhere” (para. 11). The announcement that the W.T.O. Ministerial would not happen was a “watershed towards the creation of a global citizen-based and citizen-driven democratic order” (para. 16). The W.T.O. protests were the birth of a new global citizen’s movement. “In their diversity,” Shiva concludes, “citizens were united across sectors and regions” (para. 12)."></a>On November 30, 1999, activists from around the globe descended on Seattle to protest the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999.
