<br />
<strong>Society has constructed citizenship as a totalizing event marked by concrete representations. The problem with this is the assemblage of political dependence that erases any possibility for multiplistic transgression—Hauck 2007</strong> [Nicholas Hauck, “Thinking Through Philosophy: Alain Badiou and the Event of Transitory Citizenship” Nicholas Hauck graduated in April 2008 from Simon Fraser University with a double BA majoring in French and Humanities. He is interested in the interrelations between political philosophy, the philosophy of language, and literature, especially poetry and poetics, Simons Foundation/ SFU, November 14, 2007]<br />

<strong>The image of a foreign worker is not synonymous with a common worker; there exists a dichotomy of citizen vs. “illegal alien” that creates a categorical difference in politics and ethics that excludes and banishes the “immigrant” from society as nothing more than intrinsic capital of the State—Badiou 1998</strong> [Alain Badiou, Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, “Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Translated and introduced by Peter Hallward, First published as L 'ethique: Essai Sur la Conscience du Mal, 1998]<br />
<br />
<strong>Subjectification of immigrants is a determined normality defined by the void of State representations. The aggregation of any exclusive characteristics cancels all contributing perspectives and ensures the impossibility of immigrant legalization—Hallward 2001</strong><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> [Translator’s Introduction from Alain Badiou’s, “Ethics: </span>An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Translated and introduced by Peter Hallward, First published as L 'ethique: Essai Sur la Conscience du Mal, 1998, Second publishing and introduction, 2001]<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: windowtext;">The classification of indentity-based groups is what Badiou calls a simulacrum of truth. Simulacrums are dangerous because they create an “us” of ethical insiders vs. a “them” of outsiders. This is the root of war, racism, and genocide. Only a search for universals that we refuse to impose on others can be emancipator—Badiou 1998 </span></strong><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">[Alain Badiou, Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, “Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Translated and introduced by Peter Hallward, First published as L 'ethique: Essai Sur la Conscience du Mal, 1998]</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Rather than being defined by restrictions, there should be an affirmation of humanity through abstract concepts that work towards understanding the conditions and nature of citizenship. The circumstances under which truth is constructed create a space for free thought and political discourse; Only the matheme, rooted in logic and reason, works to transcend the subject/ object dualisms of fact that are prohibiting our ability to process consistent ontological practice—Hauck 2007</strong> [Nicholas Hauck, “Thinking Through Philosophy: Alain Badiou and the Event of Transitory Citizenship” Nicholas Hauck graduated in April 2008 from Simon Fraser University with a double BA majoring in French and Humanities.

 <br />
<strong>The current political structure is largely nihilistic; what must occur is a break in the monotonous affirmation of the disconnect between philosophy and language. In the unique configuration of political debates, reaffirming value in language and poetic communication combined with the transcendence of multiplistic capital is key to develop a true notion of citizenship—Hauck 2007</strong> [Nicholas Hauck, “Thinking Through Philosophy: Alain Badiou and the Event of Transitory Citizenship” Nicholas Hauck graduated in April 2008 from Simon Fraser University with a double BA majoring in French and Humanities.

<br />
<strong><span style="color: windowtext;">Ethical principles remove us from the urgency of particular needs. We focus on identifying situations that match the rules, rather than imagining a positive vision of the future. This reduces us all to a subhuman mass. Our advocacy works to break down such rules and give ourselves over to the particular event as an act of fidelity—Badiou 1998</span></strong><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;"> [Alain Badiou, Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, “Ethics: An Essay on the Understanding of Evil, Translated and introduced by Peter Hallward, First published as L 'ethique: Essai Sur la Conscience du Mal, 1998]</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Progressive ethics can only succeed by maintaining distance from the state. Politics must be conceived of as the search for a universal that is uncompromised by political calculations—Badiou 2005</strong> [Alain Badiou, Professor of Philosophy at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee, Switzerland, “Highly Speculative Reasoning on the Concept of Democracy,” Translated by Barbara Fulks, Appears in <em>Metapolitics</em>, 2005]<br />
