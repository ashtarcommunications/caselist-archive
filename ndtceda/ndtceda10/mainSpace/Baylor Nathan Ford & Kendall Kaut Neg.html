 Their objectivity claims don't assume an argumentative forum- the aff's deliberate framing of their statistic means they can't be objevtively evaluated-<br />
Slovic 97 (Paul, President of Decision Research in Eugene, Oregon, and Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon, 1997 U Chi Legal F 59, &quot;Trust, Emotion, Sex, Politics, and Science: Surveying the Risk Assesment Battlefield,&quot;)<br />
After a risk...just different frames<br />
<br />
Turns the case-reliance on statistical analysis allows immigration bureaucracy to racially exclude immigrants- Culp 86 (Robert, The immigration and Naturalization Service and Racially Motivated Questioning Does Equal Protection Pick Up Where the Fourteenth Amendment Left Off? 86 Colum L. Rev. 800)<br />
Reference to hostility... a large number of Hispanics.<br />
<br />
Relying merely on isolated bits of statistics misses the larger context, causing policy failure- Vietnam proves- Sheldon 08 (John C. Sheldon is the principal of Maine Dispute Resolution, in Falmouth, Maine. He was a judge of the maine District Court from 1987 to 2002, and a visiting scholar at the Harvard Law School in 2000 and in 2002-2003. 23 Maine Bar J. 90, &quot;Thinking Outside of the box about Pro Se Litigation&quot;)<br />

Collateral Damage Comes HOme 52 Depaul L. Rev. 849<br />
Racial profiling in the... national security matters.<br />
<br />
Turn Courts won't listen to statistics that prove racial profiling exists- proves our link and that statistics aren't objectively interpreted- Leipold 98 (Andrew, Associate Professor University of Illinois College of Law 73 Chi-Kent L. Rev 599, &quot;Objective Tests and Subjective Bias: Some Problems of Discriminatory Intent in Criminal Law)<br />
But this commitment is qualified... racist conduct to escape sanction.<br />
<br />
Courts have tons of access to statistics about racial profiling-they deliberately ignore them- Leipold 98 (Andrew, Associate Professor University of Illinois College of Law 73 Chi-Kent L. Rev 599, &quot;Objective Tests and Subjective Bias: Some Problems of Discriminatory Intent in Criminal Law)<br />
Although the size of the racial problem... has been at least indifferent, and at most hostile to claims of racial bias.<br />
<br />
Statistical focus alone can't objectively change perceptions of risk- reading a bunch of numbers isn't persuasive to anyone- Slovic 97 (Paul, President of Decision Research in Eugene, Oregon, and Professor of Psychology at the University of Oregon, 1997 U Chi Legal F 59, &quot;Trust, Emotion, Sex, Politics, and Science: Surveying the Risk Assesment Battlefield,&quot;)<br />

 Their view of history is wrong. History is a process towards the ideological dominance of liberal democracies. Accepting this view requires embracing calculation and strategic thinking- Marks ’97 (Susan is a fellow at Emmanuel College of Cambridge, “The End of History, Reflections on Summer International,” 449-353) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/8/3/1456.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ejil.org/pdfs/8/3/1456.pdf</a><br />
Fukyama's central thesis... of all citizens.<br />

And, Intellectuals must unambiguously embrace western democratic ideals and institutions to lend support to consolidate democratic movements and prevent backsliding. The alternative is NOT “radical democracy” as they describe it--rather, it is local authoritarian rule, a near guarantee of genocide, and the possibility of new nuclear wars.<br />

 Text: An appropriate appellate court should submit a writ of certification to the United States Supreme Court requesting a clarification of federal law on marriage and federal rights. The Supreme Court should, citing 14th Amendment concerns, rule that marriage as a recognized institution should be relieved of its place as the precondition of legal entitlements of various kinds, including delinking the institution of marriage from the bundle of basic civil rights. The Court should, if necessary, issue writs of mandamus to appropriate actors to effectuate said ruling.<br />
