<br />
A/T “Death doesn’t exist”<br />
<br />
Think about what you are voting for for a minute- you are literally saying that we should kill everybody because their energy might live on in a “multiverse” that might exist. This isn’t noble self-sacrifice- you would be closer to a serial killer or a genocidaire.<br />
<br />
<br />

&quot;In any case, ...mean it's fictitious.<br />

This argument is dumb- their book was written to present an interesting metaphor for a public audience- it neither makes the “Death good” args they want to cite nor lays the foundation for the arg that “life doesn’t objectively exist.”<br />
