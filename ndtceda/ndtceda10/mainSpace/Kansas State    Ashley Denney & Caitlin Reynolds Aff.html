The history of United States immigration is marked by racial, economic, and sexual exclusion that reflect the larger logics of US empire; visas were distributed in such a way as to maintain the dominant social order, but always masked in the language of policymaking and inclusion; this discourse has disguised the fact that the immigration system is actually a site of exclusion based on the attempt to let in only the most desirable, which translates to the perception of the ideal immigrant as the one who is most malleable into being shaped into a representation of the good white, heterosexual, capitalist citizen – all those outside these boundaries are marked and rejected because of their alterity<br />

Policing at the border and attempts to incorporate the new immigrant into the “mainstream” of the nation are meant to dichotomize between the good immigrant, who can be transformed into the good American, and the bad immigrant who becomes the terrorist, the security threat, the danger from within – this enemy construction is a foundational project of imperial nation-building – empire perpetuates the closing off of different ways of being and leads to the systematic destruction of the Other in the name of security<br />
