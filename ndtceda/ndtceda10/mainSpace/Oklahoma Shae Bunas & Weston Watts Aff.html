The ideology of liberalism is used to exclude immigration based on a fear of antagonism. These restrictions are founded in the fear of communism perpetuated by the McCarthy era and operate to preserve hegemonic ideologies - <br />
Rose 10 [executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts Carol On Liberty Boston.com Blogs 7/16/2010 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://boston.com/community/blogs/on_liberty/2010/07/defending_the_right_of_america.Html" rel="nofollow">http://boston.com/community/blogs/on_liberty/2010/07/defending_the_right_of_america.Html</a>]<br />
Beyond that, it's time for … terrorism watch lists as instruments of censorship.<br />
<br />
These ideological exclusions are responsible for shaping the public perception of immigration POLICY and PROCEDURE, allowing the state to benevolently normalize the ideology of capital as a disciplining move. This form of politics produces a direct barrier to universality <br />
ZIZEK 2008 [SLAVOJ VIOLENCE P 158-159]<br />
The particular ethnic substance … are conditions of survival.<br />

PLAN: The United States Federal Government should end its exclusion of communist and totalitarian party members by rescinding section 212(a) 3 (d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act for topically designated visas<br />
<br />
Assertion of the Communist Idea is a necessary response to the naturalization of the ideology of capital. The plan is an act of fidelity to the impulse of Communism which is infinitely affirming of the revolutionary potential of the Communist Hypothesis. This affirmation is essential to exposing the antagonisms that are excluded in the status quo<br />
Zizek 2009 Slavoj First as Tragedy, Then as Farce page 87-94<br />
In Kierkegaardian terms, … the world that has been sustaining us.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upholding the Communist Idea is an act of subjectivation which outweighs any concerns of survival. Becoming a body of truth is necessary for actualization of emancipatory politics. Even banal discussions about the Idea of Communism are political – they allow us to expand Communism to create a Truth -Event <br />
Badiou 2010 [Alain The Communist Hypothesis page 252-257, Prof of Philosophy at EGS]<br />
Let's recapitulate as simply … exposed in a fictional structure.<br />
<br />
Part and parcel of fidelity to an event is the acceptance of the inherent risk and possibility of catastrophe that accompanies and idea which radical changes social and political coordinates of existence. The refusal to risk the comforts of the status quo is a death wish for progressive politics <br />
Zizek 2009 [Slavoj First as Tragedy, Then as Farce page 74-77]<br />
We all know the anti-communist … of the radical Left. <br />
<br />
And - fidelity to the communist idea is key revolutionary politics – it is a necessary ethical move in the face of liberal capitalism’s ideological embrace of hedonistic-utilitarianism <br />
Zizek 2010 [Living in the End Times p xiii-xv]<br />
The locus communis … for survival is our lives. <br />
<br />
Fidelity to the Communist Idea undermines the totality of the liberal-capitalist world order <br />
Zizek, 2001 [Slavoj, Rethinking Marxism Volume 13, Number 2, summer, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-can-lenin-tell-us-about-freedom-today.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/faculty/zizek/zizek-can-lenin-tell-us-about-freedom-today.html</a> Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia] <br />
As such, Lenin's politics … with regard to today's Empire.1<br />
<br />
Resisting the reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale <br />
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)<br />
For Zizek it … in an otherwise sound matrix. <br />
<br />
Ethical decision makers must accept responsibility for the universal application of their ethical judgments. The plan universalizes the cause that is lost within the Communist idea as a necessary point of antagonism <br />
Vighi &amp; Feldner 10 [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/view/239/325" rel="nofollow">http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/view/239/325</a>; Cardiff University UK Fabio &amp; Heiko International Journal of Zizek Studies 4.1]<br />
Let us recall … actualises our lost causes? <br />
The plan is a necessary subtraction from the State. Supplementing state militarism and total utopian withdraw from the state are both apolitical – only preferring not to allow the State to restrict immigration can rupture the violence of totalitarian state structures -<br />
Zizek 2009 [Slavoj First as Tragedy, Then as Farce page 128 – 131<br />
The true question here is… achieve such a &quot;dictatorship&quot;? <br />
The affirmative stands for more then just lifting exclusion on topical visas, instead our particular demand is a politicized embrace of the Communist Impulse. This act of metaphoric condensation is a means of global opposition to the ideology of capital <br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1999 Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 204<br />
Let us recall …. to the dimension beyond particularity.
