NOTE:<br />
1. What we do on the negative is not really all that diverse -- we pretty much make arguments about why acknowledging the social location of the speaker is important and that heeding the perspectives of oppressed people is a competitive and superior method to standard debate practices like relying on the resolution and using the state. The list of cites below is somewhat short because what we do isn't all that complicated. Often times, these arguments are framed through a spoken-word piece (we have several that are read situationally) that Toya recites during the 1NC. Since a lot of our strategies are mix-and-match constructions of many/all of cites listed below, a very specific disclosure of what we may read in any given debate is hard to say since we don't really know.<br />
<br />
2. We would appreciate more reciprocation with disclosure -- we understand that many of the arguments/cards that folks read against us are very specific to what we do but when asked to put those specific arguments on the caselist, we are often not obliged. We believe in disclosure and engage in it -- we hope that our competitors will begin to make disclosure more of a 2-way street. Thank you.<br />

Vs. most others, we have made arguments about social location, structural violence (Abu Jamal), displacing agency/state focus bad (Nayar), and arguments about using debate as a site of contest<br />
