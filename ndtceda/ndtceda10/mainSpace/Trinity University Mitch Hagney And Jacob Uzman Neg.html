B. Violation – the aff only increases substantive eligibility, they don’t set aside visas for newly eligible immigrants<br />
<br />
C. Vote negative – topicality must be a voting issue because it tells the negative what they should and should not be prepared to debate.<br />
1. limits –only our interpretation provides functional limits because they have to read solvency evidence that would answer the offset counterplan. Burden of solvency advocate prevents proliferation of tiny affs.<br />
<br />
2.Makes them anti-topical – expanding eligibility within the current cap means that they fiat current visa recipients to get none. Leads to unpredictable advantages and steals generic negative ground – logically we should be able to say immigration bad, especially to beat a new aff.<br />

Our interpretation of debate is that the 1AC has to answer the question of the resolution with a normative policy affirmation of the topic and the aff has to defend the political implementation of a specific plan of action<br />

Absent grammar there is no predictable way to establish limits – research is derived from the resolution and it’s the only objective point of contention for debate to begin<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -.25in;">B. Limits – </span><br />
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">There are an infinite number of competing frameworks to evaluate a debate </span><br />
<span style="text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Mearsheimer 1995</span></span><span style="color: black;"> (John, Professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago, International Security, Winter 94/95) </span></span><br />

<br />
Finite limits are key to decision making and effective debate and a middle ground can be reached<br />
<span style="text-autospace: ideograph-numeric;"><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Lutz</span></span><strong>,</strong> Prof PolSci U of Huston, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">2k</span></span> (Donald, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p 46)</span><br />
The surprising fact is not that AND <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 10pt;">theory or not trying at all.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></span><br />
<br />
Limits key to fairness – they allow any individual ideology or theory or cause to become an affirmative which negates our ability to effectively research the aff position. Research is predicated off the resolution and has to be limited – even if you knew every aff if there were 1,000 you still couldn’t be prepared.<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">We need closure to engage in the substance of the aff</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: .5in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -.25in;">C. Ground </span><br />
1. Aff can claim anything from racism bad to violence bad – unpredictable affirmations means we can’t answer their methodology and are forced to impact turn. Turns the case – researching [impact turn to the aff] undoes whatever ethical improvements they have made so far.<br />
<br />
2. They dodge our best arguments – we can’t read a DA to the resolution or utilize any of the research we have already done. Proves their impact turns are not a fair test of framework because we couldn’t predict their offense.<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-outline-level: 1;">Impact is fairness</span><br />
Debate is a game – it has established norms which guide debate. Even if those norms are bad the only way to create effective change is to play by those norms otherwise the aff faces uncontrollable backlash <br />
<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Switch side debate uniquely good – forces the majority to listen to dissent and understand both sides of the issue. Adhering to the norms of switch side debate means debaters have to engage the substance of the 1AC. </span></span><br />

<strong>Courts CP</strong><br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that numerical limits on employment based visas for individuals with advanced degrees in science and technology from accredited universities in the United States is unconstitutional because it violates a Good Faith interpretation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services.<br />
<br />
Courts should apply international law to immigration cases<br />

<strong>EPA Regulations CP</strong><br />
Text: The United States Environmental Protection Agency should classify water vapor as a pollutant and impose sufficient regulations regarding water vapor emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency should file a lawsuit in the relevant federal court against Tyson Foods, Incorporated, Cargill Meat Solutions Corporation, and Smithfield Foods, Incorporated for violation of national ambient air quality standards.<br />

<strong>Parole CP vs Translators Aff</strong><br />
The Executive Branch of the United States Federal Government should grant travel and employment authorization to applicants for employment fourth preference visas who were employed in Iraq or Afghanistan by an organization or entity closely associated with the United States mission in Iraq or Afghanistan that has received United States Government funding and excluded from an employment fourth preference visa because of the numerical cap on employment fourth preference visas<br />
<br />
Executive has massive discretion to do this through parole<br />
