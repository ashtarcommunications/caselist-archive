B. Prefer it – resolutionally based:<br />

<h1 id="toc1"><a name="T - Admissibility Not Eligibility"></a>T - Admissibility Not Eligibility</h1>
 <br />
<strong>A. INTERPRETATION.</strong> Admissibility standards apply to all visas under INA §212(a), while eligibility standards relate to specific categories of visas. Eligibility allows you to receive a visa before you travel, while admissibility gets you into the US once you have arrived. <br />
<strong>Hasche 05</strong>, partner with the firm of Parker, Butte &amp; Lane, P.C., whose practice focuses on immigration law<br />

<u>The Act establishes… for permanent residence</u>.”[2]<br />
<br />
<strong>B. VIOLATION.</strong> Our interpretation includes and excludes possible affirmatives. The affirmative removes the terrorism admissibility requirement, which is excluded by our interpretation. This does not change eligibility for any of the topic visa categories.<br />
C. STANDARDS <br />
1. <strong>Limits</strong>. Our interpretation allows at least the 43 category cases listed on the ADI caselist, which meets needs for creativity and diversity. Their interpretation allows the aff to double that number again. Negatives will not be prepared with specific positions and evidence against all these admissibility cases, and education will suffer.<br />
2. <strong>Ground</strong>. Giving the negative the ground of admissibility allows us to propose PICs to increased or expanded eligibility category visas. Their interpretation takes away PIC ground and avoids a good test of the affirmative. <br />
3. <strong>Extratopicality</strong>. The USCIS lists visa name-number categories according to the 4 groups in the topic. If the aff grows one of those government-listed categories, they are topical. Their interpretation would allow them to remove admissibility standards that relate of any category of visa. This is extratopical, and makes it impossible for the judge to make an objective determination of jurisdiction, which is unfair to both sides.<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and communication. <strong>It’s a game of competing interpretations.</strong><br />
<br />
<h1 id="toc2"><a name="T - Must Raise Entire Cap"></a>T - Must Raise Entire Cap</h1>
 <br />
A. Interpretation – the Aff must increase the number of available visas for one of the topic categories – this contextually means raising the overall cap<br />
<br />
We’ll read a slew of contextual evidence to prove that exemptions and “increase the number of” are two different actions<br />

 We argued that significantly was qualitative whereas substantial is quantitative – this explodes limits because affs can pick a qualitative expansion of immigration which is unfair (letting in one immigrant may meet their interp, but obvi no neg links).<br />
