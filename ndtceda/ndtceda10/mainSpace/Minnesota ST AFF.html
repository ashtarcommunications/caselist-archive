Trafficking AFF<br />
<br />
Observation 1 (TVPA)<br />
<br />
Those who actually experience trafficking frequently fail to meet the eligibility requirements for T visas<br />
MACIEL-MATOS 10 (ENRIQUE A., COMMENT: BEYOND THE SHACKLES AND CHAINS OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE: HUMAN TRAFFICKING UNVEILED, The Scholar: St. Mary's Law Review on Minority Issues, 12 SCHOLAR 327, Winter, l/n bjn)<br />
In order to be eligible for [...] ineligible for badly needed immigration relief.<br />
<br />
<br />
TVPA requires survivors of trafficking to portray themselves as helpless victims while providing evidence of their victimhood<br />
Haynes, Assistant Professor of Law at New England Law, 08 (Dina Francesca, ARTICLE: (NOT) FOUND CHAINED TO A BED IN A BROTHEL: CONCEPTUAL, LEGAL, AND PROCEDURAL FAILURES TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT,” Georgetown Immigration Law Journal, Spring 2007, Lexis, mrw)<br />
When laws are invoked to protect [...] little corresponding understanding for trafficking victims.<br />
<br />
<br />
The discourse of trafficking constructs the victims of sex trafficking as white and innocent and in need of help while it constructs the domestic workers as racialized, guilty, and deserving of abuse—this is devastating to domestic workers because their discursive representation has material effects—it dooms them to slavery and it creates the parameters of policy and enforcement<br />

Current discourse of human trafficking, [...] safeguards to victims of worker abuse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Further, these discourses focus an approach to trafficked victims which fails and undercuts prosecution and leads to re-trafficking<br />

The discourses constructing the image of the domestic worker are built upon a master/slave binary which engenders racism and dehumanization<br />

Dehumanization of domestic workers, both [...] in domestic labor was intensified. n20<br />

The systemic impact of dehumanization outweighs and causes your impacts<br />

(Berube, David. Professor. English. University of South Carolina. “Nanotechnological Prolongevity: The Down Side.” 1997. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/prolong.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cas.sc.edu/engl/faculty/berube/prolong.htm</a>.)<br />
Assuming we are able to predict [...] dehumanization is evil's most powerful weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Current polices ignore that the domestic service industry is comprised of mostly poor, immigrant, raced, women and as such doesn’t recognize that the feminization of poverty and migration will only exacerbate this situation—only by taking all these factors into account can we address the institutional barriers to understanding oppression<br />
