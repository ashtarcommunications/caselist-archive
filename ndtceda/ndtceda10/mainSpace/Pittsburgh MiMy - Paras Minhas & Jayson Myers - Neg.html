There are 2 types of Hospitality, Conditional and Unconditional. The affirmative is a notion of pure conditional hospitality. They place conditions on which the immigrant must accept and become accustomed to or else there is no home for them. Their conception has no adherence to unconditional hospitality. <br />
<br />
Derrida, 1990. (Jacques, “A discussion with Jacques Derrida’”, Theory and Event Issue 5.1 Pg. 16-17)<br />
That's conditional hospitality,... that's unconditional hospitality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their purely political and regulated hospitality leads to tyrannical violence. The immigrant “other” is forced to becomes faceless and one with which any violence can be justified against.<br />
<br />
Derrida, 1997. (Jacques, “Adieu to Emmanuel levinas”, Stanford University Press. Pg. 96-97)<br />
The Preface of Totality ... will perhaps prevail.<br />
<br />
The Alternative is to reject the affirmative –<br />
Their purely political basing behind their plan condemns death of nations everywhere. We are not advocating to let every single person come to the U.S. unquestioned. We are advocating a discussion of a priori ethics where unconditional hospitality is taken into account and is the backbone behind political decisions. <br />
<br />
Yegenoglu 2003 (Meyda, Professor at Department of Sociology at Middle East Technical University, &quot;Liberal Multiculturalism and the Ethics of Hospitality in the Age of Globalization,&quot; Postmodern Culture 13.2, project muse. Pg.39)<br />
If unconditional or pure ... of closure and determinism.
