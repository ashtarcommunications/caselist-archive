Observation 1- Inherency<br />
<br />
We’re suffering a high-skilled worker shortage that US citizens won’t fill because of job market distortions- outside solutions to the worker drought is key to a fully-realized recovery<br />
Whitehouse 8-9-10 [Mark, deputy bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, “Some Firms Struggle to Hire Despite High Unemployment,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704895004575395491314812452.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704895004575395491314812452.html?mod=googlenews_wsj</a>]<br />
<br />
In Bloomington, Ill., machine shop … candidates before the recession.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should eliminate the H1-B cap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is the Economy:<br />
<br />
The economy is recovering slowly, but high unemployment due to lack of skilled workers will cause another setback<br />
IMF 7-8-10 [International Monetary Fund, “U.S. Economy Recovering, Debt And Unemployment Next Challenges,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/new070810b.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2010/new070810b.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
The U.S. economy is recovering… the necessary skill set.<br />
<br />
Even though demand is temporarily low, the cap forces businesses to turn away talent during the upswing that are key to maintain the recovery<br />
Yantis 8-1-10 [John, staff writer for The Arizona Republic, “Tech companies seek to increase cap on visas for foreign-born skilled workers,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/2010/08/01/20100801biz-tech-companies-seek-increase-cap-visas-foreign-born-skilled-workers-0801.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/business/articles/2010/08/01/20100801biz-tech-companies-seek-increase-cap-visas-foreign-born-skilled-workers-0801.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Of course, the recession … exist in the following year.<br />
<br />
The coming baby boomer retirement period and skilled worker drought make the plan an economic necessity<br />

<br />
As our population ages and…drop or immigration to slow.”<br />
<br />
The plan greatly enhances the job market overall<br />

<br />
H-1B workers are associated…workers they need are available.<br />
<br />
Raising the H-1B cap is the best way to stabilize the economy—the plan sends a crucial signal to put the country back on track to a high-tech economy, and is key to ensuring a sustainable recovery:<br />
Friedman ’09 [Thomas, three-time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist for the New York Times and former chief economic correspondent in the Washington bureau and chief White House correspondent, “The Open-Door Bailout,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/opinion/11friedman.html?_r=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/opinion/11friedman.html?_r=2</a>]<br />
<br />
While I think President Obama … Detroit is enough.<br />
<br />
And, innovation creates a tech base that creates an engine to sustain the US economy--generations of economists are on our side:<br />

<br />
US double-dip causes every major impact- we need a solution before 2011<br />

<br />
Could the current economic…history repeats itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is Medical Tech:<br />
<br />
Our medical technology sector is in a slump- pharmaceuticals and new drug production are taking severe hits<br />

<br />
Peter Drucker once said…reliable flow of products.<br />
<br />
The plan is vital to revive medical technology firms- otherwise we’ll lose the brightest workers<br />

<br />
Losing the Competition for Global…actively seek and master risk.<br />
<br />
New superbugs are beginning to spread globally and current treatments won’t stop them<br />

<br />
Despite the importance… of the human race,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is Infrastructure:<br />
<br />
US infrastructure is crumbling now:<br />
Matthew Harwood, 2010 (staff writer). January 15, 2010. “Crumbling Infrastructure a National Security Concern, Experts Say.”<br />

And because the United States…see them as a weaknesses.<br />

Terrorists will use nuclear weapons triggering global nuclear war and extinction<br />

The electrical and communications…weapons launched against it.<br />
<br />
An EMP attack risks extinction: rebuilding grid infrastructure is key to stopping the attack:<br />
Ronald Kessler, 2009 (chief Washington correspondent of Newsmax.com). “EMP Attack Could Wipe Out U.S.” September 9, 2009.

The federal government…especially the electric power grid.”<br />
<br />
A new wave of highly skilled workers would be the best stimulus for our infrastructure<br />
