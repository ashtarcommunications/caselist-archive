<br />
Subpoint B: Securitization<br />
<br />
The 1AC’s granting of new visas is rooted in the notion of exclusion – the letting in of some people NECESSARILY justifies the state’s exclusion of many more visa applicants – the ultimate goal is the securitization of the migrant rendering ALL applicants as potential risks to be managed<br />

A. Interest Convergence:<br />

The structural precondition for minority advances is that the AFF benefit the interests of white elites.<br />

One of the central tenets..., as I will illustrate.<br />
<br />
Interest convergence accounts for the material context of the 1960’s civil rights gains – Only our framework consistently explains the ups AND downs of minority empowerment by identifying the implicit bargain between concessions from government elites and the ideological support of black communities.<br />

<br />
B. Let’s Make A Deal:<br />
<br />
Our political economy examines the ballot as a moment of interest convergence – First between the 1AC and the structures of white supremacy and Second between the AFF team and the judge.<br />
<br />
FIRST, the 1AC makes the same bargain as the postwar Civil Right Compromise:<br />
<br />
For the structures of white supremacy, racial equity is not an end in and of itself – The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of the plan is accepting the current terms of American nationalism which means that the official antiracism they advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.<br />

<br />
SECOND, The Maoist<br />
<br />
The ballot is also a moment of interest convergence between the Affirmative and the judge – This rhetorical alliance with alterity is a technology of political demand that repeats the strategic attitude of the system it seeks to overturn – The guilty solidarity of the 1AC masks the privilege that prevents the AFF project from directly changing the lives of the people they invoke to warrant a ballot.<br />
<br />
Chow – Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities @ Brown - 1993<br />
(Rey, Writing Diaspora: Tactics of Intervention in Contemporary Cultural Studies, p. 16-17) jfs<br />
<br />
Why are &quot;tactics&quot; useful ...the academic sense<br />
<br />
AND, Within the Affirmative project, the ballot functions as a politics of self-subalternization, where the judge is encouraged to found a vacuous solidarity with the Affirmative Other by valorizing the material deprivation portrayed in the 1AC – However, their rhetorical strategy amounts to nothing more than a sham renunciation authorized by the same structures of power that produce alterity in the first place, turning the case at a higher level of analysis.<br />
<br />

(Rey, Writing Diaspora: Tactics of Intervention in Contemporary Cultural Studies, p. 10-11) jfs<br />
<br />
The Orientalist has a special ...that enables her rhetoric.<br />
<br />
C. Interest Divergence:<br />
<br />
The interest convergence represented by the ballot is temporary at best – Empirically, the implicit bargain that generates agency in exchange for minority support of elite policy demands cannot last – The most resistant elements of movements will either be bought off or brutally suppressed, turning the case either way.<br />
<br />
