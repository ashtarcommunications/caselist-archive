<em><strong>The affirmative makes a deliberate attempt to liberalize immigration laws. Such an act results in their participation in the ideology of capital. The prevasive ideology of capitalism relies upon the ability of both employers and employees to create contracts freely with one another (regardless of national origin), and pure capitalists seek to open our borders while providing no added safety nets.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Contention II: The Harms</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Unfortunately for the majority of us, the interests of the capitalists and those of labor are “diametrically opposed” from one another. The rapid accumulation of wealth causes the relative wages of employees to fall and increases the leads to the dependence of labor on capital; both of which come at the cost of the employee’s social position.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Poverty in society is intimately linked with capitalism through its ‘reserve army of labor,’ which is the world’s poor. Having a market of underemployeed individuals is a necessity to the capitalists profit accumulation.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>The Alternative</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Our alternative we endorse is the abandonment of our belief in capitalism.</strong> <strong>Though not ideal, rejection of docile political action within the prevailing capitalist system is the only means to effectively solve for capitalism and poverty in the long run. Our individual rejection has substantial transformative potential because capitalism’s existence is sustained only by the willingness of individuals to believe in the system, and this desertion is the first step to initiating a new socio-political reality.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>Our alternative may not offer citizens a direct, concrete action, the first crucial step towards changing things for the better requires a liberation of thinking and the self-discipline to resist the temptation of acting hastily on concrete plans that are doomed to fail.</strong></em><br />

<em>Furthermore, you should prefer our alternative because debate is a zone for intellectual alignment and one that allows for us to reform our current practices in the most effective means possible. Rather than pushing another flawwed policy proposal, we recognize that the underlying intellectual framework- upon which we develop these proposed ‘solutions’- is inherently defective. Only by illuminating the philosophical underpinings of our current political and economic institutions and thus changing the ways in which we develop policies can we actually begin to find true remedies to the ills of society.</em><br />
