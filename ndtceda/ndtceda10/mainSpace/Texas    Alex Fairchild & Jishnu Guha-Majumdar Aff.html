First, individuals in the US via international marriage brokerages, or IMBS, are not eligible for T-visas now. <br />

<br />
Plan— <br />
<br />
The United States federal government should expand eligibility for T-visas to individuals who are in the United States via an International Marriage Brokerage. <br />
<br />
Current feminist perspectives have focused exclusively on mail order brides through the lens of women’s agency.<br />
This approach ignores and silences discussions of the many structures and institutions that place women into positions where oppression is inevitable.<br />
Identifying IMBs as trafficking is crucial to a return to a feminist perspective that both empowers women and challenges the structures that force MOBs into a system of abuse and subservience.<br />
Quek 10 <span style="font-weight: normal;">(Kaye, School of Social and Political Sciences, University of Melbourne, “EMPOWERING THE CONSUMER AND BUYING A WIFE ONLINE”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://apsa2010.com.au/full-papers/pdf/APSA2010_0099.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://apsa2010.com.au/full-papers/pdf/APSA2010_0099.pdf</a>)</span><br />
The idea <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 10pt;">that … <strong>contemporary feminist thinking</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
And, in 2005, the International Marriage Brokerage Reform Act was folded into the Violence Against Women Act and NOT the Trafficking Victims Protection Act which provides T-Visas. <br />
However, this legislative change, consistent with flawed feminist views, was an active decision to confine the discussion of MOBs to the realm of domestic politics despite the fact that IMBs constitute international trafficking. <br />
The ballot is a symbolic rejection of this view and a recognition of mistake that congress has made --- this is the first step to reformulate politics. <br />

<span style="font-size: 6pt;">In recent years, …</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> brides as a group</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span><br />
<br />
Specifically, the aff is a rethinking of the way gender knowledge is structured in terms of trafficking --- this and the tracing of historical patterns of feminism is critical to open up intellectual space to transform gendered orders. <br />
A recognition of the way that production of knowledge influences policies is crucial. <br />

<br />
We will defend fiat of our plan, BUT it is too narrow to focus on the tangible end impacts of our policy. <br />
The benefit of the aff is symbolic --- specifically, the judge should evaluate trafficking legislation as <u>an end in and of itself</u>.<br />
Such an approach to trafficking policymaking is critical to educate and spur discussions between congress, interest groups, movements, and the public in order to align ourselves with discourses that are the first step towards effective state engagement. <br />

The role of the ballot is to affirm that IMBs are a form of trafficking. <br />
Negative ploys to avoid the debate over trafficking reify the political attitude that has allowed IMBs to grow unregulated and crowd out effective policymaking.<br />

Plan—<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The United State federal government should extend eligibility for T-visas to individuals who are in the United States via an International Marriage Brokerage. </span></strong><br />
<br />
Advantage One—<br />
<br />
The United States is a nation built on the back of trafficking from indigenous people to modern internet-based IMBS. We must recognize the history and place and throw off attached stereotypes of trafficking marred by naiveté and gold-digging. The problem is in the predatory industry that promotes and feeds it.<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Jackson 2</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Suzanne H., Associate Professor of Clinical Law, The George Washington University Law School., June, “ To Honor and Obey: Trafficking in &quot;Mail-Order Brides&quot;”, 70 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 475, Lexis Law, st) </span><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Native American women… measures needed to address its ills. </span></u><br />
<br />
And, IMBS constitute trafficking BUT current law confines the problem domestically. In 2005, the International Marriage Brokerage Reform Act was folded into the Violence Against Women Act and NOT the Trafficking Victims Protection Act which provides T-Visas. This was an active decision made by policymakers as to what the expressive problem was, which ended in them deciding IMBs were not trafficking but instead only a domestic violence issue.<br />
The question for this round is simple. Your ballot must call out the truth about IMBs—that they are human trafficking akin to slavery. Voting aff symbolically exposes IMBs for what they truly are.<br />

We will defend fiat of our plan, BUT it is too narrow to only look at the tangible end impacts of our policy.

That is the same type of hand washing that has occurred and legitimized trafficking-based slavery in the past – Voting aff is an essential instrumental and expressive starting point. </span></strong><br />
