C<strong>ontention Two is Dignity</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Human communities are defined by the narratives they use to distinguish between self and other. Sacred orders define themselves by a fixed transcendent idea of the human and seek to eradicate the profane other. Alternatively, holy communities seek self-transcendence through the affirmation of the dignity of others through justice and compassion.</strong><br />
Fasching and deChant 2001 (Darrell J., Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, Dell, Director of Religious Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, Pp. 10) Burr<br />
Human religiousness is defined by two opposing types of experience that tend to shape the way stories are told and interpreted---AND---<span style="background-color: yellow;">which affirm</span> the <span style="background-color: yellow;">human dignity </span>of precisely those who do not share my identity and my stories.<br />
<br />
<strong>Holy communities are produced through an alienated theology like the plan, which rejects the pretension towards certainty in our own narratives, leaving us open to the transformative impact of the experiences of others. The apologetic theology of sacred orders is a methodology of domination. Its foreclosure of the possibility of truth in difference condemns us to an apocalyptic stalemate moving ever closer to human self-destruction.</strong><br />

The best way to describe the &quot;style&quot; of the theology of culture proposed in these books is to suggest that it is a &quot;decentered&quot; or &quot;alienated theology&quot;. ---AND---<span style="background-color: yellow;"> In either case we place ourselves under the dark </span>and threatening <span style="background-color: yellow;">cloud of </span>a <span style="background-color: yellow;">nuclear apocalypse </span>that such a path risks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Utopian ethics are necessary to preserve human dignity and make incremental steps towards the creation of an ethical world.</strong><br />
Fasching, 1993 (Darrell, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima)<br />
<span style="background-color: yellow;">Utopians </span>seem to <span style="background-color: yellow;">offer vague hopes for some unrealizable fu­ture</span>---AND--- for the world as we know it is passing away&quot; (1 Corinthians 7:30-31).<br />
<br />
<strong>We must actively pursue and affirm human dignity in order to break down white supremacy.</strong><br />

It was a victory for youth, and their social and political sensibilities---AND---and making sure they know that the success of one man of color does not equate to the eradication of systemic racial inequity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The aff isn’t deontology or Levinasian responsibility, it’s about creating a framework for decision-making which subjects every choice to the litmus test of human dignity. We don’t abandon politics for some transcendent priorities, rather our framework is a prerequisite to any political prediction or decision.</strong><br />
Fasching and deChant 2001 (Darrell J., Professor of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, Dell, Director of Religious Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of South Florida, Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, p. 21-22) Bankey<br />
Modern philosophical forms of ethics have sought to achieve the &quot;ethical point of view&quot; by adhering to &quot;rational objectivity.&quot; The ethical point of view that everyone must strive to achieve is interpreted as the point of view that &quot;<span style="background-color: yellow;">any disinterested observer</span>&quot; could supply. ---AND--- It is about David, the greatest King of ancient Israel (c.1000 BCE).<br />
