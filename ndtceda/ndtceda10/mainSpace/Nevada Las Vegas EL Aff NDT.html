1AC round NDT Round 1<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Las Vegas is known as America’s premier adult vacation land. Popular culture has promoted the idea that What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas. You can come to Las Vegas, gamble with abandon, drink until you can’t see, and have crazy sex with any number of people that you can order to be delivered to your casino hotel room. Movies and advertisements routinely portray the sex industry in Las Vegas as glamorous, exciting, care-free, consequence-free, and victim-free. Everything from the truck-mounted billboards that constantly circle the strip advertising “HOT BABES DIRECT TO YOU” to the brothel advertisements where you can order “services” off of a menu of sex positions, different nationalities, and various fetishes promote these ideas. For example, the LasVegasXXXscorts.com website advertises-<br />
<br />
[Las VegasXXXscorts.com]<br />
<br />
Hot Las Vegas ....be right there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But, there is a dark underbelly to Las Vegas-The entertainment industry runs off of immigrants who have been trafficked into the city. They are forced into horrific situations of slavery.<br />
<br />
Miller, former Las Vegas City Councilman, 6 [Steve, “Las Vegas is the end of the road in the sex slave trade”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanmafia.com/inside_vegas/3-20-06_inside_vegas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanmafia.com/inside_vegas/3-20-06_inside_vegas.html</a>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanmafia.com/inside_vegas/3-20-06_inside_vegas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanmafia.com/inside_vegas/3-20-06_inside_vegas.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The road starts in the jungles ....bow their heads in shame.<br />
<br />
GENDERED LANGUAGE SAID IN CONTEXT<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, it’s not just Asian and Russian immigrants. Human trafficking into Las Vegas occurs from all corners of the world.<br />

<br />
Maybe Farley´s most shocking find is that &quot;Las Vegas is the epicenter of North American trafficking and prostitution. Women are trafficked into this city from all over the world, including Korea, China, Mexico, Russia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Ukraine, Czech Republic and others.&quot;<br />
<br />
In fact, Las Vegas is a top destination for human trafficking<br />

Las Vegas represents the worst of the worst: We live in the epicenter of degradation. This directly impacts the ability of the United States to combat sex trafficking worldwide<br />

<br />
There is probably no city...<br />
<br />
“That ended when I became mayor,” said Mr. Goodman.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, human trafficking is intrinsically linked to immigration policy. For example,<br />
<br />
Temporary work visas are used as a tool of coercion in sex trafficking<br />

The starting point of the negative is complicit with the ideology of politics-as-making—forcing the debate to be about instrumental desirability imposes mastery, control, and violence into the realm of politics.
