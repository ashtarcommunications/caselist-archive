<strong>Their feminism is arrogant repression of women who disagree with them</strong><br />

Nevertheless<strong><u>, the claim of &quot;coercion into pornography&quot; generally rests on a few horrifying and well-publicized accounts by women who had worked in the industry</u></strong>. After leaving, they claimed they had been coerced into performing pornographic acts. These accounts must not be cavalierly dismissed.<br />
Nor should they be given a rubber stamp of acceptance. If the specific charges are found to be true, this truth should not be allowed to drown out the voices of women who have benefited from pornography.<br />
<strong><u>If a specific charge of &quot;coercion into pornography&quot; is proven true, those who used force or threats to make a woman perform should be charged with kidnapping, assault, and/or rape.</u></strong> Any pictures or films that result from the coercion should be confiscated and burned, because no one has the right to benefit from the proceeds of a crime.<br />
<strong><u>What radical feminists propose, however, offers women less protection than they already have</u></strong>. Radical feminists insist that &quot;coercion into pornography&quot; is a civil rights violation, a form of discrimination against women. According to them, a man who kidnaps a woman, imprisons her, and forces her to pose at gunpoint has not committed a criminal act, but a civil one. Instead, feminists should be calling for the full enforcement of criminal laws.<br />
Women in porn who have not been physically coerced have been so traumatized by patriarchy that they cannot give &quot;real&quot; consent. And the absence of real consent is the equivalent of coercion.<br />
This is the second way in which women in the industry are said to be victims of violence. <strong><u>They are said to be so brainwashed by white male culture that they cannot render consent</u></strong>. Thus, they are <em>de facto</em> coerced. <strong><u>Consider how arrogant this statement is.</u></strong><br />
Although women in pornography <em>appear</em> to be willing, anti-porn feminists see through this charade. They know that no psychologically healthy woman would agree to the humiliation and degradation of pornography. If agreement seems to be present, it is only because the women have been so emotionally beaten down they have fallen in love with their own oppression. In order to restore real choice to these victims, feminists must rescue them from themselves. In other words, any woman who poses for pornography is psychologically damaged, by definition, and her avowed wishes need not be respected. Like a mentally ill patient, she is incapable of acting in her own interests because she is incapable of knowing what they are.<br />
<strong><u>If a woman enjoys performing sex acts in front of a camera, it is not because she is a unique human being who reasons and reacts from a different background or personality. No. It is because she is psychologically damaged and no longer responsible for her actions</u></strong>. She must, in effect, become a political ward of radical feminists, who will make the correct choices for her.<br />
<strong><u>This is more than an attack on the right to pose for pornography. It is a denial of a woman's right to choose anything outside the narrow corridor of choices offered by political/sexual correctness.</u></strong><br />
The right to choose hinges on the right to make a &quot;wrong&quot; choice. Freedom of religion entails the right to be an atheist. Freedom of speech involves the right to be silent. Freedom of choice requires the right to make bad choices-that is, a decision society considers to be wrong. After all, society is not going to stop a woman from doing what it wants her to do. But <strong><u>radical feminists</u></strong> are going one step farther than simply denying that women have the right to make wrong choices; they <strong><u>deny that women have the <em>ability</em> to choose.</u></strong> How do radical feminists explain away the abundant and clear evidence of consent-contracts, witnesses, personal testimony, releases, etc. provided by these women? They handle this sticky issue by redefining consent so as to make it unrecognizable. According to the Minneapolis ordinance drafted by MacKinnon and Dworkin, for example, the following factors do not indicate the presence of consent: that <strong><u>the woman is of age; that she showed no resistance; that a contract was signed and witnessed; that payment was received.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Anti-porn feminists turn back centuries of feminist progress and deny women the right to choose</strong><br />

<strong><u>According to radical feminists, even if a woman in pornography signed a contract with full knowledge, she can sue on the grounds of coercion. What legal implications does this have for a woman's right to contract?</u></strong> What legal weight will future negotiators give to a woman's signature? <strong><u>Women's contracts will be legally unenforceable; their signature will become a legal triviality.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>For centuries, women have struggled against tremendous odds to have their contracts taken seriously</u></strong>. At great personal expense, they stood up and demanded the right to own land, to control their own wages, to retain custody of their children-in other words, to become legally responsible for themselves and for their property. A woman's consent must never again become legally irrelevant.<br />
Yet this is what radical feminists propose to do. They claim that women are so weak-willed and feeble-minded that cultural pressures easily overwhelm their free will and make them into the playthings of patriarchy. Consider one fact: <em>Everyone is</em> formed by his or her culture. The very language with which we speak and formulate thought comes from our culture. And certainly there are times when cultural pressures lead people to make bad choices. But <strong><u>to say that any woman who poses nude does so only because she has been indoctrinated by patriarchy, is to eliminate the possibility of her ever choosing anything.</u></strong><br />
In other words, if one choice is invalidated because of cultural influences, all choices are invalidated. Why? Because <em>all</em> choices are culturally influenced if only because the people making them have been shaped by experience. Every decision is made in the presence of cultural pressures<strong><u>. To invalidate a woman's choices is to deny her the one protection she has against an unhealthy culture: namely, the right to decide for herself.</u></strong> Yet this is what radical feminists propose. And they do so under the guise of protecting psychologically damaged women. Pause for a moment. Think of what is being said.<br />
<strong><u>Anti-porn feminists want us to accept their sexual preferences as gospel. Presumably, their theories are based on solid fact and deep insight</u></strong>. Although they have been born and raised in the same patriarchal culture that has warped other women, radical feminists have somehow escaped unscathed. Just as they have escaped being damaged by the pornography they view. Somehow these women have scaled the pinnacle, from which they now look down and make pronouncements on the lifestyle of those beneath them. Perhaps radical feminists are superwomen. Perhaps they are merely fanatics unwilling to respect any position other than their own. If women's choices are to be trashed, why should radical feminists fare better than other women? Are they the elite<strong><u>? If the choices of pornographic models are not to be taken seriously, radical feminists cannot claim respect for their choices either. If culture negates the free will of women, anti-porn feminists are in the same boat as the rest of us.</u></strong><br />

<strong>No impact to porn, their analysis is bullshit, women have a right to choose and porn decreases violence</strong><br />

<strong><u>It is said that pornography</u></strong> is the way men subjugate women, in order to maintain their own position of power. It <strong><u>is the way men degrade and objectify women</u></strong>. Radical feminists avoid words like <em>good</em> or <em>evil.</em> They prefer to use more politically/sexually correct terms like <em>oppression</em> and <em>exploitation.</em><br />
Let's examine the second accusation first: the idea that pornography is degrading to women. <strong><em><u>Degrading is</u></em> <u>a subjective term</u></strong>. Personally, I find detergent commercials in which women become orgasmic over soapsuds to be tremendously degrading to women. I find movies in which prostitutes are treated like ignorant drug addicts to be slander against women. <strong><u>Every woman has the right-the need!-to define degradation for herself.</u></strong> Next it is charged that pornography objectifies women<strong><u>: It converts them into sexual objects. Again, what does this mean? If taken literally, it means nothing at all because objects don't have sexuality; only human beings do. But the charge that pornography portrays women as &quot;sexual beings&quot; would not inspire rage and, so, it has no place in the anti-porn rhetoric</u></strong>. Usually, <strong><u>the term <em>sex objects</em> means that women are shown as &quot;body parts&quot;</u></strong>; they are reduced to being physical objects. <strong><u>What is wrong with this? Women are as much their bodies as they are their minds or souls. No one gets upset if you present a women as a brain or as a spiritual being. Yet those portrayals ignore women as physical beings. To get upset by an image that focuses on the human body is merely to demonstrate a bad attitude toward what is physical. If I concentrated on a woman's sense of humor to the exclusion of her other characteristics, would this be degrading?</u></strong> Why is it degrading to focus on her sexuality? Underlying this attitude is the view that sex must be somehow ennobled to be proper. And, for that matter, <strong><u>why is a naked female body more of an &quot;object&quot; than a clothed one?</u></strong> Pornography, it is said, presents false images about women. Pornography is a lie, because it presents women as large-breasted nymphomanics. If this accusation is true, the remedy is not to ban pornography, but to recruit a wider variety of women into the industry. The Meese Commission carefully avoided a repetition of this embarrassing liberalism. For example, the first Meese hearing allowed testimony from forty-two anti-porn advocates as opposed and only three pro-freedom of speech people. Many anticensorship groups, including major writers' organizations, were denied the chance to speak. The reason given: lack of time.But when radical feminist Dorchen Leidholt, who had already testified, rushed the microphone along with a group of other women, she was given extra time. The microphones stayed switched on. And the chairman requested a written copy of her remarks. Is it any wonder that the Meese Commission found there to be a relationship between pornography and violence? In the <em>Virginia Law Review,</em> Nadine Strossen commented on the shaky ground beneath this finding: &quot;The Meese Commission ... relied on Professor Murray Straus' correlational studies ... to `justify' their conclusions that exposure to `pornography' leads to sexual assaults. But, as Professor Straus wrote the Commission, `I do not believe that [my] research demonstrates that pornography causes rape.' &quot; [15] Other studies, such as the one prepared by feminist Thelma McCormick (1983) for the Metropolitan <strong><u>Toronto Task Force on Violence Against Women, found no pattern to indicate a connection between pornography and sex crimes. Incredibly, the Task Force suppressed the study and re-assigned the project to a procensorship male, who returned the &quot;correct&quot; results</u></strong>. His study was published. Moving away from studies, what of real world feedback? In West Germany, <strong><u>rape rates have slightly declined since 1973, when pornography became widely available</u></strong>; meanwhile, other violent crime has increased. In Japan, where pornography depicting violence is widely available, rape is much lower per capita than in the United States, where violence in porn is restricted. It can be argued that all forms of violence are lower in these countries. The low rate of violence against women may be nothing more than a reflection of this. Nevertheless<strong><u>,</u></strong> <strong><u>if pornography were intimately connected to violence against women, you would expect to see that connection to be manifested in some manner. It is up to radical feminists to explain why it is not.</u></strong><br />

<strong>Even if you win the correlation argument, it doesn’t prove causation</strong><br />

<br />
But even generously <strong><u>granting the assumption that a correlation <em>does</em> exist between pornography and violence, what would such a correlation tell us? It would certainly not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship. It is a fallacy to assume that if A can be correlated with B, then A causes B</u></strong>. Such a correlation may indicate nothing more than that both are caused by another factor, C. For example, there is a high correlation between the number of doctors in a city and the number of alcoholics there. One doesn't cause the other; both statistics are proportional to the size of the city's population.<br />

<strong>The aff alienates women and denies them the right of free speech and the right to choose, this turns the aff because the women get sent to prison</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">Swimme 05</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> (Stacey </span>“<span style="color: black;">1) Robyn Few/Stacey Swimme/Sex Worker pro-sex trade letter and resolution proposed Wednesday Sept. 7, 2005:,” )</span><br />
<strong><u>The women's movement is at a crucial crossroad</u></strong> and is in desperate need of a strategy that will embrace all women, without alienating many based on their sexual lifestyles, occupations or other sexual and reproductive decisions. The &quot;Pornography Outreach and Education&quot; <strong><u>resolution not only alienates many women based on their sexual interests and occupations, it supports a form of censorship that would threaten the very right to freedom of speech that we use to educate and fight for women's reproductive rights and education.</u></strong> <br />
<strong><u>An anti-pornography and anti-prostitution approach to the issues related to the sex industry will not promote real solutions for women who work against their will, nor does it support a woman's right to self-determination if choosing to work in the sex industry. Women need real solutions, such as sensible health and employment policies, occupational training, health care, STI prevention education, literacy classes, collective bargaining power</u></strong>, rights for migrant workers and realistic options when exiting the sex industry. <br />
<strong><u>Jail is not a solution to many of the problems that sex industry workers deal with on a daily basis. The American justice system is the most forceful expression of Patriarchy and male domination in American government today. The criminal status of some sex workers subjects many women to government-sanctioned harassment and assault under the guise of &quot;saving&quot; them.</u></strong> Furthermore, if workers live in fear of jail or deportation, even losing custody of their children in some instances- how can they make their voices heard to those who truly care to help them? Stigmatization, alienation, and rejection from society work to exacerbate the silence imposed on women in all areas of the sex industry.<br />
Passing an anti-pornography resolution will not address the very urgent need for reform that the health and safety of women in the sex industry are dependent on. This resolution instead asks NOW to make a public statement alienating women who choose to work in the sex industry whose beliefs are often aligned with the core values of NOW. Please support the alternate resolution titled &quot;Unity, Safety and Choice for All Women&quot; which affirms NOW's commitment to fight violence and discrimination against women while standing behind a woman's right to choose in all facets of her sexual life and reproductive options so that all women can feel like they belong with NOW and can join us in our struggle to protect Women's Rights.<br />

<strong>Their feminism ignores biological differences, ignores rights, and leads to repression that helps bring fascism</strong><br />

<strong><u>&quot;My message to the media is: Wake up! The silencing of authentic debate among feminists just helps the rise of the far right.</u></strong> When the media get locked in their Northeastern ghetto and become slaves of the feminist establishment and fanatical special interests, the American audience ends up looking to conservative voices for common sense. As a libertarian Democrat, I protest against this self-defeating tyranny of political correctness. (Vamps and Tramps, p. 431) &quot;<strong><u>White middle-class girls at the elite colleges and universities seem to want the world handed to them on a platter. They have been sheltered, coddled, and flattered. Having taught at a wide variety of institutions over my ill-starred career, I have observed that working-class or lower-middle-class girls, who are from financially struggling families and who must take a patchwork of menial off-campus jobs to stay in school, are usually the least hospitable to feminist rhetoric</u></strong>. They see life as it is and have fewer illusions about sex. It is affluent, upper-middle class students who most spout the party line - as if the grisly hyperemotionalism of feminist jargon satisfies their hunger for meaningful experience outside their eventless upbringing. In the absence of war, invent one. (Vamps &amp; Tramps, p. 28) &quot;Feminist confidence that the whole human race can be &quot;reeducated&quot; to totally eliminate the possibility of rape is pure folly...Wave after wave of boys hit puberty every year. Do feminists, with their multicultural pretensions, really envision a massive export of white bourgeois good manners all around the world? Speak of imperialism!&quot;(Vamps &amp; Tramps, p. 33.) &quot;It is tremendously difficult to convince feminist professional women of the existence of unconscious or subliminal erotic communication. As my friend Bruce Benderson says, their middle class world has &quot;no subtext<strong><u>.&quot;...</u></strong><strong><u>That men can satisfy their desires on an inert or unconscious object seems intolerable to such women, though it is a fact of life, palatable or not. Male sexual functioning does not depend on female response.</u></strong> And the illicit is always highly charged. (Vamps &amp; Tramps, p.37) <br />
&quot;<strong><u>A major failing of most feminist ideology is its dumb, ungenerous stereotyping of men as tyrants and abusers</u></strong>, when in fact-as I know full well, from my own mortifying lesbian experience- men are tormented by women's flirtatiousness and hemming and hawing, their manipulations and changeableness, their humiliating rejections. Cock teasing is a universal reality. It is part of women's merciless testing and cold-eyed comparison shopping for potential mates. <strong><u>Men will do anything to win the favor of women. Women literally <em>size up</em> men- &quot;What can you show me?&quot;- in bed and out. If middle class feminists think they conduct their love lives perfectly rationally, without any instinctual influences from biology, they are imbeciles</u></strong>. (Vamps &amp; Tramps, p. 35) &quot;This is <em>madness!</em> The idea that somehow one cannot critique liberalism from the left, from the left wing of liberalism. I mean, <em>how</em> can people be so stupid?...So, I'm this very powerful weapon, okay, being used <em>not</em> by the right against the left but rather by people who are <em>liberal</em> thinkers who have been enslaved by these poseurs, these racketeers, people who are pretending to be liberal but who are in fact just naive politically. I have been congratulated by women<strong><u>--</u></strong><strong><u>people rush up to me at the end of my lectures--women of my age, women who are younger, who are <em>so sick</em> of being bullied by these sanctimonious <em>puritans</em> who call themselves feminists. I'm a feminist, but I am liberating current feminism from these false feminists who have a death grip on it right now, who are antiporn and so on</u></strong>. I'm bringing, like Madonna, a sense of beauty and pleasure and sensuality back into feminism. Because, you know, feminism's main problem for the last twenty years has been that it is incapable of appreciating art, okay? There is no aesthetics in feminism. All there is, is a social agenda. Art is made a servant to a prefab social agenda. So what I'm doing is allowing feminism to take aesthetics into it, and also psychology.(Vamps &amp; Tramps p. 246-247) <br />
&quot;(Andrea) Dworkin's blanket condemnation of fellatio as disgusting and violent should make every man furious. (Catharine) MacKinnon and Dworkin are victim-mongers, ambulance chasers, atrocity addicts. <strong><u>MacKinnon begins every argument from big, flawed premises such as &quot;male supremacy&quot; or &quot;misogyny,&quot; while Dworkin spouts glib Auschwitz metaphors at the drop of a bra. Here's one of their typical maxims:&quot;The pornographers rank with Nazis and Klansmen in promoting hatred and violence.&quot; Anyone who could write such a sentence knows nothing about pornography <em>or</em> Nazism....In arguing that a hypothetical physical safety on the streets should take precedence over the democratic principle of free speech, MacKinnon aligns herself with the authoritarian Soviet comissars. She would lobotomize the village in order to save it.&quot;</u></strong> <br />

&quot;<strong><u>Feminist anti-porn discourse virtually always ignores the gigantic gay male porn industry, since any mention of the latter would bring crashing to the ground the absurd argument that pornography is by definition subordination of women...Far from poisoning the mind, pornography shows the deepest truth about sexuality, stripped of romantic veneer....What feminists denounce as woman's humiliating total accessibility in porn is actually her elevation to high priestess of a pagan paradise garden, where the body has become a bountiful fruit tree where growth and harvest are simultaneous.</u></strong>&quot; (Vamps &amp; Tramps, p. 66) <br />

If not Wikipedia, then what? Maybe rape is down because former rapists have found their true loves on <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.match.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Match.com</a>. But professor Kendall points out that the effects are strongest among 15-year-old to 19-year-old perpetrators—the group least likely to use such dating services.<br />
Moreover, professor Kendall argues that those teenagers are precisely the group that (presumably) relies most heavily on the Internet for access to porn. When you're living with your parents, it's a lot easier to close your browser in a hurry than to hide a stash of magazines. So, the auxiliary evidence is all consistent with the hypothesis that Net access reduces rape because Net access makes it easy to find porn. <br />
Next, violence<strong><u>. What happens when a particularly violent movie is released? Answer: Violent crime rates fall.

<strong>Porn is a victory for feminists, women love it</strong><br />

<strong><u>Feminists should actually consider modern pornography a major victory for the women involved. Female porn actresses not only get paid lots of money to do something that comes naturally to them, they are usually having sex with well-hung studs who know how to handle their business in bed</u></strong> (that is, last longer than 30 seconds<strong><u>). The average porn film depicts male-centered sex, yes, but male-centered sex that at least <em>looks</em> (and probably is) more enjoyable and pleasurable for the woman than anything going on in the &quot;average&quot; American bedroom</u></strong> (where couples have sex for an average 8.5 minutes from foreplay to finish).<br />
<br />
I think it's one of the biggest and dirtiest unspoken truths of the sex industry <strong><u>that the women involved, in many cases, are <em>loving it</em> -- whether prostitutes or porn actresses, these women are getting paid to have sex.</u></strong> <br />

<strong>Porn good—empowers women, leads to sexual freedom, breaks down cultural and political stereotypes, is good therapy, and decreases violence against women</strong><br />
<strong>McElroy 97</strong> (Wendy, “A Feminist Defense of Pornography,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/fi/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Free Inquiry</a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/fi/index.htm" rel="nofollow"> //magazine//</a><em><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">, Volume 17, Number 4.</span></em> Fall, 1997 - Volume 17, Number 4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/mcelroy_17_4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/mcelroy_17_4.html</a> )<br />
<span style="color: black;">As a &quot;pro-sex&quot; feminist, I contend: <strong><u>Pornography benefits women, both personally and politically</u></strong>. It provides sexual information on at least three levels: </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="color: black;">It gives a panoramic view of the world's sexual possibilities</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">. This is true even of basic sexual information such as masturbation<strong><u>. It is not uncommon for women to reach adulthood without knowing how to give themselves pleasure.</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="color: black;">It allows women to &quot;safely&quot; experience sexual alternatives and satisfy a healthy sexual curiosity</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">. The world is a dangerous place. By contrast, pornography can be a source of solitary enlightenment. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">It offers the emotional information that comes only from experiencing something either directly or vicariously. It provides us with a sense how it would &quot;feel&quot; to do something. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Pornography allows women to enjoy scenes and situations that would be anathema to them in real life. Take, for example, one of the most common fantasies reported by women - the fantasy of &quot;being taken.&quot; The first thing to understand is that a rape fantasy does not represent a desire for the real thing. Why would a healthy woman daydream about being raped? Perhaps by losing control, she also sheds all sense of responsibility for and guilt over sex. Perhaps it is the exact opposite of the polite, gentle sex she has now. Perhaps it is flattering to imagine a particular man being so overwhelmed by her that he must have her. Perhaps she is curious. Perhaps she has some masochistic feelings that are vented through the fantasy. Is it better to bottle them up? </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="color: black;">Pornography breaks cultural and political stereotypes, so that each woman can interpret sex for herself.</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> <strong><u>Anti-feminists tell women to be ashamed of their appetites and urges. Pornography tells them to accept and enjoy them. Pornography can be good therapy.</u></strong> Pornography provides a sexual outlet for those who - for whatever reason - have no sexual partner. Perhaps they are away from home, recently widowed, isolated because of infirmity. Perhaps they simply choose to be alone. Couples also use pornography to enhance their relationship. Sometimes they do so on their own, watching videos and exploring their reactions together. Sometimes, the couples go to a sex therapist who advises them to use pornography as a way of opening up communication on sex. By sharing pornography, the couples are able to experience variety in their sex lives without having to commit adultery. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Pornography benefits women politically in many ways. <strong><u>Historically, pornography and feminism have been fellow travelers and natural allies. Although it is not possible to draw a cause-and-effect relationship between the rise of pornography and that of feminism, they both demand the same social conditions - namely, sexual freedom.</u></strong> </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;"> Pornography is free speech applied to the sexual realm. </span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">Freedom of speech is the ally of those who seek change: it is the enemy of those who seek to maintain control. Pornography, along with all other forms of sexual heresy, such as homosexuality, should have the same legal protection as political heresy. <strong><u>This protection is especially important to women, whose sexuality has been controlled by censorship through the centuries.</u></strong> </span><strong><u><span style="color: black;"> Viewing pornography may well have a cathartic effect on men who have violent urges toward women.

What is wrong with this? Women are as much their bodies as they are their minds or souls. No one gets upset if you present women as &quot;brains&quot; or as spiritual beings.

<strong>Porn decreases sex crimes and doesn’t cause misogyny, repression leads to rape</strong><br />
<strong>Marquit 10</strong> (Miranda, “Could Porn Be Good For Society?,” March 10, 2010<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.physorg.com/news187448961.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physorg.com/news187448961.html</a> )<br />
Over the years, many scientists have investigated the link between pornography (considered legal under the First Amendment in the United States unless judged “obscene”) and sex crimes and attitudes towards women. And <strong><u>in every region investigated,</u></strong> researchers have found that <strong><u>as pornography has increased in availability, sex crimes have either decreased or not increased.</u></strong><br />
While that is far from a ringing endorsement, it does at least seem to indicate that <strong><u>pornography isn't contributing to sex crimes</u></strong>. While some naysayers may point out that most offenders in prison have been exposed to porn, the fact of the matter is that nearly every male -- and a good number of females -- is exposed to pornography at some point. It stands to reason that most offenders have viewed porn. But other studies found that being punished for porn use might contribute to someone becoming a rapist, and not the porn use itself. Indeed, continues The Scientist<strong><u>, a repressive religious upbringing might be more of a factor in rape than porn:</u></strong><br />
Looking closer, Michael Goldstein and Harold Kant found <strong><u>that rapists were more likely than nonrapists in the prison population to have been punished for looking at pornography while a youngster, while other research has shown that incarcerated nonrapists had seen more pornography, and seen it at an earlier age,</u></strong> than rapists. What does correlate highly with sex offense is a strict, repressive religious upbringing. Richard Green too has reported that both rapists and child molesters use less pornography than a control group of “normal” males.<br />
This sort of assertion is bound to raise a few eyebrows and even cause a little controversy. Especially when taken alongside <strong><u>studies</u></strong> that seem to <strong><u>indicate that porn doesn't result in feelings of misogyny.</u></strong> Additionally, while there is anecdotal evidence that porn users are abusive toward their female partners, there is no evidence that pornography use is the cause of these actions. Perhaps there are other factors, such as alcoholism or violent tendencies, that are bigger influences.<br />
In any case, <strong><u>while such studies do not prove that porn is actively good for society, they do seem to imply that</u></strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.physorg.com/tags/pornography/" rel="nofollow">**pornography**</a> <strong><u>isn't actively bad for us</u></strong>.<br />

But one thing that clinicians dealing with this problem may wish to consider is that <strong><u>the individual’s cognitive limitations may not allow them to engage in more “appropriate” private masturbation because of difficulties with mental representation. In fact, frequency of erotic fantasies correlates positively with</u></strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=imaginary-worlds-are-early-sign-of-2009-08-07" rel="nofollow">**intelligence**</a><strong><u>.</u></strong> The average IQ of Lukianowicz’s sample was 132. <strong><u>So perhaps public masturbation, in which other people are physically present to induce arousal, is the only way that many with developmental disorders can achieve sexual satisfaction</u></strong>. Sadly, of course, society isn’t very accommodating of this particular problem: Between 1969-1989, for example, a single institution in the United States performed 656 castrations with the aim to stop the men from masturbating. One clinical study reported some success in eliminating this problem behavior by squirting lemon juice into the mouth of a young patient every time he pulled out his penis in public.<br />
In any event, Lukianowicz argues <strong><u>that erotic fantasies involve imaginary companions not altogether unlike children’s</u></strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-serious-need-for-play" rel="nofollow">**make-believe friends**</a>. But unlike the more long-lived latter, he concedes, the former is conjured up for one very practical purpose: “… as soon as the orgasm is achieved the role of the imaginary sexual partner is completed, and he is quite simply and quickly dismissed from his master’s mind.” And<strong><u>, perhaps not surprisingly, men seem to entertain more visitors in their heads than do women</u></strong>. In a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content%7Edb=all%7Econtent=a918466737" rel="nofollow">1990 study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Sex Research</em> , evolutionary psychologists Bruce Ellis and Donald Symons found that 32 percent of men said that they’d had sexual encounters in their imagination with more than 1,000 different people, compared to only 8 percent of women<strong><u>. Men also reported rotating in from their imaginary rosters one imagined partner for another during the course of a single fantasy more often than women did.</u></strong><br />

Researchers were conducting a study comparing the views of men in their 20s who had never been exposed to pornography with regular users. But their project <strong><u>stumbled at the first hurdle when they failed to find a single man who had not been seen it.</u></strong> <br />
<strong><u>“We started our research seeking men in their 20s who had never consumed pornography</u></strong>,” said Professor Simon Louis Lajeunesse. <strong><u>“We couldn't find any.”</u></strong> Although hampered in its original aim, the study did examined the habits of those young men who used pornography – which would appear to be all of them. Prof Lajeunesse interviewed 20 heterosexual male university students who consumed pornography, and found on average, they first watched pornography when they were 10 years old. Around 90 per cent of consumption was on the internet, while 10 per cent of material came from video stores. Single men watched pornography for an average of 40 minutes, three times a week, while those in relationships watched it 1.7 times a week for around 20 minutes. The study found <strong><u>that men watched pornography that matched their own image of sexuality, and quickly discarded material they found offensive or distasteful</u></strong>. Prof Lajeunesse said <strong><u>pornography did not have a negative effect on men's sexuality. “Not one subject had a pathological sexuality,” he said. “In fact, all of their sexual practices were quite conventional. “Pornography hasn't changed their perception of women or their relationship</u></strong>, which they all want to be as harmonious and fulfilling as possible,” he added. <br />

Second, let’s talk about masturbation. I’ve heard many people – Christian people – tell me that masturbation is not a sin. I remain unconvinced as this act takes something that is designed to be shared and makes it selfish, but let’s say – for argument’s sake – that it is not a sin. Porn viewing and/or mental imagery of someone other than your wife <strong>is</strong> wrong. Job knew this when he wrote about a contract he made with his eyes (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://biblia.com/bible/niv/Job%2031.1" rel="nofollow">Job 31:1</a>).

MANILA, Philippines - Only a few people may admit to doing &quot;it,&quot; but experts have said that <strong><u>masturbation is beneficial to a person's mental, social, and physical health.</u></strong><br />
According to the McKinley Health Center at the University of Illinois, <strong><u>masturbation</u></strong> (which they defined as touching one's own sex organs for pleasure) <strong><u>reduces stress, induces sleep, and can help people to become familiar and comfortable with their body.</u></strong><br />
Citing studies, the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/Handouts/masturbation.html" rel="nofollow">McKinley health handout</a> also cited the following perks of masturbation:<br />
alleviates premenstrual tension for many women<br />
provides a healthy sexual outlet for people who choose to abstain from sex with partners or who do not currently have available sexual partners<br />
<strong><u>can be a route to safer sex, to help prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV allows for sexual pleasuring for those who are not ready to engage in vaginal, anal, or oral sex</u></strong><br />
increases blood flow to the genital region, which can help overall sexual functioning<br />
<strong><u>helps women learn how to achieve orgasm</u></strong><br />
helps men to increase ejaculatory control and manage rapid or delayed ejaculation.<br />
<strong>Masturbation myths debunked</strong><br />
Contrary to what some people think, the McKinley Health Center said masturbation does not lead to insanity or hair growing on the palms. It added that it does not drain excessive energy from the body.<br />
<strong><u>&quot;There are no harmful side effects of masturbation</u></strong>,&quot; it said, adding that regardless of cultural attitudes and values, masturbation has been found in all societies.<br />

James Dabbs, Jr., studied 4,462 men in 1990 and found that &quot;<strong><u>the overall picture among the high-testosterone men is one of delinquency, substance abuse and a tendency toward excess</u></strong>.&quot; These men, he added, &quot;have more trouble with people like teachers while they are growing up, have more sexual partners, are more likely to have gone AWOL in the service and to have used hard drugs,&quot; particularly if they had poor educations and low incomes. A separate study by Dabbs of <strong><u>young male prison inmates found that high testosterone levels were associated with more violent crimes, parole board decisions against release, and more prison rule violations.

The latest study by Dabbs et al., which pooled data from two groups of prisoners, measured testosterone levels in the saliva of 692 adult male prisoners. <strong><u>The researchers found that inmates who committed crimes of sex and violence had higher testosterone levels than inmates who were incarcerated for property crimes or drug abuse</u></strong>.

Among men, <strong><u>high testosterone levels are correlated with an increased likelihood of engaging in criminal violence and other forms of aggression,<a name="_ednref13"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.simonlevay.com/sex-and-violence#_edn13" rel="nofollow">[xiii</a>] and male aggression and sexual coercion is most prevalent during young adulthood, when testosterone levels are high</u></strong>. But the correlation between testosterone levels and aggression is not terribly strong: it leaves a lot of the variation in aggressiveness unexplained. A more important causal factor may be the levels of testosterone during fetal life, when the brain circuits involved in aggression and sexuality are first assembling themselves. The higher levels of circulating testosterone in male fetuses compared with female fetuses is probably a large part of the reason why adult males are on average more aggressive and more interested in casual and coercive sex than females..<br />

Rosen argues that testosterone plays a major role in human events. <strong><u>Testosterone</u></strong> is present in all humans, although its level varies greatly depending on age, sex, situational factors and culture, and it <strong><u>equals aggressiveness and dominant behavior</u></strong>. <strong><u>This has been common knowledge for decades, but it is Rosen’s contention that states and their leaders are</u></strong> similarly <strong><u>driven by such biological phenomena and that some societies specifically cater to their more aggressive elements</u></strong>. Such societies tend to permit tyrants to lead them. These tyrants punish perceived challengers and are unwilling to coexist with rivals; they rule by fear rather than consensus; and <strong><u>they are more interested in short-term gains and prestige than in long-term, rational calculations.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u>It is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve depression and lead to a higher sense of self-worth. Masturbation</u></strong> can also be particularly useful <strong><u>in relationships</u></strong> where one partner wants more sex than the other—in which case masturbation <strong><u>provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.</u></strong><br />

The final explanation is that <strong><u>masturbation is actually a form of self-medication. By cleaning their genitals, males reduce their odds of contracting a sexually transmitted infection. It’s a new hypothesis that Waterman herself put forward, but it’s the only one that actually fits with all of her data. If it’s true, you’d expect males to masturbate more frequently after sex than before it, which they do. You’d expect them to masturbate more frequently during the time of month when females are ready to mate, which they do. And finally, you’d expect their tendency to masturbate to increase as they get more sex, which it does.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>A masturbating squirrel gets cleaner genitals in two ways – it scrubs the outside bit and flushes out the inside ones</u></strong>. Many other rodents will groom their genitals after sex and experiments with rats have shown that this does actually help to <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;doptcmdl=Citation&amp;defaultField=Title%20Word&amp;term=Hart%5bauthor%5d%20AND%20Postcopulatory%20genital%20grooming%20in%20male%20rats%20-%20prevention%20of%20sexually%20transmitted%20infections." rel="nofollow">prevent infections</a>. This might also explain the fact that some <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bit.ly/a9w5MH" rel="nofollow">fruit bats practice fellatio during sex</a>.<br />
<strong><u>In terms of flushing out the genital tract, some studies have suggested that this is why human men feel the need to go to urinate after sex</u></strong>. Cape ground squirrels, however, are a desert species and conserve water by very rarely urinating. Masturbating may be the next best thing and indeed, by eating their ejaculates afterwards, the squirrels can prevent the needless loss of water.
