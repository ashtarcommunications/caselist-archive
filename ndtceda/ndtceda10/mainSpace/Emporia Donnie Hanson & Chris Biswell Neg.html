<strong>A-SPEC</strong><br />
A. Interpretation and Violation: AFF must specify an agent. They don’t.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">B. Vote NEG</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">1. Ground – Specific agent links and disads can only be generated when the aff specifies.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">2. AFF Conditionality – They can specify in the 2AC which moots the 1NC and makes them a moving target.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;">3. Plan is Impossible – The United States federal government is not a legislative body – Policies are carried out through its branches.</span><br />
4. Education – 90% of education comes from implementation<br />

<strong>Capitalism K</strong><br />
The plan is an extension of flexible empire and citizenship by creating exceptions of the “good immigrant” in order to grease the wheels of capital—in doing so migrants are placed in a precarious position, excluded at any whim<br />

[Sunaina [asspcoate prof of Asian American studies @ UC Davis]; Flexible Citizenship/ Flexible Empire: South Asian Muslim Youth in Post-9/11 America; American Quaterly; Vol 60, no 3; kdf]<br />
“Flexible citizenship” was the…to the demands of the market.<a name="f23-text"></a><br />
<br />
Ethical actors must be willing to risk the impossible – this radical ethical stance is key to break free from the neo-liberal capitalist order <br />
Daly 2k4 <br />
(Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 18-19)<br />
For Zizek, a confrontation with…us to risk the impossible.<br />
<br />
Thus the Alternative: Vote negative to do nothing<br />
<br />
Doing nothing is not just sitting and waiting for the moment to attack—it is the only genuine political act--it is an act of abstaining from the depoliticized gameboard of capitalism by refusing to play their game—ultimately withdrawing past the point of commodification<br />

Last but not least, the…vacuity of today's democracies.<br />

<strong>Terrorism DA</strong><br />
First, visa security programs being expanded now but reforms are slow and modest<br />
Burton and Stewart,10<br />
[Fred And Scott, Expert On Security, Terrorists And Terrorist Organizations, February 18, “Visa Security: Getting Back To The Basics”,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100218_visa_security_getting_back_basics" rel="nofollow">Http://Www.Stratfor.Com/Weekly/20100218_Visa_Security_Getting_Back_Basics</a>, OCI=Overseas Criminal Investigations]<br />
As we’ve previously noted, there… other agencies are now seeking to fill the void.<br />
<br />
And, an influx in immigration compromises visa security and allows terrorists entry<br />
Krikorian 8<br />
[Mark, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, Mass immigration defeats homeland security, acc. via Google Books]<br />
The security challenges posed… do get in—is a security imperative.<br />
<br />
And, the attack will be nuclear <br />

[Global Security Newswire, August 6, 2010, “WMD terrorism remains grave threat, U.S. says,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100806_6521.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20100806_6521.php</a>]<br />

And, extinction<br />
Sid-Ahmed, 4<br />
[Al-Ahram Mohamed Weekly political analyst. August 26 &quot;Extinction!&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm</a>] <br />
What would be the consequences…we will all be losers.<br />

<strong>State PIC</strong><br />
Text: Whatever the plan is without &quot;United States Federal Government&quot;<br />
<br />
The aff uses the social construction of the &quot;United States Federal Government&quot; - This entity does not exist - Their recognition of the state forces them to ignore what they can do within the everyday as individuals while empowering capitalism making all of their impacts inevitable<br />
Hallward in 2k3<br />
[Peter, French Department at Kings College, Badiou a Subject to Truth, pg 96-99, kdf]<br />
The stat is thus a kind of primordial...remain a philosophy written against the state.<br />
<br />
Ethics begin with the self not the state - They can have no valid explanation for calling on the state - Instead prefer the counterplan which is an act of everdayness - Our dissent ultimately shatters the pillars of the system<br />
Havel, 90<br />
[Vaclav, The Power of the Powerless, pg 39-40, JT]<br />
Let us now imagine that one...more severely than anything else.
