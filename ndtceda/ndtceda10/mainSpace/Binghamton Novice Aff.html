<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Observation One: To Consent or Not to Consent </span><br />
<br />
The “severe” standard within visa protection for trafficking renders countless people ineligible while ranking which forms of exploitation are worthy of consideration and undermining investigations<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">The result of such policies builds upon images of the innocent white victim while leaving migrant workers who consent to moving across borders or engaging in sex work unprotected even as they experience the same abuse </span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">These sorts of dichotomies between good girls and bad demonize sex work while fostering a masculinist hegemony that ensures violence and inequality by reducing even transgendered sex into a heteronormative paradigm </span><br />

<span style="font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 5.5pt;">Perhaps one of the most confounding dimensions in the conceptualization of prostitution as labor concerns the relation</span>...<br />
<strong><u>Within the sex industry, a gendered hierarchy and systemic privileging of the</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 5.5pt;">male</span><span style="font-size: 5.5pt;"> and the </span><strong><u>masculine continues to be prevalent.</u></strong> <br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">In fact, this clash over sexuality is the defining symbol that props up war, poverty, disease, and inequality </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 6pt;">The time has come to think about sex. To some, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 10pt;">sexuality may seem to be an unimportant topic</span></span><span style="font-size: 6pt;">...</span><br />
<span class="underline"><span style="font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 10pt;">sex is always political</span></span><span style="font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 6pt;">. But there are also historical periods in which sexuality is more sharply contested and more overtly politicized. In such periods, the domain of erotic life is, in effect, renegotiated. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Fortunately, by acknowledging the supposed indignity of sex we can embrace a queerness which has the potential to cut against all hierarchies </span><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; font-size: 10pt;">In those circles where queerness has been most cultivated</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 6pt;">...</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 6pt;">not the media spokesmen and respectable leaders of the gay community. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Therefore we propose the following plan— </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Resolved: President Barack Obama should issue a presidential directive to substantially expand beneficiary eligibility by eliminating the “severe” requirements within current human trafficking-based visas.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Eliminating the forced, fraud, and coercion requirements within trafficking legislation is essential to solve trafficking and adequately distribute rights without violating the autonomy of willful sex workers </span><br />
