 <strong>2AC Eligibility T</strong><br />
Holding the letter of the law to its logical extreme and hollowing out the system from within is the most radical act<br />
Zizek 1998, Law and the Postmodern Mind, “Why Does the Law Need an Obscene Supplement?” p. 91-94<br />
Finally, the point about inherent transgression…for the banality of men’s rights.<br />
<strong>1AR beneficiary eligibility</strong><br />
Beneficiary eligibility is a broader category of which admissibility and eligibility are both SUBSETS.<br />
<br />
Federal Grants Wire 1997 (Occupation safety and health-training Grants)<br />

Beneficiary Eligibility Trainees must be admissible…safety and health training programs.<br />
<strong>Wage deflation</strong><br />
Concerns for conservatives reaction to the plan is anti-politics. Fidelity to the event must refuse the ethical compromise of the DA<br />
Jodi Dean, 2005, Zizek against democracy, online<br />
Not surprisingly, this superficial….wants to destroy the displaced element.<br />
Their disad is a racist description of the world-allowing their logic to infuse policy discussion dooms all sustainable immigration policy.<br />
Darder, 2007, Antonia New Political Science 29.3 Informaworld<br />
In this alarmist attack of Latino immigration…deeply entrenched egoistic defense of privilege.<br />
Their argument is based in xenophobic neoconservative logic-Immigration is not the cause of their impact-capital accumulation and neo-liberailsm are the root cause<br />
Darder, 2007, Antonia New Political Science 29.3 Informaworld<br />
Xenophobic neoconservative rhetoric blatantly….stabilization of capitalism.<br />
A2: K-beginning point key<br />
Eithne Luibheid, 2008, “sexuality, migration, and the shifting line between legal and illegal status,” GLQ 14:2-3<br />
One way to begin reframing is by viewing…United States to undocumented parents.<br />
Free trade is a fantasy that takes for granted contingent socioeconomic arrangements. The aff’s investment in this fantasy naturalizes structural violence and results in the scapegoating of perceived threats to the ideal market.<br />
Jodi Dean, 2004, “Enjoying Neoliberalism”<br />
Neoliberalism is based on the fantasy of….It just isn’t fair.<br />
No crowd out-immigration ups wages<br />
Ampersand, 2010, “fix the world economy: open the borders,” online<br />
Felix Salmon writes: Never mind…but it also benefits us.<br />

We can affirm the family as contingent and performative<br />

PLAN:<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The United States federal government should remove beneficiary eligibility restrictions on individuals excluded under section 202 (6) (A) (i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act for the purpose of determining beneficiary eligibility for topically designated visas.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Status quo framing of Immigration policy as a security issue lays at an intersection of political and ethical anxiety—the discourse of illegal migration is a stand-in for larger concerns about United States national identity and the lust for a harmonious social whole. However, this reactive politics ignores the impossibility of its task setting the tone for exclusion on a global scale trhough its renunciation of difference and negativity <br />
Van Munster, 2k4 (Rens, Senior Researcher, Danish Institute for International Studies The Desecuritisation of Illegal Migration: The Case for European Belonging Without Community, A paper prepared for the PhD-seminar/EUROPA workshop, Department of Political Science and Public Management, University of Southern Denmark.)<br />
<br />
Security is a specific way of politicizing.. exclusionary logic of security.<br />
<br />
<br />
Likewise, Immigration represents a crisis in the symbolic—both paranoid and racist strategies and assimilationist liberal programmes participate in defering the ethical injunction and reinvesting belief in the big other of national identity<br />
Martinez, 2k5 (Jose Saul, M.A. in Anthropology U of Texas at Austin, “Abysmal Desires for Recognition: Nostalgic Disavowal in Anti-Immigrant Texts”, Text, Practice, Performance VI)<br />
<br />
The same trend of interdisciplinary racist… cheap and uncivilized labor.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the worst atrocities in history are the by product of such a quest for political and ethical cohesion—Immigration policy represents a fantasy intended to quell the anxiety that lies at the heart of subjectivity producing its repression and violent, depoliticized externalization onto a scapegoat blamed for preventing the impossible task of social harmony <br />
Stavrakakis, 99 (Yannis, teaching fellow at the dept to government U of Essex, Lacan and the Political)<br />
In order to answer these questions it is crucial to enumerate… only way out of this troubling state.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is no mere abstraction—illegal immigrants are precisely the inevitably excluded sinthome of the modern state and have come to stand in for uncertainty, vulnerability and as an excuse for the biopolitical organization of all life through the internalization of threats and state-sponsered racism justifying its elimination of entire populations <br />
Hoffman, 2k8 (Mark N., University of Minnesota, Broken Borders, Foreign Bodies, and Statist (In)Security: Writing the National Immigration Crisis in the American Heartland International Studies Association Annual Meeting March)<br />
<br />
As the violent history of U.S. labor struggles… already contaminated population.<br />
<br />
Likewise, this symbolic enframing of the international field gaurantees violence through emnity creation and scapaegoating<br />
Burke, 7 ( Anthony, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at UNSW, Sydney, “Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason”, Theory and Event, 10.2, Muse)<br />
<br />
My argument here, whilst… and violence? Will our thought?<br />
<br />
<br />
This National identiy requires the creation and violent exclusion of a signifier in order to justify its symbolic survival<br />
Shapiro, critical international relations theorist and a professor of Political Science at the University of Hawaii. 1993. [Michael j. “That obscure object of violence: Logistic and Desire in the Gulf War” The political subject of violence p.126-130] <br />
Because Lacanian desire operates… lacks a reflective rapport with itself.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the visa process is a byproduct of the larger quest for total social control and provides a crucial entry point into the symbolic realm of immigration policy<br />
Neumayer, 2k6 (Eric, Professor of Geography and Environment @ LSE,, Unequal access to foreign spaces: how states use visa restrictions to regulate mobility in a globalized world. Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 31: 72–84.)<br />
There can be no doubt… on people on the basis of nationality.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, this act of identification with the abject of immigration policy ruptures and radically reconfigures the political by affirming that which will inevitably be excluded from the symbolic order creating a universal challenge to security’s monopoly on poltics by highlightinh its paradoxical nature <br />
<br />
Van Munster, 2k4 (Rens, Senior Researcher, Danish Institute for International Studies The Desecuritisation of Illegal Migration: The Case for European Belonging Without Community, A paper prepared for the PhD-seminar/EUROPA workshop, Department of Political Science and Public Management, University of Southern Denmark.)<br />
<br />
An act of desecuritisation… constitution of a European public space. <br />
<br />
<br />
Only highlighting the lack in immigration policy allows for a proper relationship with disorder and insecurity—repressive relationships with danger produce self-hatred and <br />
Van Munster, 2k4 (Rens, Senior Researcher, Danish Institute for International Studies The Desecuritisation of Illegal Migration: The Case for European Belonging Without Community, A paper prepared for the PhD-seminar/EUROPA workshop, Department of Political Science and Public Management, University of Southern Denmark.)<br />
<br />
In contrast to deconstructivist thought… belonging in an ethical way. <br />
<br />
Our institutional focus is critical to actualizing change in the regime of security<br />
Ghughunishvili, 2k10 (Irina, paper fulfilling final requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts @ Central European University, “Constructing Muslims and Arabs as Enemies,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf/" rel="nofollow">http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2010/ghughunishvili_irina.pdf/</a>)<br />
<br />
One of the main objections… always pursuing power maximization. <br />
<br />
<br />
We must institutionalize the lack—the alternative is mindless and constant criticism<br />
<br />
McMillan, 2k10 (Chris, completed PhD Student at Massey University in New Zealand, “Disavowed Foundations”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://chrismcmillan.org/2010/05/28/is-there-a-lacanian-reading-of-politics-2/" rel="nofollow">http://chrismcmillan.org/2010/05/28/is-there-a-lacanian-reading-of-politics-2/</a>)<br />

Following on from Laclau, Stavrakakis … own lack of foundations.<br />

One of the main objections was directed… pursuing power maximization.<br />
Such a political move would usher in a radical form of democracy that abandons traditional progressive politics and that recognizes its limitations and remains reflexive by constantly encircleing the real that lies at its heart<br />

 <br />
Current immigration policy is steeped in the rhetoric and policy of the war on terror. This ideology is rooted in a geopolitical anxiety that refuses to relinquish an antiquated national identity in favor of violently lashing out against anything that does not fit within our global purview. <br />
Coleman, 2k7 (Mathew, Dept Geography @ Ohio State, “Immigration Geopolitics Beyond the Mexico-US Border”, Antipode) <br />
“After 9/11, US lawmakers… result less than clear.” <br />
Furthermore, the conflation of immigration and terrorism is ahistorical and rooted in an ideological attempt at returning to a sense of normalcy through externalizing and policing difference. <br />
De Genova, 2k6 (borderbattles.ssrc.org/De_Genova/<br />
“Since September 11, 2001, 80,000 male…“illegal aliens” and “enemy aliens.” <br />
This impossible quest for security has become a will-to-will that admits no questioning and organizes all of politics such that all actions are taken merely for the reproduction of the same. This global enframing NECESSITATES that certain populations such as immigrants and terrorists fall OUTSIDE of its attempt at creating global order through standing reserve. <br />
Mitchell, 2k5 (Andrew J., Stanford University, “Heidegger and Terrorism”, Research in Phenomenology, 35) <br />
There can be no security…. Human resources do not die, they perish. <br />
The war on terror is the modern manifestation of this growing will-to-will and its objectification of the world CAN ONLY reproduce the conditions it needs to justify and sustain itself. To be today, is to be terrorised. <br />
Mitchell, 2k5 (Andrew J., Stanford University, “Heidegger and Terrorism”, Research in Phenomenology, 35) <br />
These three points of war equally determine… war and peace; beings have become uncommon. <br />
This will to will sustains itself by violently rejecting the vulnerability that terrorism has revealed resulting in an amorphous war on difference that escalates apocalyptically <br />
Lifton, 2k3 (Robert, Taught at Harvard, Super Power Syndrome: America’s Apocalyptic Confrontation with the World, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Rogue_State_US/War_Terrorism_SPS.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Rogue_State_US/War_Terrorism_SPS.html</a>) <br />
A superpower dominates and rules…. has been &quot;the culture of modern evangencalism. <br />
<br />
TEXT: Thus, we resolve to think the terrorist with a visa. <br />
<br />
<br />
This act of contemplation in the face of the challenge of terrorism is one that ruptures the dominant political regime in favor of opening to the possibilities of being itself. Only such a resolute stance can confront the frenetic activity that the war on terrorism mandates and the ontological anxiety that lies at the heart of the fear that terrorism envokes. <br />
Zingale and Hummel, 2k8 (Nicholas, teaches environmental finance, corporate change, and public policy and administration at Cleveland State University and the University of Akron, and Ralph, Institute for Applied Phenomenology in Science and Technology, “Disturbance, Coping, and Innovation: A Phenomenology of Terror”, Administrative Theory and Praxis, Vol. 30, No. 2) <br />
Contemplation, according to Heidegger… the threat of being nothing and nobody. <br />
Failure to aknowledge the metaphysical aspect of terrorism ensures serial policy failure and escalating violence. <br />
Mitchell, 2k5 (Andrew J., Stanford University, “Heidegger and Terrorism”, Research in Phenomenology, 35) <br />
Heideggerian thought is a thinking … which terrorism takes place. <br />
Furthermore, we must terrorize thinking itself in order to open political possibilies beyond status quo positivism <br />
Mitchell, 2k5 (Andrew J., Stanford University, “Heidegger and Terrorism”, Research in Phenomenology, 35) <br />
Insofar as it is Americanism … too obstinately squelch them. <br />
This act of political refusal ruptures hegemonic forms of thought and allows for agency in the face of impossibility <br />
Burke, 2k2 (Anthony, School of Political Science and International Studies, University of Queensland , Alternatives: Global, Local, Political 27.1 page InfoTrac OneFile) <br />
It is perhaps easy to become despondent… possibilities might be. <br />
Finally, hegemonic forms of thought are the LARGEST proximate cause of macro-level violence <br />
Burke, 2k7 (Anthony, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at UNSW, Sydney, “Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason”, Theory and Event, 10.2, Muse) <br />
