<strong>Kentucky- Round 7 vs. Emory HR- NEW SIJ AFF</strong><br />
Contention 1: Blame Game<br />
<br />
The plight of unaccompanied minors has become invisibilized. With a focus on securitizing our borders, immigration officials view these children as ‘border rats’. Their position as the other has become normalized in the context of an adult-centered politics.<br />

<br />
<br />
Subpoint A: Protection Deficits<br />
<br />
The government retains authority over detained children, unlawfully preventing them from being eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile visas. Through criminalization, the government justifies inhumane detention practices and the eventual deportation of these noncitizens.<br />

<span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Since the SIJ program…</span></span> and its subsequent amendments.<br />
<br />
Criminalization is emblematic of our larger migration policy, creating cycles of violent exclusion through fear-based politics.<br />

As Pierre Bourdieu has shown…<span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> pertaining to the risk category. </span></span><br />
<br />
Subpoint B: Myopic Responsibility<br />
<br />
The statue of “specific consent” destroys ethical decisionmaking by making the Attorney General the gatekeeper of our responsibility towards these unaccompanied minors.<br />
<span class="AuthorDateChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mai</span></span>, Law @ UMaryland, <span class="AuthorDateChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">09 </span></span>[My Xuan T.

Placing these children at the whim of the Attorney General places them in the ultimate zone of exception.<br />

And yet, <span class="CardsFont12pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">the predictability…</span></span> appear to deliver a right to rights.<br />
<br />
These zones of exception become normalized under the guise of sovereignty. This creates genocidal politics where the sovereign decides who lives and who dies. <br />

Plan: <br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should remove the Secretary of Health and Human Services specific consent requirement for the juvenile court dependent visa. <br />
<br />
Contention 2: Power<br />
<br />
This debate is about concrete strategies of resistance. Challenging oppressive state practices through concrete demands is a necessary first step to establish a rights-based approach that contests attempts to violate dignity.<br />
