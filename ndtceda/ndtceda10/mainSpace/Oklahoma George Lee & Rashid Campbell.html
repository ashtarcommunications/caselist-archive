<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">The hook of our affirmative is gatekeeping…</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We will keep it simple…nothing complicated….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We should remove all restrictions on all resolutionally based visas….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Don’t be talking about how you got no ground….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">You can read all of your disads about removing visa restrictions as bad….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">The first main Lyrical invention of our affirmative is that restrictions on visas are form of gatekeeping utilized by the United States Federal Government to keep the “other” out of the US….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We got plenty of “others” already here, but we are already marked…..</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">GA Martinez writes in 2007 about how in 1790 Congress made it a requirement that only a “white person” could become an American citizen and this racial requirement for whiteness lasted until 1952.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Yeah, that’s right..do the math…..58 years ago…..whiteness was more up front and guarding the gate with the color racial markings….but the gates have changed,,,,,and the uniforms of the gatekeepers of have also changed….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Setha Low writes in 2004 of how gating is a global trend drawing on US models and is based upon fears of the other. The gates represent safety and protection and based upon notions that this society isn’t what it was and we must get control of the borders……she writes that “gating also involves racialization of space in which the representation and definition of “other” is based upon human biological characteristics and racial categories.” Pa 42</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">She continues on how peoples use gate-keeping to keep perceived dangers outside of their social world….the walls make visible the systems of exclusions which ….This way of seeing the social is a form of social splitting that is an attempt to have a purified space where we have eliminated the unwashed…the dirty…..</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Its easy to draw parallels between gatekeeping and whiteness in relation to gated communities, but the parallels can also be drawn in relation to visa restrictions that attempt to maintain a temporary pool of workers for the purpose of keeping the poor people of the south in standing reserve…..you know standing their…waiting on their visas….to come over here and do our dirty work that other minorities have refused to do for such little money……</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">This idea of standing reserve is discussed by Shannon Sullivan in 2008 where she claims whiteness has the view of “ownership” of the earth. She explains how whiteness has defined itself through exclusive ownership of values such as goodness and cleanliness and beauty….the same values behind the need for the gates in the gated community, but also decorate it with beautiful architecture as to keep the place pure…..</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Payal Banarjee explains in 2010 how the “visa” complex has created a immigrant labor-dependent subcontracting complex….not to help the immigrants…..but to define them only as value producing units…</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We contend just as Payal that it is vacuous to speak of the stipulations of these visas without examining the institution context by which these visas are employed….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Our contention is that institutional complex is guided by norms of whiteness and white supremacy that continues to mark the immigrant body just as the bodies of our ancestors used to be marked for ownership and utility value. </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Mary Romero quotes Robert Chang in 1999 saying “Examination of the immigrant allows us to observe the dynamics of racial formation as immigrant enter the political/cultural/legal space of the united states and become differently racialized as Asian Americans, Black, Latina/Latino, and White.” The treatment of persons identified as “alien”, corresponds to the treatment of citizens of color in the US….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">These people carry a figurative border around with them as there are stigmatized with their new social identity……</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Romero explains how If we can otherize them and call them an alien, then we have otherized them in a way where violence against them can be deemed rational through such programs as Operation Gatekeeper…..</span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-layout-grid-align: none; mso-pagination: none; tab-stops: 28.0pt 56.0pt 84.0pt 112.0pt 140.0pt 168.0pt 196.0pt 224.0pt 3.5in 280.0pt 308.0pt 336.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">R Coleman writes in (2004)  </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">That the attempt to order space and make it predictable, sanitized and secure is bound up with the process of boundary erection which is rooted in conceptions of abjection and hostility towards difference.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We contend that this hostility towards difference is a by products of the disease of whiteness, where “others” were eliminated or executed in the past for not conforming, but now whiteness has moved to a strategy of integration of those who will accept the white superiority and become white themselves…..</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">So as you can see we contend that gatekeeping is a manifestation of whiteness….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">The use of the visas restrictions to maintain a pool of workers in standing reserve is a form of gatekeeping that keeps the planet at bay while we figure out how to consume for our the good of wealthy and the powerful……</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We also believe that the use of unquestioned norms and procedures in debate can also function as a tool of whiteness.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">When you say eduacation…we must ask education for who?</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">When you say best interpretation…we say best interpretation for who?</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">The dangerous aspect of whiteness is that is has invisible powers and visible powers. When you say that X is good for debate and you examine the historical roots of where those norms in debate come from…you will find that they were discovered in a different context with a different group of people were not like me or any of the immigrants.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Shanara Reid Brinkley explains how judges have normalized into practice this idea of line by line debating that skew the big picture of not just debates but social issues where race and gender issues an often be ignored in favor of impacts like terrorism and nuclear war.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">This line by line excludes emotion is and makes debate reflect our policy making community that has led us up through slavery I – Slavery II and now the third stage of the new world order….Slavery III…..</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We are all slaves to whiteness until we revolt….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We contend that wars, violence, environmental destructions, racism ,colonialism sexism….all of these are intertwined with the manifestations of whiteness.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Corey Walker writes in 2008 how the US is in a moment of crisis and in moments of crisis the middle class needs to produce and reproduce the dreaded outsiders to build cohesion and support for a more explorable foreign policy to solve these problems.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">This is the circular manifestations of white supremacy. The question is can we break out of it.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">John Foster writes in how the foreign policy of the United is driving the world to extermination through its desire to control the rest of the world to its interests.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">This is the manifestion of whiteness that wants to hold the globe in standing reserve that was discussed by Shannon Sullivan earlier.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Our contention is that as long as we hang out to the ideologies of gatekeeping that produce and reproduce the manifestations of whiteness’s power, we will never be able to avoid the global violence and destruction that many of the debate authors talk about….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Mead….should have happened…Foster makes you non unique….</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Bearden…not true. .historically…and our impacts outweigh…..</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">New Mead….same guy……still not believable……</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">We have 2 arguments from bell hooks to address your futuristic predictions and policy making proclamations.</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">She says “This displacement of meaning into the future makes it impossible for students to fully immerse themselves in the art of learning and to experience that immersion as a complete and satisfying moment of fulfillment.”</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">She continues ”The vision of progress that is central to imperialist white supremecist capitalist patriarchy is one that always places emphasis on the future….there is always a better moment than the moment that is….a better job, a better house, a better relationship. Education as we conventionally know it plays a crucial role as the location where students learn to embrace the values that go with the status quo.” </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">So as we strive for what education is and how might achieve it, we feel that the type of education we get is important,,not just education….neutral education is white education…</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> She continues by noting that “we should free education from the grip of dominator culture so that schooling is not simply a factory for turning out new improved dominators.”</span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;"> </span></span><br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria;">Vote affirmative.</span></span>
