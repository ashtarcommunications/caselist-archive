 In Tropic Orange, Bobby travels to Mexico to help a small Chinese girl—who lost her brother when traveling from China—illegally enter the U.S.. He disguises her as an ‘American’ by adorning her with U.S. commodities: <br />
“Get her a T-shirt and some jeans and some tennis shoes,” Bobby says, “Jeans say Levi’s. Shoes say Nike. T-shirt says Malibu. That’s it. . . . We’ll drag her through the slit jus’ like any Americanos. Just like Visa cards.” <br />
Performing American consumerism, they are baptized in the free-flow of Capital. <br />
At this border crossing, the question of the resolution makes itself manifest. The “visa/Visa-card” trope folds—intersects! collapses!—onto itself as both a signed certificate (expressing permission to enter) and a plastic placard (signifying each being as a subject of the “law of economic necessity.”)<br />
But as a Visa card, they are only as good as their credit limit.<br />
This miming of the “American,” this critical inhabiting of the Visa card, enables Bobby and his companion to cross the border into the U.S., but, “Cuz is staring at her new Nikes,” Bobby notes, “‘Made in China.’ Nikes get in. But not its maker.” <br />
This tropical collapse reveals that we no longer face a problem of negotiating a national identity with diasporic individuals—the American landscape has been completely mortgaged to global capital. “Nationality” defines a brand-name. “American consumerism” is our brand.<br />
((Brief Pause))<br />
In one sense, voices of people seeking an escape across a border are “just rhetoric,” but it is also rhetoric that is must become “just”—a rhetoric of justice! A message of “border crossing” can contribute to a rhetoric of radical justice in its ability to motivate thought and action about the border and in resistance to an oppressive and militarized line of demarcation. The borders and binaries we are interested in debating in this debate are also here—in fact, they begin here—and they are physical—material—even territorial, but they are also figurative, imaginary, mental, and semi-permeable. They are, above all, rhetorical. <br />
<h3 id="toc11"><a name="x2ac v. Fullerton CT-Liberty Round 1 - 1AC-Observation One: Framing the Status Quo."></a>Observation One: Framing the Status Quo.</h3>
 Our advocacy begins with the importance of rhetorical strategy. These voices must not continue to be molded into a platform of exclusion through a process of governmentality. We are all culpable for a discursive practice that allows no space ponder about how different ways of speaking/living emerge.<br />
Lysacker, U. Oregon, ’08 (John, “Life Takes Visa” The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, New Series, Volume 22, Number 2, 2008, pp. 71-81<br />

THIS IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF RACISM, OTHERIZATION, AND EXCLUSION—and a VOTING ISSUE that comes before anything else in the round.<br />
Rancière, Jacques. Disagreement: Politics and Philosophy. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1999. pg. 116-121. [Jacques Ranciere is a philosopher and general badass.]<br />
The “<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">exclusion</span>” talked about today <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is </span>a most ...very beginnings: short of democracy, short of politics.<br />
Why should we stand against this mode of speaking? Because its expression is immanent to the way the state colonizes the identity of whatever is foreign. “Credit or debit?!” The ‘choice’ of the visa is a forced one—its presentation is the elimination of re-presentation—since any answer shoves the foreigner into a debt of being.<br />
Pierre Legrand, professor of Law and Comparative Legal Studies at the Sorbonne in Paris, (2008) (“BAD U... ?” Cardozo Law Review 29.5. p. 2194-2199. )<br />
An incontrovertible point of departure would appear to be <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the State</span>,...<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> ‘being-there’</span> of such elements <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is indistinguishable from</span> mere <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">‘non-being.’</span>”369 <br />

 Thus, we offer our planning, our advocacy:<br />
We are resolved that…<br />
the United States Federal Government should substantially increase the number of, and substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for, its category-based visas for all those seeking entrance, regardless of any category-specific beneficiary restrictions on eligibility.<br />
<h3 id="toc13"><a name="x2ac v. Fullerton CT-Liberty Round 1 - 1AC-Observation Two: “Life takes visa.”"></a>Observation Two: “Life takes visa.”</h3>
 We are the sans-papiers, the ‘paperless,’ or those without visas.<br />
We demand that you assign the ballot the role of a visa and to endorse the affirmative. This imperative temporarily conflates the trope of the ‘visa as an entrance pass’ and the ‘visa as a credit card’. Simultaneously ‘acknowledging’ the affirmative’s existence and ‘buying’ our rhetorical criticism—which links money and speech—ruptures the discursive stability of the State.<br />
Pierre Legrand, professor of Law and Comparative Legal Studies at the Sorbonne in Paris, (2008) (“BAD U... ?” Cardozo Law Review 29.5. p. 2194-2199. )<br />
But <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a subjective intervention may</span> yet <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">force the sans-papiers ...disputing the cardinal principle that underlies political normality.</span><br />
Voting affirmative has real and immediate effects because the police power of the state can only be authorized when privileged communities of intellectuals continue to author its unquestioned words and tropes. <br />
Lisa A. Flores, PhD and Professor of Communication University of Utah. (2003). (Crafting rhetorical borders: Peons, illegal aliens, and competing narratives of immigrations. Critical Studies in Media Communication, 20, 362-387.)<br />
To a degree, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">scholars researching the mediated representations ... construction of a worldview that lent moral support to the efforts of police and immigration officers</span>. <br />
We stand resolved in defense of our plan as debater-scholars advocating the tropological effects of our statement. We live on one planet, in one world, yet divisions and exclusions continue to multiple. Why separate ourselves from the initial standpoint in the debate? Why start the separation between inside and outside, legitimate articulations of a topic versus ones that rely on our own agency? We must be uncompromising on this point.<br />
Badiou, Ethicist, ’10 (Alain. The Meaning of Sarkozy. London: Verso Publishing, 2008. Pg.) <br />
The problem then has to be reversed. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">We cannot start from ...'There is only one world, that of living women and men.'</span><br />

 Political prescription and intellectual intervention are simultaneous. To access this simultaneity, we must begin from an individual position that challenges the conditions for real political change to take place. Our stance cannot begin from a place within the position of the State, but rather as a stance against the State.<br />
