 Text: The United States federal government should set the cap on H-1B visas at zero. The United States federal government should modify the L-1 visa to make persons eligible for an H-1B eligible for a L-1 visa. The United States federal government should modify the L-1 visa to use the same language as the H-1B with the exception that The United States should maintain the requirement that (A) An alien who will serve in a capacity involving specialized knowledge with respect to an employer and will be stationed primarily at the worksite of an employer other than the petitioning employer or its affiliate, subsidiary, or parent shall not be eligible for classification if (i) the alien will be controlled and supervised principally by such unaffiliated employer; or (ii) the placement of the alien at the worksite of the unaffiliated employer is essentially an arrangement to provide labor for hire for the unaffiliated employer, rather than a placement in connection with the provision of a product or service for which specialized knowledge specific to the petitioning employer is necessary. The United States federal government should remove all limitations on number(s) of persons eligible for L-1 visas. <br />

 Text: The United States federal government should lower the H1-B visa cap to zero. The United States federal government should create a visa with all the same minimum eligibility requirements as the H1-B visa. Only applicants from China, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, the Philippines, Canada, Pakistan, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, France, Germany, Russia, Spain, Italy and Israel should be eligible for the new visa. The number of visas available should be equivalent to lifting the cap on H1-B visas.<br />

 A.) Link- The era of post politics radically depoliticizes the economy – this can never obtain the dimensions of universality because it precludes acts of authentic politics – we must establish a radical strategy that re-politicizes the economy in order to break free from the chains of global capitalism – vote negative to disturb the Fantasy of the depoliticized economy and engage in an authentic act of politics<br />
