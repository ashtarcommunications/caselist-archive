<br />
<strong>CONTENTION 1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The pathological Policing of Boundaries to protect our “back doors” from the Queer Immigrant, a defense against the penetration of the Queer at our border, is grounded in the extensive historical narrative of the Queer subject and its violent exclusion from US visa policy</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Migration—the symbol of Mobility that threatens to destabilize these violent modes of identification—lies at the foundation of the State’s drive for social order that mandates modern forms of necropolitical power</strong><br />
<br />
Stychin, Pro-Vice Chancellor and Professor of Law and Social Theory at the University of Reading, 2003 (Carl Franklin, “Transnational Citizens: Mobility and Sexuality,” Governing sexuality: the changing politics of citizenship and law, p. 98-101)<br />
<br />
&lt;Mobility often triggers social anxieties … mobility, health, immunity, infection, and containment.&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>The constitution of Queer Migrants Identities occurs at the Border, a Critical Locus in the Creation of Subjectivities. Rendered against the Backdrop of Heteronormativity, the Queer Migrant is a threat, a risk of contamination to the citizenry that does not Fit the Stable Binaries of Include/Excluded or Hetero/Homo and must be Contained.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>That the Queer Immigrant cannot be neatly mapped across Space and Time sustains an anxiety that manifests itself in the creation of populations mobilized against those deemed “Outsiders”. The end result of this incessant drive for order and stability that defines Heteronormative Border Control and Immigrant Visas underlies the global management of Life and Death</strong><br />
<br />
Luibhéid, director of the Institute for LGBT Studies and associate professor of women's studies at the University of Arizona, 2008 (Eithne, “Queer/Migration: An Unruly Body of Scholarship”, GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, Vol. 14, No. 2-3, p. 170-6)<br />
<br />
&lt;Queer migration scholarship … migration circuits in particular ways.&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>Because of their difference the foreign Queer is the fictionalized enemy at our borders and must be controlled. This State of exception embodied in US immigration Visa policy functions on the construction of the inhuman Queer Migrant, and reifies the system of modern Necropolitics that guarantees the murderous functions of the State</strong><br />
<br />
Mbembe, Research Professor in the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa, 2008 (Achille, “Necropolitics”, Foucault in an Age of Terror: Essays on Biopolitics and the Defence of Society, Ed. by Stephen Morton and Stephen Bygrave, p. 156-9)<br />
<br />
&lt;Having presented a reading of … the suicidal state.&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>CONTENTION 2:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The time is now to Radically Rethink the Smoothing of Queerness embodied in US immigration policy. The intersection and mobilization of discourses on queerness and migration offer a Powerful Critical Tool to break down hetero-sexualized notions of citizenship that embody current immigration practices and transform the manifold forms of violent discrimination that occur against the Queer Migrant. Thus, Seth and I believe that</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD CEASE TO RESTRICT BENEFICIARY ELIGIBILITY FOR ITS EMPLOYMENT-BASED IMMIGRANT, NONIMMIGRANT TEMPORAR WORKER, FAMILY-BASED, AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING-BASED VISAS ON THE BASIS OF QUEERNESS</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Only by Voting Affirmative—by recognizing the Futility of imagining Center-Seeking Policy Changes or demanding the State Distribution of Rights and reclaiming the Border in this Debate Space—can we reshape Queer Migration to mobilize new ways of being Political</strong><br />
<br />
Bell, Principal Lecturer in Cultural Studies at the University of Staffordshire, and Binnie, Lecturer in the Departmnet of Geopgraphy at Brunel University, 2000 (David, and Jon, The Sexual Citizen: Queer Politics and Beyond, p. 142-144)<br />
<br />
&lt;That kind of approach … to benefit from rights claims.&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH!</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our Refusal to accept the Violent Exclusion of Queer Migrants occupies the space of the uninhabitable at the Arbitrary Line we call our Border, undermining the Social Basis for state Control over Queer Migration. By relieving the state of its ability to Dictate Ineligibility, our Act reconfigures norms of Gender and Sexuality in current Immigration Policy. We can shatter the Dominance of State Control over Life and Death</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>To Vote Affirmative is to THROW YOUR BODY ON THE LINE</strong><br />
<br />
Butler, Maxine Elliot Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley, 2000 (Judith, “Competing Universalities”, Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left, Judith Butler, Ernesto Laclau, and Slavoj Zizek, p. 177-9)<br />
<br />
&lt;So, the claim to extend … the left that is Left.&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>Our Intervention in this Debate Space challenges the heteronormative Police Logic of Queer Migrant Exclusion, allowing for the emancipation of the subject from status quo identitarian regimes. In this space, a space where the abjected Queer subject can speak, New Forms of political community and New Regimes of Politics surface. This micropolitics is the necessary first step in Unraveling the hetero-dominant police order and Facilitates the eruption of Queer migrant subjectivities</strong><br />
