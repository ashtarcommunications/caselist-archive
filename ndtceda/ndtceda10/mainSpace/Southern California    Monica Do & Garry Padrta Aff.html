 <strong>2. Playing the government is critical to keeping it in check</strong><br />

Similarly, the ideal of the public reason of free and equal peoples is realized, or satisfied, whenever chief executives and legislators, and other government officials, as well as candidates for public office, act from and follow the principles of the Law of Peoples and explain to other peoples their reason for pursuing or revising a people's foreign policy and affairs of state that involve other societies. As for private citizens, we say, as before, <u>that ideally <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">citizens are to think </span>of themselves <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">as if they were executives</span> and legislators <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and ask </span>themselves <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">what</span></u> foreign <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">policy </span>supported by what considerations <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">they would</span> think it most reasonable to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">advance</span>,</u> Once again, when firm and widespread, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the disposition of citizens to view themselves as ideal </span>executives and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">legislators, and to repudiate government officials </span>and candidates for public office <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">who violate the public reason of free and equal peoples, is part of the political and social basis of peace and understanding among peoples</span>.</u><br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cheek and Porter 1997 </span></span>[Julianne, Centre for Research rnto Nursing and Health Care, University of South Australia, and Sam, Department of Sociology and Social Work, Queen’s University of Belfast, “Reviewing Foucault: possibilities and problems for nursing and health care”, <em>Nursing Inquiry</em> volume 4 issue 2, January 14]<br />
All this may seem rather esoteric and far removed from issues concerned with nursing and health care. Let us turn to this substantive example. Foucault himself produced very effective critiques of both psychiatry and medicine.42 His identification of the clinical gaze, by which healthcare workers regard patients as objects, has been used by nursing commentators, among others, to expose the power relations that underlay the fixation with anatomophysiology. Thus, for example, <span class="underline">Henderson argued that intensive care nursing’s continued concentration on bodily surveillance prevents ‘the development of “meaningful” nurse-patient relationships’</span>(p. 938) .43 So far, so good; <span class="underline">there would seem to be nothing inconsistent with new nursing philosophy in this critical analysis of mechanistic approaches to clients.</span> However, the problem comes at the stage of deciding what to do on the basis of this analysis. <span class="underline">New Nursing’s response has been</span> (quite correctly in my opinion) to <span class="underline">argue that there is more to patients than their sick bodies, and therefore that adequate care must also take account of psychological, sociological and cultural factors</span>.4<br />
<span class="underline">However, for Foucauldian commentators this move simply involves the construction of a new power/knowledge matrix</span>. Indeed, <span class="underline">it is regarded as involving a further turn of the screw of disciplinary surveillance</span>. Thus, for example, <span class="underline">Armstrong argued</span> that New Nursing’s <span class="underline">change of focus</span> from the passive body to the patient as an interactive subject <span class="underline">involves an even greater encroachment of surveillance</span>: From a simple concern with the care of the patient’s bodily functions, <span class="underline">nursing has started to become a surveillance apparatus which both monitors and evinces the patient’s personal identity</span>: in doing so it helps fabricate and sustain that identity (p. 459).45<br />
<span class="underline">Here we can see clearly the dilemma involved in adopting a Foucauldian analysis in nursing</span>. While it can be used effectively to criticize the dominant discursive regime, <span class="underline">it cannot be used to support an alternative, in that it repudiates the possibility of loosening the tie between knowledge and power</span>. Thus, while Foucault’s critique of the clinical gaze and its exclusive concentration upon the physical body would seem to imply a programme for nursing that moves beyond such a gaze, <span class="underline">the adoption of that programme by nursing has not been regarded by Foucauldians as involving progress in care</span>. Foucault’s denial that knowledge can be either progressive or in any way independent of power means that, <span class="underline">while Foucauldian analysis can tell us a lot about what is wrong with where we are, it can tell us very little about where we should go.</span> It is my concern that nursing, with its responsibilities concerning best practice, should be wary of such relativist negativity.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Foucault’s rejection of rationality makes it impossible to challenge isolated instances of power – there is no way to differentiate between coercive power and productive power</span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cheek and Porter 1997 </span></span>[Julianne, Centre for Research rnto Nursing and Health Care, University of South Australia, and Sam, Department of Sociology and Social Work, Queen’s University of Belfast, “Reviewing Foucault: possibilities and problems for nursing and health care”, <em>Nursing Inquiry</em> volume 4 issue 2, January 14]<br />
This dismissal of the subject has serious consequences for the possibility of knowledge in the human sciences: ‘Nothing in man [sic] - not even his body - is sufficiently stable to serve as the basis for self-recognition or for understanding other men’(pp. 87-88).34 On the basis of this denial that external reality can impinge upon knowledge (in that it is power that produces reality),<span class="underline"> Foucault goes beyond ‘epistemic relativity’ and the acceptance that, because all beliefs are socially produced, knowledge can never be regarded as certain</span>. He adheres to a position known as ‘judgmental relativity’,35 in that <span class="underline">he denied that there are any criteria that can be used to judge between different claims made about the nature of the body</span>. <span class="underline">The problem with Foucault’s judgmental relativism is that</span>, while it may well undermine the taken-forgranted certainties that currently animate health care, <span class="underline">it can provide no grounding for alternative modes of knowledge, for they will be equally bereft of a firm epistemological territory upon which to stand</span>. <span class="underline">In his rejection of rational criteria </span>to adjudicate between different knowledge claims, <span class="Emphasis2">Foucault closed off the possibility of criticizing biomedicine </span>(for example) <span class="Emphasis2">on the grounds that there are more rational forms of care.</span><br />
It is not just that adoption of a Foucauldian position makes it very difficult for the critic to posit alternative knowledge claims, in that their claims will be seen just as much as those they oppose as being generated by powerbased discourse. <span class="underline">Foucault’ s analysis also makes it very difficult to engage in constructive criticism of power and coercion</span>. Foucault argued that power is omnipresent: ‘Power is everywhere . . . because it comes from everywhere’ (p. 93).36 The problem with such a position is that <span class="underline">if power is found in all interactions it becomes impossible to differentiate between different instances of the application of power</span>.37 <span class="underline">Foucault’s position drove him inexorably towards a desolate, Hobbesian conception of social life</span>:<br />
This is just a hypothesis, but I would say it’s all against all. There aren’t immediately given subjects of the struggle, one the proletariat, the other the bourgeoisie. Who fights against whom? We all fight against each other (p. 208).38<br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PERM: DO BOTH. Foucault’s form of resistance is ineffective at dealing with global oppression – a combination of action and postmodernism is best. Discourses of power can be used to create counter-hegemonic forms of resistance</span></span><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cook 92 </span></span>(Anthony. Associate Professor at Georgetown Law School, &quot;A Diversity of Influence: Reflections on Postmodernism.&quot; New Eng. L. Rev. 751)<br />
Several things trouble me about <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Foucault's approach</span>. First, he <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nurtures</span> in many ways an unhealthy <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">insularity that fails to connect localized struggle to other localized struggles</span> and to modes of oppression like classism, racism, sexism, and homophobia that transcend their localized articulation within this particular law school, that particular law firm, within this particular church or that particular factory. <br />
I note among some followers of Foucault an unhealthy propensity to rely on rich, thick, ethnographic type descriptions of power relations playing themselves out in these localized laboratories of social conflict. This reliance on detailed description and its concomitant deemphasis of explanation begins, ironically, to look like a regressive positivism which purports to sever the descriptive from the normative, the is from the ought and law from morality and politics. <br />
Unless we are to be trapped in this Foucaultian insularity, we must resist the temptation to sever description from explanation. Instead, our objective should be to explain what we describe in light of a vision embracing values that we make explicit in struggle. These values should act as magnets that link our particularized struggles to other struggles and more global critiques of power. In other words, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we must not, </span>as Foucault seems all too willing to do,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> forsake the possibility of more universal narratives that, while tempered by postmodern insights, attempt to sav and do something about the oppressive world in which we live. Second. Foucault's emphasis on the techniques and discourses of </span>knowledge that constitute the human subject often <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">diminishes, if not abrogates the role of human agency. </span>Agency is of tremendous importance in any theory of oppression, because <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">individuals are not simply constituted by systems of knowledge but also constitute</span> hegemonic and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">counter-hegemonic systems of knowledge</span> as well. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Critical theory must pay attention to the ways in which oppressed people </span>not only are victimized by ideologies oppression but the ways they<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> craft </span>from these ideologies and discourses<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> counter-hegemonic weapons of liberation. </span><br />

Thus, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Foucault is – mistakenly – taking to claim that we are witnessing</span> the progressive spread of increasingly <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">more effective practices of discipline and control</span>, thereby invoking the idea of a ‘disciplined society’. However, Foucault went at great pains to stress that although the disciplinary practices have spread to a number of <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">institutions</span> in modern society, they <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are by no means the only practices by which we constitute ourselves as subjects</span>. Moreover, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the disciplinary practices</span>, Foucault argues, regardless of the rigor with which they are sought schemed and implemented, <em>are failing all the time</em>. In short, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we may characterize our society as disciplinary</span> – in the sense of an increasing importance of disciplines in making up ourselves – <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">but certainly not as disciplined</span> – in the sense of a society characterized by increasingly disciplined <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">obedient and controlled citizens</span>. <br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Wrong – prioritization of ontology over all else an incomplete view of politics and collapses into theorizing while impeding real problem-solving approaches. </span></span><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Owen ‘2</span></span> (David, Reader of Political Theory at the Univ. of Southampton, Millennium, Vol 31, No 3)<br />
Commenting on the ‘philosophical turn’ in IR, Wæver remarks that ‘[a] frenzy for words like <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">“epistemology” and</span> “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ontology</span>” often signals this philosophical turn’, although he goes on to comment that these terms are often used loosely.4 However, loosely deployed or not, it is clear that debates concerning ontology and epistemology play a central role in the contemporary IR theory wars. In one respect, this is unsurprising since it is a characteristic feature of the social sciences that periods of disciplinary disorientation involve recourse to reflection on the philosophical commitments of different theoretical approaches, and there is no doubt that such reflection can play a valuable role in making explicit the commitments that characterise (and help individuate) diverse theoretical positions. Yet, such a philosophical turn <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is not without its dangers</span> and I will briefly mention three before turning to consider a confusion that has, I will suggest, helped to promote the IR theory wars by motivating this philosophical turn. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The first danger with the philosophical turn is that it has an inbuilt tendency to prioritise issues of ontology and epistemology over explanatory and/or interpretive power as if the latter two were merely a simple function of the former</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> But while the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">explanatory and/or interpretive power</span> of a theoretical account is not wholly independent of its ontological and/or epistemological commitments (otherwise criticism of these features would not be a criticism that had any value), it <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is by no means clear that it is, in contrast, wholly dependent on these philosophical commitments.</span></u> Thus, for example, one need not be sympathetic to rational choice theory to recognise that it can provide powerful accounts of certain kinds of problems, such as the tragedy of the commons in which dilemmas of collective action are foregrounded. It may, of course, be the case that the advocates of rational choice theory cannot give a good account of why this type of theory is powerful in accounting for this class of problems (i.e., how it is that the relevant actors come to exhibit features in these circumstances that approximate the assumptions of rational choice theory) and, if this is the case, it is a philosophical weakness—but this does not undermine the point that, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">for a certain class of problems, rational choice theory may provide the best account available to us.</span> In other words, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">while the critical judgement of theoretical accounts in terms of their ontological and/or epistemological sophistication is one kind of critical judgement, it is not the only or even necessarily the most important kind</span>. The second danger run by the philosophical turn is that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">because prioritisation of ontology and epistemology promotes theory-construction from philosophical first principles, it cultivates a theory-driven rather than problem-driven approach to IR</span><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span></u> Paraphrasing Ian Shapiro, the point can be put like this: <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">since it is the case that there is always a plurality of possible true descriptions of a given action, event or phenomenon, the challenge is to decide which is the most apt</span> in terms of getting a perspicuous grip on the action, event or phenomenon in question given the purposes of the inquiry; yet, from this standpoint, ‘<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">theory-driven work is part of a reductionist program’ in that it ‘dictates always opting for the description that calls for the explanation that flows from the preferred model or theory’.</span>5 The justification offered for this strategy rests on the mistaken belief that it is necessary for social science because general explanations are required to characterise the classes of phenomena studied in similar terms. However, as Shapiro points out, this is to misunderstand the enterprise of science since ‘whether there are general explanations for classes of phenomena is a question for social-scientific inquiry, not to be prejudged before conducting that inquiry’.6 Moreover, <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">this strategy easily slips into the promotion of the pursuit of generality over that of empirical validity.</span></u> The third danger is that the preceding two combine to encourage the formation of a particular image of disciplinary debate in IR—what might be called (only slightly tongue in cheek) ‘the Highlander view’—namely, an image of warring theoretical approaches with each, despite occasional temporary tactical alliances, dedicated to the strategic achievement of sovereignty over the disciplinary field. It encourages this view because the turn to, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">prioritisation of, ontology and epistemology stimulates the idea that there can only be one theoretical approach</span> which gets things right, namely, the theoretical approach that gets its ontology and epistemology right. <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This image feeds back into IR exacerbating the first and second dangers, and so a potentially vicious circle arises</span></u><strong><u>.</u></strong><br />

In this respect, the annual scorecard of program impacts represents a gaming card more closely than the initial use of the metaphor might have suggested. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The card </span>is a powerful testimony to the social construction of official statistics, for it<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> embodies the performances of both government and business migrants.</span> As we have seen, several evaluations have regarded its claims as exaggerated, and the more recent the assessment, the greater has been the charge of inflated impacts. Above all, the card represents the desire of the state to demonstrate palpable achievements in an authoritative statistical genre. But the small print reveals that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the state is not, in fact, the sole author of the card, for data have been compiled from the records supplied by migrants themselves, who have everything to gain through selective presentation</span> of business achievements. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Here, </span><em>governmentality is vulnerable</em>, for though the state initiated the business program, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it is scarcely a surveillant overseer</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as its monitoring capacity is weak.</span> So, too, its requirement of high immigrant entry levels has obligated setting low thresholds for immigrant selection. In both cases, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the state's vulnerability creates opportunities for migrants</span> prompted by knowledgeable immigration consultants. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">By playing the state's game, they can take advantage of the state's vulnerabilities to play their own game more advantageously. </span>The annual scorecard becomes a performative fiction that satisfies both game plans, as it consolidates a specter of homo economicus that suits both sides. Moreover, its statistical presentation conveys objectivity and facticity for an external audience, adding the persuasive magic of large numbers. Only with critical interpretation does the transparency of the numbers on the scorecard reveal a deeper misrepresentation, for these numbers represent, above all, the materialization of mutual desire.<br />

<span class="underline">The prevailing academic debates on the whole range of conceptual di- chotomies</span>, such as: local/global, modernity/tradition, development/under- development/post-development, rational/ irrational, and so on <span class="underline">have led the struggle for emancipation and social justice to a blind alley. The ramifications of getting stuck in a blind alley are very serious for those of us who wish to write 'history from below' and find ways to emancipate our- selves and our writings of histories.</span> One major repercussion is that the oppression of those (mostly women, who already are among the most oppressed groups as well as violated against, within various societ- ies of the world including more specifi- cally in recent Gujarat riots), has further increased with newly bestowed legitimacy to such <br />
oppressive traditions as 'sati' and their abysmal living conditions. In the last two decades, <span class="underline">the concept of 'history from below' lost its emancipatory base when some influential scholars reinterpreted and misconstrued this concept for their own political agenda. </span>Unwittingly, <span class="underline">their rein- terpretation also provided legitimacy to the already emerging</span> (due to various international and national economic, social, and political reasons) <span class="underline">prevailing conser- vative political environment</span> within India since the 1980s. Therefore, to move out of this blind alley and to bring back the emancipatory politics and social justice to the concept of the 'history from below', it is important that we start from different assumption.<br />

It seems to me, that to make the language speak an imagined and desired world would not only not bring such a world about, but it would also potentially deprive us of prima facie evidence of the position of women; crucial to keep attention on the issue. Pauwels argues, Feminist language campaigns have made it increasingly difficult for substantial sections of the population to ignore this linguistic expression of gender discrimination. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Even if people don’t adopt the changes or embrace the principles of such linguistic change, they can no longer ignore its existence</span>. This is, for instance, clear from increased meta-linguistic comments in both speech and writing referring to the issue.

[Claudia. “Security and the democratic scene: desecuritization and emancipation” Journal of International Relations and Development]<br />
I shall contend that desecuritization needs to learn the lessons of the democratic politics of emancipation. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Deprived of political commitment, desecuritization can only be a relatively sterile tool, unfit for acting upon the world and transforming ‘prevailing social and power relationships and the institutions into which they are organised’ (</span>Cox, quoted in Krause and Williams 1997: xi). <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Emancipation itself is not a new concept in security studies</span> and it has been used by both Critical and (partially) by feminist security studies. Yet, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">their circular definition of emancipation as security deprives the former of its truly transformative potential.</span> In contradistinction to this tradition of understanding emancipation, I propose a concept of emancipation inspired by the work of two post-Marxist French philosophers,E´ tienne Balibar and Jacques Rancie` re, and subsequently present two possible strategies of emancipation/desecuritization for societal security.4 Against the problematic assertion that emancipation is coeval to security, their concept of emancipation is informed by the principles of universality and recognition. <br />

TIGER 8 – J.D. candidate at the Georgetown University Law Center (JOSEPH, Spring, “NOTE: RE-BENDING THE PAPERCLIP: AN EXAMINATION OF AMERICA'S POLICY REGARDING SKILLED WORKERS AND STUDENT VISAS”, 22 Geo. Immigr. L.J. 507, Lexis Law) <br />
<br />
The SKIL Bill, endorsed by both the Council of Graduate Schools n195 and the Information Technology Association of America, n196 addresses the two main problems facing foreign students at American universities--the timing of H-1B visas relative to graduation, and the period between graduation and the beginning of the fiscal year. It addresses the first through substantial increases in H-1B and EB quotas and exemptions from the quotas, and the second through extension of OPT for all students and permission to file for green card status directly out of OPT. Senator Hagel's High-Tech Worker Relief Act temporarily addresses the first problem but does not deal with the second. <br />
In fact, there are innumerable ways in which these problems can be addressed. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At some level, each proposal will likely involve some form of increase in quotas, either through a direct increase in the number or by exempting students from the quotas.</span> Conceivably, the problem of the graduation date being later than the availability of visas could be dealt with by delaying the first date petitions for H-1B visas are accepted, from the beginning of April until the beginning of May or June, so that students would have a chance to compete. <br />

• Holders of advanced STEM degrees who have worked in the U.S. in a related field for three years with a temporary visa; <br />

• Outstanding professors and researchers; <br />
• Persons who have received a &quot;national interest waiver&quot; of the normal job offer requirements in the green card process; and <br />

<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Enemark 2005</span></span> [Dr. Christian, Visiting Fellow of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at ANU where he serves as Deputy Director of the National Centre for Biosecurity, “Infectious Diseases and International Security”, <em>The Nonproliferation Review</em> vol 12 no 1, March 1, p. InformaWorld] <br />
<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In pursuing international cooperation, a threshold issue is how to win political acceptance for the idea that some infectious diseases pose a threat to security as well as to health. To securitize infectious diseases is to seek some of the overriding political interest and superior financial resources</span> associated with more traditional (military) concepts of security. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Labeling something a security issue lends it a sense of urgency, attracts greater public attention, and implicitly demands resources.</span>1 <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There is a strong humanitarian imperative to mitigate the huge potential and actual loss of life resulting from infectious disease</span>, but humanitarian motivations alone are not sufficient to address this problem. In appealing to national governments—still the principal players in the international arena—<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">infectious diseases need to be portrayed in such a way </span>as to stimulate concerns about national interests. Historically,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> governments have shown greater enthusiasm toward their own security than </span>they have<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> toward humanitarian causes. </span><br />
A good introduction to the way in which infectious diseases impact security is to examine their relevance to military operations throughout history. The historian Livy described an outbreak of plague in the Carthaginian and Roman armies during the siege of Syracuse in 212 BC. The Carthaginians, less accustomed than the Romans to the city's moist climate, suffered greater casualties from the disease and were defeated shortly afterward.2 In the thirteenth century, the Mongol invasions helped spread various epidemics of plague between East Asia and Eastern Europe. The sixteenth century demise of the Aztec empire came about mostly because the Spanish conquerors brought smallpox and measles with them to the New World. During World War I, an outbreak of typhus in Serbia in 1915 was so severe that the fighting on both sides stopped for six months. <br />
And disease was relevant in April 2003 when Canada's health minister suggested that medical staff from the Canadian Forces could help relieve pressure on Toronto hospital staff treating patients with SARS. The military replied that it was already critically short of physicians to look after its troops. At the time, Canada was preparing for a major deployment to Afghanistan. Had the SARS outbreak in Toronto become so bad as to require medical personnel from Canadian military units to assist, those units would not have been able to deploy overseas.3 <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In one sense, infectious diseases are already an “established” security threat</span> in the form of biological warfare. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Weapons for deliberately disseminating pathogenic micro-organisms potentially pose direct security threats to many countries</span>. BW is not a new threat like emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, and it fits more easily within traditional conceptions of security. For these reasons, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">attempts to link disease and security via the problem of BW tend to resonate more strongly with the public and policymakers.</span>4 But biological weapons are just one part of a spectrum of risks associated with the biological sciences. The spectrum encompasses natural disease outbreaks, accidents arising from otherwise benign activities such as medical research with pathogens, and the use of disease as a weapon of war or terror.5 <br />
( ) Absolute rejections of “terrorism” is moralistic posturing – your K shuts down discussions of all political violence <br />
Peter C. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sederberg</span></span>, Government Prof @ USC, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1989</span></span>, Terrorist Myths, p. 41-2 <br />
<br />
No wonder critics like Hitchens think it advisable to abandon the quest for a minimum degree of precision with the concept and allow the politicians and ideological partisans their mindless pleasures. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If we believe</span><span class="underline">, </span>however, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that certain forms of coercion</span> that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">can be plausibly labeled terrorism</span> constitute a serious problem demanding serious treatment, then <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we must accept the challenge</span> of establishing just what terrorism is and distinguish it from what it is not. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Such a task need not be</span> construed as <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a search for absolute incontrovertible truth, but simply as a pragmatic undertaking</span> to make some distinctions that will prove useful for understanding. SAVING THE CONCEPT In order to rescue the concept from various partisan agendas, we must engage in at least three interrelated tasks. First, for the concept to assist us in making sense of the world, we must establish some nontrivial bases for distinguishing between terrorism and the many other types of coercion that characterize our political relations. If we construe the meaning of terrorism so vaguely that it becomes indistinguishable from other forms of coercion, then the term becomes superfluous. For example, to define terrorism as “the use or threatened use of violence for political purposes to extort, intimidate or coerce others in modifying their behavior” covers virtually every conceivable form of political violence including war. Second, if we successfully identify these nontrivial factors that set terrorism apart, then these must be plausibly related to the effect of fear or terror. If the forms of coercion we claim as instances of terrorism are not more “terrifying’ than other coercive acts, then we should avoid using such an emotionally loaded label. We might call them “unconventional violence,” or something else less likely to inflame the discussion. On the other hand, circular definitions should also be avoided, such as that contained in the British “Prevention of Terrorism Act” of 1974, which defines terrorism as “the use of violence for political ends, and includes any use of violence for the purpose of putting the public or any section of the public in fear.” This effort has the dubious distinction of being both vague and tautological. A final and most challenging task must be to avoid moralistic posturing but not to ignore the moral dimensions of the problem. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Uncritical acceptance or rejection of myth that one person’s terrorist is another’s freedom fighter tends to foreclose any significant moral discussion. Acceptance of the myth of the complete subjectivity of definition implies a sophomoric moral relativism:</span> that is, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the morality of terrorism becomes a matter opinion, and all opinions are considered of equal merit. Such muddled moral relativism hardly encourages significant discussion of any conclusions about the moral implications of terrorism. </span><br />

<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The neg identifies language as the cause and solution, seeking to linguistically reinvent the world – it wants to think differently about something that is determined by MANY DIFFERENT forces larger than the way we speak about them. </span></span><br />

<br />
However, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to change the linguistic evidence would not re-make the</span> gendered <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">world</span> in which we live. While <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">people do live in language, we also live in thoughts, ideas and bodies</span>. It seems to me, that to make the language speak an imagined and desired world would not only not bring such a world about, but it would also potentially deprive us of prima facie evidence of the position of women; crucial to keep attention on the issue. Pauwels argues, Feminist language campaigns have made it increasingly difficult for substantial sections of the population to ignore this linguistic expression of gender discrimination. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Even if people don’t adopt the changes or embrace the principles of such linguistic change, they can no longer ignore its existence</span>. This is, for instance, clear from increased meta-linguistic comments in both speech and writing referring to the issue. Examples include apologies for not adopting dual, gender-inclusive generic pronouns, making statements such as I do not want to sound sexist, but...’.114 I am not denying that awareness of language issues may have increased. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But there is a danger that if we focus too much on language as a site of violence, its symptom status and other sites of violence, will be forgotten.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The move towards de-securitizing language gets lost in speech acts instead of focusing of material constraints </span></span><br />

<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This reliance on language</span> as the exclusive form of ‘securitizing move’<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> is problematic</span> for two reasons. First, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">language is only one</span> (albeit the most central) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">means through which meaning is communicated </span>(Möller, 2007: 180). A range of authors in this context have suggested the need to take account of the role of images as potential forms of securitization. Second, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an exclusive focus</span> on language is problematic in the sense that it can <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">exclude forms of bureaucratic practices or physical action that do not merely follow from securitizing ‘speech acts’ but are part of the process through which meanings of security are communicated</span> and security itself constructed. <br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">First, lowers research quality</span> – it rewards teams that put together shallow strats that they can jettison, without delve into the aff’s literature to come up with germane strategies. The whole point of evidence-based debate is to force people to research the entirety of the arc of policy proposals, conditionality is a cheap shot. <br />
<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Second, teaches bad debating practices </span>– Promotes an illogical raeson to reject affs by encourages a form of debate that doesn’t sponsor more clash or higher order strategic thinking. AND, in the real world, the idea that once people answer our argument, we can just jettison our position is not something that is condoned by academia, law, and even talk shows. <br />
<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Third, ruins competitive equity</span> – Affs have already been put in a re-active position, and conditionality takes away the option to straight turn, which is one of the BEST strategic tools affs have to leverage the direction of the debate. Contradictory conditional arguments are even worse because they even further constrain what the aff can say.

As the United States runs short of nurses, senators are looking abroad. A little-noticed provision in their immigration bill would throw open the gate and, some fear, drain nurses from the world's developing countries. The legislation is expected to pass this week, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">t</span><span class="underline">he Senate provision, which removes the limit on the number of nurses who can immigrate, has been largely overlooked in the emotional debate over </span>illegal <span class="underline">immigration</span>. <span class="underline">Senator Sam Brownback</span>, a Republican from Kansas who <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sponsored the proposal</span>, said it was needed to help the United States cope with a growing nursing shortage. He said he doubted that the measure would greatly increase the small number of African nurses coming to the United States, but acknowledged that it could have an impact on the Philippines and India, which are already sending thousands of nurses to the United States each year. The exodus of nurses from poor to rich countries has strained health systems in the developing world, which are already facing severe shortages of their own. Many African countries have begun to demand compensation for the training and loss of nurses and other health professionals who move away. Some rich countries have responded. Two years ago, Britain, a huge beneficiary of nurses from Malawi, pledged to give that country more than $100 million to increase the salaries of nurses and other health workers there. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Senate provision,</span> which would remain in force until 2014, contains no such compensation. It<span class="underline"> has not stirred serious opposition in </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congress, </span>but it is not part of the House of Representatives' immigration bill. So if the full Congress approves the legislation, a committee from both houses would then have to decide whether to include the provision on nurses. <br />
<br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cards that aren’t about employment visas for nurses don’t count-they are bipartisan-even with politicians who are normally tough on immigration </span></span><br />

<br />
Legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives (HR 5924) which addresses the shortages of certain healthcare workers and offers significant solutions. Specifically, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">all quotas would be waived for</span> Schedule A shortage occupations (registered <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nurses</span> and physical therapists) as long as the immigrant visa petition (I-140) is filed by September 30, 2011. This would give healthcare facilities approximately 3 years to bring in significantly more foreign nurses and physical therapists during that period, although consulates would be limited to approving no more than 20,000 nurse or physical therapist cases in a year. The ability of the government to handle the increased workload in a timely manner, as always, remains in doubt. The USCIS would be required to process the I-140 immigrant visa petition within 30 days, a vast improvement over the current 6-12 month processing times. Again, the ability of the government's limited resources to handle the expedited processing time remains in doubt. All nursing visas issued under this law would require a $1,500 fee, with limited exceptions, to be used to fund grants for schools of nursing. While commendable, past efforts by the government in other areas to fund the development of the American workforce at the expense of employers of foreign workers have met with little or no success. Finally, immigrant visa applicants will need to attest that they do not owe their country of residence a financial obligation that was incurred for their education so that they would remain in that country. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This legislation is sponsored by members of both political parties</span>, one of <em>whom is known as tough on immigration</em>. While we remain hopeful about the chances for success for this proposed law, a word of caution is necessary. The proposed legislation will need to survive debate and amendments in both the House and the Senate before it ever gets to the President for signature and becomes law. Election year politics and the illegal immigration/enforcement debate are also obstacles to passage of this law. In addition, HR 5882 was recently introduced in the House of Representatives which proposes to recapture unused employment-based immigrant visas from past years. This could be as many as 218,000 immigrant visas. This is significantly more than the 50,000 Schedule A immigrant visas that were recaptured by special legislation in 2005 and ran out very quickly. This proposed law would act <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to speed up the EB-3 immigrant visa quota </span>category which is where most nurses are delayed. This law<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> appears to have bipartisan support and is sponsored by leading members of Congress</span>. However, as above, the same word of caution applies. <br />

Senate leaders have been trying to keep out all immigration measures in their version of the appropriations bill, arguing that a “clean” bill will pass much more quickly. <span style="font-size: 9pt;">Majority Leader Frist has promised that immigration measures will be taken up later this year. However, members of his own party have balked at this promise noting that virtually no immigration legislation has been passed since 9/11.

A second lesson concerns the limits of bipartisanship. Obama and moderates in the Democratic party have learned that the relationship between Obama and the Republicans (both the leadership and the bulk of the membership) is likely to be rocky throughout his presidency. By communicating with them regularly, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama can</span> perhaps <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">prevent the relationship from descending into bitter distrust</span><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> Opportunities for genuine cooperation will arise occasionally. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama </span>and the Democratic congressional leadership <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">can foster some bipartisanship</span> at the committee level by using regular order as much as possible. 10 But the Republican leaders’ job is furthering their members’ policy and electoral goals; a majority of those members will not see supporting Obama as furthering either of those goals. Mostly Obama and the Democratic leadership will have to be satisfied with <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">picking off a few Republicans in the Senate</span>. Certainly Obama has learned not to make getting a large number of Republican votes a test of his success. Still, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama’s attempts to reach out</span> have <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">yielded considerable dividends in terms of public opinion.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Just two weeks after President Obama was sworn into office, Richard Umbdenstock, head of the powerful </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">merican </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">H</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ospital </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">ssociation, visited the White House.Over the next five months, the former Seattle hospital executive made eight other trips to the White House, making him the most frequent visitor among major health-care leaders, according to a list released by the Obama administration. </span>The treks were part of an expansive lobbying effort by<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> the hospital association </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">as the health-care reform debate has intensified this spring and summer.The hospital association, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which spends millions of dollars each year on lobbying and campaign contributions</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, is in many ways typical of the medical interests now seeking to minimize the damage to their bottom lines. </span>The health-care fight represents one of the largest lobbying battles in congressional history<span style="font-size: 8pt;">, embroiling an industry that accounts for one-sixth of the U.S. economy and a worsening drain on the federal treasury. </span>Hospitals account for nearly a third of that spending, and their lobbying illustrates the complicated relationship between an industry with much at stake and the lawmakers who could reshape its future<span style="font-size: 8pt;">.Like insurers, doctors and stakeholders, the hospitals have agreed to concessions, joining Vice President Biden this month to announce $155 billion worth of cuts in Medicare reimbursements and other payments over the next decade. But in recent weeks, the group has also ratcheted up its opposition to proposals for a public insurance option and an independent agency to set Medicare rates; it says the changes would dramatically hurt hospital finances at a time when many institutions are struggling.&quot;We are very much interested at being at the table and are very pleased that we have been included,&quot; said Umbdenstock, who previously served as executive vice president of Providence Health &amp; Services, a Seattle-based regional network of hospitals and clinics. &quot;But there are certain issues that are very serious and grave concerns for us.&quot;The </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">AHA</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which </span>represents more than 5,000 <span style="font-size: 8pt;">public, nonprofit and for-profit </span>hospitals <span style="font-size: 8pt;">around the country, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has spent more than $7 million this year in its Washington lobbying campaign</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, ranking it near the top of the industry. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">More than two dozen lobbyists from the group have been closely involved in talks with lawmakers and staff members </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">with the Senate Finance Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and other key panels as they have wrangled over reform, according to disclosure records.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The organization also ranks as a major donor to members of Congress. It contributed more than $2 million to congressional candidates during the last election cycle, primarily to Democrats</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, according to data from the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.Top recipients include House and Senate leaders from both parties, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.), as well as leaders of the key committees shaping health-care legislation, including Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and House Ways and Means Chairman Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.). Other top recipients include Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.), who is part of the &quot;Blue Dog&quot; coalition of conservative Democrats, and former congressman Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.), now Obama's chief of staff.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Hospital opposition to key reform proposals has been an important factor in slowing the pace of negotiations in the House</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, contributing to this week's announcement that the Senate would not meet Obama's August deadline for a final bill. Unlike other top industry groups, including the American Medical Association, </span>the hospital group has yet to endorse any current reform bills, and it has signaled that such approval is unlikely unless the public insurance and Medicare payment options are scrapped.<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Richard Kirsch, national campaign director for Health Care for America Now, a pro-reform advocacy group, characterized the hospital lobby as similar to others in the debate, including doctors and pharmaceutical companies -- all of whom are seeking to minimize the negative financial impact they might face. Kirsch noted that Obama had initially called for $200 billion in cuts from the hospital sector; the group agreed to $45 billion less. Pelosi said this week that she might still push for more.&quot;They want to make the fewest cost concessions that they can get away with, and they want to design those cost concessions themselves,&quot; Kirsch said.</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The hospital lobby's clout is especially strong among the Blue Dogs, a group of more than 50 conservative Democrats </span>whose concerns effectively halted the progress of health reform legislation <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the House this week. A key sticking point is the complaint from rural hospitals -- many of which are located in Blue Dog districts -- that they are not paid enough under varying reimbursement rates through Medicare.Rick Pollack, executive vice president of the hospital association, said </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">close ties between hospitals and their communities mean that lawmakers pay close attention to such concerns</span>.&quot;We have a hospital in every district in the country, and in many communities we're the single largest employer,&quot; he said. &quot;The grass roots and the ground game is always the most important thing in terms of influencing and interacting with legislators.&quot; <br />

<br />
Peter Hart gets at a key point. Some believe that political capital is finite, that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> political capital can be regenerated -- and, specifically, </span>that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more capital</span>. Indeed, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that appears to be what is happening with Barack Obama</span>, who went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of the Republicans on Capitol Hill, and is being rewarded by the American public as a result. Take a look at the numbers. President Obama now has a 68 percent favorable rating in the NBC-WSJ poll, his highest ever showing in the survey. Nearly half of those surveyed (47 percent) view him very positively. Obama's Democratic Party earns a respectable 49 percent favorable rating. The Republican Party, however, is in the toilet, with its worst ever showing in the history of the NBC-WSJ poll, 26 percent favorable. On the question of blame for the partisanship in Washington, 56 percent place the onus on the Bush administration and another 41 percent place it on Congressional Republicans. Yet just 24 percent blame Congressional Democrats, and a mere 11 percent blame the Obama administration. <br />
So at this point, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with President Obama seemingly benefiting from his ambitious actions and the Republicans sinking further and further as a result of their knee-jerked opposition</span> to that agenda, there appears to be no reason not to push forward on anything from universal healthcare to energy reform to ending the war in Iraq. <br />
<br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Visa reform gets GOP on board – most popular form of immigration concession </span></span><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lawrence 11</span></span> (Stewart, Immigration Specialist, &quot;Is a Deal on Immigration Possible Before 2012,&quot; Counterpunch, January 14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.counterpunch.org/lawrence01142011.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterpunch.org/lawrence01142011.html</a>) <br />
<br />
A second option is to punt on legalization and expanded enforcement altogether and to focus for now on<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> visa reform - </span>an issue on which <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is already much </span>greater<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> bipartisan agreement</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The two sides could agree to work on a bill that </span>made it easier for foreign scientists and engineers to get work visas and to transition to legal residency. That<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> would mean raising or even eliminating the current visa &quot;cap&quot;</span> for high-skill workers (from its current, widely acknowledged to be inadequate level of 65,000) and changing the rules so that foreign-born students in US schools could become legal residents more quickly. <br />
The virtue of this approach is that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> it can be sold as a contribution to US global “competitiveness”</span> - and a blow to China - and a step toward in reviving the depressed economy. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While it means importing workers at a time of high joblessness, the workers are widely viewed as ones the country should have. </span>That probably wouldn’t be the case if the visa reform debate were extended to unskilled workers, reviving<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the age-old polemics over the pros and cons of an economy-wide &quot;guest worker program&quot; which have torpedoed bipartisan initiatives on immigration reform in the past. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">The GOP far-right has long attacked a guest worker program as a spur to illegal immigration, while the left has viewed it as a system for indentured labor and super-exploitation, much like the infamous Bracero program of the 1950s and 1960s. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">The Washington Post recently editorialized in favor of focusing on a high-skill visa program, but significantly, said nothing about a guest worker program. The Post was merely reflecting the views of the US business community, especially the high-tech sector, as well as Senate moderates in both parties, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) whose support would be critical to initiating such an effort. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">In short, the vaunted &quot;deadlock&quot; on immigration that many predicted would last through 2012 may not, in fact, last that long. Neither party can afford to be viewed as &quot;obstructionist&quot; on an issue that has proven to be the nation's thorniest and most volatile -but on which the public is demanding real action. In some ways, the tables have now turned</span>: with the GOP running the House, it's finally in a position to set the agenda and to compel the Democrats to respond. And having made clear last week that the agenda is no longer one immediately guaranteed to inflame Latinos, and much of the nation - birthright citizenship - the Democrats must now prepare to parry with the GOP on workplace enforcement - and beyond. <br />
Of course, there's always the chance that the two parties may get distracted by other issues, and simply try to punt for two more years. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But as the mid-term elections revealed, the do-nothing strategy carries real risks for both parties</span> -- the Democrats especially. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Republicans</span> successfully <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">exploited immigration</span> as a “wedge” issue with white voters in key congressional districts, which helped them win the House. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But they alienated some Latinos </span>in California and the Southwest, and t<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">hat clearly helped cost them the Senate. </span>With 23 Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2012, compared to just 10 Republicans, senior Republican strategists have no intention of making that mistake again. <br />
Therefore, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the best option </span>for Democrats<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> is for the President to get out in front on immigration as quickly as possible and to forge a modest deal that can steal the GOP's thunder</span>. It won't be the whole “enchildada” - not even close. But by demonstrating that he's prepared to embrace the concerns of both parties, and indeed, stand up to his own base, in the short term,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Obama may finally &quot;win&quot; with immigration - ensuring his own re-election, averting a further rightward slide, while setting the stage for an expanded legalization program after 2012</span>. Given the current electoral math, that's probably the best the Democrats can hope for. <br />

They should lose – The neg should be restricted to the agent of the plan. They’ve also conceded the terminal framing of the debate – logical decision making is the highest pedagogical value of the activity because it teaches us how to approach choices in our every day lives.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If studying the implementation of judicial policies is important, then we must study it as a political process.

Political scientist Michael Lipsky remarks on how postdecision factors may enter the implementation process: “There are many contexts in which the latitude of those charged with carrying out a policy is so substantial that studies of policy implement it.” As we will see in later chapters,</span> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">many judicial decisions afford a great deal of latitude for interpretation and implementation. Political actors and institutions who follow through on the decisions make the judicial policy. Certainly, the judges who enforced civil rights decisions were subject to political pressures from a variety of sources</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Similar pressures affected public and private institutions after court decisions on affirmative action.

Rev. 185, Spring, p. Lexis] <br />
<br />
In contrast, legislating from the bench involves &quot;prospective decision making,&quot; in which judges, perhaps in the interest of developing a more general [*205] policy or political agenda, abandon incremental legal rulings in favor of decisions with a broader scale or target. n94 As Henry Abraham has argued, these kinds of rulings can entail &quot;prescriptive policy making&quot; that shifts from imposing negative limits on what government can do to identifying positive obligations of government - what the state must do - and through what means. This approach, according to critics, is precisely the task of the political branches, not the judiciary. n95 <br />
<span class="underline">What problems are potentially associated with this picture of a judiciary that actively develops policy </span>and issue areas by issuing expansive, far-reaching decisions? To begin with, <span class="underline">this behavior may encourage a kind of political irresponsibility, passivity, or at least lethargy in legislators </span>(and other political figures) <span class="underline">who defer to the courts </span>or at least turn their attention to areas where the judiciary is less involved. n96 Abraham further contends that judges must resolutely shun prescriptive policy making because they are already overburdened with the responsibilities of their more traditional tasks of limited, case-based constitutional and statutory interpretation. n97 <br />
Moreover, as several scholars have claimed, when judges move too far away from the issues embedded in the particular disputes they are called upon to resolve, <span class="underline">they run the risk of having to make judgments about information, facts, and claims that are still emerging or that are simply better accessed by other officials</span>, like elected lawmakers. n98 As one scholar notes, <span class="underline">courts are typically not well-suited to consider broad policy matters regarding societal values and decisions</span>. First, the judiciary only considers the issues presented to it. Consequently, a particular court may lack the [*206] information and access to different viewpoints that would be necessary to reach a sound interpretation. n99 <br />
<span class="underline">Finally, when courts make decisions with a wide and forward reaching scope, they face the problems associated with attempting to implement change where there may not be the political will and institutional support behind this effort. </span>n100 <br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Feere 2009 </span></span>[Jon, Legal Policy Analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, “Backgrounder: Plenary Power”, Center for Immigration Studies, February, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2009/back209.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://www.cis.org/articles/2009/back209.pdf__</a>] <br />
<br />
Foreign Powers Controlling U.S. Immigration Policy? <span class="underline">One of the arguments for the political branches’ plenary power over immigration involves a focus on foreign affairs</span>. That issue was a factor in the Zadvydas decision. Under the Constitution, it is the executive and legislative branches that direct foreign policy matters. <span class="underline">This ensures that the U.S. relations with other countries are consistent and reliable. </span>As explained by the dissenting justices in Zadvydas: “<span class="underline">judicial orders </span>requiring release of removable aliens, even on a temporary basis, <span class="underline">have the potential to undermine the obvious necessity that the Nation speak with one voice on immigration and foreign affairs matters.”90 The problem is that the majority effectively empowered foreign governments to control U.S. immigration policy</span>. The dissenting justices in Zadvydas explained: <br />
<span class="underline">“The result of the Court’s rule is that</span>, by refusing to accept repatriation of their own nationals, <span class="underline">other countries can effect the release of these individuals back into the American community. </span>If their own nationals are now at large in the United States, the nation of origin may ignore or disclaim responsibility to accept their return. The interference with sensitive foreign relations becomes even more acute where hostility or tension characterizes the relationship, for other countries can use the fact of judicially mandated release to their strategic advantage, refusing the return of their nationals to force dangerous aliens upon us.”91 <br />
Certainly, such political considerations are not on the average judge’s radar, and they shouldn’t be. Political issues are to be debated and resolved within the political branches. But the decision in Zadvydas arguably requires judges to involve the judiciary in foreign affairs. According to the dissenting justices: <br />
<span class="underline">“One of the more alarming aspects of the Court’s new venture into foreign affairs management is the suggestion that the district court can expand or contract the reasonable period of detention based on its own assessment </span>of the course of negotiations with foreign powers. The Court says it will allow the Executive to perform its duties on its own for six months; after that, foreign relations go into judicially supervised receivership.”92 <br />
<span class="underline">By not adhering to the plenary power doctrine, the Zadvydas majority effectively relocates foreign policy considerations from </span>experienced and accountable <span class="underline">political actors to </span>arguably <span class="underline">less-politically astute judges while simultaneously politicizing the judiciary</span>. <span class="underline">The decision also puts foreign governments in the driver’s seat. </span><br />

<span class="underline">Recruitment of nurses is one of Japan's most significant efforts to date </span>to loosen its immigration rules<span style="background-color: aqua;">.</span> Japan's official policy rules out foreign unskilled workers. It has so far relied on loopholes, letting workers in as special &quot;trainees&quot; or allowing those on student visas to work many hours a week. <br />
Under the new program, negotiated for three years, the workers from Indonesia can initially stay three to four years. But they would be allowed to stay indefinitely if they pass tests to receive qualifications in time -- marking a departure from current programs that send workers home after a few years. Japan expects to hire as many as 1,000 Indonesian nurses in the next two years. <br />
The move comes as<span class="underline"> Japan strives to figure out how to care for its growing population of elderly as the number of young workers who can support them is dwindling</span>. The share of people 65 and older is projected to rise to 27% of the total population in 2015 from 20% in 2005. <span class="underline">The government estimates Japan will need 400,000 to 600,000 additional care providers to cope with </span>that<span class="underline"> demographic change. </span><br />

The authors echo Dr Meleis’s conviction that <span class="underline">international migration of nurses can serve as a mechanism of empowerment for nurses </span>from developing countries,6 despite its brain drain potential. We even see it as emancipatory. <span class="underline">The possibility and reality of </span>unit or facility<span class="underline"> closure may force national governments and health care administrators to take serious measures to improve the socioeconomic status of nurses </span>from developing countries. In fact, nurses in those countries should proactively take advantage of this long-awaited opportunity to promote reforms that will improve their welfare. In this vein, the comments of the same senior officer of the CNA was enlightening: CNA supports the establishment of the CGFNS test center in China because <span class="underline">the backlash from the outflow and depletion of nurses is the only way to draw the attention of the Government </span>to improving the social welfare of Chinese nurses.7 <br />
The international migration of nurses is a double-edged sword. While it may lead to a brain drain from some developing countries, <span class="underline">it may also serve as a mechanism for ‘brain preservation’ </span>from a long-term perspective. <span class="underline">The experiences of South Korea and Taiwan may offer some lessons in this regard</span>, although the concerned human capital is international students, not nurses. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, both South Korea and Taiwan suffered a brain drain when a significant share of their international students studying in the USA failed to return on completion of their studies. However, the tide turned after the 1980s when economic and social development reached a level that created attractive opportunities and professional environments. The brain drain seemed to have turned into brain preservation and ‘brain enhancement’. <br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Pressure on</span>the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama Administration to send all three pending free trade agreements to the Hill for</span> consideration at one time <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ramped up on Monday with a new threat from 44 Senate Republicans to hold up key confirmations until they see action. </span><br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In a letter to</span> Senate Majority Leader Harry <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Reid</span> (D-Nev.), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">they said they would block consideration of nominations</span>- including a likely Commerce Secretary nominee and other trade-related nominees - <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">until the agreements</span>with South Korea, Panama and Colombia, which have been languishing for more than four years, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are considered.</span><br />
The letter was perhaps the strongest statement of consequences yet on the question of if the three agreements should be considered together. <br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">House Republicans favor the agreement but won’t consider it unless the president submits it along with two others,</span> with Colombia and Panama, about which the president has hesitated for two years and still has doubts.

Last Wednesday the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Baucus, who supports voting on the Korea, Colombia and Panama deals together, warned the administration that its position is putting all three agreements at risk. </span><br />
With so much support for the agreements in both parties, why is the administration asking for more time? The substantive issues that the president has raised - Colombia s purported indifference to labor rights, Panama s status as a tax haven - were never as serious as he contended, and are well on their way to resolution. No one even tries to deny the economic benefits to American companies and workers of the two pacts, especially the one to open the much larger Colombian market. Indeed, it would enable U.S. exports to enter Colombia duty-free, as Colombian products have entered the United States for many years. Alas, in retaliation for Republicans refusal to extend trade-adjustment assistance, House Democrats have held up extension of long-standing duty-free access to U.S. markets for Colombia and other struggling Andean nations. <br />

As the United States runs short of nurses, senators are looking abroad. A little-noticed provision in their immigration bill would throw open the gate and, some fear, drain nurses from the world's developing countries. The legislation is expected to pass this week, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">t</span><span class="underline">he Senate provision, which removes the limit on the number of nurses who can immigrate, has been largely overlooked in the emotional debate over </span>illegal <span class="underline">immigration</span>. <span class="underline">Senator Sam Brownback</span>, a Republican from Kansas who <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">sponsored the proposal</span>, said it was needed to help the United States cope with a growing nursing shortage. He said he doubted that the measure would greatly increase the small number of African nurses coming to the United States, but acknowledged that it could have an impact on the Philippines and India, which are already sending thousands of nurses to the United States each year. The exodus of nurses from poor to rich countries has strained health systems in the developing world, which are already facing severe shortages of their own. Many African countries have begun to demand compensation for the training and loss of nurses and other health professionals who move away. Some rich countries have responded. Two years ago, Britain, a huge beneficiary of nurses from Malawi, pledged to give that country more than $100 million to increase the salaries of nurses and other health workers there. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Senate provision,</span> which would remain in force until 2014, contains no such compensation. It<span class="underline"> has not stirred serious opposition in </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congress, </span>but it is not part of the House of Representatives' immigration bill. So if the full Congress approves the legislation, a committee from both houses would then have to decide whether to include the provision on nurses. <br />

Legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives (HR 5924) which addresses the shortages of certain healthcare workers and offers significant solutions. Specifically, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">all quotas would be waived for</span> Schedule A shortage occupations (registered <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nurses</span> and physical therapists) as long as the immigrant visa petition (I-140) is filed by September 30, 2011. This would give healthcare facilities approximately 3 years to bring in significantly more foreign nurses and physical therapists during that period, although consulates would be limited to approving no more than 20,000 nurse or physical therapist cases in a year. The ability of the government to handle the increased workload in a timely manner, as always, remains in doubt. The USCIS would be required to process the I-140 immigrant visa petition within 30 days, a vast improvement over the current 6-12 month processing times. Again, the ability of the government's limited resources to handle the expedited processing time remains in doubt. All nursing visas issued under this law would require a $1,500 fee, with limited exceptions, to be used to fund grants for schools of nursing. While commendable, past efforts by the government in other areas to fund the development of the American workforce at the expense of employers of foreign workers have met with little or no success. Finally, immigrant visa applicants will need to attest that they do not owe their country of residence a financial obligation that was incurred for their education so that they would remain in that country. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This legislation is sponsored by members of both political parties</span>, one of <em>whom is known as tough on immigration</em>. While we remain hopeful about the chances for success for this proposed law, a word of caution is necessary. The proposed legislation will need to survive debate and amendments in both the House and the Senate before it ever gets to the President for signature and becomes law. Election year politics and the illegal immigration/enforcement debate are also obstacles to passage of this law. In addition, HR 5882 was recently introduced in the House of Representatives which proposes to recapture unused employment-based immigrant visas from past years. This could be as many as 218,000 immigrant visas. This is significantly more than the 50,000 Schedule A immigrant visas that were recaptured by special legislation in 2005 and ran out very quickly. This proposed law would act <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to speed up the EB-3 immigrant visa quota </span>category which is where most nurses are delayed. This law<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> appears to have bipartisan support and is sponsored by leading members of Congress</span>. However, as above, the same word of caution applies. <br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Normally such an influx of immigrant workers into any labor market would foster a natural resistance from groups</span> wanting to protect their turf and/or their bargaining position. Certainly, American plumbers would not be happy if thousands of foreign plumbers were entering our country to compete with them. The same could be said of doctors, lawyers, engineers, and just about any other profession. However, with good reason<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> there is little organized resistance to international nurse migration. Chiefly responsible for this lack of resistance has been the positive affect nurse migration has had on job satisfaction for US nurses.</span> While <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">individual nurses now enjoy more bargaining power</span> than before, the lack of adequate RN staffing has made the nursing profession increasingly demanding and unsatisfying. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The fewer nurses to do the job, the lower the quality of work life for American nurses.</span> Nurses across the board are reporting high levels of stress, safety concerns, and emotional and physical exhaustion resulting from long, unsupported hours of work, often including mandatory overtime. <br />

Senate leaders have been trying to keep out all immigration measures in their version of the appropriations bill, arguing that a “clean” bill will pass much more quickly. <span style="font-size: 9pt;">Majority Leader Frist has promised that immigration measures will be taken up later this year. However, members of his own party have balked at this promise noting that virtually no immigration legislation has been passed since 9/11. Senator Larry Craig insisted on the introduction of an agricultural worker amendment that is considered to have wide support in the Senate. Another bipartisan measure that has been pushed is the increase of H-2B visas which are widely used in the hospitality industry. </span><br />
Senate leaders have apparently decided to allow at least a handful of immigration amendments to be considered.

A second lesson concerns the limits of bipartisanship. Obama and moderates in the Democratic party have learned that the relationship between Obama and the Republicans (both the leadership and the bulk of the membership) is likely to be rocky throughout his presidency. By communicating with them regularly, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama can</span> perhaps <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">prevent the relationship from descending into bitter distrust</span><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> Opportunities for genuine cooperation will arise occasionally. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama </span>and the Democratic congressional leadership <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">can foster some bipartisanship</span> at the committee level by using regular order as much as possible. 10 But the Republican leaders’ job is furthering their members’ policy and electoral goals; a majority of those members will not see supporting Obama as furthering either of those goals. Mostly Obama and the Democratic leadership will have to be satisfied with <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">picking off a few Republicans in the Senate</span>. Certainly Obama has learned not to make getting a large number of Republican votes a test of his success. Still, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama’s attempts to reach out</span> have <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">yielded considerable dividends in terms of public opinion.

Peter Hart gets at a key point. Some believe that political capital is finite, that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> political capital can be regenerated -- and, specifically, </span>that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more capital</span>. Indeed, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">that appears to be what is happening with Barack Obama</span>, who went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of the Republicans on Capitol Hill, and is being rewarded by the American public as a result. Take a look at the numbers. President Obama now has a 68 percent favorable rating in the NBC-WSJ poll, his highest ever showing in the survey. Nearly half of those surveyed (47 percent) view him very positively. Obama's Democratic Party earns a respectable 49 percent favorable rating. The Republican Party, however, is in the toilet, with its worst ever showing in the history of the NBC-WSJ poll, 26 percent favorable. On the question of blame for the partisanship in Washington, 56 percent place the onus on the Bush administration and another 41 percent place it on Congressional Republicans. Yet just 24 percent blame Congressional Democrats, and a mere 11 percent blame the Obama administration. <br />
So at this point, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">with President Obama seemingly benefiting from his ambitious actions and the Republicans sinking further and further as a result of their knee-jerked opposition</span> to that agenda, there appears to be no reason not to push forward on anything from universal healthcare to energy reform to ending the war in Iraq. <br />

<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Visa reform gets GOP on board – most popular form of immigration concession </span></span><br />

<br />
A second option is to punt on legalization and expanded enforcement altogether and to focus for now on<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> visa reform - </span>an issue on which <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is already much </span>greater<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> bipartisan agreement</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The two sides could agree to work on a bill that </span>made it easier for foreign scientists and engineers to get work visas and to transition to legal residency. That<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> would mean raising or even eliminating the current visa &quot;cap&quot;</span> for high-skill workers (from its current, widely acknowledged to be inadequate level of 65,000) and changing the rules so that foreign-born students in US schools could become legal residents more quickly. <br />
The virtue of this approach is that<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> it can be sold as a contribution to US global “competitiveness”</span> - and a blow to China - and a step toward in reviving the depressed economy. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While it means importing workers at a time of high joblessness, the workers are widely viewed as ones the country should have. </span>That probably wouldn’t be the case if the visa reform debate were extended to unskilled workers, reviving<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> the age-old polemics over the pros and cons of an economy-wide &quot;guest worker program&quot; which have torpedoed bipartisan initiatives on immigration reform in the past. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">The GOP far-right has long attacked a guest worker program as a spur to illegal immigration, while the left has viewed it as a system for indentured labor and super-exploitation, much like the infamous Bracero program of the 1950s and 1960s. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">The Washington Post recently editorialized in favor of focusing on a high-skill visa program, but significantly, said nothing about a guest worker program. The Post was merely reflecting the views of the US business community, especially the high-tech sector, as well as Senate moderates in both parties, including Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) whose support would be critical to initiating such an effort. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">In short, the vaunted &quot;deadlock&quot; on immigration that many predicted would last through 2012 may not, in fact, last that long. Neither party can afford to be viewed as &quot;obstructionist&quot; on an issue that has proven to be the nation's thorniest and most volatile -but on which the public is demanding real action. In some ways, the tables have now turned</span>: with the GOP running the House, it's finally in a position to set the agenda and to compel the Democrats to respond. And having made clear last week that the agenda is no longer one immediately guaranteed to inflame Latinos, and much of the nation - birthright citizenship - the Democrats must now prepare to parry with the GOP on workplace enforcement - and beyond. <br />
Of course, there's always the chance that the two parties may get distracted by other issues, and simply try to punt for two more years. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But as the mid-term elections revealed, the do-nothing strategy carries real risks for both parties</span> -- the Democrats especially. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Republicans</span> successfully <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">exploited immigration</span> as a “wedge” issue with white voters in key congressional districts, which helped them win the House. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But they alienated some Latinos </span>in California and the Southwest, and t<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">hat clearly helped cost them the Senate. </span>With 23 Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2012, compared to just 10 Republicans, senior Republican strategists have no intention of making that mistake again. <br />
Therefore, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the best option </span>for Democrats<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> is for the President to get out in front on immigration as quickly as possible and to forge a modest deal that can steal the GOP's thunder</span>. It won't be the whole “enchildada” - not even close. But by demonstrating that he's prepared to embrace the concerns of both parties, and indeed, stand up to his own base, in the short term,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Obama may finally &quot;win&quot; with immigration - ensuring his own re-election, averting a further rightward slide, while setting the stage for an expanded legalization program after 2012</span>. Given the current electoral math, that's probably the best the Democrats can hope for. <br />

One line of skepticism about growth arises from individuals and groups who worry that as the world’s population increases and economic growth continues, societies will use up scarce resources and, at the same time, degrade the environment. In the early 1970s, a group called the “Club of Rome” expressed such worries, fearing that eventually (and rather soon) the world would run out of energy and some commodities, so that growth couldn’t continue at anything like the existing pace. Today, there are those who believe, for similar reasons, that growth shouldn’t continue. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The doomsayers who projected that economic growth would come to a standstill were wrong. Since 1975, total world economic output has increased more than sevenfold</span>.2 On a per capita basis, world output is more than five times higher than it was thirty years ago. Growth in output, and therefore income, per person throughout the world advanced at a far more rapid pace (nearly ninefold) in the twentieth century than in any other century during the previous one thousand years (to the extent these things can be measured).3 Per capita output continues to increase because firms around the world continue to make more use of machines and information technology that enable workers to be more productive and because technology itself continues to advance, making it possible for consumers to use new products and services. There is good reason to hope that this process can and will continue, though there are some lurking dangers, including foolish actions by governments. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">should growth continue? </span>What about the supplies of energy that will be depleted in the process or the pollution that will be generated as ever more things are produced and used? Curiously,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> economists who tend to be quite rational in their lives </span>urge the worriers to have faith—faith that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">continued technological progress powered by market incentives will ease these concerns</span><span style="background-color: lime;">.</span> As it turns out, however, economists’ faith has roots in historical fact. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the early 1800s</span>, Thomas R. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Malthus </span>famously <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">predicted that the world’s population would eventually starve </span>or, at the least, live at a minimal level of subsistence because food production could not keep pace with the growth of population. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Technological advances since that time have proved him wrong. Through better farming techniques, the invention of new farming equipment, and continuing advances in agricultural science (</span>especially the recent “green revolution” led by genetic engineering), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">food production has increased much more rapidly than population, so much so that in “real terms”</span> (after adjusting for inflation), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the price of food is much lower today than it was two hundred years ago</span><span style="background-color: lime;">,</span> or for that matter, even fifty years ago. Farmers, who once accounted for more than 50 percent of the population at the dawn of the twentieth century in the United States, now comprise less than 2 percent of population— and are able to grow far more food at the same time. <br />

<br />
A new report from the Center for American Progress (CAP) thoroughly debunks the simplistic claims of nativist groups that immigration to the United States fuels the destruction of the U.S. environment by contributing to “over-population” of the country. The report, entitled From a “Green Farce” to a Green Future: Refuting False Claims About Immigrants and the Environment, points out that the “over-population” argument of the nativists is based on the false premise that more people automatically produce more pollution. However, the truth of the matter is that “more people do not necessarily equal more stress on the planet, and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">stopping the flow of immigrants to this country will not solve our environmental challenges</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” </span>In fact, the report finds that “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">immigrants </span>actually <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">live greener than most Americans and</span> they can <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">play a critical role in solving our environmental challenges.”</span><br />
In contrast to the “over-population” arithmetic of nativists, the CAP report notes that the United States produces 70 percent more greenhouse gases than the nations of the European Union (EU)-15, even though it is home to 23 percent fewer people. In other words, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the EU-15 countries manage to produce less pollution with more people </span>while maintaining a standard of living comparable to that of the United States. Moreover, within the United States,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> immigrants are more likely </span>than the native-born <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to live in “high-density” metropolitan areas where recycling, conservation, and use of public transportation are the norm. </span>That is why the U.S. cities with the largest immigrant populations—such as Los Angeles, New York, San Diego, and El Paso—are characterized by relatively low per capita carbon emissions; while the cities with the highest per capita “carbon footprints”—such as Knoxville, Oklahoma City, St. Louis, and Cincinnati—are home to relatively few immigrants. <br />
The CAP report also points out that “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">immigrants are integral to driving clean energy innovation” </span>given that so many scientists and engineers in the United States are foreign-born. This conclusion echoes the findings of a June 2010 report from the Immigration Policy Center (IPC), which notes that “America’s young scientists and engineers, especially the ones drawn to emerging industries like alternative energy, tend to speak with an accent.” In fact, according to the IPC report, “nearly 70 percent of the men and women who entered the fields of science and engineering from 1995 to 2006 were immigrants.” Not surprisingly, nativists conveniently fail to mention the pivotal role which immigrants play in developing high-tech solutions to our environmental problems. <br />
As the CAP report correctly concludes, nativists are attempting to “present Americans with a false choice between achieving fair and humane immigration reform and climate legislation that will respect the environment and lead our country to a clean and prosperous energy future.” The report calls upon environmentalists to resist this siren call and to “reject false choices and distractions from…the true causes of pollution and climate change: our dependence on fossil fuels and our unsustainable systems of energy consumption.”<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> The “over-population” argument </span>being advanced by nativists with dismal environmental records <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is </span>simply a<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> fig leaf </span>behind which they attempt<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> to conceal their anti-immigrant political agenda.</span><br />

Environmentalists and advocates of the green economy must reject false choices and distractions from the greater imperative to fight the true causes of pollution and climate change: our dependence on fossil fuels and our unsustainable systems of energy consumption. <br />
This report strikes down many of the false arguments regarding immigrants and the environment, provides a clearer picture of immigrants’ environmental contributions, and outlines real environmental solutions that can cut carbon and curb climate change. Key findings include: <br />
• The assumption that immigrant-driven population growth alone drives the U.S. carbon footprint is false. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The 10 highest carbon-emitting cities have an average immigrant population below 5 percent</span>, according to a 2008 Brookings Institution study. <br />
• <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The cities with the lowest carbon footprint, </span>on the other hand<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, have an average immigrant population of 26 percent.</span><br />
• Immigrants, especially <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">recent immigrants</span>, tend to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">lead “greener” lifestyles </span>than the native-born <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and are more likely to use public transportation and practice sustainable habits like compact living, conservation, and recycling.</span><br />

Renewable sources of energy such as the wind, sun, and waves have practically zero GHG emissions. Remarkably, only 7 percent of our current national energy portfolio comes from renewable sources, not counting hydroelectric power. A good start for the United States would be to set a national standard of 25 percent of energy produced to come from renewable sources by 2025. </span><br />
• Curb deforestation. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Tropical deforestation is responsible for more emissions </span>than all the cars, trucks, planes, and ships in the world combined. The United States—along with the rest of the world—must transition to more sustainable building materials and enact legislation that protects forests. <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Limit fossil fuels</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. We can end our addiction to oil through reasonable and costeffective policies. These include improved fuel economy standards, development of advanced bio-fuels, incentives for nonpolluting electric vehicles, and use of natural gas, which produces fewer emissions than other fossil fuels. Older coal-fired power plants can be retired with national energy efficiency and renewable energy standards, and </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we can use advanced battery storage and cleanerburning natural gas for our fail-safe power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">• Plan smart cities. Elements of </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">smart cities,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also referred to as “smart growth,” include widely available mass transit and walking-bicycle paths (to </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">curb vehicle travel</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">), compact residential and commercial development (to </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">curb overuse of open space</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">), </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and efficient use of</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> electricity and water through networked resource management, also called </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a “smart grid</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.” Nearly </span>all credible environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club, have rejected bogus arguments about immigrants and climate change. But fringe organizations continue to cloud our national discussions about immigration reform and clean energy. It’s time to set the record straight. <br />

The average nursing salary estimate ranges from approximately $35,360 33 to $46,782 annually, with salaries having generally remained flat since 1992.31 Even as nurses join more unions to fight for higher wages, 68% of hospital-based nurses remain dissatisfied with their jobs, with 75% having evidenced a decrease in the quality of care provided during the previous 2 years.11 Though registered nurses' starting wage is generally fair to competitive, unless one progresses into a position of leadership, management, or advanced practice,<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> little upward financial movement is possible.</span><br />
Given the current working conditions, many nurses from the top medical institutions in the country have told this writer that <em>even with bonuses</em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> for working overtime and extra shifts, </span><em>they are turning down extra work</em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> and money in favor of family time and rest.</span> As staffing rates become more greatly affected by the nursing shortage, how will the profession remedy the situation of poor working conditions and minimized pay? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">At a certain point perhaps registered nurses may refuse work all together because of poor conditions and patient safety issues.</span><br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Russia has,</span> of course, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">long been plagued by high levels of individual and organized crime</span>. &quot;The U.S. Embassy receives numerous criminal incident reports from private and official Americans on a routine basis.

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">One aspect of the growing violence in Russia likely to be replicated elsewhere is attacks on immigrants, who are often portrayed by racist and ultra-nationalist groups as taking jobs from native people</span> at a time of employment scarcity. &quot;<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">There has been a steady increase in racially-motivated incidents and ethnically-motivated violence throughout Russia</span>,&quot; the February OSAC report noted. &quot;Attacks on ethnic minorities by young Russian ultra-nationalists who profess a sentiment of 'Russia is for Russians' have risen for the third straight year.&quot; These concerns were heightened last December when photos of the decapitated body of a Central Asian male, presumably an immigrant from one of the former Soviet republics, were sent to human rights organizations in the country by an ultra-nationalist group that claimed responsibility for his murder and mutilation. <br />

One line of skepticism about growth arises from individuals and groups who worry that as the world’s population increases and economic growth continues, societies will use up scarce resources and, at the same time, degrade the environment. In the early 1970s, a group called the “Club of Rome” expressed such worries, fearing that eventually (and rather soon) the world would run out of energy and some commodities, so that growth couldn’t continue at anything like the existing pace. Today, there are those who believe, for similar reasons, that growth shouldn’t continue. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The doomsayers who projected that economic growth would come to a standstill were wrong. Since 1975, total world economic output has increased more than sevenfold</span>.2 On a per capita basis, world output is more than five times higher than it was thirty years ago. Growth in output, and therefore income, per person throughout the world advanced at a far more rapid pace (nearly ninefold) in the twentieth century than in any other century during the previous one thousand years (to the extent these things can be measured).3 Per capita output continues to increase because firms around the world continue to make more use of machines and information technology that enable workers to be more productive and because technology itself continues to advance, making it possible for consumers to use new products and services. There is good reason to hope that this process can and will continue, though there are some lurking dangers, including foolish actions by governments. But should growth continue? What about the supplies of energy that will be depleted in the process or the pollution that will be generated as ever more things are produced and used? Curiously, economists who tend to be quite rational in their lives urge the worriers to have faith—faith that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">continued technological progress powered by market incentives will ease these concerns</span><span style="background-color: lime;">.</span> As it turns out, however, economists’ faith has roots in historical fact. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">In the early 1800s</span>, Thomas R. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Malthus </span>famously <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">predicted that the world’s population would eventually starve </span>or, at the least, live at a minimal level of subsistence because food production could not keep pace with the growth of population. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Technological advances since that time have proved him wrong. Through better farming techniques, the invention of new farming equipment, and continuing advances in agricultural science (</span>especially the recent “green revolution” led by genetic engineering), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">food production has increased much more rapidly than population, so much so that in “real terms”</span> (after adjusting for inflation), <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the price of food is much lower today than it was two hundred years ago</span><span style="background-color: lime;">,</span> or for that matter, even fifty years ago. Farmers, who once accounted for more than 50 percent of the population at the dawn of the twentieth century in the United States, now comprise less than 2 percent of population— and are able to grow far more food at the same time. <br />

<br />
Regardless, the data clearly show that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">most natural resources are becoming more— not less—abundant with time.</span> In fact, a <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">proper understanding of resource economics suggests that this trend will actually improve greatly over time and that resource depletion is simply not a significant worry</span> if the correct legal and economic policies are maintained.

<br />
Like other economies hard hit by the global financial crisis, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unemployment is the top concern in China</span>. Rural migrant workers and university graduates are the two largest groups at risk of unemployment<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Educated unemployment has become a problem</span> since 2003 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">despite double-digit</span> economic <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">growth</span> until 2008. The problem worsens in 2009 as the economy continues to slide. Meanwhile, the scale of unemployment for migrant workers—15.3% of the total of 130 million—is unprecedented, in part because there have never been so many migrant workers in Chinese history. 1.3 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Chinese leaders believe that serious and chronic unemployment can trigger social instability. The same conviction is widely shared</span> among the media, the public and the academia. Thus, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the issue is </span>not whether the number of social protests will rise, but <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">whether it will rise to a level that the Chinese economy will suffer and the Chinese Communist Party</span> (CCP)’s <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">rule will be undermined</span>. 1.4 Over the years <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there have been talks of social protests spilling over to become political challenges</span>. Up until 2009, there is no strong empirical support for this thesis. Although China had difficult moments many times in the past three decades, social protests were largely localized and short lived, except for the 1989 Tiananmen incident. People are now waiting to see whether 2009 will be different 1.5 At least for now, there lacks clear sign that China’s social stability is in grave danger. The two major groups of losers in the job markets, migrant workers and college graduates, are unlikely to stage large-scale protests and other forms of destabilizing collective actions in urban areas, if they can fulfill basic material needs and retain the hope of a better life. While migrant workers lack organizational powers for collective action in cities, the better organized college graduates are likely to adjust their expectations than to resort to more radical means. 1.6 More importantly, the current government has found ways to convince people that it is taking quick and adequate actions to tackle the problem of unemployment and economic downturn. In a newly released policy directive from the State Department, governments at all levels are asked to bend on preserving and creating jobs in the economy, via generous fiscal packages and other policy measures to promote all forms of employment. Both migrant workers and college graduates receive special attention in policy formulation. 1.7 The CCP is therefore in a very different situation from that of 20 years ago. In the natural course of events, it is unlikely that 2009 will become another 1989, at least for the first several months. However, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unexpected events and major policy blunders may provoke a social crisis with politically destabilizing implications. It is essential that the government address the underlying social and economic problems</span> of the day <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to soothe tensions and pre-empt future crises. </span><br />

<br />
Since <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Party’s life is “above all else,” it would not be surprising if the CCP resorts to the use of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons in its attempt to extend its life</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The CCP</span>, which disregards human life, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would not hesitate to kill two hundred million Americans</span>, along with seven or <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">eight hundred million Chinese</span>, to achieve its ends. These speeches let the public see the CCP for what it really is. With evil filling its every cell the CCP intends to wage a war against humankind in its desperate attempt to cling to life. That is the main theme of the speeches. <br />
This theme is murderous and utterly evil. In China we have seen beggars who coerced people to give them money by threatening to stab themselves with knives or pierce their throats with long nails. But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we have never, until now, seen such a gangster who would use biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons to threaten the world, that all will die together with him</span>.

[Richad and Thomas Christensen, Dir of Inst of War and Peace Studies @ Columbia and assoc prof political science <em>National Interest</em>, “China, Getting the Questions right”]: <br />
<br />
Even if we accept the democratic peace theory at face value, there are several problems with applying it to China. First, as Fareed Zakaria has noted, <strong><u>the theory really applies only to liberal democracies on the Western model, ones with restraints on government action and guarantees of minority rights</u>. <u>Democratization in China could</u></strong> just as conceivably <strong><u>turn in an illiberal direction, on the model of post-Tito Yugoslavia, Iran or other unpleasant examples of violent activism</u></strong>. Second, the democratic peace theory does not apply clearly to civil war. Democracies must recognize each other as democracies for the theory to apply. They also have to view each other as legitimate, independent and sovereign states. No matter how many Americans and Taiwanese believe that Taiwan is or should be a sovereign state, this view is widely rejected on the mainland (and is not a premise of past or current U.S. policy). Third, <strong><u>while liberal democracy is pacific, the process of becoming a democracy can be violent and destabilizing. This is particularly true of democratizing states that lack developed civil societies, independent news media, healthy outlets for popular grievances, and a marketplace for ideas where countervailing views can be debated. This gives elites incentives to manipulate populist or nationalist themes</u></strong> and to adopt tough international policies as an electoral strategy. The Chinese Communist Party has behaved like many<span style="font-size: 7pt;"> authoritarian regimes, but with much more success. It has systematically prevented the rise of both an independent press and a civil society. Although the foreign press has penetrated China, domestic political publications are still strictly circumscribed by the state. As the recent crackdown on the Falun Gong demonstrates, the Party is afraid of any group that organizes for any purpose without state sanction, regardless of how apolitical it appears to be. The Chinese government's concerns about its legitimacy are not mere expressions of paranoia. The intensity of criticism of the leadership that one hears privately in places ranging from taxi cabs to government offices is astonishing. Awareness of its unpopularity gives the government in Beijing incentives to use nationalism as a replacement for the now hollow shell of communist ideology. But the Party is also aware that nationalism is not an inert tool to be pulled out of a kit and manipulated at the whim of the government. It is double-edged. Volatile and potentially uncontrollable, especially on emotional issues such as relations with Japan and Taiwan, nationalism is powerful enough to prop up a communist party in a capitalist society, but it could also severely damage the party if it were turned against the state. Officials in Beijing are aware that nationalism was a major force in the Communist Party's overthrow of the Kuomintang, as it was in the 1911-12 revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty. This is probably why, during the row with Japan over the Senkaku Islands in the summer of 1996, the Party actively prevented students and workers from marching in protest to the Japanese embassy. According to one prominent Chinese foreign affairs expert, since the May 1999 NATO bombing of the embassy in Belgrade, the authorities in Beijing have been very concerned about an increasing trend in public opinion that views the leaders as soft in responding to international humiliations, and sees them even as &quot;traitors&quot; (maiguo zei) interested only in business prospects. He and others argue that the protests outside the American embassy in Beijing were not so much instigated by the Communist Party, as many in the West assumed, but rather were managed, controlled and ultimately suppressed by the Party. One retired Chinese military officer touched on a similar theme during the 1996 Senkaku crisis. He maintained that, if the Party allowed the people to protest unhindered, the first day they would be protesting against Japan, the next day against the lack of response by the government, and on the third day against the government itself. </span>In the early phases of democratization, <strong><u>China should be ripe for jingoism. Hypernationalism could be</u></strong> exploited to mobilize popular support and to deflect criticism of the state, especially given the existence of irredentist claims, and the danger of ethnic and regional &quot;splittism&quot; on the mainland and in Taiwan. If democratization were to occur in the current context of weak institutions, political <strong><u>leaders and opposition parties would have incentives to appeal to nationalism in ways that could destabilize the region. In fact, this is a favorite, though perhaps cynical, argument offered to foreigners by communist opponents of multiparty democracy</u></strong><u>.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There are, however, plausible scenarios in which Chinese democratization might reduce international conflict. Democratization could make the mainland more imaginative with regard to the frameworks for unification offered to Taiwan, thus making meaningful cross-strait political dialogue more likely. Political liberalization might also make the prospect of eventual accommodation with the mainland more palatable to Taiwan and discourage the island's diplomatic adventurism. But that possibility is not necessarily more likely than its opposite: a renewed belief by Taiwan that the island has its own national identity, that unification with the mainland under any circumstances is unacceptable, and that democratization on the mainland is a threat to</span> Taiwanese goals. Taiwan may see a closing window of opportunity, with the hopes of gaining true independence reduced as the West's sympathy for Taiwan's opposition to unification hardens<strong><u>.</u></strong><br />

The situation between China and Taiwan is considerably more volatile, because <span class="underline">China</span> really <span class="underline">will conquer Taiwan militarily if it can see no other way of returning them to the fold. Taiwan</span>, on the other hand, <span class="underline">has invested well over $50 billion in the mainland</span>, no less than 40 percent of Taiwan’s outward investments; fully 70 percent of Taiwanese companies had investments on the mainland by 2000. In order to redress the imbalance, Taiwan recently ended a half-century ban on investment in the other direction. <span class="underline">Five to ten years into the future, this economic relationship will have become so close that Taiwan will bow to the inevitable: It will accept the status that Hong Kong now enjoys, as a semi-autonomous part of China</span>. And why not? It will be well on the way to owning the mainland already. <br />

<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Their assumptions are naïve – civilization collapse would kill nearly all ecosystems, making it impossible for what’s left to survive anyway </span></span><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rubin 2008</span></span> [Dani, “Beyond Post-Apocalyptic Eco-Anarchism”, PEJ News, January 10, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.anarchistnews.org/?q=node/2786" rel="nofollow">http://www.anarchistnews.org/?q=node/2786</a>] <br />
<br />
There is, however, a more reasonable sub-strain of eco-apocalyptic anarchism that makes a truly heartfelt argument: “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The End is coming anyway. If we hasten it, we may save species ’x’</span> that is currently on the verge of extinction. We should accept that our species is doomed. Must we take everything down with us in a long, slow death?” <br />
I find this rhetoric particularly appealing because it awakens deep personal notions of romantic heroism in me. These are noble, caring thoughts. <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Unfortunately, life just isn’t quite so simple. </span>Sure<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a quick crash might save a couple of emblematic species from extinction</span>, for a while, <em>but the near certain trade-off would be the desertification of whole continental areas of the planet, wiping out thousands of complete ecosystems.</em><br />
So, what are we to do? <br />
I think <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our best shot</span> at stopping the destruction of our biosphere and retaining a maximum number of intact eco-systems <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is powerful, irresistible gradualism</span>. Nature herself operates gradually. It is Mankind that has been impetuous. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If we work diligently and intelligently then we just might save civilization through massive cultural transformation. </span>And <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if we fail then we might at least succeed in preserving enough of the life-world </span>that those species that follow us will be able to continue the flowering of life on our planet. <br />

<br />
Clearly, the most crucial linchpins of the biologists’ model of extinction dynamics are seriously flawed. At best, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the alarmist projections of species loss are hypotheses still waiting for proof.84 At worst, they are classic cases of junk science</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The best review of the data</span>, undertaken by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">finds that “actual extinctions remain low”</span> and that close examination of known facts do not back up alarmist claims.85 <br />
In addition, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there is growing doubt within the ecological community whether ecosystems are naturally stable at all.</span>86 This has important implications. For instance, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">if ecosystems do not tend toward stabilization, then policies that are intended to promote species preservation through sustainable ecosystems are unnatural and without ecological merit</span>. Furthermore, if ecosystems are not functionally and structurally complete, then “sustainable management” of those stocks will prove suboptimal. Finally, if ecosystems do not tend toward stability, then calculations about the economic or ecological value of natural capital are impossible on a macro level. <br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future.

<br />
Teapolitik and other commentators take issue with me pointing out that even if a major environmental crisis resulted in large-scale death and destruction this would not necessarily mean the end of capitalism. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Teapolitik asserts that &quot;A ‘tiny wealthy elite’ could not possibly continue to control vast natural resources</span> in the event of collapse--when one elite can no longer hold a carrot in front of thousands of poor, those poor will revolt.&quot; [11] <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This assertion is wishful thinking for two reasons - not least that the ruling class has seldom maintained power through dangling the carrot alone. </span><br />
Firstly it presumes that the crisis will somehow creep up on the ruling class - that they will be unable to react or prepare for it. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Capitalism is very much more adaptable than this. </span>For example there has been a huge amount of research on alternative energy sources over the last few years as some capitalists anticipate making a substantial profit out of peak oil. On flicking through a recent issue of the 'Economist' magazine - which is close to being a bible for many CEO's - I noticed that 6 out of the dozen or so glossy full page ads were to do with alternatives to oil or energy saving technologies like hybrid cars. The transnational corporation BP (British Petroleum) Amoco rebranded itself Beyond Petroleum back in the year 2000. Although this was rightly seen as at attempt to Greenwash it was also to manovure itself for the new energy markets that would open up as oil declined. <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">On a more local scale the large scale destruction from Hurricane Katrina is actually being used by capitalism to restructure parts of the New Orleans economy in their interests.</span> Anarcho has written that Bush's plans for New Orleans amount to a; &quot;blank sheet upon which the far-right will unleash their plans for social engineering. Children will go to school with vouchers<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Wages will be lowered and regulations waived to accommodate the bosses. The entire area will become a free-enterprise zone.</span> A flat tax will be imposed. All under the guise of economic revival premised on the belief that corporations freed from trades unions, workers rights, environmental restrictions and taxes will reap huge profits and those profits will grow the pie for everybody&quot;(24). <br />
This is the way capitalism works - <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">crisis are opportunities for new investment for those companies in favour</span> (e.g. Halliburton in Iraq) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and excuses to impose cuts on the working class</span> (e.g. the introduction of the bin tax in Dublin<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">). Mass death and destruction have often been a central part of the development of capitalism - not a threat to it</span>. For capitalism they can be opportunities to remove 'unproductive people' from the land. (e.g. Irish famine of the 1840's). Much of the original wealth on which capitalism was founded was part and parcel of the process that almost entirely wiped out the indigenous people of the America's. Today tens of millions of people die every year from diseases that are easily preventable. <br />
There is also nothing automatic about poverty or a decline in living standards being met with mass revolt. Capitalism, and the market in particular, is also an inbuilt mechanism though which the population are encouraged to accept the hoarding of scarce resources as natural. In the west today this means the rich have access to fast cars, luxury homes and private yachts - not that much of a hardship for the rest of us. But elsewhere in the world the rich have access to these things while the poor literally starve in the streets. If there was to be a real crisis in world food production then this is what would visit the working class in the USA and beyond. To a minor extent this is what happened in depression era America and in post war Europe. In neither case did it lead to significant revolts never mind the collapse of civilisation. <br />

<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Capitalism is quite capable of surviving very destructive crisis. World War 2 saw</span> many of the major cities of Europe destroyed and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">most of the industry of central Europe flattened.</span> (By bombers, by war, by retreating Germans and then torn up and shipped east by advancing Russians). Millions of European workers died as a result both in the war years and in the years that followed. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">But capitalism not only survived, it flourished</span> as starvation allowed wages to be driven down and profits soared. What if? <br />
However it is worth doing a little mental exercise on this idea of the oil running out. If indeed there was no alternative what might happen? Would a primitivist utopia emerge even at the bitter price of 5,900 million people dying? <br />
No. The primitivists seem to forget that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we live in a class society.</span> The population of the earth is divided into a few people with vast resources and power and the rest of us. It is not a case of equal access to resources, rather of quite incredible unequal access. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Those who fell victim to the mass die off would not include Rubert Murdoch, Bill Gates or George Bush because these people have the money and power to monopolise remaining supplies</span> for themselves. <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Instead the first to die in huge number would be the population of the poorer mega cities on the planet.</span> Cairo and Alexandria in Egypt have a population of around 20 million between them. Egypt is dependent both on food imports and on the very intensive agriculture of the Nile valley and the oasis. Except for the tiny wealthy elite those 20 million urban dwellers would have nowhere to go and there is no more land to be worked. Current high yields are in part dependent on high inputs of cheap energy. <br />
The mass deaths of millions of people is not something that destroys capitalism. Indeed at periods of history it has been seen as quite natural and even desirable for the modernization of capital. The potato famine of the 1840's that reduced the population of Ireland by 30% was seen as desirable by many advocates of free trade.(16) So was the 1943/4 famine in British ruled Bengal in which four million died(17). For the capitalist class such mass deaths, particularly in colonies afford opportunities to restructure the economy in ways that would otherwise be resisted. <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The real result of an 'end of energy' crisis would see our rulers stock piling what energy sources remained and using them to power</span> the helicopter <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">gunships</span> that would be used to control those of us fortunate enough to be selected to toil for them in the biofuel fields. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The unlucky majority would just</span> be kept where they are and allowed to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">die off.</span><br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A quick collapse of global civilization will almost certainly lead to greater explosive damage to the biosphere than a mediated slower meltdown</span>. <br />
When one envisions the collapse of global society one is not discussing the demise of an ancient Greek city-state, or even the abandonment of an empire like the Mayans. <em>The end of our global civilization would not only result in the death of six billion humans, just wiping nature’s slate clean</em>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We also have something like 5,000 nuclear facilities</span> spread across the planet’s surface. And this is just one obvious and straightforward fact cutting across new radical arguments in favor of a quick fall. <br />
We have inserted ourselves into the web of life on planet Earth, into its interstitial fibers, over the last 500 years. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We are now a big part of the world’s dynamic biological equation set</span> – its checks and balances. If we get a “fever” and fall into social chaos, even just considering our non-nuclear toys laying about, the damage will be profound. It will be much more devastating than our new visionaries of post-apocalyptic paradise have prophesized. <br />
If one expands upon current examples of social chaos that we already see, like Afghanistan or Darfur, extrapolating them across the globe, encompassing Europe, Asia, North and South America, and elsewhere, then one can easily imagine desperate outcomes where nature is sacrificed wholesale in vain attempts to rescue human life. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The outcomes would be beyond “ugly”; they would be horrific and enduring. </span><br />
That is why I cannot accept this new wave of puritanical anarcho-apocalyptic theology. <em>The end-point of a quick collapse is quite likely to resemble the landscape of Mars</em>, or even perhaps the Moon. I love life. I do not want the Earth turned barren. <br />

Moreover, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">many local economies now rely upon access to imported raw materials</span>, components, and capital equipment for their own value-added activities. To improve chances to attract investment and talent in a world where capital (physical, financial, and human) is increasingly mobile, countries must maintain policies that create a stable business climate with limited administrative, logistical, and physical obstacles. <br />
The experience of India is instructive. Prior to reforms beginning in the 1990s, India's economy was virtually closed. The average tariff rate on intermediate goods in 1985 was nearly 150 percent. By 1997 the rate had been reduced to 30 percent. As trade barriers were reduced, imports of intermediate goods more than doubled. The tariff reductions caused prices to fall and Indian industry suddenly had access to components and materials it could not import previously. That access enabled Indian manufacturers to cut costs and use the savings to invest in new product lines, which was a process that played a crucial role in the overall growth of the Indian economy.16 <br />
India's approach has been common <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in the developing world</span>, where <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">most comprehensive trade reforms during the past quarter century have been undertaken unilaterally, without any external pressure</span>, because governments recognized that structural reforms were in their country's interest. According to the World Bank, between 1983 and 2003, developing countries reduced their weighted average tariffs by almost 21 percentage points (from 29.9 percent to 9.3 percent) and unilateral reforms accounted for 66 percent of those cuts.17 <br />
The Indispensible Nation <br />
The United States accounts for the highest percentage of world trade and has the world's largest economy. The WTO/GATT system is a U.S.-inspired and U.S.-shaped institution. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Recession in the United States has triggered a cascade of economic contractions around the world</span>, particularly in export-dependent economies. Needless to say, U.S. trade policy is closely and nervously observed in other countries. <br />
But despite the occasional anti-trade rhetoric of the Democratic Congress and the protectionist-sounding campaign pledges of President Obama, <em>the United States is unlikely to alter its strong commitment to the global trading system. There is simply too much at stake</em>. Like businesses in other countries, U.S. businesses have become increasingly reliant on transnational supply chains. Over 55 percent of U.S. import value in 2007 was of intermediate goods, which indicates that U.S. producers depend highly on imported materials, components, and capital equipment. And there is also the fact that 95 percent of the world's population lives outside of the United States, so an open trade policy is an example to uphold. <br />

<br />
There is, however, a more reasonable sub-strain of eco-apocalyptic anarchism that makes a truly heartfelt argument: “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The End is coming anyway. If we hasten it, we may save species ’x’</span> that is currently on the verge of extinction. We should accept that our species is doomed. Must we take everything down with us in a long, slow death?” <br />
I find this rhetoric particularly appealing because it awakens deep personal notions of romantic heroism in me. These are noble, caring thoughts. <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Unfortunately, life just isn’t quite so simple. </span>Sure<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> a quick crash might save a couple of emblematic species from extinction</span>, for a while, <em>but the near certain trade-off would be the desertification of whole continental areas of the planet, wiping out thousands of complete ecosystems.</em><br />
So, what are we to do? <br />
I think <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">our best shot</span> at stopping the destruction of our biosphere and retaining a maximum number of intact eco-systems <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is powerful, irresistible gradualism</span>. Nature herself operates gradually.

 Obamacare resolved questions of insurance-but ACCESS to health care infrastructure is the vital internal link to an effective health care system <br />
NYT 10 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(3-17, “Access, Access, Access”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/opinion/18kristof.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/opinion/18kristof.html</a>)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">First, a question: <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">When</span> in American history <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">did life expectancy improve the most</span></span>? Was it the late 1800s, when anesthesia made surgery easier and far more common? Was it the 1930s, when antibacterial medicines became available? Or recent decades, when CAT scans and heart bypasses proliferated? The correct answer is: none of the above. While data differ and the statistics aren’t fully reliable, a good bet is that <span class="underline">the best answer is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the</span> 19<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">40s</span>.</span> In that period, life expectancy increased about seven years. Indeed, American life expectancy appears to have been longer in 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 — even as hundreds of thousands of young Americans were being killed in World War II — than it had been when America was at peace in 1940. <span class="underline">A prime reason is that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">with</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">war mobilization, Americans got</span> much <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">better access to</span> medical <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">care</span></span>. Farmers and workers who had rarely seen doctors now found themselves with medical coverage through the military, jobs in industry or New Deal programs. In short, <span class="underline">great <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">health care is often less about breakthrough technologies than it is about access</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span><span class="underline">And for all the disagreements about</span> President <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Obama’s</span> health care p<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">roposal</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">,</span> let’s focus on this: <span class="underline">it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">unquestionably would increase access,</span></span> while its defeat would diminish access. <span class="underline">Most of American <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">history has seen a steady increase in access to</span> first-rate health <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">care. But we’re now seeing a reversal</span> of this long trend.</span> A new report has found that one-quarter of Californians are now uninsured. The reason for the declining access? Our politicians’ ignominious failure over the last half-century to provide universal health care, despite the efforts of Democratic and Republican presidents alike to pass it. It’s astonishing that Republicans today are lined up overwhelmingly against a health care package that is more modest and moderate than one that Richard Nixon proposed in the early ’70s. If Republicans succeed in killing Mr. Obama’s reform package, the share of Americans with medical coverage will continue to drop. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated this month that if significant reforms do not pass, the number of uninsured Americans could grow by 10 million over just the next five years. Partly <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">because of lack of access, American health statistics are notorious</span>: </span>Our children are two-and-a-half times as likely to die before the age of 5 as children in Sweden. American women are 11 times as likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth as Irish women. The average person in Honduras or Vietnam is expected to live longer than the average African-American in New Orleans. Opponents of health care reform claim that America’s health statistics are poor simply because of America’s racial diversity and large underclass. But there is one group of Americans who do fine in international comparisons — and that’s the 65-plus crowd. They have Medicare. One careful study after another has shown that uninsured people are significantly more likely to die than insured people. That’s because diseases are caught at later stages on uninsured people, and they don’t get treated so well. There’s one group that should be particularly passionate about supporting Mr. Obama’s efforts: opponents of abortions. There’s abundant cross-country evidence that the best way to hold down abortion numbers is to improve access to health care and thus prevent unwanted pregnancies. As T.R. Reid (my editor way back in the 13th century when I was a college intern at The Washington Post) noted in The Post this week: “Increasing health-care coverage is one of the most powerful tools for reducing the number of abortions — a fact proved by years of experience in other industrialized nations.” The United States has one-third more abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age than Canada, and more than twice as many as Germany, said Mr. Reid, author of an excellent recent book on health care around the world. While countries with liberal social policies typically make abortion accessible and cheap, they make other elements of health care accessible and cheap as well — such as contraception and child care. Research by the Guttmacher Institute suggests that access to contraception could be the crucial factor in reducing pregnancies and abortions. The tide of history has taken us and other Western countries toward steadily greater access to medical coverage — until recent reversals in the United States. Put aside quarrels over the mechanisms used to pass the bill, and <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">focus on the central question of Americans’ access to decent medical care.</span> On that issue, those trying to kill this health care reform proposal are simply on the wrong side of history.</span></span><br />

Kaiser Family Foundation, 2007). Most uninsured are in households headed by someone who is working (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2007). They are much more likely to postpone needed care, utilize emergency rooms as their usual source of care, and experience preventable illnesses and hospitalizations, a pattern that is replicated among poor patients regardless of insurance source (Hadley, 2003, 2007). Current insurance mechanisms for low-income individuals, such as Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP), only partially fill the gap (Bovbjerg, Hadley, Pohl, &amp; Rockmore, 2002; Hadley &amp; Holahan, 2004). A related issue that various candidates have proposed to address through health care insurance reform is the problem of underinsurance. A growing portion of the population is underinsured (Schoen, Doty, Collins, &amp; Holmgren, 2005). Although having some form of health insurance or coverage, people in this group face challenges in accessing the health care system adequately to fit their health needs because of financial impediments, preexisting condition preclusions, and other barriers. All the candidates have endorsed some mode of health care insurance reform. However, the Republican and Democratic candidates have subscribed to two differing approaches. Democratic candidates Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich, Barack <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Obama,</span></span> and Bill Richardson <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have tended to support</span> more-direct and immediate reforms that include an <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">expansion of public programs, insurance pooling, and/or employer mandates or subsidies</span>.</span> Approaches proposed by the Democratic candidates have varied from a single-payer federal plan (Kucinich) to mandated coverage through an expanded employee-sponsored insurance system and large government-subsidized risk pooling options (Clinton, Edwards, Dodd, Richardson). A key component of various candidates’ plans involves expanding the existing Medicaid and SCHIP programs (Clinton, Edwards, </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Obama). Funding for expanded coverage has generally been proposed without an increase in taxation (with the exception of Gravel and Kucinich), although a rollback of the Bush administration tax cuts, particularly for the wealthiest Americans, plays a key role in a number of the candidates’ plans (Biden, Dodd, Edwards, Obama). Market-based plans have dominated the Republican candidates’ proposals, which emphasize a privatized system with increased consumer choice. Candidates Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, John McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Ron Paul have supported limitations on regulation in order to increase competition and personal choice of health insurers and providers in the market. Tax policy approaches that involve increasing tax deductions, tax credits, and health savings accounts have also been advocated as means of making health insurance affordable for everyone, particularly in market-based plans (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2008; John McCain 2008, 2007; Mike Huckabee for President, 2007; Romney for President, Inc., 2008). Funding for the Republicans’ plans has generally been proposed to come through tax cuts, cost containment measures, and increased market competition. <span class="underline">Regardless of the mechanism</span></span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">coverage expansion has implications for the health care workforce</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> It has been projected that </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;">to provide health care in response to the increased demand created by universal coverage would require an additional 40,000 nurses</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">,</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> a number that seems an underestimate to us, and 35,000 physicians (Whelan, 2007). <span class="underline">It is vital to recognize that<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, unless the</span> physician and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nurse workforce shortages are addressed, access to health care for many Americans will be compromised, and the problem of access for the uninsured</span> and underinsured <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will</span> continue regardless of the coverage reforms that are implemented</span>—indeed, <span class="underline">it will <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">worsen</span></span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Although some nurse job seekers are finding that a tough economy means less job options, this appears to be temporary. Currently, as hospitals and other medical providers experience the same economic downturn as the rest of us, the national nursing crisis may be on a hiatus. However, as a recent Washington Post article explained, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">“</span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The economic downturn has put a Band-Aid on</span> one of the most vexing problems in health care, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a shortage of nurses</span> that has slowed care</span> at some hospitals <span class="underline">and forced others to turn away the ill.”</span> Once the economy picks up steam and rights itself, <span class="underline">it appears likely that we and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">our aging baby boom population</span></span> in particular <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will face a nursing shortage that is more severe than ever</span>.</span> Hopefully, we’ll have more citizens deciding that nursing is the field for them, especially given the demand<span class="underline">. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">One</span> other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">solution involves the reform of our immigration system so that U.S. employers can hire foreign-born nurses in a timelier manner</span>.</span> Due to increased population growth in recent decades, Prince William County and the rest of Northern Virginia have suffered acutely from this dearth of health care professionals<span class="underline">. A shortage of nurses means higher costs to patients and a lowered standard of care. Not having enough nurses also constricts economic growth, as businesses must locate in areas that can provide adequate medical staffing and other services for their employees</span>. In 2005, the Northern Virginia Health Care Workforce Alliance (NVHCWA), a coalition of private sector, business, government, community, health care and educational leaders, published a study finding that there is a current shortage of 2,763 health care workers in Northern Virginia that is expected to grow to 7,791 by 2010 and to 16,595 by 2020. <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">As the baby boomer population slides into its mid-60s</span> and the growth of the U.S. population outpaces projections, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the resources of our health care industry are becoming increasingly strained</span></span>. Federal experts forecast that <span class="underline">the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nursing shortage will grow to</span></span> 275,000 by 2010 and to <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">1 million in the following decade</span>.</span> This shortage is not solely linked to a lack of interest in nursing, but also the lack of instructors to teach the necessary skills to become a nurse. These statistics should come as no surprise. Studies discussing the baby boomer burden on nursing were published as early as 2000 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. To ease the shortage of nurses in the U.S., hospitals and nonprofit groups are turning to innovative recruitment and retention programs for nurses. Locally, Potomac Hospital in Woodbridge offers full scholarships to area nursing students who agree to work for the hospital after graduation. INOVA Fairfax Hospital sponsors a children’s summer camp to promote interest in the nursing field and has created programs to improve the overall quality of life for nurse employees. The NVHCWA works to implement programs that recruit and retain health care professionals, including promoting careers in health care to middle school-, high school- and college-age students. <span class="underline">These programs and other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">education initiatives should help cultivate more American-born nurses in the long run, but a change in immigration regulations would ease the more acute nursing shortage that has been predicted</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span><span class="underline"> Under current immigration laws, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it’s difficult for U.S. hospitals to turn to the international nursing population</span> to fill the shortage</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The most recent “relief</span>”</span> offered in response to the nursing shortage was the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Reauthorization Act of 2005. The 2005 Act <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">expires in</span></span> December 20<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">09</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> Under the Act, a nurse can only qualify for an H-1C non-immigrant visa if he or she is going to work for one of the 14 qualified sponsor hospitals, none of which are in the Northern Virginia area. <span class="underline">Other types of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">visas for nurses are extremely limited</span> as well</span>. With the expiration of the 2005 Act coming later this year, a proposal for immigration relief has yet to be considered. Additionally, the Obama administration has made it clear that health care reform is a key agenda item<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. <span class="underline">In order for health care reform to even be viable, an increased medical work force will be required</span></span><span class="underline">. So <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">relaxing the restrictive immigration rules for foreign nurses will accomplish more than one</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> goal.</span> Not only would this help to relieve the nursing shortage and provide care to those in need under our current health care system, <span class="underline">but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it would</span> </span>also </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;">set the groundwork for the much-needed reform in the health care industry</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If current market turmoil seriously damaged the performance and prospects of India and China, the current crisis could join the Great Depression in the list of economic events that changed history, even if the recessions in the West are relatively short and mild. The United States should stand ready to assist Chinese and Indian financial authorities on an emergency basis--and work very hard to help both countries escape or at least weather any economic downturn. It may test the political will of the Obama administration, but the United States must avoid a protectionist response to the economic slowdown. U.S. moves to limit market access for Chinese and Indian producers could poison relations for years<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">For</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> billions of people in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear-armed countries</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;"> to emerge from this crisis believing either that the United States was indifferent to their well-being or that it had profited from their</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">distress could damage U.S. foreign policy</span></span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">far more severely than any mistake made by George W. Bush. It's not just the great powers whose trajectories have been affected by the crash. Lesser powers like Saudi Arabia and Iran also face new constraints. The crisis has strengthened the U.S. position in the Middle East as falling oil prices reduce Iranian influence and increase the dependence of the oil sheikdoms on U.S. protection. Success in Iraq--however late, however undeserved, however limited--had already improved the Obama administration's prospects for addressing regional crises. Now, the collapse in oil prices has put the Iranian regime on the defensive. The annual inflation rate rose above 29 percent last September, up from about 17 percent in 2007, according to Iran's Bank Markazi. Economists forecast that Iran's real GDP growth will drop markedly in the coming months as stagnating oil revenues and the continued global economic downturn force the government to rein in its expansionary fiscal policy. All this has weakened Ahmadinejad at home and Iran abroad. Iranian officials must balance the relative merits of support for allies like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Syria against domestic needs, while international sanctions and other diplomatic sticks have been made more painful and Western carrots (like trade opportunities) have become more attractive. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and other oil states have become more dependent on the United States for protection against Iran, and they have fewer resources to fund religious extremism as they use diminished oil revenues to support basic domestic spending and development goals. None of this makes the Middle East an easy target for U.S. diplomacy, but thanks in part to the economic crisis, the incoming administration has the chance to try some new ideas and to enter negotiations with Iran (and Syria) from a position of enhanced strength. Every crisis is different, but there seem to be reasons why, over time, financial crises on balance reinforce rather than undermine the world position of the leading capitalist countries. Since capitalism first emerged in early modern Europe, the ability to exploit the advantages of rapid economic development has been a key factor in international competition. Countries that can encourage--or at least allow and sustain--the change, dislocation, upheaval, and pain that capitalism often involves, while providing their tumultuous market societies with appropriate regulatory and legal frameworks, grow swiftly. They produce cutting-edge technologies that translate into military and economic power. They are able to invest in education, making their workforces ever more productive. They typically develop liberal political institutions and cultural norms that value, or at least tolerate, dissent and that allow people of different political and religious viewpoints to collaborate on a vast social project of modernization--and to maintain political stability in the face of accelerating social and economic change. The vast productive capacity of leading capitalist powers gives them the ability to project influence around the world and, to some degree, to remake the world to suit their own interests and preferences. This is what the United Kingdom and the United States have done in past centuries, and what other capitalist powers like France, Germany, and Japan have done to a lesser extent. In these countries, the social forces that support the idea of a competitive market economy within an appropriately liberal legal and political framework are relatively strong. But, in many other countries where capitalism rubs people the wrong way, this is not the case. On either side of the Atlantic, for example, the Latin world is often drawn to anti-capitalist movements and rulers on both the right and the left. Russia, too, has never really taken to capitalism and liberal society--whether during the time of the czars, the commissars, or the post-cold war leaders who so signally failed to build a stable, open system of liberal democratic capitalism even as many former Warsaw Pact nations were making rapid transitions. Partly as a result of these internal cultural pressures, and partly because, in much of the world, capitalism has appeared as an unwelcome interloper, imposed by foreign forces and shaped to fit foreign rather than domestic interests and preferences, many countries are only half-heartedly capitalist. When crisis strikes, they are quick to decide that capitalism is a failure and look for alternatives. So far, such half-hearted experiments not only have failed to work; they have left the societies that have tried them in a progressively worse position, farther behind the front-runners as time goes by. Argentina has lost ground to Chile; Russian development has fallen farther behind that of the Baltic states and Central Europe. Frequently, the crisis has weakened the power of the merchants, industrialists, financiers, and professionals who want to develop a liberal capitalist society integrated into the world. Crisis can also strengthen the hand of religious extremists, populist radicals, or authoritarian traditionalists who are determined to resist liberal capitalist society for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, the companies and banks based in these societies are often less established and more vulnerable to the consequences of a financial crisis than more established firms in wealthier societies. As a result, developing countries and countries where capitalism has relatively recent and shallow roots tend to suffer greater economic and political damage when crisis strikes--as, inevitably, it does. And, consequently, financial crises often reinforce rather than challenge the global distribution of power and wealth. This may be happening yet again. None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">Bad economic times</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> can <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">breed wars</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.

Based on their analyses, many scholars and experts hold that the world political and economic unbalance is the factor that leads to war, but in the opinion of this author, Zhang Yulu, economic recession is the real fuse of modern war.

It can be said that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">economic downturn is the blasting fuse of modern war</span></span>. After the establishment of the capitalist system in Western countries, the market economy gradually replaced the natural economy to hold a dominant position.

In the postwar period, <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">US power and prestige</span></span>, beyond the nation’s military might, <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have been based </span>largely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">on American relative economic </span>size and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">success.

With the exception of the immediate post-Bretton Woods oil-shock period (1974-85), <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this </span>combination <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">produced </span>generally <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">growing prosperity at home and abroad, and underpinned the idea that there were benefits </span>to other countries <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">of following the American model</span></span> and playing by American rules. Initially this system was most influential and successful in those countries in tight military alliance with the US, such as Canada, West Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. With the collapse of Soviet communism in 1989, and the concomitant switch of important emerging economies, notably Brazil, China, India, and Mexico, to increasingly free-market capitalism, global integration on American terms through American leadership has been increasingly dominant for the last two decades. The global financial crisis of 2008-09, however, represents a challenge to that world order. <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">While </span>overt <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">financial panic has been averted</span></span>, and most economic forecasts are for recovery to begin in the US and the major emerging markets well before end of 2009 (a belief I share), <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">there remain significant risks for </span>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">US </span>and its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">leadership</span></span>. The global financial system, including but not limited to US-based entities, has not yet been sustainably reformed. In fact, financial stability will come under strain again when the current government financial guarantees and public ownership of financial firms and assets are unwound over the next couple of years. The growth rate of the US economy and the ability of the US government to finance responses to future crises, both military and economic, will be meaningfully curtailed for several years to come. Furthermore, the crisis will accelerate at least temporarily two related long-term trends eroding the viability of the current international economic arrangements. First, perhaps inevitably, the economic size and importance of China, India, Brazil, and other emerging markets (including oil-exporters like Russia) has been catching up with the US, and even more so with demographically and productivity challenged Europe and northeast Asia. Second, pressure has been building over the past fifteen years or so of these developing countries’ economic rise to give their governments more voice and weight in international economic decision-making. Again, this implies a transfer of relative voting share from the US, but an even greater one from overrepresented Western Europe. The near certainty that Brazil, China, and India, are to be less harmed in real economic terms by the current crisis than either the US or most other advanced economies will only emphasise their growing strength, and their ability to claim a role in leadership. The need for capital transfers from China and oil-exporters to fund deficits and bank recapitalisation throughout the West, not just in the US, increases these rising countries’ leverage and legitimacy in international economic discussions. One aspect of this particular crisis is that American economic policymakers, both Democratic and Republican, became increasingly infatuated with financial services and innovation beginning in the mid-1990s. This reflected a number of factors, some ideological, some institutional, and some interest group driven. The key point here is that export of financial services and promotion of financial liberalisation on the US securitised model abroad came to dominate the US international economic policy agenda, and thus that of the IMF, the OECD, and the G8 as well. This came to be embodied by American multinational commercial and investment banks, in perception and in practice. That particular version of the American economic model has been widely discredited, because of the crisis’ apparent origins in US lax regulation and over-consumption, as well as in excessive faith in American-style financial markets. Thus, <span class="TitleChar">American global economic leadership has been eroded</span> over the long-term by the rise of major emerging market economies, disrupted in the shortterm by the nature and scope of the financial crisis, and partially discredited by the excessive reliance upon and overselling of US-led financial capitalism. <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">This crisis</span></span> therefore <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">presents the possibility of the US model for economic development being displaced</span>, </span>not only deservedly tarnished, <span class="TitleChar">and the US having limited resources in the near-term to try to respond to that challeng</span>e. Additionally, the US’ traditional allies and co-capitalists in Western Europe and Northeast Asia have been at least as damaged economically by the crisis (though less damaged reputationally). Is there an alternative economic model? The preceding description would seem to confirm the rise of the Rest over the West. That would be premature. The empirical record is that economic recovery from financial crises, while painful, is doable even by the poorest countries, and in advanced countries rarely leads to significant political dislocation. Even large fiscal debt burdens can be reined in over a few years where political will and institutions allow, and the US has historically fit in that category. A few years of slower growth will be costly, but also may put the US back on a sustainable growth path in terms of savings versus consumption. Though the relative rise of the major emerging markets will be accelerated by the crisis, that acceleration will be insufficient to rapidly close the gap with the US in size, let alone in technology and well-being. None of those countries, except perhaps for China, can think in terms of rivaling the US in all the aspects of national power. These would include: a large, dynamic and open economy; favorable demographic dynamics; monetary stability and a currency with a global role; an ability to project hard power abroad; and an attractive economic model to export for wide emulation. This last point is key. <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In </span>the area of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">alternative economic models, one <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">cannot beat something with nothing</span> – communism fell not just because of </span>its <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">internal contradictions</span></span>, or the costly military build-up, <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">but because capitalism <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">presented a </span></span><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">clearly <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">superior alternative</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.

That would erode globalisation, and lead to greater conflict with</span> </span>and criticism of <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the US-led system</span></span>. While in the abstract that is a concern, most emerging markets – and notably Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa, and South Korea – are not pursuing that extreme line. The recent victory of the incumbent Congress Party in India is one indication, and the statements about openness of Brazilian President Lula is another. Mexico’s continued orientation towards NAFTA while seeking other investment flows (outside petroleum sector, admittedly) to and from abroad is a particularly brave example. Germany’s and Japan’s obvious crisis-prompted difficulties emerging from their very high export dependence, despite their being wealthy, serve as cautionary examples on the other side. So unlike in the1970s, the last time that the US economic performance and leadership were seriously compromised, we will not see leading developing economies like Brazil and India going down the import substitution or other self-destructive and uncooperative paths. If this assessment is correct, the policy challenge is to deal with relative US economic decline, but not outright hostility to the US model or displacement of the current international economic system. That is reassuring, for it leaves us in the realm of normal economic diplomacy, perhaps to be pursued more multilaterally and less high-handedly than the US has done over the past 20 years. It also suggests that adjustment of current international economic institutions is all that is required, rather than desperately defending economic globalisation itself. For all of that reassurance, however,<span class="TitleChar"> the need to get buy-in from the rising new players to the current system is more pressing on the economic front than it ever has been before</span>. Due to the crisis, the ability of the US and the other advanced industrial democracies to put up money and markets for rewards and side-payments to those new players is also more limited than it has been in the past, and will remain so for at least the next few years. The need for the US to avoid excessive domestic self-absorption is a real concern as well, given the combination of foreign policy fatigue from the Bush foreign policy agenda and economic insecurity from the financial crisis. Managing the post-crisis global economy Thus, the US faces a challenging but not truly threatening global economic situation as a result of the crisis and longer-term financial trends. Failure to act affirmatively to manage the situation, however, bears two significant and related risks: first, that China and perhaps some other rising economic powers will opportunistically divert countries in US-oriented integrated relationships to their economic sphere(s); second, that <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a leadership vacuum will arise in </span>international <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">financial affairs and </span>in <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">multilateral trade </span>efforts<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, which will</span> </span>over time<span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"> erode support for a globally integrated economy</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> Both of<span class="TitleChar"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">these </span>risks </span>if realised<span class="TitleChar"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would diminish </span>US <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">foreign policy influence, make the </span>economic <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">system less resilient in </span>response to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">future shocks</span></span> (to every country’s detriment), <span class="TitleChar">reduce economic growth and thus the rate of reduction in global poverty, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and conflict with </span>other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">foreign policy goals like </span>controlling <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">climate change</span> </span>or managing migration and demographic shifts.

<span class="TitleChar">With terrorism achieving &quot;global reach&quot; and conflict raging in Africa and the Middle East, you may have missed a startling fact - we are living in remarkably peaceable times</span>. <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">For six decades, developed nations have not fought </span>each other</span>. France and the United States may chafe, but the resulting conflict pitted french fries against &quot;freedom fries,&quot; rather than French soldiers against U.S. &quot;freedom fighters.&quot; Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac had a nasty spat over the EU, but the English aren't going to storm Calais any time soon. <span class="TitleChar">The present peace is unusual. Historically, powerful nations are the most war prone.

It is based on statistical studies that show <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">democracies typically don't fight other democracie</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">s.</span> <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Yet,</span> the same <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">studies show </span>that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">democratic nations go to war </span>about <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">as much as other nations overall</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span><span class="TitleChar">And <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">more recent research makes clear that only </span>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">affluent democracies are less likely to fight </span>each other. Poor democracies behave much like non-democracies when it comes to war</span> and lesser forms of conflict. <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A more powerful explanation is emerging from newer, </span>and older, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">empirical research - the &quot;capitalist peace</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.&quot;</span> As predicted by Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Norman Angell and others, <span class="TitleChar">nations with high levels of economic freedom not only fight each other less, they go to war less often, period.</span> Economic freedom is a measure of the depth of free market institutions or, put another way, of capitalism. <span class="TitleChar">The <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">&quot;democratic peace&quot; is a mirage created by the overlap between economic and political freedom</span></span>. <span class="TitleChar">Democracy and economic freedom typically co-exist. Thus, if economic freedom causes peace, then statistically democracy will also appear to cause peace</span>. <span class="TitleChar"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">When democracy and economic freedom are both </span>included <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">in a statistical model, </span>the results reveal that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">economic freedom is </span>considerably more potent in encouraging peace than democracy<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, 50 times more potent</span></span>, in fact, according to my own research. Economic freedom is highly statistically significant (at the one-per-cent level). Democracy does not have a measurable impact, while nations with very low levels of economic freedom are 14 times more prone to conflict than those with very high levels. But, why would free markets cause peace? <span class="TitleChar">Capitalism is not only an immense generator of prosperity; it is also a revolutionary source of economic, social and political change</span>. <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Wealth no longer arises primarily through land or control of natural resources. New Kind of Wealth Prosperity in modern societies is created by market competition and the efficient production that arises from it. This new kind of wealth is hard for nations to &quot;steal&quot; through conquest. In days of old, when the English did occasionally storm Calais, nobles dreamed of wealth and power in conquered lands, while visions of booty danced in the heads of peasant soldiers. Victory in war meant new property. In a free market economy, war destroys immense wealth for victor and loser alike. Even if capital stock is restored, efficient production requires property rights and free decisions by market participants that are difficult or impossible to co-ordinate to the victor's advantage. The Iraqi war, despite Iraq's immense oil wealth, will not be a money-maker for the United States. </span><span class="TitleChar">Economic freedom is not a guarantee of peace. Other factors, like ideology or the perceived need for self-defence, can still result in violence. But, where economic freedom has taken hold, it has made war less likely</span>.<br />

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the Nurse Retention and Quality Care Act of 2001 and to speak about the importance of nurses and the work they do. On September 11, nurses were among those who were on the front lines of the battle against terrorism. With courage, skill and determination, they were on the job, treating the injured, helping to save lives. To this day, <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nurses are defending America</span>. In clinics, hospitals and offices around the country, they are <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">working to detect and treat</span> actual or suspected cases of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">anthrax.</span> Should our Nation face</span> other <span class="underline">biological threats</span> or terrorist attacks, <span class="underline">nurses will be there for us.</span> Today's news that a woman who works in the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is in critical condition with possible inhalation anthrax is a reminder of the hazards faced by health care workers. And <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it is</span> a reminder of how i<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">mportant</span> it is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that our public health system be fully staffed with trained health care professionals</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> Sadly, <span class="underline">America is facing a nursing shortage at a time when the need for more nurses is so clear</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> Our nurses are facing an emergency of their own and they need our help<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The nursing shortage imposes increasing hardship on hospitals</span> and nurses alike, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and threatens the</span> </span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;">ability</span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of our health care system <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to</span> provide basic patient care, much less </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;">respond to health crises and terrorism</span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Not only is the number of individuals entering the nursing profession falling, but hospitals are also facing difficulty retaining the nurses already on staff. Fifty percent of nurses say they have recently considered leaving their jobs for reasons other than retirement, and approximately half a million licensed nurses are not currently practicing nursing. Many of the nurses who have considered leaving the profession cite their low level of overall job satisfaction. While we must do more to improve the number of nurses in training, we must also take steps to enhance the workplace to retain current nurses, and that is what the bill that Senator Gordon Smith and I will be introducing today would address. One way to retain nurses is to follow the example of those hospitals that have become nursing ``magnets.'' They are successful because they involve nurses in decision-making, encourage collaboration among health professionals, give nurses the opportunity to pursue continuing education and advancement, and they organize care to improve patient outcome. Our bill is designed to encourage more hospitals to follow these leads. And I am pleased that hospitals and nurses support this bill. It has been endorsed by the American Nurses Association and the American Hospitals Association. It is also a good bill for patients and their quality of care as well. Research has shown that magnet hospitals have lower mortality rates, shorter lengths of stay, higher patient satisfaction and cost- efficiency. <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">As our Nation faces increasing threats of</span> terrorist and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">biological attack, our health system must be stronger</span> than ever before. One of the best ways <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we can do this is by taking steps to reverse the nursing shortage,</span> and ensure that nurses on the front lines are well-prepared to respond to emergencies.</span> Our bill does both. First, it creates demonstration programs to encourage states to adopt magnet hospital practices, which will help attract and retain the nursing staff our hospitals need so they can cope with surges in patient volume. And, second, our bill encourages nurses to pursue continued education. That is so important today, when <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we need more health care professionals who can detect the early signs of a bioterrorist attack</span>.</span> This legislation will promote the kind of training that the New York State Nurses Association, Bellevue Hospital and New York College provide for nurses in my state. </span></span><br />

Although human pathogens are often lumped with nuclear explosives and lethal chemicals as potential weapons of mass destruction, there is an obvious, fundamentally important difference: Pathogens are alive, weapons are not. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Nuclear</span> and chemical <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">weapons do not reproduce themselves and do not independently engage in adaptive behavior; pathogens d</span>o both of these things. That deceptively simple observation has immense implications. The use of a manufactured weapon is a singular event. Most of the damage occurs immediately. The aftereffects, whatever they may be, decay rapidly over time and distance in a reasonably predictable manner. Even before a nuclear warhead is detonated, for instance, it is possible to estimate the extent of the subsequent damage and the likely level of radioactive fallout. Such predictability is an essential component for tactical military planning. The use of a pathogen, by contrast, is an extended process whose scope and timing cannot be precisely controlled. For most potential biological agents, the predominant drawback is that they would not act swiftly or decisively enough to be an effective weapon. But for a few pathogens - ones most likely to have a decisive effect and therefore the ones most likely to be contemplated for deliberately hostile use - the risk runs in the other direction<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. A lethal pathogen that could efficiently spread from one victim to another would be capable of initiating an intensifying cascade of disease that might ultimately threaten the entire world population</span>. The 1918 influenza epidemic demonstrated the potential for a global contagion of this sort but not necessarily its outer limit. Nobody really knows how serious a possibility this might be, since there is no way to measure it reliably.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">How should the U.S. determine its response to a CBW attack? Guided by political objectives inherent in a clearly articulated reprisal policy, the crisis response analysis can proceed by examining four key variables: context (i.e., wartime or peacetime), adversary class, number and type of casualties, and whether we can identify the perpetrators. These four variables form the genesis of an analytic framework which can enable policymakers and planners to begin developing reprisal strategies. Context </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The U.S. response to a “bolt-out-of-the-blue“ CBW attack is likely to be far different than if U.S. forces were attacked</span> during a conflict</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or period of hostilities. During hostilities, the mindset of U.S. leaders and the public is at a higher state of alert. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If casualties in a conflict have already occurred</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">from conventional means </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">prior to a CBW attack, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the leadership and</span> the public may be somewhat inured and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may not react as strongly they would in a peacetime scenario</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Moreover, during hostilities, U.S. forces are likely to be utilizing CBW defense equipment, such as masks and detection equipment, which could serve to minimize the adverse impacts of a CBW attack. In fact, depending on the nature and scope of the attack, U.S. forces could “take it in stride”, with little if any change in operational plans. In this case, a specific reprisal action may not be necessary. The international legal standards for retaliation during peacetime are much higher. Richard Erickson, author of Legitimate Use of Military Force Against State-Sponsored International Terrorism, makes the point that reprisal has a “very low level of acceptability” in international law. He says, “The general view is that articles 2(3) and 2(4) of the UN Charter have outlawed peacetime reprisals….When states have relied upon it, the UN Security Council has condemned their action soundly.“45 Thus, reprisals in peacetime will have to pass a more strict set of criteria. Adversary Class The second variable to consider in reprisal calculations is adversary class. Is the perpetrator a state or non-state actor? Whereas international law gives clear guidance as to how states may legally respond to attacks from other states, the law is murky when dealing with non-state actors; hence, any proposed U.S. retaliatory action must take this difference into account. For example, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">despite the evidence and strong justification for its actions against the Afghanista</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">n and Sudan terrorist facilities, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U.S. was subject to much condemnation from the international community</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, not to mention internal criticism<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">U.S. reprisal attacks against non-state actors are likely to require much more evidence and justification compared to similar actions against state actors</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. There are many kinds of military actions which can be taken against a state actor, whereas the kinds of actions which can be taken against non-state actors may be limited. The nature of the reprisal, therefore, will be heavily influenced by the type of actor involved. Number and Type of Casualties </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The number of American casualties suffered due to a WMD attack may</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> very well </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">be the most important variable i</span></em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">n determining the nature of the U.S. reprisal</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A key question here is, how many Americans would have to be killed in order to prompt a massive response</span> by the U.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">S? The bombing of U.S. Marines in Lebanon, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 each resulted in a casualty count of roughly the same order of magnitude (about 200-300 deaths.) Although these events caused anger and a desire for retaliation among the American public, there was no serious call for massive or nuclear retaliation. The body count from a single biological attack could easily be one or two orders of magnitude higher than these events. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Using the rule of proportionality as a guide, it is debatable whether the U.S. would use massive force in responding to an event which resulted in only a few thousand deaths</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> However, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">what if the casualty count was around 300,00</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">0</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">? Such an unimaginable result from a single CBW incident is not beyond the realm of possibility. “According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">100 kg of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">anthrax</span> spores delivered by an efficient aerosol genera</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tor on a large urban target </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would be</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> between </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">two</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">six times </span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">as lethal as a</span> one megaton thermo-<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nuclear bomb</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.“46 Would the deaths of 300,000 Americans be enough to trigger a nuclear response? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In this case, proportionality does not rule out the use of nuclear weapons</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />

“The rapidity of the spread of influenza throughout a country is only limited by the rapidity of the means of transportation,” explained the 1918 New York State Health Commissioner.572 Back then, the fastest way to cross the world was by steamship.573 In the past, a trip around the world took a year; today we and our viruses can circle the globe in 24 hours.574 The number of human globe-trotters now exceeds one billion people a year.575 AIDS left Africa on an aircraft.

What makes the threat of H5N1 different from the presumed threat of swine flu in 1976?

 <span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">None of your generic impact D applies to Bird Flu – it’s biologically prone to mutate towards human-to-human transmission</span></span><br />

A number of recent reports highlight the importance of mutations in A<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">(<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">H5N1</span></span>) avian influenza viruses, indicating that these <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">genetic variations may increase the possibility of a new pandemic</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Influenza viruses are inherently unstable</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">due to their segmented RNA genome and the lack of a genetic proofreading mechanism that allows undetected errors that occur during replication</span></span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Since</span></span> the first documentation of human infection with the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus in 19<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">97</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the virus has undergone several changes</span>. These changes have influenced the patterns of virus transmission and have spread amongst domestic and wild birds. Human infections are still considered a relatively uncommon event as the virus does not spread easily from birds to humans or from human to human. Trustworthy prediction of the evolution of influenza viruses cannot be made, as it is almost impossible to identify whether or when the A(H5N1) virus might obtain the characteristics needed to spread among humans and there is also a lack of knowledge as to which specific mutations will allow human-to-human transmission of the virus [4].<br />
Fortunately, the A(H5N1) viruses have not yet demonstrated the capacity for efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission, although limited transmission is believed to be the cause of some family clusters of cases [5]. Since those sporadic family clusters of A(H5N1) cases may be the first suggestion of a viral or epidemiologic change, they are being thoroughly investigated in order to determine any direct human-to-human transmission of the virus [6]. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Such clusters involving highly probable human-to-human transmission have been documented</span> in Egypt, China, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Pakistan [7,8]. Studies have also shown a higher prevalence of A(H5N1) antibodies among healthcare workers exposed to A(H5N1) patients in comparison with the prevalence among non-exposed healthcare workers. These findings constitute the epidemiological evidence that A(H5N1) viruses were indeed transmitted from patients to healthcare workers, who then possibly had an asymptomatic infection [9]. Such unconfirmed cases have a potentially huge impact on the case fatality ratio and could indicate that the A(H5N1) virus is probably less lethal than currently assumed.<br />
Furthermore, it was recently observed that undetected A(H5N1) cases may be occurring in Egypt, given the unusual age-specific and sex-specific case incidence and fatality rates, which can be partly attributed to the existence of undetected fatal or non-fatal atypical or asymptomatic human A(H5N1) infections [8]. Asymptomatic human infections with A(H5N1) have been also reported from China, Vietnam, Japan, Thailand, and Korea although limited investigations suggest that the frequency of asymptomatic or clinically mild A(H5N1) virus infection have been rare since 2003 [10]. Most human cases have demonstrated the increased pathogenicity of the A(H5N1) strains.<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Tumpey and colleagues, who reconstructed the A(H1N1) virus of 1918, have identified a number of common points between the viruses of Spanish and the avian A(H5N1) influenza</span>. It was concluded that it is especially the polymerase, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes that caused the extreme virulence and that the sequences of the polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, and PB2) of the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">1918 virus differ by only 10 amino acids from the avian influenza viruses</span></span> [4]. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Human forms of seven out of the 10 amino acids have already been identified in currently circulating influenza A(H5N1) viruses. It is likely that also the other mutations will eventually emerge and make the A(H5N1) virus better suited for human-to-human transmission</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. </span><br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Another important factor is the change of the HA protein to a binding preference for alpha</span></span> 2,6 sialic <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">acid,</span> which is the major form in the human respiratory tract. In avian viruses the HA protein preferentially binds to alpha 2,3 sialic acid, which is the major form in the avian enteric tract. It has been shown that only a single amino acid change can result in the change of this binding preference. Altogether it seems that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">only a few mutations are needed to make the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus a pandemic virus, with possible mortality rates resembling the rates of the Spanish flu, which killed over 40 million people worldwide.</span></span> Taubenberger et al. have recently showed that the 1918 virus was initially an avian virus, like the A(H5N1) [11].<br />

One stakeholder provided the CIS Ombudsman with an example of patient safety concerns that can result from an inadequate nursing staff. A hospital located in a remote area received a call during the evening shift that 11 new patients were being assigned to the unit. However, the hospital only had one RN on duty in the unit at that time. The incident was immediately reported as a code violation. The stakeholder noted that the number of such incidents is increasing and the “nurse/patient ratios in many hospitals are no longer safe.”18 <br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The shortage also makes it difficult for facilities to expand services or prepare for an emergency response</span>.</span>19 One hospital representative reported to the CIS Ombudsman that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">hospitals have been forced to close beds and wings to their hospitals due to the shortage.</span></span>20 In a public teleconference held by the CIS Ombudsman on May 30, 2008, a nurse recruiter commented that every time the vacancy rate for RNs goes up one percent, a hospital may lose as much as $300,000.21<br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Despite the availability of antiviral medications and intensive care units, mortality rates for the 385 humans infected with avian influenza remain</span></span> high. Virtually all of the victims have been from developing countries, with the case fatality rate in children younger than 15 years of age reaching almost 90 percent.

Whatever the age or locale, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">patients stricken with avian influenza would most likely require intensive nursing care</span></span>. Yet, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">despite the critical role that nurses play in patient outcomes</span></span>, by 2025, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the United States is estimated to have a shortage</span></span> of as many as 500,000 registered nurses, or RNs--the best trained and educated nurses who often supervise licensed practical nurses and nurses' aides. Already, 14 percent of U.S. hospitals report a severe nursing shortage with more than 20 percent of their positions vacant.<br />
Worse yet, given the country's aging population, the need for nurses is only increasing; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates that more than 587,000 new nursing positions PDF will be created by 2016.<br />

The shortage is of concern in the Denver area as four new hospitals are scheduled to open in the next two years.

In 2000, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services identified Colorado as one of 30 states with a nursing shortage.

For most nurses, it is the date of filing of the immigrant petition. The U.S. Department of State (DOS) oversees the release of immigrant visa numbers throughout the fiscal year, which runs from October 1 through September 30, as the 140,000 visas cannot be assigned all at once. The total of 140,000 visas are managed according to five employment-based categories, with the bulk of petitions, including petitions for nurses, classified in what is called the employment-based third preference (EB3). Immigrant visa numbers are available when the priority dates become “current,” with older priority dates in the queue receiving immigrant visa numbers before more recent priority dates. The DOS publishes a “Visa Bulletin” every month to inform the public of the current priority dates.26 This visa bulletin regulates access to the final stage of the permanent residence process, and to a green card itself. Today, nurses whose priority dates are on September 1, 2002 or earlier have an immigrant visa number available to them. <span class="underline">This means that those <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nurses who were sponsored for permanent residence</span></span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;"> more than five years ago</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">may now file an application to adjust status</span> if they reside in the U.S. or may apply for an immigrant visa at a U.S. Consulate abroad</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span><br />

Once the visa number becomes available, then the foreign nurse must either apply for a visa at the US consulate or embassy in his or her home country. If the nurse currently is in the US on a different type of visa, he or she then must apply for a change of immigrant status. Either one of these processes may take months more to process. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Waiting 7 or more years for a foreign nurse's immigration process to be fully completed is not helping any hospital with its nursing staff shortage</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s.

Under US immigration law, only an act of Congress amending the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) or an executive order issued by the President can create this new category for immigrant visas. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">Additionally, the federal government could</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> take action to </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">increase the number of immigrant</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> and nonimmigrant <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">visas available to nurses</span>.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This number is set each year by Congress. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Currently, there only are 140,000 eligible visas for all five of the EB categories. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">By increasing the number of available visas and providing nurses with a special priority category for attaining a visa number, the federal government can take significant steps towards addressing the nursing shortage</span>. Meaningful health care reform cannot occur without tackling the nursing shortage.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> No matter what shape the US health care system takes in the future, there will always be a need for well-trained nurses. </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Without them, hospital care cannot be expected to improve</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Considering the ongoing needs of healthcare employers for nurses, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">most bridge legislation would only address the shortage temporarily; the shortage would recur once “recaptured” immigrant visas are allocated to</span> international nurses, most likely <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">within 18 months</span></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> or less. It seems improbable that U.S. nursing schools could increase enrollment to the levels necessary to meet the nursing demand by 2009. <span class="underline">Therefore, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a longer-term solution is necessary.</span> A nonimmigrant visa category for nurses would allow healthcare employers to employ nurses more immediately</span> and sponsor them for permanent residence <span class="underline">to increase the number of available nurses in the U.</span>S. Alternatively<span class="underline">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">excepting nurses from the</span> 140,000 annual <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">quota would remove the years-long delay</span> of waiting for the employment authorization of nurses entering the U.S<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. as permanent residents</span>.</span> Even better, the combination of these approaches would boost the number of employable international nurses on an ongoing basis; <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this would allow U.S. nursing schools the time necessary to expand enrollment by recruiting more professors</span> both to replace those expected to retire in the next ten years and to expand faculty size</span> more generally.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A less favorable option would be to create a new immigrant visa classification only for Schedule A occupations. This would be similar in effect to the recapture legislation in 2005-2006. The main drawback would be that nurses would nevertheless be subject to the 140,000 annual quota and therefore the benefits to nurses would come at the cost of other critical employmentbased immigration. Similarly, </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">e<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">xcepting the dependents</span> of nurses from counting toward the yearly 140,000 numerical limitation might make more visas annually available, but this approach <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">would not redress the delay faced by nurses awaiting immigrant visas in the general EB3 pool</span></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">.</span><br />

Since the inception of modern academic debate, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">much of the praise it has received for educating students has focused on the real-world skills acquired in the processes of research, argumentation, critical thinking,</span> and policy analysis. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Students develop these skills and apply them to jobs, politics, fields of study, and their personal lives. Indeed, in every decision,</span> trivial (‘Where should I eat dinner?’), and non-trivial (‘What college should I attend?’ ‘Who should I marry?’), <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we evaluate all of the relevant advantages and disadvantages, consider possible alternatives, and come to some conclusion</span>. Apologists for policy debate often champion <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the increased critical thinking skills taught by the activity that are necessarily used to work through these kinds of choice</span>s, particularly under rigid time and speech constraints. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If this is truly the desired goal of policy debate</span>, one would think that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the way in which debates are framed, discussed, and adjudicated should closely resemble the process of deliberation that everyone</span>, from the highest government officials to the most inconsequential members of society, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">uses. Aristotle</span> (c. 330bce/1941a) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">argues</span> that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">this decision-making process combines desire and reasoning in the act of deliberation focused on some end. The ability to make good decisions</span> (and to follow through with them) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">is associated with the virtue of practical wisdom</span>: Practical wisdom… is concerned with things human and things about which it is possible to deliberate; for we say this is above all the work of the person of practical wisdom, to deliberate well, but no one deliberates about things invariable, nor about things which have not an end, and that a good that can be brought about by action. The person who is without qualification good at deliberating is the person who is capable of aiming in accordance with calculation at the best for humanity of things attainable by action. Nor is practical wisdom concerned with universals only—it must also recognize the particulars; for it is practical, and practice is concerned with particulars. (#1141b 6-16). This underlies our contention that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">practical wisdom is the final cause of debate</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Practical wisdom is broad, provides coherence and unity in a non-arbitrary way, and is value-neutral</span> with respect to the growing divide between the policy-focused and the critically-inclined. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Non-practical ends are not</span> helpful – as Aristotle (c. 330bce/1941a) argues: The origin of action—its efficient, not its final cause—is choice, and that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end… Intellect itself, however, moves nothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical; for this rules the productive intellect as well, since everyone who makes makes for an end, and that which is made is not an end in the unqualified sense. (#1139a32 – 37).<br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">That means you should evaluate theory debates with the objective of maximizing logical decision making and practical wisdom </span></span><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Strait and Wallace 08</span></span> (Paul, assistant coach at USC working on his PHD at USC, Brett, Working on his MA at The George Washington University, “ACADEMIC DEBATE AS A DECISION-MAKING GAME: INCULCATING THE VIRTUE OF PRACTICAL WISDOM”, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate)<br />
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If we accept that academic debate ought to foster practical wisdom among its participants</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">debate theory itself must reflect this. It is precisely because it is rooted in real-world practice that debate has value</span>. Kuhn (1992) explains this by stating that “no other kind of thinking matters more-or contributes more-to the quality and fulfillment of people's lives, both individually and collectively” (p. 156). Thus, we argue that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the principles of good decision-making must be present in debate arguments</span>. This means, first and foremost, that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">all decisions posed by debate theory must account for the decision-maker. In the real world, decision-makers can choose only from the options open to them, not from all possible options they can imagine</span>. Aristotle (c. 330bce/1941b) argues: “Concerning things which exist or will exist inevitably, or which cannot possibly exist or take place, no counsel can be given… Clearly, counsel can only be given on matters about which people deliberate; matters, namely, that ultimately depend upon ourselves, and which we have it in our power to set going” (1359a32-39). <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">While decision-making would be much easier from the position of a universal, omnipotent decision maker, real decision-making situations are contingent on the decisions made by others, decisions which cannot be counted on to change. Recognition of this is a marker of emotional and cognitive maturity, a sign that one is ready to make adult decisions</span>. Although people might occasionally think about problems from the position of an ideal decision-maker (c.f. Ulrich, 1981, quoted in Korcok, 2002<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">), in debate we should be concerned with the type of argumentative thinking that is the most relevant to real-world intelligence and the decisions that people make every day in their lives, not academic trivialities</span>. We demonstrate how this argument resolves problems in debate theory by examining three genres of negative arguments: disadvantages, counterplans, and critiques.<br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">(</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Frank, The Bounderies of Government Fiat Debaters Research Journal <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Mitchell1981Education.htm" rel="nofollow">http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Mitchell1981Education.htm</a>) </span><br />
<u>The key to understanding current fiat theory is the notion that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">debate should reflect real world decision-making.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Certainly</span>, <u>much of debate argumentation reflects real world concern</u>s. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">For example, debaters consider actual socioeconomic issues in a discussion of their pertinent risks and benefits. Presumably</span><u>, if one of debate's tasks is to train debaters in decision making, the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">debate process should reflect aspects of real-world decision-making</span></span></u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The acceptance of this assumption also suggests</span> <u>that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">debate should reflect real world limits on governmental action</span></span>. Because current governmental structures are limited by legal authority, any social problem will have a different set of solutions depending upon the agent that addresses the problem</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For instance</span>, <u>when responding to a Constitutional question, the Supreme Court can interpret the constitutionality of a law, but cannot enact a law as Congress does</u>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">An individual citizen, reacting to high gas prices, can form a car pool, but cannot enact national</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> legislation. Thus</span> <em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">no one agent, because of limits imposed by law and the political environment, can be all-powerful</span></em>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Application of this analogy</span></span> <u>to debate <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">provides a theoretical basis for limiting fiat power and authority</span></span></u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">First</span>, <u>this notion contests the current assumption allowing negative teams the power to fiat through different governmental levels</u>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">However</span><u>, such a power has no real world counterpart. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">For a judge to be a state legislator, a federal, and a local one all at the same time goes far beyond the power of a real world legislator</span></span></u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Second, the</span> <u>notion of an all-powerful agent often assumes institutional organizations and relationships that do not exist in the real world.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For instance, a characteristic of policy action at the state level is that it is non-uniform</span>. <u>Fiat at this level becomes very &quot;non-real</u>.&quot; <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the real world</span> <u>the relative desirability of policy options is</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in part</span>, <u>a function of ease of implementation and</u> perhaps <u>this consideration should be reflected in debate. Thus the judge as an agent should act within real world limits upon policy enactment.</u> <u>The basis for this limitation on fiat can be found in an examination of the resolution</u>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">In determining the role of the judge</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">, the resolution sets down the legal jurisdictional limits for considering change</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For example, a resolution asking for federal action limits the role of the judge to that of a federal policymaker. In this instance a negative arguing for adoption of a state counterplan will go beyond the jurisdictional limits of the topic</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The assumption that debate is a game provides an additional justification for fiat limitation</span></span>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">As a game of competition with the judge's decision determining the winners</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">debate should be governed by rules that ensure a fair game</span></span><u>. By its very nature, the resolution limits the affirmative to the implementation of policy through one governmental level</u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">However</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">with unlimited fiat the negative has the power to enact policies through several different agents</span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-size: 8pt;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">Hence, the negative has retained a strategic advantage of flexibility. In sum, this section has established several theoretical criteria with which the power of legislative fiat can be limited. Acceptance of the above assumptions means that</span> <u>debaters must be constrained by the jurisdictional limits of the resolution.</u><br />
<br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Second These counterplans are topic destroyers people backed away form the legal protections topic because they where afraid the overturning of Arizonas law by the court would lose to the amendment counterplan. The Courts Topic was destroyed by them. We can never have a debate over domestic items like education reform or labor reform because things like the state counterplan obliterate those discussions entirely and move the discussion into process </span></span><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Infinitely regressive – the number of potential negative counterplans is limitless. </span></span><br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Solt, 89</span></span> (Resolving the Ambiguities of Should JAFA, 25, p. 122)<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">There is</span></span> clearly, however, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">no such consensus where negative fiat is concerned</span></span>. <span style="font-size: 7pt;">With the rise to prominence of the counterplan as a negative strategy, it is negative rather than affirmative fiat which is increasingly contentious. While affirmative fiat is a necessary consequence of the resolution's wording, negative fiat is definitely more problematic. If affirmative fiat involves imagining that the affirmative plan were adopted, negative fiat is the act of imagining alternatives to the affirmative</span>. W<u>hile the resolution usually places some constraints relating to realism on the affirmative, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the non-resolution places no such constraints on the negative</span></span>. Consequently, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the potential (and actual) abuses of negative fiat could fill a forensic wax museum</span></span></u><br />

Finally, the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">success of President <span style="background-color: yellow;">Obama’s health care package</span></span> also <em><span style="background-color: yellow;">has direct foreign policy implications</span>.</em> Global leaders want the Administration to pay attention to a series of critical international issues, from the Middle East peace process to the future of arms control, from policy toward Russia and China to climate change. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The sharp increase in positive views of U.S. leadership</span> -- the “Obama bounce,” well documented in GMF’s most recent Transatlantic Trends survey -- <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has shown signs of erosion</span> in recent months, especially among European elites. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Ongoing economic challenges and domestic political battles</span></span>, including the heath care agenda, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">have limited the president’s attention to foreign policy</span>. And when international issues have taken center stage, Europe has not been the priority concern.<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">With an important domestic policy achievement, the administration is now in a position to devote greater attention to</span></span> -- and spend more political capital on -- <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">strategic <span style="background-color: yellow;">challenges</span> and strategic alliances.</span> This should include more visible engagement with partners on issues of key importance to Europe and transatlantic relations: Iran, nuclear arms control, peace process diplomacy, and the stabilization of global finance. Having opted against a visit to Europe for an EU-U.S. summit at a time of domestic political distractions, the November 2010 NATO summit in Lisbon will be a critical opportunity for high-level dialogue… just after the crucial mid-term elections in which the health care issue is sure to figure prominently.<br />

As the United States runs short of nurses, senators are looking abroad. A little-noticed provision in their immigration bill would throw open the gate and, some fear, drain nurses from the world's developing countries. <span class="underline">The legislation is expected to pass this week, and <span style="background-color: yellow;">the Senate provision, which removes the limit on the number of nurses who can immigrate, has been largely overlooked in the</span> emotional <span style="background-color: yellow;">debate over</span> </span>illegal <span class="underline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">immigration</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> <span class="underline">Senator Sam <span style="background-color: yellow;">Brownback</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> a Republican from Kansas who <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">sponsored the proposal</span></span><span style="background-color: yellow;">,</span> said it was needed to help the United States cope with a growing nursing shortage. He said he doubted that the measure would greatly increase the small number of African nurses coming to the United States, but acknowledged that it could have an impact on the Philippines and India, which are already sending thousands of nurses to the United States each year.<br />
The exodus of nurses from poor to rich countries has strained health systems in the developing world, which are already facing severe shortages of their own. Many African countries have begun to demand compensation for the training and loss of nurses and other health professionals who move away.<br />
Some rich countries have responded. Two years ago, Britain, a huge beneficiary of nurses from Malawi, pledged to give that country more than $100 million to increase the salaries of nurses and other health workers there.<br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">The Senate provision</span>,</span> which would remain in force until 2014, contains no such compensation. It<span class="underline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">has not stirred serious opposition in </span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Congres</span>s, but it is not part of the House of Representatives' immigration bill.</span> So if the full Congress approves the legislation, a committee from both houses would then have to decide whether to include the provision on nurses.<br />

Senate leaders have been trying to keep out all immigration measures in their version of the appropriations bill, arguing that a “clean” bill will pass much more quickly<span style="background-color: aqua;">.</span> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">Majority Leader Frist has promised that immigration measures will be taken up later this year. However, members of his own party have balked at this promise noting that virtually no immigration legislation has been passed since 9/11. Senator Larry Craig insisted on the introduction of an agricultural worker amendment that is considered to have wide support in the Senate. Another bipartisan measure that has been pushed is the increase of H-2B visas which are widely used in the hospitality industry. </span><br />
<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Senate leaders have </span>apparently<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> decided to allow at least a handful of immigration amendments to be considered. What is not yet known is whether <span style="background-color: yellow;">an amendment to be introduced by</span> Senators Kay Bailey <span style="background-color: yellow;">Hutchison (</span>R-TX) <span style="background-color: yellow;">and</span> Charles <span style="background-color: yellow;">Schumer</span> (D-NY) that <span style="background-color: yellow;">would implement the nurse specific EB-3 borrowing proposal will be considered.</span></span><br />
After the Senate passes its version of the spending bill, members of both Houses will meet in a conference committee to reconcile the differing language in the two Houses versions of the spending bill. The nursing fix is seen as having broad bipartisan support and proponents of the plan believe that if the measure is permitted to be considered, it will be included in the final version of the bill sent to President Bush.<br />

For example, the average age of nurses in California is 47. The California Institute for Nursing and Health Care estimates that the state will need 108,000 new nurses by 2020 to fill the vacancies left by retiring nurses and to fill the new positions opened up to meet the increased demands for health care. Nationally, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that <span class="underline"><u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">1 million new and replacement nurses will be needed by 2016 to meet staffing needs.</span> Individual <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">states have</span></strong></u></span> ramped up their efforts to tackle their individual nursing shortages by <span class="underline"><u><strong>offering <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">more grants and scholarships to nursing</span> s<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">tudents</span> and trying to increase enrollments at nursing schools</strong></u></span>.

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="StyleStyleBold"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> First, a question: <span class="underline"><u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">When</span> in American history <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">did life expectancy improve the most</span></strong></u></span>? Was it the late 1800s, when anesthesia made surgery easier and far more common? Was it the 1930s, when antibacterial medicines became available? Or recent decades, when CAT scans and heart bypasses proliferated? The correct answer is: none of the above. While data differ and the statistics aren’t fully reliable, a good bet is that <span class="underline"><u><strong>the best answer is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the</span> 19<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">40s</span>.</strong></u></span> In that period, life expectancy increased about seven years. Indeed, American life expectancy appears to have been longer in 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945 — even as hundreds of thousands of young Americans were being killed in World War II — than it had been when America was at peace in 1940. <u><strong>A prime reason is that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">with</span> the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">war mobilization, Americans got</span> much <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">better access to</span> medical <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">care</span></strong></u>. Farmers and workers who had rarely seen doctors now found themselves with medical coverage through the military, jobs in industry or New Deal programs. In short, <span class="underline"><u><strong>great <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">health care is often less about breakthrough technologies than it is about access</span></strong></u></span>. <u><strong>And for all the disagreements about</strong></u> President <span class="underline"><u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Obama’s</span> health care p<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">roposal</span></strong></u></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">,</span> let’s focus on this: <span class="underline"><u><strong>it <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">unquestionably would increase access,</span></strong></u></span> while its defeat would diminish access. <u><strong>Most of American <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">history has seen a steady increase in access to</span> first-rate health <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">care. But we’re now seeing a reversal</span> of this long trend.</strong></u> A new report has found that one-quarter of Californians are now uninsured. The reason for the declining access? Our politicians’ ignominious failure over the last half-century to provide universal health care, despite the efforts of Democratic and Republican presidents alike to pass it. It’s astonishing that Republicans today are lined up overwhelmingly against a health care package that is more modest and moderate than one that Richard Nixon proposed in the early ’70s. If Republicans succeed in killing Mr. Obama’s reform package, the share of Americans with medical coverage will continue to drop. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated this month that if significant reforms do not pass, the number of uninsured Americans could grow by 10 million over just the next five years. Partly <span class="underline"><u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">because of lack of access, American health statistics are notorious</span>:</strong></u> </span>Our children are two-and-a-half times as likely to die before the age of 5 as children in Sweden. American women are 11 times as likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth as Irish women. The average person in Honduras or Vietnam is expected to live longer than the average African-American in New Orleans. Opponents of health care reform claim that America’s health statistics are poor simply because of America’s racial diversity and large underclass. But there is one group of Americans who do fine in international comparisons — and that’s the 65-plus crowd. They have Medicare. One careful study after another has shown that uninsured people are significantly more likely to die than insured people. That’s because diseases are caught at later stages on uninsured people, and they don’t get treated so well. There’s one group that should be particularly passionate about supporting Mr. Obama’s efforts: opponents of abortions. There’s abundant cross-country evidence that the best way to hold down abortion numbers is to improve access to health care and thus prevent unwanted pregnancies. As T.R. Reid (my editor way back in the 13th century when I was a college intern at The Washington Post) noted in The Post this week: “Increasing health-care coverage is one of the most powerful tools for reducing the number of abortions — a fact proved by years of experience in other industrialized nations.” The United States has one-third more abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age than Canada, and more than twice as many as Germany, said Mr. Reid, author of an excellent recent book on health care around the world. While countries with liberal social policies typically make abortion accessible and cheap, they make other elements of health care accessible and cheap as well — such as contraception and child care. Research by the Guttmacher Institute suggests that access to contraception could be the crucial factor in reducing pregnancies and abortions. The tide of history has taken us and other Western countries toward steadily greater access to medical coverage — until recent reversals in the United States. Put aside quarrels over the mechanisms used to pass the bill, and <span class="underline"><strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">focus on the central question of Americans’ access to decent medical care.</span> On that issue, those trying to kill this health care reform proposal are simply on the wrong side of history.</u></strong> </span></span></span></span><br />

Kaiser Family Foundation, 2007). Most uninsured are in households headed by someone who is working (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2007). They are much more likely to postpone needed care, utilize emergency rooms as their usual source of care, and experience preventable illnesses and hospitalizations, a pattern that is replicated among poor patients regardless of insurance source (Hadley, 2003, 2007). Current insurance mechanisms for low-income individuals, such as Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP), only partially fill the gap (Bovbjerg, Hadley, Pohl, &amp; Rockmore, 2002; Hadley &amp; Holahan, 2004). A related issue that various candidates have proposed to address through health care insurance reform is the problem of underinsurance. A growing portion of the population is underinsured (Schoen, Doty, Collins, &amp; Holmgren, 2005). Although having some form of health insurance or coverage, people in this group face challenges in accessing the health care system adequately to fit their health needs because of financial impediments, preexisting condition preclusions, and other barriers. All the candidates have endorsed some mode of health care insurance reform. However, the Republican and Democratic candidates have subscribed to two differing approaches. Democratic candidates Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, John Edwards, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich, Barack <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"><u><strong>Obama,</strong></u></span></span> and Bill Richardson <span class="underline"><u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">have tended to support</span> more-direct and immediate reforms that include an <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">expansion of public programs, insurance pooling, and/or employer mandates or subsidies</span>.</strong></u></span> Approaches proposed by the Democratic candidates have varied from a single-payer federal plan (Kucinich) to mandated coverage through an expanded employee-sponsored insurance system and large government-subsidized risk pooling options (Clinton, Edwards, Dodd, Richardson). A key component of various candidates’ plans involves expanding the existing Medicaid and SCHIP programs (Clinton, Edwards, Obama). Funding for expanded coverage has generally been proposed without an increase in taxation (with the exception of Gravel and Kucinich), although a rollback of the Bush administration tax cuts, particularly for the wealthiest Americans, plays a key role in a number of the candidates’ plans (Biden, Dodd, Edwards, Obama). Market-based plans have dominated the Republican candidates’ proposals, which emphasize a privatized system with increased consumer choice. Candidates Fred Thompson, Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, John McCain, Mike Huckabee, and Ron Paul have supported limitations on regulation in order to increase competition and personal choice of health insurers and providers in the market. Tax policy approaches that involve increasing tax deductions, tax credits, and health savings accounts have also been advocated as means of making health insurance affordable for everyone, particularly in market-based plans (Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2008; John McCain 2008, 2007; Mike Huckabee for President, 2007; Romney for President, Inc., 2008). Funding for the Republicans’ plans has generally been proposed to come through tax cuts, cost containment measures, and increased market competition. <u><strong><span class="underline">Regardless of the mechanism</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">coverage expansion has implications for the health care workforce</span></span></strong></u>. It has been projected that <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;"><u>to provide health care in response to the increased demand created by universal coverage would require an additional 40,000 nurses</u></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><u>,</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> a number that seems an underestimate to us, and 35,000 physicians (Whelan, 2007). <span class="underline"><u><strong>It is vital to recognize that<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">, unless the</span> physician and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nurse workforce shortages are addressed, access to health care for many Americans will be compromised, and the problem of access for the uninsured</span> and underinsured <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will</span> continue regardless of the coverage reforms that are implemented</strong></u></span>—indeed, <strong><u><span class="underline">it will <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">wors</span></span></u></strong></span></span></span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Although some nurse job seekers are finding that a tough economy means less job options, this appears to be temporary. Currently, as hospitals and other medical providers experience the same economic downturn as the rest of us, the national nursing crisis may be on a hiatus. However, as a recent Washington Post article explained, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">“</span><span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The economic downturn has put a Band-Aid on</span> one of the most vexing problems in health care, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">a shortage of nurses</span> that has slowed care</u></span> at some hospitals <span class="underline"><u>and forced others to turn away the ill.”</u></span> Once the economy picks up steam and rights itself, <span class="underline"><u>it appears likely that we and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">our aging baby boom population</span></u></span> in particular <span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">will face a nursing shortage that is more severe than ever</span>.</u></span> Hopefully, we’ll have more citizens deciding that nursing is the field for them, especially given the demand<span class="underline"><u>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">One</span></u> <u>other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">solution involves the reform of our immigration system so that U.S. employers can hire foreign-born nurses in a timelier manner</span>.</u></span> Due to increased population growth in recent decades, Prince William County and the rest of Northern Virginia have suffered acutely from this dearth of health care professionals<span class="underline"><u>. A shortage of nurses means higher costs to patients and a lowered standard of care. Not having enough nurses also constricts economic growth, as businesses must locate in areas that can provide adequate medical staffing and other services for their employees</u></span>. In 2005, the Northern Virginia Health Care Workforce Alliance (NVHCWA), a coalition of private sector, business, government, community, health care and educational leaders, published a study finding that there is a current shortage of 2,763 health care workers in Northern Virginia that is expected to grow to 7,791 by 2010 and to 16,595 by 2020. <span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">As the baby boomer population slides into its mid-60s</span> and the growth of the U.S. population outpaces projections, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the resources of our health care industry are becoming increasingly strained</span></u></span>. Federal experts forecast that <span class="underline"><u>the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nursing shortage will grow to</span></u></span> 275,000 by 2010 and to <span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">1 million in the following decade</span>.</u></span> This shortage is not solely linked to a lack of interest in nursing, but also the lack of instructors to teach the necessary skills to become a nurse. These statistics should come as no surprise. Studies discussing the baby boomer burden on nursing were published as early as 2000 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. To ease the shortage of nurses in the U.S., hospitals and nonprofit groups are turning to innovative recruitment and retention programs for nurses. Locally, Potomac Hospital in Woodbridge offers full scholarships to area nursing students who agree to work for the hospital after graduation. INOVA Fairfax Hospital sponsors a children’s summer camp to promote interest in the nursing field and has created programs to improve the overall quality of life for nurse employees. The NVHCWA works to implement programs that recruit and retain health care professionals, including promoting careers in health care to middle school-, high school- and college-age students. <span class="underline"><u>These programs and other <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">education initiatives should help cultivate more American-born nurses in the long run, but a change in immigration regulations would ease the more acute nursing shortage that has been predicted</span></u></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span><span class="underline"> <u>Under current immigration laws, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it’s difficult for U.S. hospitals to turn to the international nursing population</span> to fill the shortage</u></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. </span><span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The most recent “relief</span>”</u></span> offered in response to the nursing shortage was the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Reauthorization Act of 2005. The 2005 Act <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"><u>expires in</u></span></span> December 20<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;"><u>09</u></span></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> Under the Act, a nurse can only qualify for an H-1C non-immigrant visa if he or she is going to work for one of the 14 qualified sponsor hospitals, none of which are in the Northern Virginia area. <span class="underline"><u>Other types of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">visas for nurses are extremely limited</span> as well</u></span>. With the expiration of the 2005 Act coming later this year, a proposal for immigration relief has yet to be considered. Additionally, the Obama administration has made it clear that health care reform is a key agenda item<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. <span class="underline"><u>In order for health care reform to even be viable, an increased medical work force will be required</u></span></span><span class="underline"><u>.

The United States should stand ready to assist Chinese and Indian financial authorities on an emergency basis--and work very hard to help both countries escape or at least weather any economic downturn. It may test the political will of the Obama administration, but the United States must avoid a protectionist response to the economic slowdown.

Bush. It's not just the great powers whose trajectories have been affected by the crash. Lesser powers like Saudi Arabia and Iran also face new constraints. The crisis has strengthened the U.S. position in the Middle East as falling oil prices reduce Iranian influence and increase the dependence of the oil sheikdoms on U.S. protection. Success in Iraq--however late, however undeserved, however limited--had already improved the Obama administration's prospects for addressing regional crises. Now, the collapse in oil prices has put the Iranian regime on the defensive. The annual inflation rate rose above 29 percent last September, up from about 17 percent in 2007, according to Iran's Bank Markazi. Economists forecast that Iran's real GDP growth will drop markedly in the coming months as stagnating oil revenues and the continued global economic downturn force the government to rein in its expansionary fiscal policy. All this has weakened Ahmadinejad at home and Iran abroad. Iranian officials must balance the relative merits of support for allies like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Syria against domestic needs, while international sanctions and other diplomatic sticks have been made more painful and Western carrots (like trade opportunities) have become more attractive. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and other oil states have become more dependent on the United States for protection against Iran, and they have fewer resources to fund religious extremism as they use diminished oil revenues to support basic domestic spending and development goals. None of this makes the Middle East an easy target for U.S. diplomacy, but thanks in part to the economic crisis, the incoming administration has the chance to try some new ideas and to enter negotiations with Iran (and Syria) from a position of enhanced strength. Every crisis is different, but there seem to be reasons why, over time, financial crises on balance reinforce rather than undermine the world position of the leading capitalist countries. Since capitalism first emerged in early modern Europe, the ability to exploit the advantages of rapid economic development has been a key factor in international competition. Countries that can encourage--or at least allow and sustain--the change, dislocation, upheaval, and pain that capitalism often involves, while providing their tumultuous market societies with appropriate regulatory and legal frameworks, grow swiftly. They produce cutting-edge technologies that translate into military and economic power. They are able to invest in education, making their workforces ever more productive. They typically develop liberal political institutions and cultural norms that value, or at least tolerate, dissent and that allow people of different political and religious viewpoints to collaborate on a vast social project of modernization--and to maintain political stability in the face of accelerating social and economic change. The vast productive capacity of leading capitalist powers gives them the ability to project influence around the world and, to some degree, to remake the world to suit their own interests and preferences. This is what the United Kingdom and the United States have done in past centuries, and what other capitalist powers like France, Germany, and Japan have done to a lesser extent. In these countries, the social forces that support the idea of a competitive market economy within an appropriately liberal legal and political framework are relatively strong. But, in many other countries where capitalism rubs people the wrong way, this is not the case. On either side of the Atlantic, for example, the Latin world is often drawn to anti-capitalist movements and rulers on both the right and the left. Russia, too, has never really taken to capitalism and liberal society--whether during the time of the czars, the commissars, or the post-cold war leaders who so signally failed to build a stable, open system of liberal democratic capitalism even as many former Warsaw Pact nations were making rapid transitions. Partly as a result of these internal cultural pressures, and partly because, in much of the world, capitalism has appeared as an unwelcome interloper, imposed by foreign forces and shaped to fit foreign rather than domestic interests and preferences, many countries are only half-heartedly capitalist. When crisis strikes, they are quick to decide that capitalism is a failure and look for alternatives. So far, such half-hearted experiments not only have failed to work; they have left the societies that have tried them in a progressively worse position, farther behind the front-runners as time goes by. Argentina has lost ground to Chile; Russian development has fallen farther behind that of the Baltic states and Central Europe. Frequently, the crisis has weakened the power of the merchants, industrialists, financiers, and professionals who want to develop a liberal capitalist society integrated into the world. Crisis can also strengthen the hand of religious extremists, populist radicals, or authoritarian traditionalists who are determined to resist liberal capitalist society for a variety of reasons. Meanwhile, the companies and banks based in these societies are often less established and more vulnerable to the consequences of a financial crisis than more established firms in wealthier societies. As a result, developing countries and countries where capitalism has relatively recent and shallow roots tend to suffer greater economic and political damage when crisis strikes--as, inevitably, it does. And, consequently, financial crises often reinforce rather than challenge the global distribution of power and wealth. This may be happening yet again. None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. </span><u><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 10pt;">Bad economic times</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> can <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">breed wars</span></span></span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.

But with hardwork that will eventually be the case. At that point the Unified Command—whichwas established under U.S. Coast Guard leadership to manage the response tothis disaster—will fold, the cleanup workers will go home, and the raft of workersbrought in from diverse agencies as part of the emergency response will be pulled back to deal with other more urgent tasks.</span><br />

Robert Kadlec, former special assistant to President Bush on biodefense — and the head of the White House group that ordered Slezak to Washington — says much of the specific information linking terrorists to weapons of mass destruction is shaky. &quot;There's always the risk of strategic surprise from groups that are not on anybody's radar screen,&quot; he says. <span class="underline"><u>It no longer takes a government bioweapons program to cook up a biological weapo</u></span>n, <span class="underline"><u>as the 2001 anthrax attacks showed,</u></span> adds Kadlec, now with PRTM, an international management consulting firm.

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0.2in 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the Nurse Retention and Quality Care Act of 2001 and to speak about the importance of nurses and the work they do. On September 11, nurses were among those who were on the front lines of the battle against terrorism. With courage, skill and determination, they were on the job, treating the injured, helping to save lives. To this day, <span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">nurses are defending America</span>. In clinics, hospitals and offices around the country, they are <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">working to detect and treat</span> actual or suspected cases of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">anthrax.</span> Should our Nation face</u></span> other <span class="underline"><u>biological threats</u></span> or terrorist attacks, <span class="underline"><u>nurses will be there for us.</u></span> Today's news that a woman who works in the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is in critical condition with possible inhalation anthrax is a reminder of the hazards faced by health care workers. And <span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it is</span> a reminder of how i<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">mportant</span> it is <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">that our public health system be fully staffed with trained health care professionals</span></u></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">.</span> Sadly, <span class="underline"><u>America is facing a nursing shortage at a time when the need for more nurses is so clear</u></span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> Our nurses are facing an emergency of their own and they need our help<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">. </span><span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The nursing shortage imposes increasing hardship on hospitals</span> and nurses alike, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and threatens the</span></u> </span></span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;"><u>ability</u></span></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> of our health care system <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">to</span> provide basic patient care, much less </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow; font-size: 14pt;"><u>respond to health crises and terrorism</u></span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> Not only is the number of individuals entering the nursing profession falling, but hospitals are also facing difficulty retaining the nurses already on staff. Fifty percent of nurses say they have recently considered leaving their jobs for reasons other than retirement, and approximately half a million licensed nurses are not currently practicing nursing. Many of the nurses who have considered leaving the profession cite their low level of overall job satisfaction. While we must do more to improve the number of nurses in training, we must also take steps to enhance the workplace to retain current nurses, and that is what the bill that Senator Gordon Smith and I will be introducing today would address. One way to retain nurses is to follow the example of those hospitals that have become nursing ``magnets.'' They are successful because they involve nurses in decision-making, encourage collaboration among health professionals, give nurses the opportunity to pursue continuing education and advancement, and they organize care to improve patient outcome. Our bill is designed to encourage more hospitals to follow these leads. And I am pleased that hospitals and nurses support this bill. It has been endorsed by the American Nurses Association and the American Hospitals Association. It is also a good bill for patients and their quality of care as well. Research has shown that magnet hospitals have lower mortality rates, shorter lengths of stay, higher patient satisfaction and cost- efficiency. <span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">As our Nation faces increasing threats of</span> terrorist and <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">biological attack, our health system must be stronger</span> than ever before. One of the best ways <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we can do this is by taking steps to reverse the nursing shortage,</span> and ensure that nurses on the front lines are well-prepared to respond to emergencies.</u></span> Our bill does both. First, it creates demonstration programs to encourage states to adopt magnet hospital practices, which will help attract and retain the nursing staff our hospitals need so they can cope with surges in patient volume. And, second, our bill encourages nurses to pursue continued education. That is so important today, when <span class="underline"><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">we need more health care professionals who can detect the early signs of a bioterrorist attack</span>.</u></span> This legislation will promote the kind of training that the New York State Nurses Association, Bellevue Hospital and New York College provide for nurses in my state. </span></span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> Although human pathogens are often lumped with nuclear explosives and lethal chemicals as potential weapons of mass destruction, there is an obvious, fundamentally important difference: Pathogens are alive, weapons are not. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Nuclear</span> and chemical <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">weapons do not reproduce themselves and do not independently engage in adaptive behavior; pathogens d</span>o both of these things. That deceptively simple observation has immense implications. The use of a manufactured weapon is a singular event. Most of the damage occurs immediately. The aftereffects, whatever they may be, decay rapidly over time and distance in a reasonably predictable manner. Even before a nuclear warhead is detonated, for instance, it is possible to estimate the extent of the subsequent damage and the likely level of radioactive fallout. Such predictability is an essential component for tactical military planning. The use of a pathogen, by contrast, is an extended process whose scope and timing cannot be precisely controlled. For most potential biological agents, the predominant drawback is that they would not act swiftly or decisively enough to be an effective weapon. But for a few pathogens - ones most likely to have a decisive effect and therefore the ones most likely to be contemplated for deliberately hostile use - the risk runs in the other direction<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">. A lethal pathogen that could efficiently spread from one victim to another would be capable of initiating an intensifying cascade of disease that might ultimately threaten the entire world population</span>. The 1918 influenza epidemic demonstrated the potential for a global contagion of this sort but not necessarily its outer limit. Nobody really knows how serious a possibility this might be, since there is no way to measure it reliably.</span><br />

This underlies our contention that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">practical wisdom is the final cause of debate</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Practical wisdom is broad, provides coherence and unity in a non-arbitrary way, and is value-neutral</span> with respect to the growing divide between the policy-focused and the critically-inclined. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Non-practical ends are not</span> helpful – as Aristotle (c. 330bce/1941a) argues: The origin of action—its efficient, not its final cause—is choice, and that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end… Intellect itself, however, moves nothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical; for this rules the productive intellect as well, since everyone who makes makes for an end, and that which is made is not an end in the unqualified sense.

<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Strait and Wallace 08</span></span> (Paul, assistant coach at USC working on his PHD at USC, Brett, Working on his MA at The George Washington University, “ACADEMIC DEBATE AS A DECISION-MAKING GAME: INCULCATING THE VIRTUE OF PRACTICAL WISDOM”, Contemporary Argumentation and Debate)</span><br />
<span style="display: block; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">If we accept that academic debate ought to foster practical wisdom among its participants</span>, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">debate theory itself must reflect this. It is precisely because it is rooted in real-world practice that debate has value</span>. Kuhn (1992) explains this by stating that “no other kind of thinking matters more-or contributes more-to the quality and fulfillment of people's lives, both individually and collectively” (p. 156). Thus, we argue that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the principles of good decision-making must be present in debate arguments</span>. This means, first and foremost, that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">all decisions posed by debate theory must account for the decision-maker. In the real world, decision-makers can choose only from the options open to them, not from all possible options they can imagine</span>. Aristotle (c. 330bce/1941b) argues: “Concerning things which exist or will exist inevitably, or which cannot possibly exist or take place, no counsel can be given… Clearly, counsel can only be given on matters about which people deliberate; matters, namely, that ultimately depend upon ourselves, and which we have it in our power to set going” (1359a32-39). <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">While decision-making would be much easier from the position of a universal, omnipotent decision maker, real decision-making situations are contingent on the decisions made by others, decisions which cannot be counted on to change. Recognition of this is a marker of emotional and cognitive maturity, a sign that one is ready to make adult decisions</span>. Although people might occasionally think about problems from the position of an ideal decision-maker (c.f. Ulrich, 1981, quoted in Korcok, 2002<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">), in debate we should be concerned with the type of argumentative thinking that is the most relevant to real-world intelligence and the decisions that people make every day in their lives, not academic trivialities</span>. We demonstrate how this argument resolves problems in debate theory by examining three genres of negative arguments: disadvantages, counterplans, and critiques.</span><br />
