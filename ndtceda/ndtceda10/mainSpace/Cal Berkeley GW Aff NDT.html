Advantage 1 Is Offshoring –<br />
Massive skills shortage is plaguing the IT industry – current domestic workforce can’t meet future labor demands<br />
<u>Light, WSJ, 2-7</u>-’11 (Joe, “Labor Shortage Persists in Some Fields”)<br />
There are nearly 14 million people ...shortage, Mr. Perrault said.<br />
The result will be a new wave of IT offshoring – skills shortage is the primary motivation<br />
<u>Bacheldor, CIO, 2-4</u>-’11 (Beth, “Offshoring: It’s the Skills, Not the Savings?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://advice.cio.com/beth_bacheldor/15244/offshoring_it_s_the_skills_not_the_savings" rel="nofollow">http://advice.cio.com/beth_bacheldor/15244/offshoring_it_s_the_skills_not_the_savings</a>)<br />
Okay, here’s one that I ...CIO.com’s Stephanie Overby’s article.)<br />
IT sector shortage isn’t impacted by the recession – short project lengths create demand for H1Bs<br />

Despite all these difficulties, technology ...recession in certain areas of technology.<br />
Lifting the H1B cap solves –<br />
First, service firms – Indian service firms will be forced to adopt an extreme offshoring model moving entire operations overseas – number of H1Bs is key<br />

Second, market uncertainty – the size of the cap is irrelevant, as long as the US maintains a quota on H1B entrants firms will be uncertain future labor demands can be met, forcing business flight<br />
