Plan: The United States federal government should use a functional definition of family to determine beneficiary eligibility for its family based visas.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION ONE: THE ADVANTAGE<br />
<br />
<br />
US immigration law mandates normative heterosexuality – in order to receive a family based visa, those seeking entry must prove they fit within and uphold the model of the nuclear, heteronormative family structure.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This ongoing, violent disciplining of both sexual and familial identity at the border is part and parcel of the Western project to stabilize and control queer subjects – it perpetuates a larger culture of heteronormativity that sustains broader imperial and neocolonial structures of power around the world.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Queer migration scholarship has… circuits in particular ways.32<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The disciplining of the queer sexual subject in the U.S. mirrors the policing of the illegal migrant: just as the queer threatens the moral order that governs individuals, the illegal migrant threatens the social order which structures the nation. The resulting convergence is a focal point of social anxiety.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Mobility often triggers social anxieties… health, immunity, infection, and containment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The hetero family historically undergirds the link between stable sexual subject and the stable nation – this construction of the family at the border thus aligns the promotion of sexual and national identity, constituting the crucial mediating point between the two ends of the contemporary Western political order and making ever-increasing forms of reactionary violence inevitable.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
This chapter addresses the ways… threatens to augment violence in its most brutal forms.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
National politics and its management of contingency cannot be understood outside its intersection with the hetero family – conventional politics is therefore incapable of containing the oncoming storms of financial collapse, climate change, and global conflict<br />

Nevertheless, what composed...virtuous productivity.<br />

<br />
And heteronormativity culminates in extinction<br />

<br />
From at least the… opened and opened and opened?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The functional test for family based immigration legalizes queer migration and opens up the entire concept of the family to re-signification<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
In my opinion, it is possible… same--and opposite--sex.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And functionality spills over, radically changing society’s understanding of the family itself<br />

<br />
<br />
At an international conference… marriage-based family in the law.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The border is where we draw the line – opening the definition of family in immigration law strikes at the heart of American identity<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
As Justice Scalia noted… the traditional view of marriage and sexuality are absent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We cannot abandon the concept of the family, or else we abandon society’s capacity to promote relationality – re-signifying kinship relations solves<br />

<br />
One major part of… regulation itself.
