Counterplan<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should grant permanent refugee status to beneficiaries who are currently ineligible due to a lack of letter of recommendation from a General or Flag Officer of the United States Armed Forces and beneficiaries who have been employed in Iraq by an organization or entity closely associated with the United States mission in Iraq that has received United States Government funding. Processing of this status should be expedited to match wait times for analogous fourth preference subcategories 7 and 8 visas. Associated benefits, including but not limited to eligibility for security clearances, for those receiving aforementioned permanent refugee status should be made equal to those for fourth preference subcategories 7 and 8 visas and individuals should not be required to apply for permanent residency after one year. We’ll clarify.<br />
Refugee status solves stability and perception-based advantages<br />
