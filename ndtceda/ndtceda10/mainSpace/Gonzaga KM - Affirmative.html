Baudrillard ignores the role that physical sources of power play even in the world of hyperreality. No meaningful values or resistance are possible with Baudrillard’s methods, and we are left defenseless against exploitation. Baudrillard’s tactics also cannot create a meaningful challenge to gender-based, everyday acts of oppression. The permutation, however, can use what strengths exist in Baudrillard’s method to overcome its weaknesses.<br />

Baudrillard's critical ... cultures and societies. <br />
<br />
Baudrillard’s analysis of politics guarantees inaction, the criticism only serves to demobilize dissent against forms of dominance. They only breed a distrust of action and community, without providing an alternative to take its place. <br />

Baudrillard’s form of resistance are unavailable to spouses on dependent visas. If Baudrillard’s works have value, it is to identify consumption as a form of resistance. Our aff says that the choice of how to relate to consumption is exactly what is denied these women.<br />

Control over information and movement is what constitutes power in Baudrillard’s hyperreality. Dependent spouses who are denied access to information and movement cannot participate in the exchange of signs necessary to relate to hyperreality as Baudrillard suggests.<br />

Nothing that the K says about voting for the plan is true. The affirmation of the plan is only as a productive, contextual sentence, a tool to make sense of causal relationships and predict behavior, not a rejection of other potential truth claims. To say that the plan has any representational or epistemological meaning beyond a pragmatic statement is to reduce theory to wordplay, and prevent productive philosophy and politics by reducing the world to a sterile Cartesianism.<br />

Zalmay Khalilzad, RAND, The Washington Quarterly, Spring 1995<br />
Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />

Dependent visas rely on the doctrine of coverture, a holdover from medieval common law that gives a man the authority and obligation to chastise his wife. Only the elimination of dependent visas ends the state’s sanctioning of coverture, which is key to ending domestic violence , challenging patriarchy, and recognizing the legal autonomy and personhood of women.<br />
