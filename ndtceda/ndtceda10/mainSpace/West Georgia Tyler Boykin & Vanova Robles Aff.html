The United States Congress should make family reunification visas available to individuals who can demonstrate status relationships that are akin to currently existing family-based categories, including partnership under spousal reunification provisions. Backlogs for immediate family members of lawful permanent residents should be eliminated by increasing the number of available family-based visas without regard to quotas based on country of origin.<br />
<br />
Observation One: The Status Quo<br />
Family visa law reflects a biological nuclear family model which excludes all alternative family formations.<br />

Furthermore, same-sex partners are excluded from spousal reunification, reinforcing hierarchies based on sexual orientation.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="underline">The most readily apparent example… on the basis of sexual orientation.</span></span><br />
Furthermore, reunification for lawful permanent residents is subject to numerical caps, requiring some families to wait for over 15 years for reunification. Although facially neutral, these caps disproportionately affect the families of Asian and Latin immigrants. <br />

Advantage One: Family Reunification<br />
The destruction of familial bonds was a hallmark of slave status- breaking up families served to dehumanize slaves and destroy sources of social value other than the slavemaster. Contemporary U.S. immigration law mirrors this process by stratifying family reunification efforts according to citizenship status.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chacon 2008</span></span> (Jennifer M., Acting Professor, UC Davis, School of Law. “Citizenship and Family: Revisiting Dred Scott”, Washington University Journal of Law and Public Policy, 27 Wash. U. J.L. &amp; Pol'y 45, GAL)<br />
Of course, <span class="underline">the theme of family integrity…</span> following the Dred Scott decision.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And, the status quo heteronormative governance of migrants is an assault on human dignity which endangers families and legitimizes racialized homophobia.</span></span><br />

<span class="underline">The heteronormative governance of,,, with immigration control is laid bare.</span><br />
This regulation of family formation devalues the family unit of the migrant, which is both historically and currently a critical element in perpetuating racial hierarchy.<br />

Contemporary <span class="underline">immigration law</span> and policy…<span class="underline"> do so in more subtle forms today</span>.<br />
Devaluation of the migrant family unit fuels negative stereotypes which are used to justify even more restrictive measures. Barriers to family reunification have the effect of maintaining white supremacy.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chacon ‘7 </span></span>(Jennifer Marie, Acting Professor of Law- UC Davis, “Loving Across Borders: Immigration Law and the Limits of Loving”, Wisconsin Law Review, 2007 Wis. L. Rev. 345, GAL)<br />
In Loving, the Supreme Court noted that the statutory…. increasingly difficult to love across borders.<br />
White supremacy is an ordering principle that produces hierarchies of difference, which are enforced through widespread violence and extermination of the other.<br />

Finally, our advantage outweighs all other impacts: Racism must be rejected from both an ethical and utilitarian perspective- injustice makes violence and death inevitable.<br />

Advantage 2: The Legislated Constitution<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Fourteenth Amendment requires equal protection for all persons in the United States, not just citizens- focusing on citizenship as a prerequisite to fundamental rights like family unity fuels the emergence of a domestic caste structure.</span></span><br />

Taking the reconstructed Constitution seriously means Congress should do the plan: it provides protections to basic rights of family integrity, but doesn’t jeopardize meaningful immigration regulation.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chacon 2008</span></span> (Jennifer M., Acting Professor, UC Davis, School of Law. “Citizenship and Family: Revisiting Dred Scott”, Washington University Journal of Law and Public Policy, 27 Wash. U. J.L. &amp; Pol'y 45, GAL)<br />
At present, <span class="underline">one of the most important…. the family integrity of noncitizens</span>.<br />
Legislative interpretations of the 14th amendment must be advanced by Congress to fulfill their affirmative obligation of equal protection. Advancing this progressive constitutional vision is critical to counter the neglect of the Reconstruction Constitution.<br />

The third reason goes to the quality of our constitutionalism…<span class="underline"> compromise—is a part of who we are.</span><br />
The emergence of the Tea Party has directed national attention to the Constitution. Unfortunately, they are dominating this conversation with inaccurate claims about the sharply limited role of the central government- these ideas must be engaged and countered because they are not just false, but dangerous. <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Wydra and Gans 2010</span></span> (Elizabeth, Constitutional Accountability Center’s Chief Counsel- frequently participates in Supreme Court litigation, and David, former program director of Cardozo Law School's Floersheimer Center for Constitutional Democracy, “The Tea Party and the Constitutional Powers of the Federal Government”, Constitutional Accountability Center, Issue Brief No.4, July 16, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theusconstitution.org/upload/fck/file/File_storage/Setting%20the%20Record%20Straight%20Issue%20Brief%20formatted.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.theusconstitution.org/upload/fck/file/File_storage/Setting%20the%20Record%20Straight%20Issue%20Brief%20formatted.pdf</a></span>, GAL)<br />
<span class="underline">The emergence of the Tea Party</span> movement….<span class="underline"> what our Constitution establishes. </span><br />
The status quo cedes constitutional politics to the extreme right wing- our aff is a valuable contribution to a vision of a progressive popular constitutionalism which advances the power of the federal government to protect the rights of the oppressed.<br />

III. The Promise of the Legislated Constitution… legitimating, <span class="underline">constitutional history</span>.<br />
The Tea Party vision of the Constitution requires selective amnesia about Reconstruction and subsequent amendments- these distortions about limited federal power should be fought wherever possible.<br />

<span class="underline">The Tea Party story about… It's past time to set the record straight on the Constitution.</span><br />
Finally, recognizing a right to family integrity does not require totally open borders- it is about creating a baseline of rights protections for all persons in the United States.<br />

Conclusions<br />
To date, the courts have rejected attempts to challenge….<span class="underline"> character of such regulations.</span>
