 The call for the judge space to become politically active is far from neutral. New School’s advocacy turns it into a site for racial redemption. <br />
This process occurs in three steps: judges are given the option to publicly declare their distance from structures of white supremacy, the question of personal and historical embeddedness is buried in superficial and quick references to a reality outside of debate, and the legitimation of innocent whiteness occurs. This process makes the signature of the ballot a mere token for a clean slate, which not only devastates their movement by giving judges the opportunity to treat them like tokens, but guarantees future acts of outright aggression. <br />

 The way they cut their Talal evidence is wrong (in our opinion). Doha fails because the WTO is haunted by laize-faire orthodoxy that violently commodifies everything. Its collapse isn’t the end of social cooperation, rather it underscores the irrelevance of trade liberalism to the modern world. Only a new trade politics that embraces the shared commons can possibly address resource conflict.<br />
We begin this evidence with the last sentence they read. Note that the next thing he says is that their conclusion is wrong. <br />
