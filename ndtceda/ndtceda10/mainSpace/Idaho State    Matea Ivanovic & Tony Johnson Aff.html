<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">ACT I: The Domocrats</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">In the office of a known democrat – in the great and all important exclusive realm of politics, Capital Hill, here we find two gents, we will call them, Ronny and Dom…</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Listen up Ronny, now that you are fully… under… my control… you have to listen, and listen well, in the end I might “quiz” you, America is the greatest country ever! Land of opportunity. Home of freedom, truth, and justice for all. This sure is a Beautiful Country. And I intend to keep it that way. I don’t think we need any more Havana in Florida, or Tijuana in California, or—</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: Or Quebec in Montana, Dom.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Shut the fuck up Ronny! Nobody cares about Montana. I’m talking about making sure we still speak American and not Mexican in twenty years! Standing up for Mom and Pop store owner and Joe the Plumber—</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: I thought it turned out that guy wasn’t a Plumber at all?</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Shut the fuck up Ronny! I’m talking about making sure we still have American businesses and American family values. Keeping our culture and heritage alive. Making sure our kids have a safe place to play with their friends. And that our schools not only help our little ones learn all they can about English, Science, English, Math, and English, but where the kids are safe from pederasses.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: Ooo, Whats a pederass Dom? </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Shut the fuck up Ronny! You disgusting, deviant, sick son of a—wait—what was that… &lt;clear throat&gt; Ron what is that sound?</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: Wait… its ok, I think that’s my assistant, he won’t come in here, then again maybe he will, mmm. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Are you sure? God I feel so dirty acting like this… but it is hot. Its so aggressive.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: Do it more! Come on, really let go. But one quick thing before we get going again, I forgot the safe word.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Jesus Ron, alpaca. Its alpaca. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: That’s right, alpaca, Ok keep going. You were screaming at me pederasses…</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Ok here we go… &lt;clear throat&gt; You know my boss thinks It Takes A Village, and someone needs to think of the kids. We can’t have pederasses, dykes, and sissies in our schools, in our Village. </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: We have a village?</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: Not, a vill… seriously Ronny will you just shut the fuck up? The point is, we need to make sure our communities are safe. That we maintain the purity of essence that is the American way. It’s not enough to make sure we are keeping the borders safe from terrorists, and only letting in immigrants that will take the jobs American’s don’t want, we also need to make sure there is no moral deviancy! We need constancy! If there is one thing I will not take it’s IMMORALITY!</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: But whose to say?</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: DON’T YOU START IN ON ME WITH THAT LINE OF HORSE SHIT!!!! YOU KNOW THIS IS A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY!!!! JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MINORITY WHIP DOESN’T MEAN I WON’T SHOW YOU HOW THE MAJORITY CAN STILL BEAT YOU DOWN!!!!</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: (under breathe) More like beat me off…</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: AND WHO ARE YOU TO LECTURE ME ABOUT WHOSE TO SAY? WHO IS THE GOD DAMNED REPUBLICAN HERE? YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG!!! ITS AS PLAIN AS BLACK AND WHITE! AND MEAN BLACK AND WHITE!</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: I don’t think you even believe what you are saying at this point.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF JUST PLAYING THE ROLE OF PISSED OFF DOMICRAT!!! THAT’S ENOUGH TO MAKE ME BITCH SLAP YOU!!! I’M TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE OUR STREETS AND JOBS AREN’T TAKEN OVER BY IMMIGRANTS, OUR PARADES AREN’T ALL GAY PRIDE AND S&amp;M AND NO FIREMEN AND UNCLE SAM!!! AND, DON’T YOU TALK BACK TO ME BOY OR I’LL SHOW YOU THE MAJORITY WHIP!!!</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: Sounds like someone is confused about how to get out the closet</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO PISS ME OFF NOW!!! I WILL MAKE YOU BEG FOR MERCY!</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: do it!</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Dom: SHUT THE FUCK UP RONNY!!!</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ronny: you are such a tease. Give it to me. </span><br />

<span style="color: #000000; margin-bottom: 0in;">David Roman Writes…</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">“The archive for this work remains, for the most part, undocumented and unexamined. It exists in… local performance—media that do not rely on print culture for their preservation. Because this archive often exists outside of official culture, it is frequently undervalued or even derided. So too are most efforts to recover it. Jose Munoz, writing about the archives of queer culture, explains one of the main reasons for this occurrence: “Because the archives of queerness are makeshift and randomly organized, due to the restraints historically shackled upon minoritarian cultural workers, the Rights is able to question the evidentiary authority of queer inquiry.” Munoz goes on to argue against this critique of queer theory, in part, by advocating for the performativity of queer scholarship, or what he calls “queer acts”… Recent work by a new generation of queer playwrights call attention to the rich archives of memory that exist in the vernacular imagination of the queer immigrant subject… Chay Yew’s saga of <span style="color: #000000;"><em>Miss Visa Denied</em>, a Malaysian immigrant and drag queen, in <em>A Beautiful Country</em> (1998) stands as a case in point… The play’s dramatic structure, indeed, framed by Visa’s efforts to gain entrance into the United States… Visa is played by three actors: a male actor who embodies Visa on stage but does not speak, another male actor who speaks Visa’s inner thoughts but only from an offstage microphone, and a female actor who is meant to represent Visa’s “soul” and performs only through dance. The duality assigned to Visa in the production notes is therefore misleading: while she may serve as “a metaphor for the duality experiences by most immigrants,” the fact that Yew chooses three actors to perform the character suggests not simply duality but fragmentation. The play thus powerfully demonstrates how the experience of immigration not only displaces immigrants geographically, but how it also enacts a kind of symbolic violence or fragmentation on the level of the individual subject… The theme of fragmentation is also brought into relief by the cross-racial and cross-gendered performances of the actors and the overt theatricality of the production. Everyone here is performing a role… If “queer acts” as Jose Munoz argues, “stand as evidence of queer lives, powers, and possibilities,” and if “immigrant acts,” as Lisa Lowe argues, “[name]… the <em>acts</em> of labor, resistance, memory, and survival, as well as politicized cultural work that emerges from dislocation and disidentification,” then perhaps “queer immigrant acts” acknowledge the alternative forms of sociality and community that these interrelated and collective efforts make possible. Queer immigrant acts make possible queer and transnational identities, transforming the social and public worlds in which these subjects travel.”</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Idaho%20State%20%20%20%20Matea%20Ivanovic%20%26%20Tony%20Johnson%20Aff.html#sdfootnote4sym">4</a></span><br />
