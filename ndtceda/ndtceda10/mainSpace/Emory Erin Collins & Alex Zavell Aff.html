Observation 1: A Queer History<br />
<br />
Over time, the US has created immigration legislation that limits out all those imagined as queer. It is this basis that has served as a model for the Page Act, the uniform Rule of Naturalization, and even what it means to be a citizen. Citizens are understood in terms of their ability to propagate and spread new good Americans for the purpose of a homogenous society. This process creates an irrational fear of the immigrant that can only be overcome by recognizing the queer potential immigration holds.<br />
Somerville 05, [Siobhan B., prof. Department of English and the Gender and Women's Studies Program at the University of Illinois, ?Notes toward a Queer History of Naturalization,? American Quarterly?57.3 (2005) 659-675. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v057/57.3somerville.html" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v057/57.3somerville.html</a>]<br />
<br />
In its first century of existence, then, the U.S. federal government ?.o detach political belonging from (hetero)sexual reproduction.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: HomoTerrorism<br />
<br />
<br />
United States immigration policy is dependent on securitizing and categorizing all individuals?Queers have become the new terrorists and through immigration legislation, the line between LGBT immigrants and terrorism has been blurred, and the two are now inseparable<br />
Francoeur 07 [Adam, Policy Coordinator for Immigration Equality, The Enemy Within: Constructions Of U.S. Immigration Law And Policy And The Hiomoterrorist Threat, Stanford Journal of Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties 345 (2007). <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/inlr28&amp;div=6&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals" rel="nofollow">http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/inlr28&amp;div=6&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals</a>. Pg. 361-2]<br />
<br />
C. A New Threat: Homoterrorism In the lead-up ?. ideological exclusion and LGBT immigrants as terrorists.<br />
<br />
<br />
This as two implications one:<br />
<br />
First: securitization of immigrants is based on an attempt to secure the unknown and on the idea that somehow the world is completely knowable and self-contained<br />
Bigo 02 [Didier, Prof. Institut des Etudes politiques, Paris. 2002 ?Security and immigration: Toward a critique of the governmentality of unease.?]<br />
<br />
My hypothesis is that the securitization ?. concern for the management of fear or unease. (11)<br />
<br />
Pushing towards complete security is not the answer. Disorder is inevitable and efforts to control this will produce violence and extinction.<br />
James Der Derian 98, Political Science Professor, University of Massachusetts, 1998. On Security, ed: Lipschitz, The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche, and Baudrillard, Decentering Security.<br />
<br />
No other concept in international relations ?. and identities calcifying into a fearful sameness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
<br />
Linkage of the Queer with Terrorism was designed not only to secure the American identity and its values from the imagined homosexual threat?but to construct the imagined war on terror<br />
Francoeur 07 [Adam, Policy Coordinator ? the true nature of American values.<br />
<br />
The war on terror has gone far beyond protection of our borders and has taken on the impossible task of re-making the world in our image --- this causes global war.<br />

<br />
A war to rid the world of evil, and ending ?. Elizabeth Barrett, who secretly married . . .) .<br />
<br />
Plan<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should substantially expand beneficiary eligibility for its family based visas to include queers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Focusing on the Queer subject destabilizes what it means to be a part of the American family. Through this particular demand we can destabilize the dominating aspects of immigration management<br />

American Quarterly?57.3 (2005) 659-675. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v057/57.3somerville.html" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.library.emory.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v057/57.3somerville.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Although studies of nationalism ?. own objects of desire and produces them as citizens.<br />
<br />
<br />
This focus on a particular demand is the only way to deal with the political hijacking in the status quo.<br />

<br />
Slavoj ?i?ek and Chantal Mouffe, among others, ?outside the law and treated as extremists and terrorists.<br />
<br />
By incorporating Queerness into the American family ? we are able to identify with a particular demand. It is this identification that helps the self accept the insecurity and unpredictability in the world we live in<br />
Stavrakakis 99[Ideology and Discourse Analysis Program in the Department of Government at the University of Essex, Yannis, Lacan and the Political, Ruteledge Press 74-75]<br />
<br />
In the face of the irreducibility of the ?. of alleviating the uncanny character of experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Why act?<br />
<br />
<br />
Each of us has the capacity to determining what our obligations are - we must accept our responsibility within the act since it is the only possibility for a true ethical commitment?refusals to make ones ethical claims universal defers ones responsibility and becomes an excuse for violence and torture<br />
<br />
Zizek 7 [Slavoj, Robespierre or the &quot;Divine Violence&quot; of Terror, Lacan.com, 2007 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizrobes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizrobes.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
We can see now why Lacan's motto il n'y a pas de grand Autre ?. for doing my duty, but no less for determining what my duty is.<br />
<br />
Any revolutionary change must begin with a systematic critique of the assumptions of the current system?operating in the realm of ideas de-colonizes the mind and allows for new politics.<br />
Reinsborough, Organizer, Rainforest Action Network and Wake Up America Campaign, 2003 (Journal of Aesthetics and Protest, August 2003, Volume 1, Issue 2, Patrick).<br />
<br />
Direct action? actions that either symbolically ?and ask the questions that topple empires.<br />
<br />
Thus the role of the ballot should be to assume the position of a critical intellectual- debate is primarily an academic activity. The signal sent intellectually outweighs any specific policy proposal- this card is the bees knees<br />
Richard Wyn Jones, Professor International Politics @ Aberystwyth University, ?99 (Security, Strategy, and Critical Theory, p. 155-163)<br />
The central political task of ? thus arguably playing a crucial role in the very survival of the human race, should act as both an inspiration and a challenge to critical security studies.
