 There are 2 types of Hospitality, Conditional and Unconditional. The affirmative is a notion of pure conditional hospitality. They place conditions on which the immigrant must accept and become accustomed to or else there is no home for them. Their conception has no adherence to unconditional hospitality. <br />
<br />
Derrida, 1990. (Jacques, “A discussion with Jacques Derrida’”, Theory and Event Issue 5.1 Pg. 16-17)<br />
That's conditional hospitality,... that's unconditional hospitality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their purely political and regulated hospitality leads to tyrannical violence. The immigrant “other” is forced to becomes faceless and one with which any violence can be justified against.<br />
<br />
Derrida, 1997. (Jacques, “Adieu to Emmanuel levinas”, Stanford University Press. Pg. 96-97)<br />
The Preface of Totality ... will perhaps prevail.<br />
<br />
The Alternative is to reject the affirmative –<br />
Their purely political basing behind their plan condemns death of nations everywhere. We are not advocating to let every single person come to the U.S. unquestioned. We are advocating a discussion of a priori ethics where unconditional hospitality is taken into account and is the backbone behind political decisions. <br />

A. Uniqueness – wages are rising now.<br />

As the economy sputters back to life, businesses that made major cuts to survive the recession are beginning to invest in their employees again during the recovery.<br />
Nearly 90 percent of companies are increasing salaries this year, according to two national surveys, and 98 percent expect to do so next year.<br />

B. Link –<br />
Plan destabilizes high-tech jobs; deflates wages, causes offshoring, and exacerbates loopholes.<br />
Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology, “Beware the H-1B Visa,” 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/debateroom/archives/2007/09/beware_the_h-1b_visa.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/debateroom/archives/2007/09/beware_the_h-1b_visa.html</a><br />
The H-1B program has been corrupted by a large and growing share of firms that use it for cheap labor and to facilitate the outsourcing of jobs. Gaping loopholes make it very easy and legal to pay below-market wages. In fact, employers admitted to the Government Accountability Office, Congress’ watchdog agency, that they use the visas to hire less-expensive foreign workers. And examples of approved H-1B applications show how the program undercuts American workers. In 2006, the U.S. Department of Labor rubber-stamped HCL America’s bid to import 75 computer software engineers at $11.88 per hour.<br />
The problems don’t stop with cheap labor. The H-1B visa is so critical to the offshore outsourcing industry that India’s Commerce Minister has dubbed it the &quot;outsourcing visa.&quot; Seven of the top 10 H-1B employers are offshore outsourcing firms, none of whom hire many Americans, gobbling up tens of thousands of H-1B visas along the way. Rather than preventing it, the program speeds up the outsourcing of high-wage high-technology jobs.<br />
None of this should be surprising given the raison d’etre of modern corporations, maximizing profits. Businesses do not exist to maximize their U.S. workforce or improve competitiveness in the U.S. If companies can lower costs by hiring cheaper foreign guest-workers, they will. If they can hire vendors who hire cheaper foreign guest-workers, they will. And who can blame them? If they don’t take advantage of blatant loopholes, their competitors surely will. Cheap labor and outsourcing explain why the H-1B program is oversubscribed.<br />
A sizable share of the U.S. high-tech workforce understands this logic, and justifiably views the H-1B program as a threat and a scam. That’s the real danger to U.S. competitiveness. Young people considering a technology career see that industry prefers cheaper foreign guest-workers and that the government uses immigration policy to work against technology professionals.<br />

C. Wage deflation kills the economy – consumer demand and investment.<br />
Patrick Belser, Global Labour University, “Why we should care about wages,” 1/18/2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://column.global-labour-university.org/2010/01/why-we-should-care-about-wages_3262.html" rel="nofollow">http://column.global-labour-university.org/2010/01/why-we-should-care-about-wages_3262.html</a><br />
The second reason why we should care is that a continued deterioration in wages is bad news for the economic recovery. The pace of the recovery depends largely on the extent to which people are able to consume whatever the global economy produces. And consumption, in turn, depends on the level of wages. In fact, in some advanced economies, almost 80% of household income comes from wages and salaries. Although GDP figures in the course of 2009 provided indications of a possible economic rebound, the trends in real wages observed during the past few quarters raise serious questions about the true extent of a global economic recovery and also highlight the risks of phasing out government rescue packages too early. As the experience of Japan during the past decade has cruelly shown, wage deflation deprives national economies of much needed demand and can result in lengthy periods of economic stagnation.<br />
Finally, we should already be thinking about the post-crisis world. Before the crisis, in the period from 1995-2007, the share of wages in GDP had declined in a majority of countries for which data is available. This may have been due to a combination of weaker trade unions, labour-saving technology, openness to trade and the pressures arising from the financial of markets. Whatever the cause, the imbalance between increasing profits and stagnating wages has contributed to the crisis by creating an explosive mixture of high liquidity on financial markets, low rates of interest, and huge household debts. A system of bonuses which distorted incentives towards short-term risk provided the additional dynamite. For a more stable future, we should identify policies which ensure that productivity growth - when it is back - translates into adequate increases in wages for a majority, and not just higher bonuses for a few. Only this way can advanced economies achieve more sustainable patterns of consumption and investment.<br />

D. Economic collapse causes extinction<br />
Mead 09 [Walter Russell, Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, “Only Makes You Stronger: Why the recession bolstered America.” New Republic, February 4]<br />
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />

<h2 id="toc4"><a name="Full Text Info-Flex Cap CP 1NC"></a>Flex Cap CP 1NC</h2>
The United States Federal Government should make the annual H-1B visa cap flexible and based on annual labor market analysis, providing H-1B visas to employers that can demonstrate a shortage in the occupation for which they are applying for H-1B visas, defining a shortage as having adult unemployment rates below the national unemployment rate. The United States Federal Government should provide expanded oversight authority to the Department of Labor, including subpoena power for employer records and baseline compliance evaluations.<br />
<br />
CP solves case while avoiding our wage deflation DA.<br />
Vernon M. Briggs, Jr., Emeritus Professor of Labor and Human Resource Economics at Cornell University, “Immigration Policy in Free Societies: Are There Principles Involved or Is It All Politics?” November 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cis.org/immigration-principles" rel="nofollow">http://www.cis.org/immigration-principles</a> <br />
<br />
There should be limits on these entries, however, as immigration should never be permitted to undercut the wage and benefit levels that are needed to provide incentives to persons to invest in their own human-capital preparation and for communities to expend the tax revenues to provide such learning opportunities. But, in those occupations in which the adult unemployment rates are significantly below the national unemployment rates for all adult workers, immigration can play a supportive role to augment the need for a greater skilled labor supply. In the process, the productivity of the labor force is enhanced and economic growth for society is encouraged. But, inviting skilled immigrants to gain permanent residence and citizenship is not the preferred route to augmenting the skill levels of the labor force. It should always be considered a supplemental route to be used only when real labor shortages can be demonstrated. “Brain-draining” other countries of their highly skilled human resources should never be seen as a reliable or socially useful long-term strategy. <br />
The number of such employment-based skilled immigrants should be flexible but the tendency always should be to reduce the number downward as circumstances change in order to encourage domestic education and training programs to increase their graduates in the shortage occupations. Hitting a legislated entry cap (such as provided in the Immigration Act of 1990) in a specific year, therefore, should not warrant a conclusion that the existing cap is too low. A cap is a cap. A shortage in the short run should not mean automatically that more skilled immigrants be admitted. First recourse should always be to allow market forces to signal the domestic education and training system to respond. If over time it is clear that these systems cannot provide more graduates or that demographic shifts such as an aging population or declining fertility rates will adversely affect future skill availability, the numbers (that is, the cap) for skilled immigrants can be raised. <br />

Expanding oversight solves loopholes.<br />

Given the limited nature of Labor’s review of LCAs, the Congress should consider streamlining the H-1B approval process by eliminating the separate requirement that employers first submit an LCA to Labor for certification. Instead, the Congress could require employers to submit an LCA and the I-129 petition simultaneously to INS, which will continue to review and evaluate the information contained on both the LCA and the petition. If the Congress wished to broaden Labor’s enforcement authority and improve its ability to enforce relevant provisions in the H-1B law, it could consider, at a minimum, giving Labor’s WHD subpoena power to obtain employers’ records during investigations under the H-1B program. It could also consider allowing Labor to perform baseline evaluations to determine the extent of employers’ compliance with H-1B requirements and conduct subsequent targeted efforts to address suspected noncompliance or abuse.<br />

The Netherlands Provides Refugees with living and health necessities from the beginning, incorporating refugees into society quickly and more efficiently, solving the case and takes them off [Insert Country’s Name] hands<br />

<br />
Refugees were shown a video on daily life in the Netherlands; many had practical questions about topics ranging from the weather to housing, from the use of washing machines to health care services, from cycling to access to work. &quot;It was useful because we learned about life and our rights in the Netherlands,&quot; remembered teenage boy Malega, who attended the course. At the end of the training – now a standard component of the Dutch resettlement process – each participant received a certificate. After their arrival at Amsterdam airport, the immediate destination for the refugees was AZC Amersfoort, a reception centre where resettled refugees live until housing is allocated in a Dutch municipality. As residents of the centre, they receive additional cultural and language induction courses to help them prepare for integration in the Netherlands. Dutch classes at various levels are available, including a specific course for illiterate resettled refugees. In three months, the refugees will have a formal identity card, a bank account and a house in a Dutch municipality. The Dutch government began placing refugees in groups based on two main criteria: the refugees have the same nationality and come from the same camp, having been selected during the same resettlement mission. This benefits the refugees, who know each other before arrival. It is also appreciated by the receiving municipalities, which see resettlement in groups helps integration. The Netherlands was one of the first European countries to implement a refugee resettlement plan, starting in 1984. Since 1987, this country has welcomed 500 &quot;invited refugees&quot; each year.<br />

Travel arrangements to the resettlement country are paid for by the Nordic states and are arranged in cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The resettlement country's local embassy or mission undertakes the issuance of relevant and necessary travel documentation. At times the Nordic countries' embassies help each other when one state lacks a diplomatic presence in the specific country of asylum. Upon arrival in a Nordic country, the refugees are normally settled in an apartment or house, and only in rare situations do local communities have to offer temporary housing in a reception facility. None of the Nordic countries require that the refugees undergo medical check-ups before acceptance for resettlement, or before departure from the country of asylum. Upon entering the country of resettlement, all refugees are offered a thorough medical examination paid for by the state. All refugees are entitled to free health care on equal terms with the rest of the population. All refugees are offered the opportunity to participate in an introduction program. The lengths and contents of these programs vary from country to country, but commonly the introduction plans all offer language training, cultural programs, vocational training, and other elements aimed at integrating the refugee into the society of his/her new country. In Denmark, participation is mandatory for all (unemployed) refugees for the first three years. Failure to attend may have a negative effect on the amount of public relief received and the eventual acquisition of a permanent residence permit and citizenship. Refugees in all the Nordic countries have access to the regular education system, which for all students is paid for by the state. <br />

Refugees that Resettle in The Netherlands have full Government and Public Support to Succeed <br />
Selm ’03 (Joanne van Selm, Migration Policy Institute (Washington DC) and Institute for Migration and Ethnic Studies (University of Amsterdam), Report: “Public-Private Partnerships in Refugee Resettlement: Europe and US, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/d007516151387x30/fulltext.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com/content/d007516151387x30/fulltext.pdf</a>, accessed: 8/21/10). <br />

A refugee being resettled to the Netherlands is faced with a whole range of organizations from the moment of arrival, some government, others nongovernment. All are active in some way where the resettled refugee will first live: a reception centre run by the Centraal Opvang Asielzoekers (COA-Central Reception Asylum-Seekers). The COA is a government body responsible for running all forms of collective housing or shelters for asylum-seekers and refugees in the Netherlands. Asylum-seekers go through various types of reception facilities depending on what stage they have reached in the asylum procedures. There is one type of facility for people who have just arrived and lodged their claim and another for people whose claim is being handled and for those who have been recently accepted as refugees before they are helped to find housing. The COA is also responsible for paying the weekly allowance to refugees, which is set out in the Regeling verstrekking asielzoekers (rule on assistance to asylum seekers). In the centre where a resettled refugee first lives, there will also be people whose asylum claim is in procedure, people who have just been accepted as refugees after applying for asylum, and people whose claim to asylum has been rejected. Some may be from the same country and/or ethnic group as the resettled refugee. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND in Dutch) is part of the Justice Ministry and is responsible for granting status to refugees. All invited refugees have a residence permit for one year on arrival, which can be renewed twice. On paper, only if the situation in their country of origin has not changed at the end of those three years are they granted a permanent residence status. In fact the regulations say that they will receive a permanent residence permit, which is logical given that resettlement is a durable solution. So they do not need to have direct contact with the IND until they have been in the country for three years unless there is some question about their status. The Foreigners' Service, another part of the Justice Ministry located in police stations, actually gives documentation to resettled refugees. The Dutch Refugee Council has offices in almost all municipalities and in the reception centres. This independent NGO, with 10,000 volunteers in a population of ]6 million, assists refugees in finding their way in society. It helps with questions about employment, education, housing, and so forth, but does not provide any of these services. Rather, it provides an information service for refugees to find their way to government-provided or assisted services. The MedicaI Reception of Asylum Seekers (MRA), a suborganization of the national government body responsible for health care, is also present in each of the reception centres. They do not provide medical services other than nurses' consultations: every refugee is helped to find a regular family practitioner, dentist, and other appropriate physicians and has the same access to health care as all Dutch citizens. Medical bills are covered by state-managed insurance until their income reaches a relatively high benchmark. The MRA is in the reception centres to advise and help the refugees to find the appropriate medical practitioners for their needs. Both the Dutch Red Cross (an NGO) and IOM (an interstate organization) are also available to refugees to assist them respectively with tracing family members and arranging the movement of those family members to the Netherlands as appropriate. In addition, an IOM representative is at the airport to greet newly arriving invited refugees and ensure they come through immigration and customs controls and to the reception centre, or to family members, to begin their life in the Netherlands.
