 Next Page is our Pre-empts and Transnationalism Arguments<br />
First – The assimiliationist and exclusion schools of migration studies are dead – they’ve been taken-over by the “transnational” school. This turns the assumptions of most Neg K’s.<br />
Vertovec ‘1 (Steven Vertovec is Research Reader in Social Anthropology at Oxford University and Director of the Economic and Social Research Council's Research Programme on Transnational Communities – Transnationalism and identity. Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 27(4), 573–582. Obtained via Academic One File)<br />
Researchers on migration have almost …identities and networks' (2000: 11).<br />
Second – Here’s a definition of the transnational school:<br />

Third – most critical migration scholarship is dated and does not apply to temporary residents. The assimilation school is wrong – transnationalism defies static borders <br />
Portes ’99 (et al, Professor Alejandro Portes is The Howard Harrison and Gabrielle Snyder Beck Professor of Sociology and director of the Center for Migration and Development at Princeton University, Princeton, USA – Ethnic and Racial Studies Volume 22 Number 2 March 1999)<br />
In keeping with the assumption that labour stays local, … both sending and receiving countries. <br />
Fourth – The TEMPORARY nature of H1B’s boosts transnationalism<br />

The discussion in this section has … areas of state interest. <br />
Independent of transnationalism, we’d like to characterize our plan:<br />
First – Plan is pure Negative-State action because it has to be.<br />
Most Neg K’s assume we actively hand out more visas. We can’t – aff’s can only reverse pro-active state limits – visas are an inherently reactive process. <br />

This book assumes that political thinking …—resistance is its negative pole. <br />
Embracing anti-politics turns their project and cedes politics to the right. <br />
Boggs ’97 (CARL BOGGS – Professor and Ph.D. Political Science, National University, Los Angeles -- Theory and Society 26: 741-780)<br />

<h2 id="toc19"><a name="Complexity-Plan"></a>Plan</h2>
 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">The United States Federal Government ought to remove the current limitation on numbers for the items mentioned in section g(1)(A) of United States Code Title 8, 1184.</span><br />
<h2 id="toc20"><a name="Complexity-Pre-Empts"></a>Pre-Empts</h2>
 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Next is our characterization of the plan and K pre-empts:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">First – Plan is pure Negative-State action because it has to be.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Most Neg K’s assume we actively hand out more visas. We can’t – aff’s can only reverse pro-active state limits – visas are an inherently reactive process. </span><br />
<span class="cite">D. o. S. ’10 </span>(U.S. Department of State via FindLaw – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://immigration.findlaw.com/immigration/immigration-visa/immigration-visa-obtaining.html" rel="nofollow">http://immigration.findlaw.com/immigration/immigration-visa/immigration-visa-obtaining.html</a>)<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For years</span> <span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">the U</span></span>nited <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">S</span></span>tates of America<br />
There is no guarantee of obtaining a visa. <br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Second – the neg K’s still LINK – but they’re only DISADS about the EFFECT of the plan </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If immigration assimilates or commodifies, or capitalists exploit migrant labors – they might be disads to the aff – BUT NOT TO LIFTING THE CAP. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The <em>effect</em> of plan may be commodification or capitalism – just as the effect of the plan may be a domestic malthus disad or a hege advantage.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Absent K’s of our reps, this characterization of the plan makes it incoherent for negs to say why our “immigration good” args are secondary or irrelevant, and only “immigration bad” args should ‘matter’. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Third – This radically changes <u>the role of the alt</u> and <u>the world that emerges post-the-perm</u></span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If they K immigration, economics, or American privilege, then they are RUNNING A DISAD AND THEN RUNNING AN ALT TO SOLVE THE IMPACTS of the EFFECT of the plan </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To analogize, they’re running the domestic Malthus DA and then running a counterplan to solve US consumption </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The plan DOES NOT commit to the squo ideologies or approach to immigration. It begs the question, do their authors REALLY want an exclusionary cap on migration? We can live in the world of their alternative AND lift the cap.</span><br />
