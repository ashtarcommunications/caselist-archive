No economic recovery?no good jobs<br />
Herbert 10<br />
[Bob Herbert, ?A Recovery?s Long Odds?, The New York Times, 9-13-2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/opinion/14herbert.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/opinion/14herbert.html</a>]<br />
We can keep wishing and hoping for a powerful economic recovery to pull the U.S. out of its doldrums, but I wouldn?t count on it. Ordinary American families no longer have the purchasing power to build a strong recovery and keep it going. Americans are not being honest with themselves about the structural changes in the economy that have bestowed fabulous wealth on a tiny sliver at the top, while undermining the living standards of the middle class and absolutely crushing the poor. Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans have a viable strategy for reversing this dreadful state of affairs. (There is no evidence the G.O.P. even wants to.) Robert Reich, in his new book, ?Aftershock,? gives us one of the clearest explanations to date of what has happened ? how the United States went from what he calls ?the Great Prosperity? of 1947 to 1975 to the Great Recession that has hobbled the U.S. economy and darkened the future of younger Americans. He gives the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve credit for moving quickly in terms of fiscal and monetary policies to prevent the economic crash of 2008 from driving the U.S. into a second great depression. ?But,? he writes, ?we did not learn the larger lesson of the 1930s: that when the distribution of income gets too far out of whack, the economy needs to be reorganized so the broad middle class has enough buying power to rejuvenate the economy over the longer term.? The middle class is finally on its knees. Jobs are scarce and good jobs even scarcer. Government and corporate policies have been whacking working Americans every which way for the past three or four decades. While globalization and technological wizardry were wreaking employment havoc, the movers and shakers in government and in the board rooms of the great corporations were embracing privatization and deregulation with the fervor of fanatics. The safety net was shredded, unions were brutally attacked and demonized, employment training and jobs programs were eliminated, higher education costs skyrocketed, and the nation?s infrastructure, a key to long-term industrial and economic health, deteriorated. It?s a wonder matters aren?t worse.<br />

Any growth is unsustainable<br />
Kruger and Hays 10<br />
[Daniel Kruger and Kathleen Hays, ?U.S. Economy?s Downturn ?Escape Velocity? Growing, Pimco?s Crescenzi Says?, Bloomberg, 9-14-2010]<br />
A gain in retail sales for a second month shows the economy is beginning to accelerate, according to Tony Crescenzi, a portfolio manager and strategist at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, California. ?The economy does have some degree of escape velocity in that the movement beyond fiscal stimulus and inventory investment requires consumers to go out and spend,? Crescenzi said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio?s ?The Hays Advantage? with Kathleen Hays. Sales at U.S. retailers climbed 0.4 percent in August after rising 0.3 percent in the previous month, the Commerce Department reported today. Bigger back-to-school discounts, an increase in the number of states offering tax-free holidays and the restoration of extended jobless benefits may have helped boost demand. The economy still needs increases in job growth before economic growth can reach a self-sustaining ?virtuous cycle,? said Crescenzi, whose firm operates the world?s biggest bond fund. ?It?s important that this degree of escape velocity has occurred, but you could say the ship is not far enough in orbit to believe it will stay in orbit.? The economy has added an average of 90,000 jobs each month since the start of the year after posting gains in payrolls in November for the first time since December 2007. ?Still Undershooting? ?We?re still undershooting the job growth that?s necessary to maintain this escape velocity,? Crescenzi said.<br />

Evans-Pritchard 10<br />
[Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, ?No defence left against double-dip recession, says Nouriel Roubini?, Telegraph UK, 9-5-2010]<br />
?The US has run out of bullets,? said Nouriel Roubini, professor at New York University, and one of a caste of luminaries with grim forecasts at the annual Ambrosetti conference on Lake Como. ?More quantitative easing (bond purchases) by the Federal Reserve is not going to make any difference. Treasury yields are already down to 2.5pc yet credit spreads are widening again. Monetary policy can boost liquidity but it can?t deal with solvency problems,? he told Europe?s policy elite. Dr Roubini said the US growth rate was likely to fall below 1pc in the second half of the year, despite the biggest stimulus in history: a cut in interest rates from 5pc to zero, a budget deficit of 10pc of GDP, and $3 trillion to shore up the financial system. The anaemic pace compares with rates of 4pc-6pc at this stage of recovery in normal post-war recoveries. ?We have reached stall speed. Any shock at this point can tip you back into recession. With interbank spreads rising, you can get a vicious circle like 2008-2009,? he said, describing a self-feeding process as the real economy and the credit system hurt each other. ?There is a 40pc chance of double-dip recession in the US, and worse in Japan. Even if it is not technically a recession it will feel like it,? he added. Hans-Werner Sinn, head of Germany?s IFO Institute, said the US would have to purge its debt excesses the hard way. ?The bitter truth is that there is no way out of this with monetary and fiscal policy. They will just have to see their living standards go down. I see a decade of difficulties for the US,? he said.<br />

Entrepreneurs key to avoid recession<br />
Kaufmann Foundation for Entrepreneurship 10<br />
[?2010 State of Entrepreneurship Address?, January 19 2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedfiles/state_of_entrepreneurship_2010.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.kauffman.org/uploadedfiles/state_of_entrepreneurship_2010.pdf</a>]<br />
In a new poll we just completed, entrepreneurs paint a pretty grim picture. One-third of entrepreneurs tell us they have had to reduce their head counts in the past year, and close to two-thirds have seen their sales volume decrease. Two-thirds have seen their profitability decline as well. Additionally, and this is very worrisome, over 70 percent of entrepreneurs say that they don?t expect to add additional employees this year. Worse, with this continuing unemployment, consumers are understandably nervous about spending. In such an environment, it won?t just be more government spending that will get consumers to open their wallets?responsibly, I might add, we don?t want consumers overdoing it, as too many were pre-crisis by using their houses as ATMs. But this responsible spending, both here and abroad, won?t happen until consumers are once again excited to spend?not on the things that were around before the housing bubble popped, but on novel products and services. Once these are developed and widely commercialized, a virtuous cycle can begin. As consumers spend more, businesses have reason to invest and hire. And the more hiring that occurs, the higher incomes and spending will be. And then we will have the recovery we all want and are waiting for. But to get this virtuous ball rolling we need? guess who?entrepreneurs, who are responsible for most of the breakthrough products that have changed our lives for the better. We need entrepreneurs for today?s breakthroughs in energy generation?only they will develop and commercialize the successor to petroleum. We need breakthroughs in health and medicine?and only entrepreneurs will bend the cost curve and continue to extend life expectancy. Entrepreneurs also will continue to provide services we need and want, such as Rosetta Stone, Zappos, and Mint.com. We could wait for history to repeat itself, to generate the future Fortune 500, as entrepreneurs have done in previous downturns. But with another 85,000 jobs lost last month, I, for one, would be much more comfortable if we had some policies to help history along. Here, then, are some big ideas in that spirit.<br />

Immigrant entrepreneurs are key to solve innovation and unemployment<br />

Immigrant entrepreneurs are an engine of jobs and growth. We need more of them. While fast-growing companies have long been the main source of new jobs and innovation, this country makes it outrageously difficult for immigrants to launch new companies here. This doesn?t make any sense. After all, Google, Pfizer, Intel, Yahoo, DuPont, eBay and Procter &amp; Gamble are all former start-ups founded by immigrants. Where would this country be today without their world-changing innovations? Immigrants have not only founded big, well-known companies. Foreign-born residents made up just 12.5% of the U.S. population in 2008. But nearly 40% of technology company founders and 52% of founders of companies in Silicon Valley. Yet we don?t seem to care. We send recent, foreign-born university science and engineering graduates back to their own countries after their student visas expire?unless these creative sorts are willing to spend some of the most entrepreneurial years of their lives working in a big company under an H-1B visa after they finish their studies. For those who studied elsewhere, but who nonetheless want to bring their job-creating ideas here, American policies treat them?the job-creating, trouble-making innovators that they are?as a cross between deadbeats and queue-jumpers. Why can?t they wait in line like everyone else to get a visa in five years or so? What?s their hurry? Their hurry is Joseph Schumpeter?s hurry: They want to hustle out and disrupt markets when the opportunity arises. In the 21st century those opportunities don?t wait for our interminable, employment-based visa programs. As a result rather than saying &quot;Come and create jobs here&quot; we, in effect, tell them to shove off. Come back when you have a few million in sales? at which point they will be rooted elsewhere and creating jobs somewhere else. That needs to end now. Immigrants who come here to create companies create jobs. We need the jobs.<br />

Message: If we want to bring down unemployment in a sustainable way, neither rescuing General Motors nor funding more road construction will do it. We need to create a big bushel of new companies ? fast. We?ve got to get more Americans working again for their own dignity ? and to generate the rising incomes and wealth we need to pay for existing entitlements, as well as all the new investments we?ll need to make. It was just reported that Social Security this year will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes ? a red line we were not expected to cross until at least 2016. But you cannot say this often enough: Good-paying jobs don?t come from bailouts. They come from start-ups. And where do start-ups come from? They come from smart, creative, inspired risk-takers. How do we get more of those? There are only two ways: grow more by improving our schools or import more by recruiting talented immigrants. Surely, we need to do both, and we need to start by breaking the deadlock in Congress over immigration, so we can develop a much more strategic approach to attracting more of the world?s creative risk-takers. ?Roughly 25 percent of successful high-tech start-ups over the last decade were founded or co-founded by immigrants,? said Litan. Think Sergey Brin, the Russian-born co-founder of Google, or Vinod Khosla, the India-born co-founder of Sun Microsystems. That is no surprise. After all, Craig Mundie, the chief research and strategy officer of Microsoft, asks: What made America this incredible engine of prosperity? It was immigration, plus free markets. Because we were so open to immigration ? and immigrants are by definition high-aspiring risk-takers, ready to leave their native lands in search of greater opportunities ? ?we as a country accumulated a disproportionate share of the world?s high-I.Q. risk-takers.?<br />

Plan spurs high-tech innovation and economic productivity<br />

High-Tech Immigrant Entrepreneurship in the United States Executive Summary In this study, we quantify the role of immigrants in high-tech entrepreneurship in the United States. We report the results of a survey of a nationally representative sample of rapidly growing high-impact, high-tech companies.1 This group of companies is very important to the U.S. economy, because they account for a disproportionate share of job creation and economic growth. We find that about 16% of the companies in our sample had at least one foreign-born person among their founding teams. This estimate is lower than that found in most previous studies of high-tech immigrant entrepreneurship. Nonetheless, our data show that immigrants play a crucial role in this vital economic activity. High-impact, high-tech companies founded by immigrant entrepreneurs and those founded by native-born entrepreneurs in our sample are similar in many ways. They operate in the same industries and are about the same size. One important difference between the two is their location. Immigrant-founded companies tend to be located in states that have large immigrant populations. Another difference is that immigrant-founded companies in our sample are about twice as likely as native-founded companies to state that they have a strategic relationship with a foreign firm, such as a major supplier, key partner, or major customer. Immigrant-founded companies may also have a higher level of technological performance than native-founded companies, although the evidence on this issue is not conclusive. This study sheds light on high-tech immigrant entrepreneurs as individuals as well as on the companies that they helped to found. The vast majority of these individuals are strongly rooted in the United States. A large proportion of them have lived in this country for two decades or more. More than three-quarters of them are U.S. citizens. Two-thirds of them received undergraduate or graduate degrees here. The 250 foreign-born entrepreneurs on whom we have data hail from 54 countries in all regions of the world. India is the largest source country, accounting for 16% of this group, followed by the U.K. at 10%. Policymakers are rightly concerned that government should sustain a healthy climate for starting and running high-impact, high-tech companies like those in our sample. Immigration policy, as it affects highly educated and highly experienced foreign-born individuals who might be drawn into high-tech entrepreneurship, is an important element of that climate. 6 High-Tech Immigrant Entrepreneurship in the United States 1.0 Introduction A vigorous high-technology sector is vital to sustain U.S. prosperity in the 21st century. The new products, services, and business models that the high-tech sector generates differentiate this nation?s output from that of the rest of the world and enable capital accumulation, wage gains, and productivity growth. A high level of entrepreneurship, by which we mean the founding of new businesses, makes the high-tech sector vigorous. High-tech entrepreneurs, by which we mean the founders of new high-tech businesses, take risks that managers of existing high-tech businesses choose not to take and recognize opportunities that they fail to spot. High-tech entrepreneurship requires a rare combination of inclinations, capabilities, and resources. Half of new businesses fail within five years (Shane 2008), so founders must be optimistic, but also capable of weathering severe challenges. Because the opportunities in high-tech sectors blend together technological and market factors, individual entrepreneurs and founding teams in these sectors typically combine technical expertise rooted in formal education with market savvy that flows from extensive business experience. They must also be able to tap quickly and effectively into networks of customers, suppliers, expertise, finance, and talent as business opportunities ripen. Foreign-born individuals play an important role in U.S. high-tech entrepreneurship. By virtue of having left their native land, they may have entrepreneurial inclinations. Their large presence in American higher education and the U.S. labor force, especially science and engineering disciplines and occupations, equips them with valuable knowledge that bears on high-tech innovation. Their outsider status may allow them, in some cases, to recognize ?out-of-the box? opportunities that native-born individuals with similar knowledge and skills do not perceive. These capabilities may be linked to unique entrepreneurial resources, such as access to partners, customers, and suppliers in their countries of origin. In this study, we quantify the role of immigrants2 in high-tech entrepreneurship in a nationally representative sample of rapidly growing ?high-impact? companies (HICs). This class of companies drives job creation and aggregate growth in the United States. We find that, while most previous studies have overstated the role of immigrants in high-tech entrepreneurship, it is nonetheless very important. For instance, about 16% of the companies in our sample had at least one foreign-born entrepreneur among their founding teams, and these high-tech companies display better performance in some respects than high-tech companies in our sample whose founders were all native-born. We also provide a profile of high-tech immigrant entrepreneurs. The vast majority are strongly rooted in the United States. Most of them received their highest educational degree here and have become citizens. 8 Our report begins by situating the subject of high-tech immigrant entrepreneurship in policy and analytical debates about immigration, entrepreneurship, and technology-based economic development. We then describe our methods and findings. We conclude by highlighting the research and policy agendas that our work illuminates. 2.0 Policy Context Our research brings together two important areas of public policy: technology-based economic development (TBED) and immigration. In both areas, recent research points to new ways to achieve desirable policy outcomes. The linkages between them are just beginning to be explored. 2.1 Technological Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Economic Growth The importance of technological innovation in economic growth is by now firmly established. Well-understood by classical economists, technology?s contribution to the economy began to be conceptualized and measured after World War II by modern economists such as Solow (1957), Griliches (1958), Nelson (1959), and Arrow (1962). Applied economists in fields like industrial organization (Scherer 1984) and agricultural economics (Ruttan 2001) sustained this agenda, and they have been joined in recent years by formal theorists such as Romer (1990) and Lucas (1988). As McCraw (2007) has written, the twenty-first century is shaping up to be ?Schumpeter?s Century,? a tribute to Joseph A. Schumpeter (1942), the towering figure whose work on technological innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth in the first half of the twentieth century set the stage for the advances of the post-World War II period. 9 Early studies of technology and economic growth in the post-World War II period centered on the contributions of formal R&amp;D. Economic dynamism in these decades was perceived to flow from the investments made by large organizations with big R&amp;D budgets, including public agencies, like the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and multinational companies, such as IBM and General Electric. In his 1952 book American Capitalism, John Kenneth Galbraith described the large company as an ?an almost perfect instrument? of technological development. Galbraith argued that oligopoly provided a sufficient level of competition to stimulate innovation, while also assuring an adequate resource flow to fund large-scale R&amp;D operations and sufficient confidence that the benefits of these investments would be reaped by firms that built such operations. This conventional wisdom was not entirely accurate. Beneath the giant redwoods of the Fortune 500, the industrial landscape of the United States contained a thriving undergrowth of smaller and newer companies in the 1950s and 1960s, including some seedlings that would grow into giants themselves, toppling their elders as they did so (Acs and Audretsch 1990). The post-World War II period heralded not only the expansion of large U.S.-based multinational companies but also the invention of whole new institutional forms, such as the venture capital firm and the high-tech start-up, which would eventually blossom into a unique entrepreneurial ecology in places like California?s Silicon Valley and Boston?s Route 128 (Kenney 2000, Hsu and Kenney 2005). Indeed, the environment in the United States for high-growth, high-tech start-up companies grew more hospitable over time, culminating in the entrepreneurial frenzy of the dot-com boom at the end of the twentieth century. 10 Recent research suggests that high-growth entrepreneurship is linked to a variety of important economic outcomes. Acs and Audretsch and their collaborators have shown in several studies that business start-ups are associated with economic growth at the regional and national levels. For instance, Acs and Mueller (2008) demonstrate that sustained economic benefits from entrepreneurship at the regional level derive mainly from young (two to five years old), medium-sized (20 to 499 employees) enterprises and not from small businesses in general or the establishment of branch plants of large firms. Haltiwanger (2009) provides evidence that companies that are less than five years old account for nearly all net job creation in the United States. Autio (2005) summarizes a variety of studies (including Wong, Ho, and Autio 2005) showing that 1-10% of new firms generate 40-75% of new jobs. Henrekson and Johansson (2008, 14) summarize the ?clear-cut result? in empirical literature covering several countries, including the United States: ?a few rapidly growing companies generate a disproportionately large share of all new net jobs?? In addition, as Scherer (1992) points out, competition from new entrants, even if they fail, forces their older rivals to adapt or die and thus drives productivity growth across the broader economy. Although young, high-growth companies are present in a wide variety of industries, the dynamics of those in high-technology sectors are especially important for scholars and policymakers to understand. These companies are more likely than others to be pursuing opportunities associated with radical innovations that produce positive knowledge externalities and that may have transformative consequences for society (Baumol, Litan, and Schramm 2007). Because such opportunities are so challenging and so risky, existing 11 businesses are particularly unlikely to find out about them or to pursue them (Utterback 1994, Christensen and Rosenbloom 1995). High-technology start-ups are one of the main organizational vehicles by which new knowledge in the science and engineering disciplines is converted into economic benefits (Acs, et al. 2005, Acs, Audretsch, and Strom 2009).<br />

I usually avoid politics, but since we now seem to have an administration that's open to suggestions, I'm going to risk making one. The single biggest thing the government could do to increase the number of startups in this country is a policy that would cost nothing: establish a new class of visa for startup founders.?The biggest constraint on the number of new startups that get created in the US is not tax policy or employment law or even Sarbanes-Oxley. It's that we won't let the people who want to start them into the country.??Letting just 10,000 startup founders into the country each year could have a visible effect on the economy. If we assume 4 people per startup, which is probably an overestimate, that's 2500 new companies. Each year. They wouldn't all grow as big as Google, but out of 2500 some would come close.??By definition these 10,000 founders wouldn't be taking jobs from Americans: it could be part of the terms of the visa that they couldn't work for existing companies, only new ones they'd founded. In fact they'd cause there to be more jobs for Americans, because the companies they started would hire more employees as they grew.<br />

US key to the global economy<br />
Caploe 09<br />
(David Caploe is CEO of the Singapore-incorporated American Centre for Applied Liberal Arts and Humanities in Asia., ?Focus still on America to lead global recovery?, April 7, The Strait Times, lexis)<br />
IN THE aftermath of the G-20 summit, most observers seem to have missed perhaps the most crucial statement of the entire event, made by United States President Barack Obama at his pre-conference meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown: 'The world has become accustomed to the US being a voracious consumer market, the engine that drives a lot of economic growth worldwide,' he said. 'If there is going to be renewed growth, it just can't be the US as the engine.' While superficially sensible, this view is deeply problematic. To begin with, it ignores the fact that the global economy has in fact been 'America-centred' for more than 60 years. Countries - China, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Korea, Mexico and so on - either sell to the US or they sell to countries that sell to the US. This system has generally been advantageous for all concerned. America gained certain historically unprecedented benefits, but the system also enabled participating countries - first in Western Europe and Japan, and later, many in the Third World - to achieve undreamt-of prosperity. At the same time, this deep inter-connection between the US and the rest of the world also explains how the collapse of a relatively small sector of the US economy - 'sub-prime' housing, logarithmically exponentialised by Wall Street's ingenious chicanery - has cascaded into the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. To put it simply, Mr Obama doesn't seem to understand that there is no other engine for the world economy - and hasn't been for the last six decades. If the US does not drive global economic growth, growth is not going to happen. Thus, US policies to deal with the current crisis are critical not just domestically, but also to the entire world. Consequently, it is a matter of global concern that the Obama administration seems to be following Japan's 'model' from the 1990s: allowing major banks to avoid declaring massive losses openly and transparently, and so perpetuating 'zombie' banks - technically alive but in reality dead. As analysts like Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have pointed out, the administration's unwillingness to confront US banks is the main reason why they are continuing their increasingly inexplicable credit freeze, thus ravaging the American and global economies.<br />

(Walter Russell, ?Only Makes You Stronger,? The New Republic, 2/4/09,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&amp;p=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&amp;p=2</a>)<br />
The damage to China's position is more subtle. The crisis has not--yet--led to the nightmare scenario that China-watchers fear: a recession or slowdown producing the kind of social unrest that could challenge the government. That may still come to pass--the recent economic news from China has been consistently worse than most experts predicted--but, even if the worst case is avoided, the financial crisis has nevertheless had significant effects. For one thing, it has reminded China that its growth remains dependent on the health of the U.S. economy. (continued?) A deceleration in China's long-term growth rate would postpone indefinitely the date when China could emerge as a peer competitor to the United States. The present global distribution of power could be changing slowly, if at all. The greatest danger both to U.S.-China relations and to American power itself is probably not that China will rise too far, too fast; it is that the current crisis might end China's growth miracle. In the worst-case scenario, the turmoil in the international economy will plunge China into a major economic downturn. The Chinese financial system will implode as loans to both state and private enterprises go bad. Millions or even tens of millions of Chinese will be unemployed in a country without an effective social safety net. The collapse of asset bubbles in the stock and property markets will wipe out the savings of a generation of the Chinese middle class. The political consequences could include dangerous unrest--and a bitter climate of anti-foreign feeling that blames others for China's woes. (Think of Weimar Germany, when both Nazi and communist politicians blamed the West for Germany's economic travails.) Worse, instability could lead to a vicious cycle, as nervous investors moved their money out of the country, further slowing growth and, in turn, fomenting ever-greater bitterness. Thanks to a generation of rapid economic growth, China has so far been able to manage the stresses and conflicts of modernization and change; nobody knows what will happen if the growth stops. India's future is also a question. Support for global integration is a fairly recent development in India, and many serious Indians remain skeptical of it. While India's 60-year-old democratic system has resisted many shocks, a deep economic recession in a country where mass poverty and even hunger are still major concerns could undermine political order, long-term growth, and India's attitude toward the United States and global economic integration. The violent Naxalite insurrection plaguing a significant swath of the country could get worse; religious extremism among both Hindus and Muslims could further polarize Indian politics; and India's economic miracle could be nipped in the bud. If current market turmoil seriously damaged the performance and prospects of India and China, the current crisis could join the Great Depression in the list of economic events that changed history, even if the recessions in the West are relatively short and mild. The United States should stand ready to assist Chinese and Indian financial authorities on an emergency basis--and work very hard to help both countries escape or at least weather any economic downturn. It may test the political will of the Obama administration, but the United States must avoid a protectionist response to the economic slowdown. U.S. moves to limit market access for Chinese and Indian producers could poison relations for years. For billions of people in nuclear-armed countries to emerge from this crisis believing either that the United States was indifferent to their well-being or that it had profited from their distress could damage U.S. foreign policy far more severely than any mistake made by George W. Bush. (continued???) This may be happening yet again. None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />

Scenario 2: Economic Leadership<br />
<br />
Visa restrictions on entrepreneurs are crushing U.S. economic leadership<br />

[Howard Lindzon in addition to 99 other venture capitalists, Letter to the United States Senate in Support of the Startup Visa, 02-22-2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://startupvisa.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/startup-visa-letter-with-signatures-feb22.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://startupvisa.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/startup-visa-letter-with-signatures-feb22.pdf</a>]<br />
We write to express our support for the Startup Visa. Since the founding of our country, the entrepreneurial spirit has been a defining characteristic of the United States. Today we are the world leader in creating new enterprises, advancing innovation, and creating jobs as a result of this entrepreneurial activity. Fast-growing companies have long been the main source of new jobs and innovation in the United States. However, in recent years our visa laws have made it unnecessarily difficult for immigrants to launch new companies here. We view this as a major competitive disadvantage for our country in the 21st century. Companies such as Google, Pfizer, Intel, Yahoo, DuPont, eBay and Procter &amp; Gamble are all former start-ups founded by immigrants. Yet immigrants have not only founded major, well-known companies. Foreign-born residents made up just 12.5% of the U.S. population in 2008, while nearly 40% of technology company founders and 52% of founders of companies in Silicon Valley are foreign-born. As venture capitalists and angel investors, we often fund companies at their very inception. In cases where there are immigrant founders, it is often impossible for them to get an appropriate visa to stay in the United States and start their company. Even in cases where the founders already have a visa of some sort, they typically can't use this visa to start a company. As a result, they often have to leave our country to start their company, resulting in a loss of innovative entrepreneurs and the correspondingly created jobs in the United States. There are multiple costs to our country and our economy. First, we lose the entrepreneur, who is a critical part of our society. We then lose the jobs that are created by the new venture, which in the success case could easily number in hundreds or thousands over the first decade of the company's life. Finally, we run the risk of losing our reputation as the greatest country in which to start a company. To address this issue, we support the Startup Visa proposal. Early stage companies are often started with funding of at least $250,000. In these situations, if a qualified U.S. venture capital investor or a U.S. &quot;super angel&quot; (an angel investor that has a track record of regularly participating in seed round investments) is willing to commit a significant investment for a foreign entrepreneur to start a company in the United States, we believe the entrepreneur should be able to get a &quot;Startup Visa.&quot; We believe these thresholds are appropriate for creating credible startups which, if successful, can lead to numerous U.S. based jobs. Vanilla (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.vanillaforums.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.vanillaforums.com</a>) is an example of a type of company this visa would apply to. Vanilla has two founders, both Canadian. They spent the summer in Boulder, Colorado as part of the TechStars accelerator program getting advice, help, and mentorship from over 50 U.S. based entrepreneurs and investors. Numerous investors were interested in funding Vanilla and helping them to grow their company from Boulder; however neither founder was able to give investors comfort that they could get an appropriate visa to stay and work in the US. Since then, the founders have relocated to Montreal, raised $500,000, and started their company in Canada. Today, they are adding three people to their team, all based in Montreal. If successful, they will add many more people to the team over the next few years. Each year thousands of foreign entrepreneurs face the same situation that the Vanilla founders faced. All of these entrepreneurs are starting companies with high growth potential where they could be hiring tens or hundreds of employees over the first few years of their company's existence. When Google first started, it was two founders and an idea - today it is one of the most important companies in the world. This is the type of company the Startup Visa proposal is addressing. The U.S. remains one of the most attractive countries for entrepreneurs. It has a culture of risk taking, capital formation, and an economic dynamism that is the envy of the world. This gives us a competitive edge that we should not let slip through our fingers.<br />

There is no greater country on Earth for entrepreneurship than America. In every category, from the high-tech world of Silicon Valley, where I live, to University R&amp;D labs, to countless Main Street small business owners, Americans are taking risks, embracing new ideas and -- most importantly -- creating jobs. America's future prosperity depends on our ability to maintain this lead. But today, it is getting harder and harder to maintain. A quick glance is the rear-view mirror reveals that other countries are catching up and at an alarming rate. Part of this is due to their determination to overtake us, but part is due to structural changes in the nature of entrepreneurship. Startups are the lifeblood of our economy. In the past two decades, they have accounted for nearly all the net job growth in our country. Many of these companies are started by entrepreneurs, and are now household names: Google, Yahoo, eBay and Intel. But many more are true American success stories, out of the limelight, quietly creating jobs and securing our future. Take the example of Indiana's Passageways. Paroon Chadha came to the US for his graduate education, and was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug immediately after school. He started Passageways Inc. immediately upon graduating, and has spent the last 8 years struggling to work around visa restrictions. Luckily for the rest of us, he was able to find his path to a green card, and now employs 24 Americans in West Lafayette, Indiana. For every success story like Paroon's, there are dozens -- hundreds -- of similar cases that end in failure. Like other industries -- from publishing to automobiles -- entrepreneurship is in the process of being disrupted by globalization. The cost of creating new companies is falling rapidly, and access to markets, distribution, and information is within the reach of anyone with an Internet connection. The result is a profound democratization of the digital means of production. When Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created Apple computer in a garage in Palo Alto, it heralded the beginning of the PC revolution that ultimately dealt a death-blow to dozens of older companies. That could only have happened in Silicon Valley or one of a few specialized technology hubs that had the manufacturing, engineering, and software specialists required to build their first products. But when Mark Zuckerberg started Facebook in his dorm room in Boston, he unleashed a revolution, too. But something had changed -- it's our good fortune as Americans that Facebook began in an American dorm, but there is nothing necessary about it. It could have happened elsewhere. And it's our good fortune that Mark was already an American citizen, and so could move to Silicon Valley without difficulty, where he now leads a company that employs hundreds -- and soon, thousands. If the next Facebook, Google, or Amazon begins in another country, the economic growth that it sparks will benefit us, too. But the jobs will be created over there. The United States is locked in a new arms race for that most precious resource -- the future entrepreneurs upon whom economic growth depends. Substantial research shows that immigrants play a key role in American job creation. For example, over 25% of the technology companies founded between 1995-2005 had a key immigrant founder. These companies produced over $52 billion dollars in sales in 2005, and employed 450,000 workers that year. Similarly, 24% of all the patents filed in the US in 2006 had a foreign resident as inventor or co-inventor. If we allow other countries to welcome these immigrants, support them and nurture them, we will lose out in this race. We will not lose on their products -- after all, most of them are global. We will not necessarily harm investors, either: as capital is increasingly global, they will be able to invest wherever good ideas are born. The cost will be felt in jobs -- thousands of new jobs that could have been created here, but weren't.<br />

First, throughout our history we've relied on foreign-born entrepreneurs to help spur economic growth. Nationwide, about a quarter of our technology companies have been founded by immigrants. Here in Massachusetts, some of our most notable tech giants were created by brilliant, visionary immigrants like An Wang of Wang Laboratories, Desh Deshpande of Sycamore Networks, and Ash Dahod, who recently sold Starent Networks to Cisco for nearly three billion dollars. Second, now more than ever, our foreign-born students can return to their home countries to find opportunity. A recent study found that 52 percent of the Chinese students attending U.S. colleges and universities believed they would find greater opportunities if they returned home after graduation. With some 445K students currently enrolled at Massachusetts colleges and universities, we naturally have one of the nation's largest pools of foreign-born students, a disproportionate talent asset that, in turn, can create tremendous innovation and wealth in our Commonwealth. We need to retain every one of those students who is willing to strike out on his or her own to start a company and create new jobs and wealth in our Commonwealth. We believe this tradition of great foreign-born entrepreneurs starting companies and hiring here must be maintained and nurtured if we are to succeed in an increasingly competitive world. As connectivity and talent have become globally available commodities, the barriers that foreign-born entrepreneurs face when starting businesses outside the United States have all but disappeared. To maintain our leadership position, we need the best entrepreneurs -- domestic and foreign-born -- to stay here and build tomorrow's leading technology companies in the Commonwealth.<br />

Immediate EB-5 expansion key to economic leadership<br />
Arrison 10<br />
[Sonia Arrison, ?Silicon Valley's Innovative Approach to Creating American Jobs?, TechNewsWorld, 03-31-2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.technewsworld.com/story/69661.html?wlc=1276702494" rel="nofollow">http://www.technewsworld.com/story/69661.html?wlc=1276702494</a>]<br />
Anytime immigration comes up in public debate, you can be sure there will be protectionist groups ready to pounce, arguing that America should tighten its borders. For instance, the Programmers Guild argues that &quot;the vast majority of start-ups fail,&quot; so visas shouldn't be granted to foreign entrepreneurs because they might not leave the country when their businesses go under. This is a weak argument, since the entrepreneurs will have to leave the country if they want to work at a legitimate job, which these professionals will certainly want to do. Perhaps a more serious argument against the bill came from the Paris-based entrepreneur Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry. Gobry worries that &quot;The Startup Visa Act doesn't actually create new visas. It just takes existing allotted visas, in the EB-5 class,&quot; which allows foreigners into the country if they can invest $500,000 to $1 million in U.S. companies. This is a good point. The U.S. immigration system does still need to be reformed, and this one tweak won't solve everything. Still, around half of the EB-5 visas go unused, and when they are issued, they are more about letting capital into the country rather than talent. The startup visa is a step in the right direction, because it targets talent and clearly incentivizes smart people to create American jobs. Given tough economic times, Congress should act quickly. In an increasingly global world, other countries are getting more aggressive in extending incentives to create their own versions of Silicon Valley. It's time to create more jobs and preserve America's place as the entrepreneurial capital of the world.<br />

Immigration entrepreneurs are vital to a credible economic model<br />

The existing system of immigration into the U.S. is unfriendly to prospective entrepreneurs. The processing of visas and green cards is bureaucratic, and the number of high-skill migrants to the U.S. is capped at an artificially low level. In the meantime, other nations have been reforming in order to compete for highly qualified human capital. As a result, America has been losing its attraction as a ?brain magnet.? The United States should rationalize its immigration system soon, with a special focus on immigrant entrepreneurs. To start, considering that most high-skill immigrants have been attracted to the U.S. for its excellent universities, we must encourage them to stay to create valuable, fast-growing startup firms upon graduation. The U.S. should offer instant citizenship to bright young people from foreign countries who graduate from our universities. We should also refine the EB-5 visa, the so-called ?entrepreneur?s visa.? Instead of requiring prospective immigrants to bring cash into the country (the current rule requires $1,000,000 or $500,000 if the company is in a distressed area), the criteria should embody incentives to attract human capital. In particular, the EB-5 visa process should favor those who plan to come and start companies, with the possibility of extension once the visa holder begins hiring American residents. If bringing cash into the country has proven effective for distressed areas and EB-5 visas are seen as effective, create a new E category ? the Entrepreneurs Visa. It is time to make the U.S. once again a true magnet for entrepreneurs. Reforming our immigration system in a way that attracts innovative ideas and their executors holds great promise for unlocking our nation?s economic potential and assuring sustained economic strength.<br />

Economic leadership prevents global WMD conflicts<br />
Mead 04<br />
[Walter Russell Mead, Henry A. Kissinger Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, ?America's sticky power,? Foreign Policy, March 2004]<br />
THE SUM OF ALL POWERS???The United States' global economic might is therefore not simply, to use Nye's formulations, hard power that compels others or soft power that attracts the rest of the world. Certainly,?the U.S. economic system provides the United?States?with the prosperity needed to underwrite its security strategy, but it also encourages other countries to accept U.S. leadership.?U.S. economic might is sticky power.??How will sticky power help the United States address today's challenges? One pressing need is to ensure that Iraq's economic reconstruction integrates the nation more firmly in the global economy. Countries with open economies develop powerful trade-oriented businesses; the leaders of these businesses can promote economic policies that respect property rights, democracy, and the rule of law. Such leaders also lobby governments to avoid the isolation that characterized Iraq and Libya under economic sanctions. And looking beyond Iraq, the allure of access to Western capital and global markets is one of the few forces protecting the rule of law from even further erosion in Russia.??China's rise?to global prominence?will offer a key test?case?for sticky power. As China develops economically, it should gain wealth that could support a military rivaling that of the United States; China is also gaining political influence in the world. Some analysts in both China and the United States believe that the laws of history mean that Chinese power will someday clash with the reigning U.S. power.??Sticky power offers a way out. China benefits from participating in the U.S. economic system?and integrating itself into the global economy.?Between 1970 and 2003, China's gross domestic product grew from an estimated $106 billion to more than $1.3 trillion. By 2003, an estimated $450 billion of foreign money had flowed into the Chinese economy. Moreover,?China is becoming increasingly dependent on both imports and exports?to keep its economy (and its military machine) going.?Hostilities?between the United States and China?would cripple China's industry, and cut off supplies of oil and other key commodities.?Sticky power works both ways, though.?If China cannot afford war with the United?States,?the United?States?will have an increasingly hard time breaking off commercial relations with China.

Contention 2 Asian Economic Cooperation<br />
<br />
Asia cooperation has transitioned to a new age. Security is now defined in terms of economic cooperation, and the U.S. risks losing it<br />
Feigenbaum 10<br />
[Evan A. Feigenbaum, ?Challenge of a changing Asia?, Business Standard, 9-6-2010]<br />
It?s been a rough six months in East Asia, as tensions ratchet up in Korea, navies drill, and governments, from China to Vietnam, trade barbs, claims and counterclaims to the South China Sea. But even as anxieties grow, it is economics, not security, that still defines the essential strategic reality of Asia today: China is fast becoming the central player in a new economic regionalism. And as economic integration tightens, the US and India risk being left out. For its part, the US has endured decades of loose talk about American ?decline? in Asia. But in the months since North Korea torpedoed a South Korean naval corvette in March, America?s security role has been strongly reinforced. Yet, ironically, that?s part of the problem: Even as America?s security role remains the backbone of strategic stability, the economic pillars of US credibility are eroding across Asia. In the postwar period, US leadership in Asia depended not just on alliances, bases and carrier battle groups. It flowed, too, from a sustained commitment to three economic pillars: market openness, faith in America?s own competitiveness and strong US leadership on international trade agreements and regimes. But all three pillars are now under fierce attack in the US. And this both compounds and further contributes to a rapid erosion of American economic influence, as China becomes the central player in a growing web of trade and financial connections. Take Southeast Asia. From 2000 to 2009, China?s share of Asean?s total trade increased threefold, surpassing that of the US, whose share declined by a third in the same period. Meanwhile, when the dust settles from the current financial crisis, the character of economic globalisation may be significantly changed with respect to capital flows, production chains and trade patterns. Asian countries are moving forward together in various ways ? on trade, financial arrangements, technical standards and investment rules. And increasingly, they are moving forward on a pan-Asian basis and without Washington. This is precisely why American strategy in Asia is simply not sustainable with the kind of trade policy Washington has presently. For generations, deep trade and investment relationships have been the tangible representation of US economic weight in Asia, reflecting a widespread faith in the future economic and strategic strength of the US. This was true in the 19th century, when fast-sailing clipper ships first vaulted America into a role that spanned China, India and the waters betwixt and between. It remains true today. The good news is that US President Barack Obama?s November visit to Seoul has given Washington strong incentives to complete the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement this fall. But there is virtually no prospect that the US will keep pace with Beijing?s burgeoning trade and investment initiatives. And across Asia, anxieties persist about America?s own economic prospects: the scope and nature of its recovery from the financial crisis; its commitment to stave off protectionist sentiment; and whether it can muster a bipartisan political consensus to manage its debts. This offers a cautionary tale for India. Strategically, India has been bottled up in the subcontinent for generations, but it wasn?t always so: Southeast Asia bears the hallmarks of a bygone era in names like ?Indonesia? and ?Indochina?, and Indian sailors once plied the trade routes from the Indian Ocean to the Strait of Malacca. But as it again ?looks East?, India risks being left out in Asia because of the significant mismatch between its lofty strategic goals and more earthbound economic realities. Make no mistake, India?s strategic connections to East Asia are being restored. Yet, this is happening, in large part, because India is widely viewed as a potential ? if still very modest ? counterbalance to Chinese power. Diplomacy and politics remain the central drivers, not least, for example, in the invitation to India to become a more active player in East Asian regional groups. But, at the end of the day, strategic intentions alone cannot sustain a larger role for India in Asia writ large. As America is rediscovering, economic content is essential. Greater economic content to India?s relations with East Asia will be required. And, investment-related reforms will surely be essential, too, to enhance the flow of goods, capital and opportunity. Trade plays a growing role in the Indian economy, and India has signed preferential trade agreements with Asean and South Korea. Yet, scale remains a handicap: 11.6 per cent of Asean?s trade is with China, just 2.5 per cent with India. Meanwhile, the backbone of East Asian economies remains integrated supply and production chains to which India is largely irrelevant. More manufacturing in India?s southern states could mean greater integration into East Asian supply and production chains, or not. Likewise with outbound investment from corporate India: it could, perhaps, transform India?s interactions with Southeast Asia; but, here too, scale remains a handicap. The business of Asia is still business. And India and East Asia have some distance yet to travel.<br />

U.S. economic ties increases immigration and encourages further integration<br />
Yang 10<br />
[Philip Q. Yang, ?A Theory of Asian Immigration to the United States?, Journal of Asian American Studies, Vol. 13, No. 1, February 2010]<br />
However, mere cross-country disparities will not automatically cause migration, and they only serve as potential motivators for migration. There must be forces that initiate migration and forces that sustain it. These initiating and perpetuating forces entail connections at both the macro and micro levels. At the macro level, there must be cross-national connections between sending and receiving countries. In fact, intercountry connections can be conceptualized as a network of countries linked by interactions.61 In the case of Asian immigration to the United States, U.S. involvement in Asian sending countries acts to establish U.S.-Asia ties. U.S. involvement creates a large conducive social environment that makes immigration possible or likely to occur. It helps activate the effect of disparities between the Asian countries and the United States, and it [End Page 18] causes the formation of a pool of potential migrants and the emergence of emigration as an actual option. The higher the level of U.S. involvement in Asian countries, the higher the level of immigration to the United States, ceteris paribus. This is the essence of world system theory.62 Intercountry connections could be economic, military, political, or cultural. Each dimension of these connections or involvements affects immigration to the United States through specific mechanisms. The most common form of U.S.-Asia connections is U.S. economic involvement in Asian countries. U.S. economic involvement includes U.S trade with Asian countries, U.S. direct investment in Asian countries, establishment of U.S.-owned factories in Asia, operation of U.S. transnational corporations in Asia, training of Asian management and technical personnel in the United States or in Asia, and so forth. U.S. economic involvement displaces people from traditional economies and creates an emigrant pool; it heightens potential migrants' awareness of the disparities between the United States and their own country; and it consolidates the objective and ideological linkages with the receiving country.63 Through these mechanisms, U.S. economic involvement becomes a factor pushing Asians to leave their homelands and pulling them to the United States. The effects of U.S. economic involvements on Asian immigration before World War II were well documented in Cheng and Bonacich's 1984 volume.64 The Western powers, including the United States, imposed unequal treaties concerning trade, tariffs, and labor flow on all the Asian countries; shook slack Asians from their traditional economic base, rendering them available for labor recruitment; and actively recruited Asians for migration to the U.S. Pacific Coast and Hawaii as cheap labor to meet the labor demand. The impact of U.S. economic involvement on new Asian immigration after World War II was analyzed by Ong, Bonacich, and Cheng in 1994 and needs more documentation.65 But one basic fact is that major Asian sending countries in the post-1965 period all have close economic ties with the United States.<br />

<br />
Immigrant entrepreneurs are key to developing that economic integration<br />
Saxenian 00<br />
[AnnaLee Saxenian, ?Silicon Valley?s New Immigrant Entrepreneurs?, University of California, Santa Cruz, The Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, 2000]<br />
At the same time that Silicon Valley's immigrant entrepreneurs organized local professional networks, they were also building ties back to their home countries. The region's Chinese engineers constructed a vibrant two-way bridge connecting the technology communities in Silicon Valley and Taiwan; their Indian counterparts became key middlemen linking U.S. businesses to low-cost software expertise in India. These cross-Pacific networks represent more than an additional &quot;ethnic resource&quot; that supports entrepreneurial success; rather, they provide the region's skilled immigrants with an important advantage over their mainstream competitors who often lack the language skills, cultural know-how, and contacts to build business relationships in Asia. The traditional image of the immigrant economy is the isolated Chinatown or &quot;ethnic enclave&quot; with limited ties to the outside economy. Silicon Valley's new immigrant entrepreneurs, by contrast, are increasingly building professional and social networks that span national boundaries and facilitate flows of capital, skill, and technology. In so doing, they are creating transnational communities that provide the shared information, contacts, and trust that allow local producers to participate in an increasingly global economy (Portes, 1996). As recently as the 1970s, only very large corporations had the resources and capabilities to grow internationally, and they did so primarily by establishing marketing offices or manufacturing plants overseas. Today, by contrast, new transportation and communications technologies allow even the smallest firms to build partnerships with foreign producers to tap overseas expertise, cost-savings, and markets. Start-ups in Silicon Valley today are often global actors from the day they begin operations: Many raise capital from Asian sources, others subcontract manufacturing to Taiwan or rely on software development in India, and virtually all sell their products in Asian markets. The scarce resource in this new environment is the ability to locate foreign partners quickly and to manage complex business relationships across cultural and linguistic boundaries. This is particularly a challenge in high-technology industries in which products, markets, and technologies are continually being redefined--and where product cycles are routinely shorter than nine months. First-generation immigrants, like the Chinese and Indian engineers of Silicon Valley, who have the language, cultural, and technical skills to function well in both the United States and foreign markets are distinctly positioned to play a central role in this environment. They are creating social structures that enable even the smallest producers to locate and maintain mutually beneficial collaborations across long distances and that facilitate access to Asian sources of capital, manufacturing capabilities, skills, and markets. These ties have measurable economic benefits. Research at the University of California at Berkeley has documented a significant correlation between the presence of first-generation immigrants from a given country and exports from California. For example, every 1 percent increase in the number of first-generation immigrants from a given country, exports from California go up nearly 0.5 percent. Moreover, this effect is especially pronounced in the Asia-Pacific region where, all other things being equal, California exports nearly four times more than it exports to comparable countries in other parts of the world (Bardhan and Howe, 1998). This section presents cases of immigrant entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley who have helped to construct the new transnational (and typically trans-local) networks. The region's Taiwanese engineers have forged close social and economic ties to their counterparts in the Hsinchu region of Taiwan--the area, comparable in size to Silicon Valley, that extends from Taipei to the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park. They have created a rich fabric of professional and business relationships that supports a two-way process of reciprocal industrial upgrading. Silicon Valley's Indian engineers, by contrast, play a more arm's-length role as middlemen linking U.S.-based companies with low-cost software expertise in localities like Bangalore and Hyderabad. In both cases, the immigrant engineers provide the critical contacts, information, and cultural know-how that link dynamic--but distant--regions in the global economy.<br />

Among the various social forces that could re-shape U.S.-China relations, Chinese American families are among the most established global players. Chinese-immigrant entrepreneurs have not only transplanted their family networks, they also have expanded Chinese-owned trans-Pacific trade, transportation businesses, and banks. The third type of trans-Pacific family, in particular, illustrates how Chinese Americans who maintain borderless family networks act to strengthen U.S.-China economic relations?one critically important aspect of the overall relationship. Businesses on both sides need a gateway to help penetrate each other?s market. Trans-Pacific family networks of all three types can provide such a gateway. Family and kinship connections are the Chinese rim?s building blocks. Given their global family networks and economic power, Chinese Americans have profoundly shaped and will continue to influence U.S.-China relations.<br />

In an effort to notch up U.S.-China relations on the Bush administration's agenda, three cabinet level officials-Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans, Trade Representative Robert Zoellick and Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman-together with a Chinese delegation of 70 individuals, participated in the 15th session of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) on April 21st. The Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi, Mr. Evans and Mr. Zoellick jointly chaired the meeting held in Washington DC. This was the highest level delegation to participate in the session in over a decade. The meeting resulted in, among other assurances, a Chinese commitment to drop plans to adopt its own wireless encryption standard and to crack down on IPR infringements, while the U.S. pledged to reconsider its ban on certain high-tech exports to China. The presence of a relatively large number of top-level bureaucrats suggests the high priority both the United States and the PRC assign to their mutual economic relationship. Although the commercial benefits of U.S.-China economic ties are critical components of both nations' economies-the United States is China's second largest trading partner and China is the United States' third largest trading partner-the benefits extend beyond economic advantages.?Progress, expansion and coordination?on economic issues provide the foundation upon which cooperation on a larger strategic level can be orchestrated and the current and future strain on the relationship can be managed. Tensions in U.S.-China relations will most likely intensify in the approaching months as U.S. presidential campaigning picks up and further sparks &quot;anti-China&quot; discussion in the United States. Current matters of disagreement include Beijing's view that by proposing to sell an advanced radar system to Taiwan the U.S. is violating the &quot;Three Communiqu?s&quot; and claims that the reports of Beijing backsliding on human rights are completely unfounded. Washington is worried over the perceived undervalued RMB, Chinese failure to comply with certain WTO commitments and alleged U.S. manufacturing job loss to China. Although these are prickly matters that deserve attention, there are larger tensions on the horizon.Issues that continue to merit Washington and Beijing's full consideration include how to handle cross-Strait relations and North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Newly reelected?Taiwan?President Chen Shui-bian's current?trajectory?toward establishing?a new constitution for Taiwan and?Kim Jong Il's nuclear ambitions present two of the most formidable challenges current U.S. foreign policy faces. Effective handling of both issues heavily depends on cooperation between Washington and Beijing.The degree of coordination required to achieve acceptable solutions on both fronts is extremely high.?Thus, in order to successfully manage this relationship, both sides must continue to make progress where possible and emphasize areas of shared interest-this is most effectively achieved through cooperation on the economic front.?Unless U.S.-Sino relations are firmly rooted, the ability to successfully secure mutually satisfactory outcomes on these two issues will be difficult at best.?Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian continues to stand by his constitutional reform timetable which calls for an island-wide referendum in 2006 and full implementation of the new constitution in 2008. Chen's plans to establish a new constitution are viewed by Beijing as an overt move toward independence, and thus, entirely unacceptable.?The U.S. has long held a policy of &quot;strategic ambiguity&quot; toward the Taiwan Strait and insisted that a peaceful solution be reached between the two sides of the Strait without U.S. involvement. However, in a recent 180 degree turn, the PRC asked the United States to become more active in mediating between the two sides.?This is an opportunity for the U.S. to abandon its ambiguous cross-Strait policy and play an assertive arbitrating role, thereby increasing the likelihood of securing the primary American national interest in the region-stability.?As North Korea's long-time friend and ally, the PRC played a constructive role in coordinating the two sessions of &quot;six-party&quot; talks held in Beijing which aimed at brokering a diplomatic solution between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang's underground nuclear program.?Because Pyongyang and Washington have continuously butted heads, negotiations have been slow. In an effort to reach a conciliatory resolution, the PRC has encouraged the U.S. to deviate from its stated objective-complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of Pyongyang's nuclear program-and exercise more flexibility toward North Korea.?Washington and Beijing's divergent approaches to resolving the impasse must be overcome if progress toward an agreement is to be achieved. In a positive sign that the process may be moving in that direction, it is reported that Kim Jong Il (in an unannounced trip to Beijing) pledged to soften his stance toward American demands.?Military conflict in the Taiwan Strait or the acquisition of North Korean nuclear weapons by terrorist groups certainly are two scenarios the leaderships in Beijing and Washington would like to avoid. Therefore, it is essential to continue moving forward in the realm of economic cooperation where both countries share an increasing number of similar objectives and where progress is occurring.?For both countries, economic growth hinges on the other. During 2000-2003, U.S. exports world-wide increased by 9% while exports to China were up 76%. The U.S. is the single largest export market for firms in China, taking in 30% of total exports produced.?The risk of damaging the increasingly integrated economic links naturally encourages negotiation and cooperation on a variety of non-economic related issues,?and therefore, expanding economic ties should receive significant attention from the highest levels of the respective leaderships. The hands of the Bush Administration are full coping with turmoil in Iraq, the 9/11 hearings and coordinating a reelection campaign. The Chinese, too, are dealing with a host of domestic problems from economic matters, such as growing inequality and possible overheating of the economy to potential political unrest in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, steps to ensure stability in the U.S.-China relationship are taking place. Vice President Cheney's recent trip to China and subsequent talks with the Beijing leadership, as well as the mutual high-level bilateral support for the JCCT meeting are healthy signals that both countries are willing to expand resources to further solidify U.S.-China relations.?While?these are steps in the right direction, continued strides toward developing economic relations must remain a high priority for both nations.<br />

Taiwan war stops extinction<br />

Possible Futures of a Confrontation between China, Taiwan and the United States of America?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lamp-method.org/eCommons/Hunkovic.pdf</a>]<br />
A war between China, Taiwan and the United States has the potential to escalate into a nuclear conflict and a third world war, therefore, many countries other than the primary actors could be affected by such a conflict, including Japan, both Koreas, Russia, Australia, India and Great Britain, if they were drawn into the war, as well as all other countries in the world that participate in the global economy, in which the United States and China are the two most dominant members. If China were able to successfully annex Taiwan, the possibility exists that they could then plan to attack Japan and begin a policy of aggressive expansionism in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Pacific and even into India, which could in turn create an international standoff and deployment of military forces to contain the threat. In any case, if China and the United States engage in a full-scale conflict, there are few countries in the world that will not be economically and/or militarily affected by it. However, China, Taiwan and United States are the primary actors in this scenario, whose actions will determine its eventual outcome, therefore, other countries will not be considered in this study.<br />

First, let?s rationalize our immigration system. Over the last decade and a half, fully one-quarter of all technology firms founded in the United States were started by immigrants. Factor in first-generation Americans?the children of immigrants?and the percentage rises. Reggie Aggarwal, founder and CEO of Cvent, has created some 500 jobs in the Washington area. Reggie is here today and will share his perspective during our panel discussion. Our immigration policy needs to be friendlier to people like Reggie and his parents. We could start by offering instant citizenship to any of the thousands of bright young people from foreign countries who graduate from our universities. We also should change the provisions of the EB-5 visa, the so- called ?entrepreneur?s visa.? Rather than requiring prospective immigrants to bring cash into the country?the current rule requires $1,000,000 (or $500,000 if the company is in a distressed area)?we should favor those who plan to come and start companies, and extend their visas once they begin hiring American residents. Countries such as Singapore already allow in new immigrant entrepreneurs who bring in far less, $50,000, than we require. The United States simply cannot afford to lose the emerging global race for entrepreneurial talent.<br />

Pascal argues that the Startup Visa increases, rather than decreases the risk for entrepreneurs. I don?t see how this is the case. I came to the US on a student visa, and decided to stay to start a company (for the full story, see my previous post on My Story and Support for the Founders Visa). I had nine months of practical training left to get the company going. If it succeeded, I still needed to cross the hurdle of getting a visa. In the case of the Startup Visa you get two years to start, with extensions thereafter. If you fail, there is nothing preventing you from getting a new Startup Visa ? provided you can find sources for funding for your next idea. Or, if you want to get a job you can apply for a visa for that too. The Startup Visa doesn?t change the risks for an entrepreneur. I chose to start my company in the US because I felt that it was the right place to do it ? it was my choice. Having made that choice, the Startup Visa makes it easier for an entrepreneur like me to come to the US, or to stay in the US, as the case may be.<br />

[Vivek Wadhwa, ?Startups: The Upside of a Downturn?, BusinessWeek, 11-7-2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/nov2008/sb2008117_695019.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/nov2008/sb2008117_695019.htm</a>]<br />
In early October, Sequoia Capital summoned executives at its portfolio companies for an urgent meeting to discuss survival in the economic downturn. The presentation at the meeting, titled &quot;R.I.P: Good Times,&quot; quickly made its way onto the Internet, adding to fear in the startup community in Silicon Valley and beyond. Sequoia, after all, is one of the most respected venture capital firms in the country, an early backer of Google (GOOG) and several other huge technology successes. One takeaway from Sequoia's presentation was clear: With the economy souring, now is a bad time to launch a venture or to expand an existing business. Or is it? The founders of Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Caterpillar (CAT), McDonald's (MCD), and Walt Disney (DIS) might not agree. All of those companies were founded during an economic downturn. So were Adobe (ADBE), Intel (INTU), and Compaq (HP). Bill Gates didn't let a recessionary environment stop him from launching Microsoft (MSFT). Chuck Schwab founded his discount brokerage during the recession of 1974. And in 1982, U.S. unemployment was soaring to the highest levels in decades; that didn't stop Scott McNeely and Vinod Khosla from launching Sun Microsystems (JAVA). In fact, 18 of the 30 current Dow Jones industrial index companies were launched during economic downturns, according to research by Reference Capital Management, a venture capital fund based in Tigard, Ore. I, myself, have been through the startup process twice, in both economic ups and downs. My first company, Seer Technologies, was conceived at New York investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston (CS) after the market crash of 1987. The bank soon needed to divest key technologies. Despite the gloomy economic market, by 1989 we had raised the capital needed. And with almost no competition in sight, we grew the startup to a public company with $120 million in revenue in 1995. I started working on my second startup, Relativity Technologies, in late 1996, before the dot-com boom. We built the products, understood our markets, and recruited a solid executive team. The result? By 1998, we had venture capitalists tripping over each other to give us money, and I was able to raise about $10 million over two years to expand a successful startup. My advice for other tech entrepreneurs thinking of launching right now? Don't wait. A recession is your ally in building a lean, thriving company. Consider the following four advantages. Less competition. An economic downturn clears the competitive landscape for startups. Most of the &quot;me-too&quot; companies with inferior products and weak business models go out of business, and fewer are started. Plus, it becomes a lot easier to do licensing deals with universities and business partners?no one else is. Lower costs. It is a buyer's market, and you can negotiate deals on real estate, equipment, and materials like never before. Salaries are lower for new hires, and there is little pressure to give big salary increases to existing staff. Easier to recruit and keep employees. You will readily find people who have been laid off and are eager to get back to work. They will accept lower salaries in return for stock and take the risk of joining a startup. And rather than focusing on getting a job with a competitor who pays a little more money, employees are usually content to build tenure and focus on your success. Less pressure to expand. Rather than rushing to expand your business, you have the luxury of doing it right. You can conceive of better products, test them carefully to make sure they work and meet customer needs, and experiment with different business models. Since you are not in a frantic rush to get a product out or build market share, you can do things more methodically. True, it is harder to raise venture or angel capital in bad economic times, but such funding is not the main source of capital for most startups anyway. Research that my group at Duke University is conducting in partnership with the Kauffman Foundation shows the majority of first-time entrepreneurs fund their startups from personal savings and borrow from friends and family. So you are going to be getting money from the same sources whether it is now or during a booming economy. The big difference is that you have a chance to build your company the right way if you start now?and you have better odds of perhaps being listed on the Dow Jones one day.<br />

Our specific visa revisions solve<br />
Dallas Business Journal 10<br />
[?Create Jobs, get a green card?, 5-7-2010]<br />
Andres Ruzo came to America in 1980 to pursue a degree in engineering from Texas A&amp;M University. He calls himself a Peruvian by birth and a Texan by choice. He founded his fast-growing company, Rowlett-based LinkAmerica, in 1994. But getting to that point wasn?t easy. ?I know how difficult it is to be an immigrant who wants to start something here,? Ruzo said. ?I tried to get my H-1B Visa, which required me to work for five years, and then going from there, I needed another five years to become a resident, so it took 10 years.&quot; With $40.7 million in annual revenue, LinkAmerica ranked No. 13 on the Dallas Business Journal?s 2010 list of North Texas minority-owned businesses. New legislation coming out of Washington could provide a shortcut for foreign-born entrepreneurs. Ruzo says the proposed changes will create U.S. jobs, bring money to North Texas and open up a bridge for foreigners to invest in America. Introduced by U.S. Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the law would allow immigrant entrepreneurs to secure visas if their startup can raise $1 million in investment, or generate $1 million in revenue, and create five full-time jobs within two years. Called the Startup Visa Act of 2010, the legislation requires the entrepreneur to initially raise $250,000, of which $100,000 must come from a qualified U.S. angel or venture investor. The Startup Visa Act has enjoyed bipartisan support, despite a nationwide immigration dispute, as well as the backing of 160 venture capitalists from across the country. ?Global competition for talent and investment grows more intense daily, and the United States must step up or be left behind,? Kerry said in a statement. Lost opportunities The Startup Visa Act would create a new type of two-year visa called an EB-6. It?s a hybrid of existing visas, the H-1B, a temporary visa for immigrants working in high-tech or other specialized fields, and the E-B5, also known as the investor?s visa, which provides a method of obtaining permanent residence for foreign nationals who invest at least $1 million and create at least 10 jobs in the United States. Supporters say the startup visa would create jobs and increase America?s global competitiveness, rather than helping immigrants compete for existing ones, which is what many argue H-1B does. The new visa will also ease the threshold demanded by the E-B5, which attracts the wealthiest investors and not necessarily the most entrepreneurial. Edwin Rivas, an economics senior at Southern Methodist University and an international student from El Salvador, will graduate this month and has come up with a fat list of business ideas he wants to pursue. But current visa options were either too expensive or too restrictive, Rivas said. So he has decided to take his business ideas to El Salvador, even as he admits the business climate there is less favorable. ?The startup visa is exactly what I have been hoping for, but it?s too late for me,? he said. ?I wish it passed while I was still in school.? Nezar Chafni, an SMU finance senior from the United Arab Emirates who will also graduate this month, secured an American job through the H-1B visa. Instead, Chafni plans to go back to his native country to launch a software company he founded here. ?If I get something like the startup visa, I would move the company back here,? he said. ?I already have people who are investing in my company.?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should amend the provisions of the EB-5 visa class for immigrant investors and immigrant entrepreneurs to lower the initial capital investment requirement to $250,000 and allow for domestic superangel investor sponsorship.
