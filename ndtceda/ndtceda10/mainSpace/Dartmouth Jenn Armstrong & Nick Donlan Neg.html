[Tamara, “Imagining Communities Through Immigration Policies : Governmental Regulation, Media Spectacles and the Affective Politics of National Borders,” <em>International Journal of Cultural Studies</em> 2003 6: 335-353]<br />
<span class="underline">Foucault’s concern with the question of population must be situated in his larger argument about the emergence of biopower </span>as a transformation of the classical model of sovereign power, based on the right to inflict death, to a post-sovereign power <span class="underline">that takes the management and extension of life as its political target </span>(Foucault, 1997: 218–19). Foucault accounts for the new regime of biopower in the late 18th century through the ‘apparition of a new “personnage” ’ – the population as both a biological and political problem (1997: 218–19). <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">The governmental imagining of the population as a mass biologized body put into place a whole set of regulatory mechanisms</span> charged with its maintenance and health. In addition to the policy technologies that emerged to regulate the life of the population,</span> ranging from statistics, to public hygiene, to intervention into birth and mortality rates, <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">immigration policy constitutes a key regulatory mechanism</span></span> of the population in modern liberal nation states (Bigo, 2002; Ceyhan and Tsoukala, 2002).<br />
Much of the established governmentality literature tends to focus on the classical concerns of political economy and policy (Dean, 1999), while tending to background questions of sexuality and racism (with notable exceptions such as Stoler, 1995). Yet <span class="underline">the mutual inscription of neoliberal economics, racism and sexuality into the mechanisms of the state is crucial to the contemporary biopolitical regulation of immigration.</span><br />
In the well-known final chapter of the History of Sexuality (Vol. 1), Foucault focusses on sexuality as a critical point of articulation between the disciplinary regime of individualized bodies and the biopolitics of the ‘massi- fied’ population, a central locus of biopolitical regulation at the juncture of the ‘body’ and the ‘population’. Yet, in one of his lesser-known lectures from Il Faut Défendre la Société (Foucault, 1997; for an English translation, see Foucault, 2003), <span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Foucault</span> also <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">frames racism</span> – specifically what he calls state racism – <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">as indispensable</span> to post-sovereign societies of normalization. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Amidst the technologies of regulation focussed on improving the life of the</span></span><br />
<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">population</span></span> (or, more accurately, faire vivre la population), <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">r<span class="underline">acism introduces a</span></span><span class="underline"> ‘coupure’ or <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">gap in the biological continuum or species being of the popu- lation between those who must live and those who must die. Racism rein- scribes the sovereign right to death into post-sovereign governmentality through a logic of security, securing the life of the population by seeking the death of specified others. Those who are racialized either as an external threat or an internal enemy, who hold out the threat of pollution or degeneracy, must be killed or contained in order to assure the life of the population.</span></span><br />
The emphasis on the security of the population,2 combined with a generalized security logic dictating that ‘in order to live, one must kill’ (ulti- mately culminating, for Foucault, in discourses of war), have become central to the contemporary governmental regulation of immigration.3 To understand how such security regimes operate and become publicly normal- ized beyond the immediate sphere of governmental policy, however, we need to extend our analysis beyond the logics of governance to consider the wider mediation and public circulation of political affect in relation to immi- gration, often through a sense of threat or panic.<br />
D. The alternative is to refuse to categorize immigrants. Only through recognition of the individuality of each immigrant can we stop divisions between the worthy and unworthy and affirm our ethical obligation. <br />

1NC Scream<br />
The horrors the affirmative identifies are not isolated incidents but are manifestations of a world system that cannot be named but has gone terribly awry. Unspeakable miseries are so prevalent as to remind us that particular solutions are no longer sufficient. We can no longer comfortably seek remedy to global injustice in familiar institutions, political strategies, or modes of thought. Rather, the beginning point for any radically revolutionary reflection must be absolute negativity – dissonance finds expression in a scream.<br />
<br />
Holloway, 2005. John ,lawyer, Marxist-oriented sociologist and philosopher, [Changing the World Without Taking Power. Libcom.]<br />
In the beginning is the scream. We scream.<br />
When we write or when we read, it is easy to forget that the beginning is not the word, but the scream. Faced with the mutilation of human lives by capitalism, a scream of sadness, a scream of horror, a scream of anger, a scream of refusal: NO.<br />
The starting point of theoretical … we feel to be wrong.<br />
That is our starting point: rejection of a world that we feel to be wrong, negation of a world we feel to be negative. This is what we must cling to.<br />
<br />
Therefore, vote negative to embrace to the scream as the only starting point for an alternative to a world so wrong. The scream is simultaneously an expression of horror and that of hope. It reveals the wrongness of the world while also hinting at the possibility of another. The scream reveals the contingent existence of alternative worlds within the status quo. It reveals and exploits the tension between what is and what ought to be.<br />
Though it depends on no guarantee of success, it is this critical and negative gesture toward the non-identity of the present, the possibility of a more just future contained within the very DNA of the status quo that marks the critical potential of the absolute refusal symbolized by the scream.<br />
<br />
Holloway, 2005. John, lawyer, Marxist-oriented sociologist and philosopher, [Changing the World Without Taking Power. Libcom.]<br />
Our scream is not just a … , then we must be mad.<br />
From the time of Machiavelli, social theory has been concerned to break the unbreakable sentence in half. Machiavelli lays<br />
the basis for a new realism when he says that he is concerned only with what is, not with what things as we might wish them to be. Reality refers to the first part of the sentence, to what is. The second part of the sentence, what ought to be, is clearly distinguished from what is, and is not regarded as part of reality. The 'ought' is not entirely discarded: it becomes the theme of 'normative' social theory. What is completely broken is the unity of the two parts of the sentence. With that step alone, the scream of rejection-and-longing is disqualified.<br />
Our scream implies a two-dimensionality … sense of non-identity' (Adorno 1990, p. 5).<br />

Plank One: The United States federal government should remove beneficiary eligibility restrictions on individuals excluded under section 202 (6) (A) (i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act for the purpose of determining beneficiary eligibility for employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, and human trafficking-based visas.<br />
Plank Two: The United States federal government should eliminate family-based visas.<br />
Our counterplan has two planks – each plank is conditional. If they win that the second plank does not compete, you should kick it for us and revert to the first plank.<br />
Expansion of family-based visas is inherently heteronormative. While their expansion of eligibility is seemingly liberal, the language used to describe it structures public thought and renders LGBT individuals invisible.<br />

The emphasis on the security of the population,2 combined with a generalized security logic dictating that ‘in order to live, one must kill’ (ulti- mately culminating, for Foucault, in discourses of war), have become central to the contemporary governmental regulation of immigration.3 To understand how such security regimes operate and become publicly normal- ized beyond the immediate sphere of governmental policy, however, we need to extend our analysis beyond the logics of governance to consider the wider mediation and public circulation of political affect in relation to immi- gration, often through a sense of threat or panic.<br />

<strong>2NC Short Framework</strong><br />
<strong>1. Our K turns their framework – securitization stifles political discourse only the alternative enables political discussions. That’s Neocleous.</strong><br />
<strong>2. Proves the link - their insistence on “we get to weigh our case” proves their inability to reconceptualize reality. The case itself is a discursive production strategically arranged from a position of power<span class="NothingChar">. [The story is neither natural nor inevitable.]</span></strong><br />

<strong>5. The Aff is the Focus of the Debate – the plan text is 10 seconds. They chose everything and should defend whether their advantages and mechanisms are SECURITIZED. Pure Plan Focus means the aff could just “scratch” link cards after we impact turn.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>8. Plan Focus is Arbitrary – we have read specific link evidence on the importance of discourse in relation to the aff – they Cloak their exclusion of CORE CLAIMS in the LITERATURE as a voting issue. Plan focus reduces thinking about evidence assumptions within that evidence.</strong><br />
<strong>9. Arbitrary Aff Frameworks are More Dangerous than K’s – they prevent Questioning Choices of the Aff – Racial or Gendered Language and Reprehensible Advantages become “No Cost.”</strong><br />
<strong>6. We Provide the best education – without the K we can’t impact questions of ideology [that impacts the means of judgment in decisions on nuclear posture debates.]</strong><br />
<strong>7. “Fairness” is a Poor Standard for Debate – the Awesomeness of Debate as a Creative Research Activity is LOST if Cutting Good Evidence for a Critique Becomes a Voting Issue.</strong><br />
<strong>8. Reject the alt not the team - we’ve still proved there’s a discourse DA that comes first.</strong><br />
<strong>[We are impact turning the fundamental justifications for the plan TO BE passed. You would still vote neg as a policy maker because their policy has a bad impact calculus.]</strong><br />
<a name="_Toc272176744"></a><br />
<strong>1. I’ll do the link work here - the descriptions of the 1AC create violence - conceded links make the perm unviable –</strong><br />
<strong>The affirmative describes the world as unstable and insecure - their descriptions of Iraqi war escalating and resulting in China going after Taiwan are not natural but constructed so that sovereignty can exist as the New Theology of Truth. Even if Iraq withdrawl itself is a good policy, representations of insecurity create a new evangelism of fear that forms an identity of America as a stable leader which mediates all conflict in opposition to the dangerous outside. That’s Jaeger.</strong><br />

<strong><u>One finding is that senior <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">civilian and military leaders often lack a common understanding of roles and reciprocal responsibilities within the partnership.</span></span> The traditional shorthand that &quot;civilians make policy and the military executes&quot; is overly simplistic, masking the intricate mutual dependence of the parties. For example, civilians may not see their policymaking role as accompanied by a responsibility to ensure that military concerns about policy implementation have been fully addressed. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Military leaders may define their substantive advising role narrowly and perform it only in response to civilian inquiry. These misunderstandings have proven costly in national security decision-making.</span></span> In addition, the parties largely fail to harness the inherent frictions in the relationship. The roles of various civil and military actors abut and overlap in practice, particularly when multiple civilian authorities (including members of Congress) are engaged. <span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Managing the inevitable tensions without rancor or overreaction is a key responsibility of the civilian leadership.

Integrity Legal 5-26-09 US State Department Grants Same Sex Benefits: Is the Uniting of American Families Act Next?<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/2009/05/" rel="nofollow">http://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/2009/05/</a><br />
This begs the question that if, at bottom, these benefits ought to be conferred because “it is the right thing to do,” then isn’t granting same sex couple’s US Family Immigration benefits the right thing to do as well? The Uniting of American Families Act is a piece of legislation that would allow US citizens to obtain US visas for their alien same sex partner.<br />
In this situation, the US State Department has disregarded the spirit of the Defense of Marriage Act by conferring these benefits upon same sex partners and will likely prevail in doing so because offering these benefits is a prerogative of the Secretary of State and under the bailiwick of the executive branch of the United States government (Under the doctrine of Separation of Powers, there are certain areas in which each branch of government cannot be challenged by another branch).<br />
The UAFA also subtly avoids … the definition of “permanent partner.”<br />
<br />
<br />
C. The Aff interpretation is bad for debate- just because the aff calls their affirmative a family visa does not mean that it is. This legitimizes any refugee, or asylum affirmatives by just redefining employment based visas to include refugees. The resolution was limited down to four visa category for a reason, and certain areas of the topic are excluded to maintain some limits on the topic<br />
<br />
<br />
Limits are necessary for negative preparation and clash. The affirmative unlimits with the creation of any new visa. There is no limit to the possible visas that could be added . Our competing definition is superior.<br />
