<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our first argument is VISIBILITY</span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">A. We begin by recognizing the privilege that allows us to debate in this room. There are some people who make our community possible who remain invisible every weekend. </span></strong></span><br />

Jerome Gautie &amp; John Schmitt]; March; 269-318) </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="font-family: Arial;">What is remarkable… … being inconspicuous to the customer.</span></u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">B. And, this invisibility is governed by a larger project of hospitality that orders bodies to ensure the best guest experience. </span></strong></span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Furthermore, </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial;">hotels… …</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial;"> unchanging or unchangeable, however.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">C. This ordering of bodies is stratified on gender and color lines, with women of color occupying the lowest point on the pyramid of hotel work. Room attendants are the largest group of service workers in the hotel industry, but lack access to relationships that would lead to promotion. </span></strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Wells ‘00 </span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">(Miriam J. [Professor of Anthropology in the Department of Human and Community Development, University of California, Davis]; “Immigration and Unionization in the San Francisco Hotel Industry,” In <em>Organizing Immigrants: The Challenge for Unions in Contemporary California</em>, pp. 109-129) </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">San Francisco's recent… …</span><u><span style="font-family: Arial;"> they did not previously know.</span></u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our second argument is DISTANCE </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">A. The affirmative looks to the global, making the localized residue of colonization and inequity invisible. Privileging the global over the local is a display of the “be anywhere” academic. </span></strong></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nayar ’99</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"> (Jayan, [School of Law, University of Warwick]. “Symposium: Re-framing international law for the 21st century: Orders of Inhumanity.” Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems. Fall.) </span></span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><u><span style="font-family: Arial;">It has become a,,, ,,, colonialism is now plainly visible.</span></u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">B. This idea of the “be anywhere” academic makes invisible the exploitation of the service labor that is the engine of the global economy. The Aff’s turn to abstract global theory ignores the material conditions that make that turn possible. We must instead focus on practices that make this labor visible. </span></strong></span><br />

<u><span style="font-family: Arial; margin-bottom: 0in;">What are the strategic… … involved in the work of globalization. </span></u><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">C. This is a question of sequencing. We have an obligation to consider how our abstract language relates to local labor struggles. </span></strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Our third argument is LABOR </span></strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">A. The body of the hotel room attendant is disciplined. The more they try to enact their political agency, the more it is taken from them. </span></strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">B. Debate is our living labor, or a value-producing activity. Since this is a political space we choose to discipline ourselves to occupy, what we say becomes very important. We must use our labor to expose the powers that subvert others using their labor. </span></strong></span><br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 17px;"><strong>The 1ac’s introduction of body politics as a method sabotages material change. We must consider how material conditions make our discourse possible or we replicate oppression.</strong></span><br />

<strong>In particular, the aff’s very ability to interrogate communication is sustained by the material labor of immigrants. The 1ac renders their material lives constantly devalued.</strong><br />
