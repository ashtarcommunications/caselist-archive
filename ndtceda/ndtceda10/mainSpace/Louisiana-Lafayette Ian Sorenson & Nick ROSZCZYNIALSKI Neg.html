Negative Strategies Necessary to comply with Wake's Scout-Fascism:<br />
<br />
We say H1B's suck and that visas as a general concept suck. If you plan is so damn good, why not just let everyone into the country, why waste time with a stupid stamp program? Then we run a really bad courts or XO counter-plans and a shitty poltics disad with internal links that are taken out of context. If they go critical, we will run a Cap K or Agamben. Then, in a pinch, we read Wake Forest, Northwestern, Cal-Berkeley or Harvard blocks. I think that pretty much covers our negative strategy on this topic as well as 80% of the teams in the nation's negative strategies.<br />

The public inevitably must suffer regulatory burdens to realize regulatory benefits, but the laws will come from an agency that legislators can then criticize for imposing excessive bur­dens on their constituents.

United States immigration officials removed more than 79,000 &quot;criminal aliens&quot; during the year 2003 alone. n14 Many of the LPRs among this number learned the hard way that punishment imposed for criminal behavior is often followed by exile in the form of immigration sanctions that may result in the relinquishment of home and [*485] family. n15 Legislative amendments to United States immigration statutes have steadily eroded the availability of relief for the LPR who is subject to an order of deportation, or removal as that proceeding is now known, n16 because of a criminal conviction. The year 1996 was particularly hard for this category of non-citizen with the advent of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (the &quot;AEDPA&quot;) in April, n17 and the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (the &quot;IIRIRA&quot;) in September. n18 These 1996 legislative changes drastically affected aliens convicted of aggravated felonies, as that term is defined by the immigration statutes, when Attorney General Janet Reno announced that the amendments restricting relief from removal for these individuals would apply retroactively. n19</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"> </span><span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 9.5pt;"><strong><u>As a result, a conviction for an aggravated felony offense at any time in the past not only rendered non-citizens subject to deportation, but it also made them ineligible for relief from deportation in the<span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"> form of a discretionary waiver</span></u></strong></span></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">. </span></span><br />

Two basic types of visas exist: immigrant and nonimmigrant. n118 Immigrant visas are typically reserved for foreign individuals who desire to live in the U.S. permanently. n119 Conversely, a nonimmigrant visa is issued on the condition that the person stays in the U.S. temporarily and only for a specified purpose. n120 The foreign individuals upon whom this Comment focuses are those seeking a nonimmigrant visa. <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong><u>Certain general requirements must<span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;"> be met before most nonimmigrant visas are issued</span></u></strong></span></span>. n121 First and foremost, <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong><u>the applicant must be able to prove that he has a permanent residence abroad to which he intends to return</u></strong> </span></span>after the expiration of his visa. n122 <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong><u>The foreign national must have a v<span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">alid passport, must be admissible or have received a waiver of inadmissibility</span></u></strong></span></span>, and in certain cases, must prove that he will be financially stable during his visit to the U.S. n123 The foreign national may also have the ability to obtain permanent status as a U.S. citizen if certain standards are met. n124 <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong><u>Many different nonimmigrant visas are available, but three categories typically affect those in the creative class: student visas, H-1B</u></strong></span></span> (or skilled employee) visas, <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong><u>and J-1 exchange visitor visas</u></strong></span></span> for visiting scholars and researchers. n125 </span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0pt 0in;"><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">A more feasible approach for avoiding unnecessary ideological exclusions would be to reinstate section 411's requirement that the Secretary of State specifically assess an alien's dangerousness. As a further step, Congress could enact a modest waiver scheme for nondangerous individuals modeled on the McGovern Amendment. Of course, this approach flies in the face of Congress' recent elimination of the Secretary of State's need to determine dangerousness. No matter how unlikely the change in the current political climate, the fact remains that</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"> <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong></u>some kind of waiver scheme is probably the most effective device for preventing unnecessary and abusive ideological exclusions<u></strong></span></span>. As explained in Part I, Congress' first major attempt to rein in the abusive ideological exclusions taking place under the McCarran-Walter Act was the McGovern Amendment of 1977. n228 The McGovern Amendment turned the voluntary waiver framework which was already in place upside down. Instead of simply allowing the Secretary of State the discretion to issue voluntary waivers for nondangerous individuals found inadmissible, <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong></u>the McGovern Amendment required the Secretary of State to recommend a waiver of ineligibility to the Attorney General for any alien denied a visa due to subsection 28 of the McCarran-W<span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">alter Act unless the Secretary certified to Congress that a waiver would be detrimental to the security interests of the United States.</span><u></strong></span></span> n229 <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong></u>Section 411's requirement of a determination by the Secretary of State that an alien's statements represented a thr<span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">eat to the U.S. war on terrorism operated in a similar, though more modest, manner </span><u></strong></span></span>as the McGovern Amendment did. <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong></u>Both provisions assumed that an alien's statements in favor of certain ideas may or may not indicate a threat to the United States<u></strong></span></span>. Thus, aliens were excludable for their speech under both provisions if they represented a threat, but aliens were not excluded simply for speech without some higher threshold showing of danger. The Secretary of State had to certify, under both approaches, that the alien's entry was actually a threat to the United States' interests. Thus, while the McGovern Amendment's verbal formulation [*787] established a higher standard - requiring a &quot;detriment&quot; to U.S. &quot;security interests&quot; n230 - than section 411, the premises of the two were similar. Congress, therefore, should at least consider reinstating section 411's requirement that the Secretary of State determine dangerousness. <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong></u>Congress could also consider a waiver scheme for those who fall under the inadmissibility prov<span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none;">isions of the current INA</span><u></strong></span></span>, as amended by the REAL ID Act. <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong></u>Such a waiver framework could be modeled on the McGovern Amendment, but would not necessarily need to set the same high standard to protect against wanton ideological exclusions.<u></strong> </span></span></span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">The case of Dora Maria Tellez provides the perfect example of how such a waiver scheme might work. Because she took part in the overthrow of the Somoza regime in the 1970s, Professor Tellez undoubtedly participated in past terrorist activity and has been a member of a terrorist organization under the INA's definition of those terms. She personally participated in the Sandinista takeover of the Nicaraguan parliament in which over two thousand people were held hostage. n231 Moreover, she has endorsed and espoused her activity ever since, which falls under the definition of endorsement of terrorism under section 411 of the PATRIOT Act and the REAL ID Act. Her behavior, however, does not make Ms. Tellez a terrorist threat to the United States today. The civil war between Somoza and the Sandinistas, and later between the Sandinistas and the Contras, involved a great deal of political violence on both sides. But, advocacy of Latin American political violence that took place in the 1970s and 1980s in no sense would make Ms. Tellez a &quot;terrorist&quot; in the common usage of that word today</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">. <span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong></u>Under the hypothetical waiver scheme described above, it is very difficult to imagine that the Secretary of State would certify to Congress that<u></strong> </span></span></span><span class="reduce2"><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">Ms. Tellez's</span></span><span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"><strong></u>past revolutionary activity<u></strong> </span></span><span class="reduce2"><span style="color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;">in a tiny Central American country over twenty-five years ago makes her</span></span><span class="highlight2"><span style="border-bottom: medium none; border-left: medium none; border-right: medium none; border-top: medium none; color: windowtext; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 10pt;"><strong></u>a terrorist threat to the United States today.

Of the many reasons for this fact, we will survey only a few of the most salient. First and foremost is <span class="underline"><strong><u>the increasing interdependence of all peoples</u></strong></span>. Even as the world is riven with many contradictions and conflicts, it <span class="underline"><strong><u>is also becoming more integrated with a greater need for orderly, predictable conduct</u></strong></span>. Events, and especially natural and social disasters, even when they occur within a single country, have more noticeable effects on conditions in the world at large. The Chernobyl accident, the earthquake in Armenia, and <span class="underline"><strong><u>internal political processes underway</u></strong></span> in the territories of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe – these and many other events <span class="underline"><strong><u>occurring within separate countries or regions have a global significance affecting the destiny of all peoples</u></strong></span>. The intertwining of the economic life of diverse countries today is even greater than was the interdependence of different regions within the same state only half a century ago. <span class="underline"><strong><u>Order and predictability of the behavior of actors on the international scene can be achieved first of all with the aid of social norms, among which international law occupies an important place</u></strong></span>. A second reason for the growth of the role of international law is inextricably connected with the first. <span class="underline"><strong><u>The threats of a thermonuclear catastrophe, universal ecological crisis, and acute economic problems in developing countries are of global concern and endanger the very existence of humanity. Resolution of these problems demands coordinated efforts of all states and peoples, which would be impossible to achieve without the aid of international norms, procedures, institutions.</u></strong></span>  </span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0.3in 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">However,</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>when international instruments reflect U.S. policy preferences vis-à-vis other states<u></strong></span> – <span style="font-size: 8pt;">as they often do (eg., in the area of arms control) –</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>careful analysis is needed on whether unilateral action can render similar results<u></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or whatever even the short-term interests of the United States demand adherence to the treaty. Even the United States itself recognizes the value of legal regulation of international relations, as the description of its attempts to create and enforce law by unilateral means has shown. It is not ready to renounce law as an instrument, because</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>law stabilizes expectations and reduces the costs of later negotiation and of the enforcement of certain policies<u></strong></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thus, the question is whether it is in the U.S. interest to accept the more egalitarian process of international law instead of using unilateral, hierarchal legal instruments. Although it is impossible to enter into a comprehensive discussion of the general value of international law in this chapter, I shall outline at least some arguments in favor of such an acceptance. First,</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>a stronger use of international law could help stabilize the current predominant positions of the United States. If the United States now concludes that treaties with other states that reflect its superior negotiating power<u></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(even if not to the degree the United States would wish),</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>U.S. preferences can shape international relations in a longer perspective, as change in international law is slower and more difficult than political change<u></strong></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is worthwhile noting that past great powers similarly influenced the international legal order to such a degree that it is possible to divide the history of international law into epochs dominated by these powers – epochs that have left many traces in contemporary law. Second,</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>even if the U.S. power continues to increase and this argument therefore appears to be less appealing, the United States can gain from stronger reliance on international law because the law can help legitimize its current exercise of power. Unilateralism in international politics is always regarded suspiciously by other states, and it is quite probable that perceptions of “imperialism” or “bully hegemony” will lead to stronger reactions by other states in the long run<u></strong></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Already now, some states show greater unity. Although it remains to be seen whether in the Case of Russia and China this greater unity is only symbolic, other instances</span>,<span class="underline"> <strong></u>such as the strong stance of the like-minded states in the ICC, indicate a more substantive regrouping in the face of U.S. predominance. Similarly, the accelerated integration of the EU can be regarded as caused in part by the desire to counterbalance the United States. IF the United States were able to channel its power into the more egalitarian process of international law, it could gain much more legitimacy for its exercise of power and significantly reduce the short and long term costs of its policies<u></strong></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">This has been recognized in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks against the United States in September 2001, and the U.S. president not only sought to build an international ad hoc coalition but also taken steps to bolster the international legal regime against terrorism, in particular by transmitting conventions against terrorism to the Senate in order to proceed with ratification</span>. <span class="underline"><strong></u>Multilateralism is certainly valued more highly<u></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">by U.S. administration since the attacks</span>, <span class="underline"><strong></u>but reluctance still prevails in many areas<u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, as enduring U.S. opposition to the ICC and to the additional protocol to the BWC shows. Third, it</span> </u><span class="underline"><strong>is highly questionable whether the United States will in fact be able to pursue its strategy of subjecting international law in the future</strong></span><u>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">In the past, it might have been possible to exert significant influence on the content of international agreements and then not subscribe to them. Repeating this in the future is likely to be more difficult – as the United States discovered in the case of the ICC statute after a certain point. As one observer to the ICC negotiations notes: Increasingly, the other delegations felt that it would be better to stop giving in to the Untied States; they believed that the United States would never be satisfied with the concessions it got and ultimately would never sign the treaty for completely unrelated domestic political reasons. Similarly, the use of reservations in order to secure a privileged position has become increasingly difficult as other states become wary of this strategy and seek to foreclose the possibility of reservations to new treaties entirely, as in the ICC statute and the Ottawa Convention. And</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>discontent with U.S. behavior might backfire in unexpected circumstances – as with the loss of the seat in the Commission for Human Rights<u></strong></span>, <span style="font-size: 8pt;">or the suit brought and vigorously defended by Germany in the LaGrand case. In general, </span><span class="underline"><strong></u>these effects are likely to undermine the U.S. capacity for leadership which to a large degree is based on reputation, credibility, and persuasiveness – not only on brute power. Moreover, as the United States discovered in its failure to achieve desired goals<u></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the climate change and the landmine negotiations, leadership can be barred by too great a difference in opinion between the leader and those to be led. Compromise may thus be necessary to maintain the momentum to lead. The</span> </u><span class="underline"><strong>United States may be forced to choose between engagement, leadership, and control, on the one hand, and free-riding, isolation, and a loss of influence on the other.</strong> </span><u></span></span><br />

That did not prevent the success of the four-week military campaign, but it made others less willing to help in the reconstruction of Iraq and made the American occupation more costly in the hard-power resources of blood and treasure. Because of its leading edge in the information revolution and its past investment in military power, the US probably will remain the world's single most powerful country well into the 21st century.

<span style="margin: 0in 0.3in 0pt 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">No species has ever dominated its fellow species as man has. In most cases, people have assumed the God-like power of life and death -- extinction or survival -- over the plants and animals of the world. For most of history, mankind pursued this domination with a singleminded determination to master the world, tame the wilderness, and exploit nature for the maximum benefit of the human race. n67 In past mass extinction episodes, as many as ninety percent of the existing species perished, and yet the world moved forward, and new species replaced the old. So why should the world be concerned now? The prime reason is the world's survival. Like all animal life,</span> <span class="underline"><strong></u>humans live off of other species<u></strong></span>. At some point<span class="DebateUnderline"></u>,<u> </span><span class="underline"><strong></u>the number of species could decline to the point at which the ecosystem fails, and then humans<u></strong></span> also <span class="underline"><strong></u>would become extinct<u></strong></span>. <span style="font-size: 8pt;">No one knows how many [*171] species the world needs to support human life, and to find out -- by allowing certain species to become extinct -- would not be sound policy. In addition to food, species offer many direct and indirect benefits to mankind. n68 2. Ecological Value. -- Ecological value is the value that species have in maintaining the environment. Pest, n69 erosion, and flood control are prime benefits certain species provide to man. Plants and animals also provide additional ecological services -- pollution control, n70 oxygen production, sewage treatment, and biodegradation. n71 3. Scientific and Utilitarian Value. -- Scientific value is the use of species for research into the physical processes of the world. n72 Without plants and animals, a large portion of basic scientific research would be impossible. Utilitarian value is the direct utility humans draw from plants and animals. n73 Only a fraction of the [*172] earth's species have been examined, and mankind may someday desperately need the species that it is exterminating today. To accept that the snail darter, harelip sucker, or Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew n74 could save mankind may be difficult for some. Many, if not most, species are useless to man in a direct utilitarian sense. Nonetheless, they may be critical in an indirect role, because their extirpations could affect a directly useful species negatively.</span> </u><span class="underline"><strong>In a closely interconnected ecosystem, the loss of a species affects other species dependent on i</strong></span><span class="DebateUnderline">t</span><u>. n75 Moreover, <span class="underline"><strong></u>as the number of species decline, the effect of each new extinction on the remaining species increases dramatically<u></strong></span>. n76 4. Biological Diversity. -- The main premise of species preservation is that diversity is better than simplicity. n77 As the current mass extinction has progressed, the world's biological diversity generally has decreased. This trend occurs within ecosystems by reducing the number of species, and within species by reducing the number of individuals. Both trends carry serious future implications. <span class="underline"><strong></u>Biologically diverse ecosystems are characterized by a large number of specialist species, filling narrow ecological niches. These ecosystems inherently are more stable than less diverse systems<u></strong></span>. &quot;The more complex the ecosystem, the more successfully it can resist a stress. . . .[l]ike a net, in which each knot is connected to others by several strands, such a fabric can resist collapse better than a simple, unbranched circle of threads -- which if cut anywhere breaks down as a whole.&quot; n79 <span class="underline"><strong></u>By causing widespread extinctions, humans have artificially simplified many ecosystems. As biologic simplicity increases, so does the risk of ecosystem failure<u></strong></span>. The spreading Sahara Desert in Africa, and the dustbowl conditions of the 1930s in the United States are relatively mild examples of what might be expected if this trend continues. Theoretically, each new animal or plant extinction, with all its dimly perceived and intertwined affects, <span class="underline"><strong></u>could cause total ecosystem collapse and human extinction. Each new extinction increases the risk of disaster<u></strong></span>. Like a mechanic removing, one by one, the rivets from an aircraft's wings, <span class="underline"><strong></u>[hu]mankind may be edging closer to the abyss.<u></strong> </span></span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">If we cannot count on the courts to participate in leveling down, we <span class="underline"><strong><u>ought to think seriously about leveling executive discretion up by delegating the President more control over our immigrant admissions system</u></strong></span>. Such an idea has recently emerged in the policy debate. A 2006 task force made up of former government officials and immigration policy experts has recommended establishing a Standing Commission, similar to the Federal Reserve, to allocate [*539] labor visas, n260 and two major labor unions recently have come out in favor of delegation, as well. n261 Moreover, <span class="underline"><strong><u>such formal delegation already exists in one limited area: the refugee allocation system</u></strong></span> established by the Refugee Act of 1980. n262 To be sure, this delegation may itself have been motivated by the desire to limit executive discretion. The Refugee Act of 1980 created a formal system that demanded the President consult with his Cabinet and members of Congress in the allocation of refugee slots, which had the effect of curtailing the then-existing executive discretion to admit as many refugees as desired through the use of the parole power. Still, <span class="underline"><strong><u>Congress chose to formally delegate considerable ex ante screening power to the President rather than to set the refugee quota itself</u></strong></span>. Perhaps Congress concluded that <span class="underline"><strong><u>presidential control, made transparent and consultative, remained necessary to address with flexibility the worldwide refugee situation</u></strong></span>, which could change dramatically from year to year depending on human-initiated and natural disasters and shifting foreign policy concerns. <span class="underline"><strong><u>Delegating to the President more general ex ante screening power would capture this very flexibility for the immigration system as a whole.</u></strong></span> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">Leveling up would simply involve expanding the logic of the refugee regime to the other domains of immigration. In a sense, doing so would bring to immigration policy a practice of delegation commonplace in other regulatory arenas. Throughout the administrative state, Congress has delegated ex ante standard setting authority to administrative and independent agencies, taking advantage of the greater ease with which agencies can collect and synthesize information presented by experts, interest groups, and the public alike, to produce regulatory policies or standards that reflect facts on the ground and changed circumstances. n263</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"> <span class="underline"><strong><u>The failure to delegate similar authority in the immigration context has contributed to the pathological features of immigration policy</u></strong></span> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">laid out above. [*540] We recognize, of course, that lawmakers and the public regard immigration law as different from other regulatory arenas in fundamental ways. Perhaps leaving immigrant admissions policy in the control of Congress helps maintain the illusion of democratic control over membership decisions - the process of self-definition of the polity that the people's institution of the legislature must manage. n264 On this theory, admissions standards can be analogized to marginal tax rates, or to the elements of a crime - rules that our intuitions tell us should be kept in the hands of the most deliberative and popularly accountable body, the legislature. As we have emphasized throughout, however</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">, <span class="underline"><strong><u>the idea that Congress remains in control of immigrant screening more generally is illusory. Congress has, as a de facto matter, given the Executive wide authority to decide these basic membership questions</u></strong></span>. The ex post screening system obscures the extent to which Congress does not actually control membership decisions. </span></span><br />

We have moved from a world of plausible independent executive</u></strong></span> [*511] <span class="underline"><strong><u>authority to admit and remove to a world of pervasive delegation and subsequent executive screening. To be clear, we do not mean that Congress has formally delegated to the President the power to set the legal criteria governing the admission and deportation of noncitizens. To the contrary</u></strong></span> - as we noted at the outset of this Part, one of the signal features of immigration law is that <span class="underline"><strong><u>Congress has largely retained a monopoly over these formal legal criteria</u></strong></span>. n182 In general, Congress specifies in great detail the criteria for admission and removal, particularly when it comes to the major categories of family and labor migration that make up the bulk of admissions. In this sense, immigration law resembles tax law, where Congress retains control over marginal rates, or criminal law, where Congress defines the elements of a crime, rather than other regulatory arenas in which <span class="underline"><strong><u>Congress has delegated broad authority to the executive branch to set standards.</u></strong></span> n183 We claim, instead, that <span class="underline"><strong><u>the President's inability to set formal admissions and removal criteria has not precluded him from playing a major role in shaping screening policy. The modern structure of immigration law that gives the President little standard-setting authority as a formal matter actually has given rise to a system of de facto delegation of power that serves as the functional equivalent to standard-setting authority. This de facto delegation is driven by legal rules that make a huge fraction of resident noncitizens deportable at the option of the Executive. This significant population of formally deportable people gives the President vast discretion to shape immigration policy by deciding how (and over which types of immigrants) to exercise the option to deport</u></strong></span>. </span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">Almost all separation-of-powers jurisprudence and scholarship in immigration law focuses on judicial review - an understandable tendency given how the die was cast in the Chinese Exclusion Cases. But this extraordinary attention to the relationship between the judiciary and the political branches has obscured an even more important separation-of-powers question - how power is allocated between the two political branches</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">. <span class="underline"><strong></u>The Court's jurisprudence on this question provides few answers, and conventional wisdom assumes that Congress retains responsibility for making the decisions at the heart of immigration law: how many and which types of noncitizens should be allowed to enter and reside in the United States. But as the historical practice we unearth reveals, the Executive has exercised considerable screening authority through three basic sources of power: inherent authority, formal delegation, and de facto delegation. Though the first two forms of authority have been significant historically, and the formal delegation model remains important, it is the de facto delegation model that principally drives the relationship between Congress and the President today.

Multiple presidents vetoed these efforts, n83 until Congress finally overrode President Wilson's second veto in 1917. n84 In this Part, however, we put to the side the President's formal role in the legislative process, largely because the veto power enables the President only to block rather than to initiate the setting of admissions and removal standards. Instead, we explore the other paths through which</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"> <span class="underline"><strong><u>the Executive has wielded affirmative authority over admissions and removals</u></strong></span>, even as Congress has developed an extremely detailed immigration code covering the substantive criteria for admitting and deporting immigrants. <span class="underline"><strong><u>We identify three models of executive power, which map onto those identified by the courts</u></strong></span> in Part I: (1) [*485] <span class="underline"><strong><u>inherent executive authority</u></strong></span>; (2) <span class="underline"><strong><u>formal delegated authority; and</u></strong></span> (3) <span class="underline"><strong><u>de facto delegated authority</u></strong></span>. <span class="underline"><strong><u>Though the inherent authority and formal delegation models have historically supported expansive regulation by the Executive historically and continue to play a role in defining the interbranch relationship, the model of de facto delegation is the most salient</u></strong></span> and least understood in today's context. On the subject of inherent authority, we consider the </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 8pt;">negotiation and maintenance of the Bracero guest worker program in the post-World War II period as an illustration. As we show, as late as the mid-twentieth century, it was still thinkable for the Executive to claim the constitutional authority to decide for himself whom to admit to the country - standard setting ordinarily thought to be the province of Congress. On the subject of delegated authority, we focus first on the model of express congressional delegation to the executive branch.

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Many more recent cases, such as Kleindienst v. Mandel n54 and Fiallo v. Bell, n55 have reiterated this language, n56 which could be read as simply limiting judicial review and recognizing political branch primacy generally. n57 But the reference to &quot;Congress&quot; rather the political branches as a unit could also be read as recognizing congressional primacy. For an even more striking example in which the Court appeared to conceptualize immigration authority as a typical congressional power governed by standard conceptions of the separation of powers, consider INS v. Chadha: It is also argued that these cases present a nonjusticiable political question, because Chadha is merely challenging Congress's authority under the Naturalization Clause, and the Necessary and Proper Clause. It is argued that Congress's Art. I power &quot;To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,&quot; combined with the Necessary and Proper Clause, grants it unreviewable authority over the regulation of aliens. The plenary authority of Congress over aliens under Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, is not open to question, but what is challenged here is whether Congress has chosen a constitutionally permissible means of implementing that power. As we made clear <span class="underline"><strong><u>in Buckley v. Valeo: &quot;Congress has plenary authority in all cases in which it has substantive legislative jurisdiction, so long as the exercise of that authority does not offend some other constitutional restriction</u></strong></span>.&quot; n58 [*478] <span class="underline"><strong><u>This passage not only suggests that the immigration power is a function of Congress's authority to set rules for naturalization, but also suggests that the power to regulate immigration may be subject to constraint, just like any other Article I power. On this account, the immigration power is plenary in the same way that the commerce power is plenary</u></strong> </span>under Justice Marshall's formulation in McCulloch v. Maryland, not in a way that suggests complete freedom from constitutional restraint, or inherent executive authority to regulate. Moreover, although Chadha explicitly addresses the institutional structure of national lawmaking in the immigration arena - it is perhaps the only modern Supreme Court case directly concerned with that structure - the Chadha Court did not devote any of its opinion to the question whether the policymaking structure might be different in immigration law than in other regulatory arenas. Despite these developments <span class="underline"><strong><u>bringing immigration law into line with standard understandings of separation of powers, traces of inherent executive authority with respect to immigration still appear in doctrine from the latter part of the century - though the Court never again came close to making as bold a statement in support of inherent authority</u></strong></span> as its undefined elaboration in Knauff. In Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, n59 for example, the Court struck down a regulation promulgated by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) barring noncitizens, including lawful permanent residents, from employment in the civil service. The Court suggested that the regulations' validity turned on whether the CSC &quot;has direct responsibility for fostering or protecting&quot; the overriding national interest claimed by the government in the case. n60 The Court concluded that the CSC did not have that expertise or status - a conclusion that then-Justice Rehnquist argued, in dissent, ran counter to the standard operating procedure of the administrative state. n61 </span></span><br />

If agency inaction is a pervasive problem across the administrative state, for example, then it might be difficult to secure a change in executive policy simply through delegation, absent an external push of some kind.</u></strong></span> n273 The courts present the most likely candidate to exert external pressure. <span class="underline"><strong><u>If, for example, courts were to apply robust conceptions of due process to the Executive's enforcement policies, thereby substantially raising the costs of enforcement raids, detention pending removal, and other aspects of the current asymmetric regime, an Executive under pressure to address illegal immigration would be more likely to utilize his delegated authority to address the problem on the front end</u></strong></span>. n274 This dynamic was clearly apparent in the 1970s, when the lower courts during the Haitian refugee crises applied due process norms to force the Executive to change its policies with respect to the removal of unauthorized immigrants. The Reagan Administration, of course, ran an end-run around the courts by adopting an interdiction policy subject to even fewer due process and oversight constraints than the policy it replaced. But <span class="underline"><strong><u>today's dilemma of unauthorized immigration would not obviously lend itself to this kind of extraterritorial solution, because by definition the problem involves persons in the territory of the United States. In addition to these challenges, we recognize that delegating formal screening authority to the President presents legitimacy concerns</u></strong></span>. As we [*545] explain above, much of this concern is misguided, given that the President already exercises screening authority through de facto delegation. Moreover, if a concern for accountability drives the worry over delegation, the history laid out in Part II highlights the error of making simple-minded statements about superior congressional accountability in the immigration arena. The Executive's unitary cast might well mean that its decision-making processes are less deliberative than Congress's (though notice and comment procedures can recreate some public deliberation). Part II also provides some suggestive evidence that the President has been more open to higher levels of immigration, as the Bracero experiment and the saga of the literacy test vetoes underscore. n275 But this evidence cannot tell us in the abstract whether the President or Congress is more likely to be responsive to voters. To be sure, the President is likely to be responsive to a different set of voters. According to a standard trope, the President lacks the regional bias of Congress and is therefore more likely to approximate the views of the median voter, or to overcome obstacles erected by regional minorities in the Senate. n276 Whereas the intensity of regional preferences can allow a minority coalition to block reform in Congress, the President through the administrative process is arguably better positioned to effectively balance competing interests, such as the interests of employers, labor, and immigrants themselves. Of course, <span class="underline"><strong><u>whether we can conclude that the President is more accountable to the people than Congress depends on to whom accountability should run</u></strong></span> - a question beyond the scope of this Article. For our purposes, we simply underscore that Congress [*546] does not have a monopoly on the virtue of accountability. n277 Most importantly, we are writing in a context in which Congress does not appear capable of or willing to act to address the pathologies we have outlined. </span></span><br />

It defies logic to say that, in reaching a judicial decision, a judge may review and &quot;consider&quot; the opinions of foreign tribunals without ultimately &quot;using&quot; those opinions. In other words, even if Sotomayor suggests that she does not advocate &quot;using&quot; foreign law as binding or controlling authority, her own statements concede that she endorses its &quot;use&quot; as persuasive authority. <strong><u><span class="underline">This &quot;use&quot; is dangerous, because American law is unique--the constitutional protection of free speech, for example, is far more robust than in most other nations--and so relying on persuasive foreign authority could serve to undermine these key, and uniquely American, constitutional protections.</span></u></strong> </span></span><br />

<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';">Customary international law is different. Unlike treaties, <span class="underline"><strong></u>customary international law is not created by what states put down in writing but, rather, by what states do in practice<u></strong></span>. In order for there to be a rule of customary international law, there must be an authoritative state practice. In order words<span class="underline"><strong></u>, states must engage in a particular activity and believe that such activity is required by law<u></strong></span>. Diplomatic immunity, for example, began as a rule of customary international law before it was ultimately codified in a treaty. Centuries ago, states began the practice of granting diplomats immunity from local jurisdiction for a variety of pragmatic reasons: they did not wish to cut off a channel of communication; they feared that, if they arrested diplomats of a foreign state, the foreign state would do the same to their diplomats; and so on. As time passed, more and more states began to grant immunity until virtually all states in the international system were giving diplomats immunity. Gradually, these states that had originally begun granting immunity for largely practical reasons came to believe that granting such immunity was required by law. At that point, there was a rule of customary international law—when there was both a near-universal practice and a belief that the practice was required by law. <span class="underline"><strong></u>Under the regime of customary international law<u></strong></span> that developed long before the UN Charter was adopted, it <span class="underline"><strong></u>was generally accepted that preemptive force was permissible in self-defense. There was, in other words, an accepted doctrine of anticipatory self-defense.<u></strong></span> The classic case that articulated this doctrine is the oft-cited Caroline incident.  </span></span><br />
