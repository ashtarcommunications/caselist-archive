TEXT: The President of the United States should issue an executive order to provide an avenue without numerical limits for foreign nationals with who would be eligible for family-based visas restricted from eligibility on the basis of queerness to reside in the United States regardless of acquisition of family-based visas.

Speaking is impossible in the realm of modern, capitalist politics – capitalist ideology controls how the message is received and interpreted. This process merely strengthens the system by producing new avenues of control. Without problematizing capitalism first, liberty is impossible.  <br />

Invisible Commitee <br />
Embrace invisibility! Trying to make the Queer seen and heard steals their most offensive weapon in the fight against oppresssion. When we are seen we are targetable. Invisibility produces the maximum freedom of action, until the oppressed masses have reached the opportune moment. Once seen, the clock is set and we must make the most of our time. <br />

Revolution is not a linear explosion from a singular point, it’s a cascade, a resonance that builds on momentum – today the sound of revolution is upon us and we should add our voice to the collective music of our time. The revolutionary potential of the ballot is not an endorsement of a specific policy – it is the continuance of the revolutionary momentum. <br />

Zizek 10,[ Slavoj, “Living in the End Times” pg: x-xi] <br />
<br />
The underlying premise of the present book is a simple one: the global capitalist system is approaching an apocalyptic zero-point. Its “four riders of the apocalypse” are comprised by the ecological crisis, the consequences of the biogenetic revolution, imbalances within the system itself (problems with intellectual property; forthcoming struggles over raw materials, food and water) and the explosive growth of social divisions and exclusions. <br />
To take up only the last point, <br />
AND <br />
it might succeed relies on a fantasmatic vision. <br />
<br />
The alternative is to ethically withdraw your belief and support of capitalism – you ethically participate in the construction of capitalism by believing and supporting it—while we can’t destroy capitalism – your ballot is an opportunity to withdraw your particular ethical relationship to it. It is our belief that sustains the violence within Capital – rejection is an ethical imperative. <br />

Capitalism is on the brink – it is at the edge of a structural crisis that it cannot emerge from. The democractization of the world has produced an increased demand for more income, more health care, more products that the system cannot handle. The cost of production has increased beyond the elasticity of demand. The final economic bubble will be state indebtedness – a collapse already manifesting itself in the economies of PIIGs nations. As a result, we are in an age of political, economic and sociocultural chaos, a chaos that is beyond the grasp of public policy. The lesson is clear: capitalism cannot continue – the only political question is then how to reconstruct society. The alternative is to reject the distraction of the affirmative and the pathological desire to “develop” the U.S. economy by injecting foreign capital or attracting entrepeuners – non of these fixes can resolve the inevitability of capitalisms collapse. Instead we must focus our political agency and social capital toward producing a new economic and political system. <br />
