<strong><span style="color: black;">Massive skills shortage in cyber-defense industry now- makes us vulnerable to a cyber attack </span></strong><br />
<strong>NPR, 2010</strong><br />
[<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100536" rel="nofollow">Tom Gjelten</a> July 19th “Cyberwarrior Shortage Threatens U.S. Security” Accessed 9/21/10 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128574055" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128574055</a> JCP] There may be <u>no country on the planet more vulnerable to a massive cyberattack than the United States</u>, where financial, transportation, telecommunications and even military operations are now deeply dependent on data networking. What's worse: U.S. security officials say the country's cyberdefenses are not up to the challenge. In part, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it's due to a severe shortage of computer security specialists and engineers with the skills and knowledge necessary to do battle against would-be adversaries</span></u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The protection of U.S. computer systems essentially requires an army of cyberwarriors, but the recruitment of that force is suffering</span></u>. &quot;We don't have sufficiently bright people moving into this field to support those national security objectives as we move forward in time,&quot; says James Gosler, a veteran cybersecurity specialist who has worked at the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Energy Department. If U.S. cyberdefenses are to be improved, more people like Gosler will be needed on the front lines. Gosler, 58, works at the Energy Department's Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., where he focuses on ways to counter efforts to penetrate U.S. data networks. It's an ever-increasing challenge. &quot;You can have vulnerabilities in the fundamentals of the technology, you can have vulnerabilities introduced based on how that technology is implemented, and you can have vulnerabilities introduced through the artificial applications that are built on that fundamental technology,&quot; Gosler says. &quot;<u>It takes a very skilled person to operate at that level, and we don't have enough of them</u>.&quot; Gosler estimates there are now only 1,000 people in the entire United States with the sophisticated skills needed for the most demanding cyberdefense tasks. To meet the computer security needs of U.S. government agencies and large corporations, he says, a force of 20,000 to 30,000 similarly skilled specialists is needed<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.

<strong>Visa restrictions are creating an R&amp;D shortage crippling our cyber security</strong><br />
<strong>Piper 09</strong> (Greg, Washington Internet Daily Staff Writer, October 21, “Ex-Officials Tell Entrepreneurs How to Pitch Cybersecurity to Feds,” WASHINGTON INTERNET DAILY Vol. 10 No. 202) <br />
<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Companies providing cybersecurity solutions will be eligible for the bonanza of spending once the White House cybersecurity operation is complete</span></u>, Minihan said. &quot;I don't wring my hands too much that we're grinding our way through this,&quot; considering that procurements are virtually certain from the U.S. Cyber Command, the National Security Agency and the Defense Information Systems Agency, he said. &quot;You need to make your way horizontally across the government&quot; to take advantage of &quot;dual-use&quot; opportunities for products and services focused on network assurance, authentication and diagnostic -- real-time -- protection, Minihan said. Since most critical infrastructure is in private hands in the U.S., companies &quot;have to be involved as an equal partner in what we, the government, may do,&quot; Russell said. That means companies need to be careful about protecting their own intellectual property from industrial espionage, such as leaks in their networks, he said. Wade said the White House has correctly focused on the &quot;human dimension&quot; of cybersecurity, such as policy development, tradeoffs and how to measure security: &quot;We don't even have fundamental concepts yet&quot; for measurement and evaluating different technologies. &quot;This is not a mature market&quot; and the government is dealing more with commercial-technology providers, as opposed to government-focused integrators, he said. But the government is also making decisions much more quickly than in 2001, when Wade took over as CIO of the CIA, he said. China's suspected role in much industrial espionage shouldn't drive U.S. decision making on cybersecurity, Wade said. &quot;I wouldn't get too hung up on where the threat comes from,&quot; he told a questioner. Much of the same technology to guard against cyberattacks is useful to prevent &quot;self- inflicted wounds&quot; by employees and software bugs. Minihan told another questioner that foreign adversaries already have a &quot;persistent presence&quot; in government systems, but that adversaries are limited by their ability to process all the information held by the government in exposed systems. The &quot;'gotcha' tip of the iceberg&quot; -- embarrassing breaches -- must not be the focus of agencies and cybersecurity providers, because the rest of the iceberg can be addressed with &quot;building codes and standards,&quot; Minihan said. Asked about an open letter to the White House from <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">several security</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">CEOs</span></u> that called <u>for more federal cybersecurity R&amp;D,</u> Security Innovation Network founder Robert Rodriguez <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">blamed the R&amp;D shortage partly on immigration rules.</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> Some of <u>the most innovative entrepreneurs in security have left the U.S. because of an</u> </span><u>H-1B <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">visa shortage</span></u>, he said. Wade said the National Science Foundation is promoting &quot;leap- ahead technology&quot; through sponsored conferences on both coasts to bring together academic researchers, and Defense is sponsoring similar gatherings. &quot;<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There's a substantial amount of money that's going to be thrown at this problem,&quot; but entrepreneurs must be ready to pitch a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in cybersecurity, not a marginally better product</span></u>, Russell said. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Any system can be hacked, so the U.S. needs a competitive advantage in advanced technology to stay ahead of threats</span></u>, he said. -- Greg Piper <br />

<strong><span style="color: black;">The threat of cyber warfare is real- countries are increasing attacks against the US- every attack increases the risk of major power war </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> Habiger 10</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> (Eugene, Retired Air Force General, “ CYBERWARFARE AND CYBERTERRORISM: THE NEED FOR A NEW U.S. STRATEGIC APPROACH,” The Cyber Security Institute, February 1)</span><br />
However, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there are reasons to believe that what is going on now amounts to a fundamental shift</span> as opposed to business as usual</u>. Today’s network exploitation or information operation trespasses possess a number of characteristics that suggest that the line between espionage and conflict has been, or is close to being, crossed. (What that suggests for the proper response is a different matter.) First, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the number of cyberattacks we are facing is growing significantly</span></u>. Andrew Palowitch, a former CIA official now consulting with the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), which oversees the Defense Department’s Joint Task Force<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 10pt;">‐</span>Global Network Operations, recently told a meeting of experts that the Defense Department has experienced almost 80,000 computer attacks, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and some number of these assaults have actually “reduced” the military’s “operational capabilities</span></u>.”20 Second, the nature of these attacks is starting to shift from penetration attempts aimed at gathering intelligence (cyber spying) to offensive efforts aimed at taking down systems (cyberattacks). Palowitch put this in stark terms last November, “<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We are currently in a cyberwar </span>and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">war is going on today</span></u>.”21 Third, these recent attacks need to be taken in a broader strategic context. Both Russia and China have stepped up their offensive efforts and taken a much more aggressive cyberwarfare posture. The Chinese have developed an openly discussed cyberwar strategy aimed at achieving electronic dominance over the U.S. and its allies by 2050. In 2007 the Department of Defense reported that <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for the first time China has developed first strike viruses, marking a major shift from prior investments in defensive measures</span></u>.22 And in the intervening period China has launched a series of offensive cyber operations against U.S. government and private sector networks and infrastructure. In 2007, Gen. James Cartwright, the former head of STRATCOM and now the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the US<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 10pt;">‐</span>China Economic and Security Review Commission that China’s ability to launch “denial of service” attacks to overwhelm an IT system is of particular concern. 23 <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Russia also has already begun to wage offensive cyberwar.</span></u> At the outset of the <u>recent hostilities with Georgia</u>, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Russian assets launched a series of cyberattacks against the Georgian</span></u> government and its critical infrastructure systems, including media, banking and transportation sites.24 In 2007, cyberattacks that many experts attribute, directly or indirectly, to Russia shut down the Estonia government’s IT systems. Fourth, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the current geopolitical context must also be factored </span>into any effort to gauge the degree of threat of cyberwar</u>. The start of the new Obama Administration has begun to help reduce tensions between the United States and other nations. And, <u>the new administration has taken initial steps to improve bilateral relations specifically with both China and Russia</u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">However, it must be said that over the last few years the posture of both the Chinese and Russian governments toward America has clearly become more assertive, and at times even aggressive.</span></u> Some commentators have talked about <u>the prospects of a cyber Pearl Harbor, and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the pattern of Chinese and Russian behavior to date gives reason for concern along these lines: both nations have offensive cyberwarfare strategies in place;</span></u> both nations have taken the cyber equivalent of building up their forces; both nations now regularly probe our cyber defenses looking for gaps to be exploited; both nations have begun taking actions that cross the line from cyberespionage to cyberaggression; and, our bilateral relations with both nations are increasingly fractious and complicated by areas of marked, direct competition. Clearly, there a sharp differences between current U.S. relations with these two nations and relations between the US and Japan just prior to World War II. However, from a strategic defense perspective, there are enough warning signs to warrant preparation. In addition to the threat of cyberwar, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the limited resources required to carry out even a large scale cyberattack also makes likely </span>the potential for a significant cyberterror attack against the</u> <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates. However, the lack of a long list of specific incidences of cyberterrorism should provide no comfort. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There is strong evidence to suggest that al Qaeda has the ability to conduct cyberterror attacks against the</span></u> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates and its allies. Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are extremely active in cyberspace, using these technologies to communicate among themselves and others, carry out logistics, recruit members, and wage information warfare. For example, al Qaeda leaders used email to communicate with the 9<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>11 terrorists and the 9<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>11 terrorists used the Internet to make travel plans and book flights. Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda members routinely post videos and other messages to online sites to communicate. Moreover, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there is evidence of efforts that al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are actively developing cyberterrorism capabilities and seeking to carry out cyberterrorist attacks</span></u>. For example, the Washington Post has reported that “U.S. investigators have found evidence in the logs that mark a browser's path through the Internet that al Qaeda operators spent time on sites that offer software and programming instructions for the digital switches that run power, water, transport and communications grids. In some interrogations . . . al Qaeda prisoners have described intentions, in general terms, to use those tools.”25 Similarly, a 2002 CIA report on the cyberterror threat to a member of the Senate stated that <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">al Qaeda and Hezbollah have become &quot;more adept at using the internet and computer technologies.”</span></u>26 The FBI has issued bulletins stating that, “U. S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies have received indications that Al Qaeda members have sought information on Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems available on multiple SCADA<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>related web sites.”27 In addition a number of jihadist websites, such as 7hj.7hj.com, teach computer attack and hacking skills in the service of Islam.28 While al Qaeda may lack the cyber<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>attack capability of nations like Russia and China, there is every reason to believe its operatives, and those of its ilk, are as capable as the cyber criminals and hackers who routinely effect great harm on the world’s digital infrastructure generally and American assets specifically. In fact, perhaps, <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the most troubling indication of the level of the cyberterrorist threat is the countless, serious non</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">terrorist cyberattacks routinely carried out by criminals, hackers, disgruntled insiders,</span></u> crime syndicates and the like. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">If run</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">of</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">the</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">mill criminals and hackers can threaten powergrids, hack vital military networks,</span></u> steal vast sums of money, take down a city’s of traffic lights, compromise the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic control systems, among other attacks, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">it is overwhelmingly likely that terrorists can carry out similar, if not more malicious attacks</span></u>. Moreover, even if the world’s terrorists are unable to breed these skills, they can certainly buy them. There are untold numbers of cybermercenaries around the world—sophisticated hackers with advanced training who would be willing to offer their services for the right price. Finally, given the nature of our understanding of cyber threats, there is always the possibility that we have already been the victim or a cyberterrorist attack, or such an attack has already been set but not yet effectuated, and we don’t know it yet. Instead, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">a well</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif;">‐</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">designed cyberattack has the capacity cause widespread chaos, sow societal unrest</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">, undermine national governments, spread paralyzing fear and anxiety, and create a state of utter turmoil, all without taking a single life</span></u>. <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">A sophisticated cyberattack could throw a nation’s banking and finance system into chaos causing markets to crash, prompting runs on banks, degrading confidence in markets, perhaps even putting the nation’s currency in play and making the government look helpless and hapless</span></u>. <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">In today’s difficult economy, imagine how Americans would react if vast sums of money were taken from their accounts and their supporting financial records were destroye</span></u>d<u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. A truly nefarious cyberattacker could carry out an attack in such a way</span></u> (akin to Robin Hood) <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">as to engender populist support and deepen rifts within our society</span></u>, thereby making efforts to restore the system all the more difficult. A modestly advanced enemy could use a cyberattack to shut down (if not physically damage) one or more regional power grids. An entire region could be cast into total darkness, power<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>dependent systems could be shutdown. An attack on one or more regional power grids could also cause cascading effects that could jeopardize our entire national grid. When word leaks that the blackout was caused by a cyberattack, the specter of a foreign enemy capable of sending the entire nation into darkness would only increase the fear, turmoil and unrest. While the finance and energy sectors are considered prime targets for a cyberattack, an attack on any of the 17 delineated critical infrastructure sectors could have a major impact on the United States. For example, our healthcare system is already technologically driven and the Obama Administration’s e<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>health efforts will only increase that dependency<u>. A cyberattack on the U.S. e</u><u><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 10pt;">‐</span></u><u>health infrastructure could send our healthcare system into chaos and put countless of lives at risk</u>. Imagine if emergency room physicians and surgeons were suddenly no longer able to access vital patient information. <u>A cyberattack on our nation’s water systems could likewise cause widespread disruption</u>. An attack on the control systems for one or more dams could put entire communities at risk of being inundated, <u>and could create ripple effects across the water</u>, agriculture, and energy sectors. Similar water control system attacks could be used to at least temporarily deny water to otherwise arid regions, impacting everything from the quality of life in these areas to agriculture. In 2007, the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit determined that the destruction from a single wave of cyberattacks on critical infrastructures could exceed $700 billion, which would be the rough equivalent of 50 Katrina<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>esque hurricanes hitting the United States all at the same time.29 Similarly, one IT security source has estimated that the impact of <u>a single day cyberwar attack that focused on and disrupted U.S. credit and debit card transactions</u> would be approximately $35 billion.30 Another way to gauge the potential for harm is in comparison to other similar noncyberattack infrastructure failures. For example, the August 2003 <u>regional power grid blackout is estimated to have cost the U.S. economy up to $10 billion</u>, or roughly .1 percent of the nation’s GDP. 31 That said, a cyberattack of the exact same magnitude would most certainly have a much larger impact. The origin of the 2003 blackout was almost immediately disclosed as an atypical system failure having nothing to do with terrorism. This made the event both less threatening and likely a single time occurrence. Had it been disclosed that the event was the result of an attack that could readily be repeated the impacts would likely have grown substantially, if not exponentially. Additionally, <u>a cyberattack could also be used to disrupt our nation’s defenses or distract our national leaders in advance of a more traditional conventional or strategic attack</u>. Many military leaders actually believe that such a disruptive cyber pre<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>offensive is the most effective use of offensive cyber capabilities. This is, in fact, the way Russia utilized cyberattackers—whether government assets, governmentdirected/ coordinated assets, or allied cyber irregulars—in advance of the invasion of Georgia. Widespread distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks were launched on the Georgian governments IT systems. Roughly a day later Russian armor rolled into Georgian territory. The cyberattacks were used to prepare the battlefield; they denied the Georgian government a critical communications tool isolating it from its citizens and degrading its command and control capabilities precisely at the time of attack. In this way, these attacks were the functional equivalent of conventional air and/or missile strikes on a nation’s communications infrastructure.32 One interesting element of the Georgian cyberattacks has been generally overlooked: On July 20th, weeks before the August cyberattack, the website of Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was overwhelmed by a more narrowly focused, but technologically similar DDOS attack.33 This should be particularly chilling to American national security experts as our systems undergo the same sorts of focused, probing attacks on a constant basis. The ability of an enemy to use a cyberattack to counter our offensive capabilities or soften our defenses for a wider offensive against the United States is much more than mere speculation. In fact, in Iraq it is already happening. Iraq insurgents are now using off<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>the<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>shelf software (costing just $26) to hack U.S. drones (costing $4.5 million each), allowing them to intercept the video feed from these drones.34 <u>By hacking these drones the insurgents have succeeded in greatly reducing one of our most valuable sources of real</u><u><span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 10pt;">‐</span></u><u>time intelligence and situational awareness. If our enemies in Iraq are capable of such an effective cyberattack against one of our more sophisticated systems, consider what a more technologically advanced enemy could do</u>. At the strategic level, in 2008, as the United States Central Command was leading wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan, a cyber intruder compromised the security of the Command and sat within its IT systems, monitoring everything the Command was doing. 35 This time the attacker simply gathered vast amounts of intelligence. However, <u>it is clear that the attacker could have used this access to wage cyberwar</u>—altering information, disrupting the flow of information, destroying information, taking down systems—against the United States forces already at war. Similarly, during 2003 as the United States prepared for and began the War in Iraq, the IT networks of the Department of Defense were hacked 294 times.36 By August of 2004, with America at war, these ongoing attacks compelled then<span style="font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; font-size: 8pt;">‐</span>Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz to write in a memo that, &quot;Recent exploits have reduced operational capabilities on our networks.&quot;37 This wasn’t the first time that our national security IT infrastructure was penetrated immediately in advance of a U.S. military option.38 In February of 1998 the Solar Sunrise attacks systematically compromised a series of Department of Defense networks. What is often overlooked is that these attacks occurred during the ramp up period ahead of potential military action against Iraq. The attackers were able to obtain vast amounts of sensitive information—information that would have certainly been of value to an enemy’s military leaders. There is no way to prove that these actions were purposefully launched with the specific intent to distract American military assets or degrade our capabilities. However, such ambiguities—the inability to specifically attribute actions and motives to actors—are the very nature of cyberspace. Perhaps, these repeated patterns of behavior were mere coincidence, or perhaps they weren’t. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The potential that an enemy might use a cyberattack to soften physical defenses</span>, increase the gravity of harms from kinetic attacks, or both, significantly increases the potential harms from a cyberattack</u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Consider the gravity of the threat and risk if an enemy</span>, rightly or wrongly, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">believed that it could use a cyberattack to degrade our strategic weapons capabilities.

<strong>Cyber terrorism risk multiple scenarios for nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Fritz 09</strong> (A study commissioned by the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament Hacking Nuclear Command and Control Jason Fritz BS (St. Cloud), July 2009) <br />
Direct control of launch <br />
The US uses the two-man rule to achieve a higher level of security in nuclear affairs. Under this rule two authorized personnel must be present and in agreement during critical stages of nuclear command and control. The President must jointly issue a launch order with the Secretary of Defense; Minuteman missile operators must agree that the launch order is valid; and on a submarine, both the commanding officer and executive officer must agree that the order to launch is valid. In the US, in order to execute a nuclear launch, an Emergency Action Message (EAM) is needed. This is a preformatted message that directs nuclear forces to execute a specific attack. The contents of an EAM change daily and consist of a complex code read by a human voice. Regular monitoring by shortwave listeners and videos posted to YouTube provide insight into how these work. These are issued from the NMCC, or in the event of destruction, from the designated hierarchy of command and control centres. Once a command centre has confirmed the EAM, using the two-man rule, the Permissive Action Link (PAL) codes are entered to arm the weapons and the message is sent out. These messages are sent in digital format via the secure Automatic Digital Network and then relayed to aircraft via single-sideband radio transmitters of the High Frequency Global Communications System, and, at least in the past, sent to nuclear capable submarines via Very Low Frequency (Greenemeier 2008, Hardisty 1985). The technical details of VLF submarine communication methods can be found online, including PC-based VLF reception. Some reports have noted a Pentagon review, which showed <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a potential “electronic back door into the US Navy’s system for broadcasting nuclear launch orders to Trident submarines”</span></u> (Peterson 2004). The investigation showed that <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">cyber terrorists could potentially infiltrate this network and insert false orders for launch.</span></u> The investigation led to “elaborate new instructions for validating launch orders” (Blair 2003). Adding further to the concern of cyber terrorists seizing control over submarine launched nuclear missiles; The Royal Navy announced in 2008 that it would be installing a Microsoft Windows operating system on its nuclear submarines (Page 2008). The choice of operating system, apparently based on Windows XP, is not as alarming as the advertising of such a system is. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">This may attract hackers and narrow the necessary reconnaissance to learning its details and potential exploits</span></u>. It is unlikely that the operating system would play a direct role in the signal to launch, although this is far from certain. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Knowledge of the operating system may lead to the insertion of malicious code,</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> which could be used to gain accelerating privileges, tracking, valuable information, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and deception that could subsequently be used to initiate a launch</span></span></u>. Remember from Chapter 2 that the UK’s nuclear submarines have the authority to launch if they believe the central command has been destroyed. <br />
<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Attempts by cyber terrorists to create the illusion of a decapitating strike could also be used to engage fail-deadly systems</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">. Open source knowledge is scarce as to whether Russia continues to operate such a system</span></u>. However evidence suggests that they have in the past. Perimetr, also known as <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Dead Hand,</span></u><u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> was an automated system <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">set to launch a mass scale nuclear attack in the event of a decapitation strike against Soviet leadership</span></span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> a</span>nd military. <br />
In a crisis, military officials would send a coded message to the bunkers, switching on the dead hand. If nearby ground-level sensors detected a nuclear attack on Moscow, and if a break was detected in communications links with top military commanders, the system would send low-frequency signals over underground antennas to special rockets. Flying high over missile fields and other military sites, these rockets in turn would broadcast attack orders to missiles, bombers and, via radio relays, submarines at sea. Contrary to some Western beliefs, Dr. Blair says, many of Russia's nuclear-armed missiles in underground silos and on mobile launchers can be fired automatically. (Broad 1993) <br />
Assuming such a system is still active, <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">cyber terrorists would need to create a crisis situation in order to activate Perimetr, and then fool it into believing a decapitating strike had taken place</span></u>. While this is not an easy task, the information age makes it easier. <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Cyber reconnaissance could help locate the machine and learn its inner workings. This could be done by targeting the computers high of level official’s</span></u>—anyone who has reportedly worked on such a project, or individuals involved in military operations at underground facilities, such as those reported to be located at Yamantau and Kosvinksy mountains in the central southern Urals (Rosenbaum 2007, Blair 2008) <br />
Indirect Control of Launch <br />
<u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Cyber terrorists could cause incorrect information to be transmitted, received, or displayed at nuclear command and control centres, or shut down these centres’ computer networks completely</span></u>. In 1995, a Norwegian scientific sounding rocket was mistaken by Russian early warning systems as a nuclear missile launched from a US submarine. A radar operator used Krokus to notify a general on duty who decided to alert the highest levels. Kavkaz was implemented, all three chegets activated, and the countdown for a nuclear decision began. It took eight minutes before the missile was properly identified—a considerable amount of time considering the speed with which a nuclear response must be decided upon (Aftergood 2000). <br />
<u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Creating a false signal in these early warning systems would be relatively easy using computer network operations</span></u>. The real difficulty would be gaining access to these systems as they are most likely on a closed network. However, <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">if they are transmitting wirelessly, that may provide an entry point, and information gained through the internet may reveal the details, such as passwords and software, for gaining entrance to the closed network</span></u>. If access was obtained, <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">a false alarm could be followed by something like a DDoS attack</span></u>, so the operators believe an attack may be imminent, yet they can no longer verify it. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">This could add pressure to the decision making process, and if coordinated precisely, could appear as a first round EMP burst</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Terrorist groups could also attempt to launch a non-nuclear missile</span></u>, such as the one used by Norway, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">in an attempt to fool the system</span></u>. The number of states who possess such technology is far greater than the number of states who possess nuclear weapons. Obtaining them would be considerably easier, especially when enhancing operations through computer network operations. <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Combining traditional terrorist methods with cyber techniques opens opportunities neither could accomplish on their own</span></u>. For example, <u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">radar stations might be more vulnerable to a computer attack, while satellites are more vulnerable to jamming from a laser beam, thus <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">together they deny dual phenomenology</span>. Mapping communications networks through cyber reconnaissance may expose weaknesses, and automated scanning devices created by more experienced hackers can be readily found on the internet. </span></u><br />
Intercepting or spoofing communications is a highly complex science. These systems are designed to protect against the world’s most powerful and well funded militaries. Yet, there are recurring gaffes, and the very nature of asymmetric warfare is to bypass complexities by finding simple loopholes. For example, commercially available software for voice-morphing could be used to capture voice commands within the command and control structure, cut these sound bytes into phonemes, and splice it back together in order to issue false voice commands (Andersen 2001, Chapter 16). Spoofing could also be used to escalate a volatile situation in the hopes of starting a nuclear war. “ <strong>[they cut off the paragraph]</strong> “In June 1998, a group of international hackers calling themselves Milw0rm hacked the web site of India’s Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) and put up a spoofed web page showing a mushroom cloud and the text “If <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">a nuclear war does start</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">,</span> you will be the first to scream” (Denning 1999). Hacker web-page defacements like these are often derided by critics of cyber terrorism as simply being a nuisance which causes no significant harm. However, web-page defacements are becoming more common, and they point towards alarming possibilities in subversion. During the 2007 cyber attacks against Estonia, a counterfeit letter of apology from Prime Minister Andrus Ansip was planted on his political party website (Grant 2007). This took place amid the confusion of mass DDoS attacks, real world protests, and accusations between governments. <br />

<span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in;">While the satellite broadband market slowed in 2009 because of the poor economy, it still increased. The market continues to expand after U.S. regulators outlined the national broadband plan that allows satellite operators to use their radio spectrum for Internet traffic. That is why cyber security professionals are so concerned about the convergence of cyber space and space. </span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in;">Its becoming increasingly evident that <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">any future war between modern militaries would be both a space war and a cyber war</span></u>, in fact, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">they would be one and the same</span></u>.

<span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt; margin: 0in;">That sounds so familiar – oh wait a minute, didn’t <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Russia, China and the U.S. say the same thing about cyber war</span></u>?

<span class="Underline">The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense ‘use or lose’ pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting. Death Start with automated ‘hair trigger’ devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict</span>. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed ‘<em>complexlyinteractive,</em> tightly coupled’ industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee</span> all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, ‘<em>[t]he odd term “normal accident” is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable’.36</em> Deployment of space weapons with predelegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to <em>“normal accidents’.</em> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, <em>‘<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage- even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size</span>!’.37</em> In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: <em>’One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people’.</em></span> Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear biological, and/or chemical weapons. An accidental war sparked by a computer glitch in space could plunge the world into the most destructive military conflict ever see</span>n. </span><br />

<strong>And retaliation of a cyber-attack ensures global nuclear war</strong><br />

<span style="tab-stops: 585.0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">At a time when it seems impossible to avoid the seemingly growing hysteria over the threat of cyber war,[1] </span><u>network security expert Marcus Ranum</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> delivered a refreshing talk recently, “The Problem with Cyber War,” that took a critical look at a number of the assumptions underlying contemporary cybersecurity discourse in the United States. He </span><u>addressed</u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">one issue in partiuclar that I would like to riff on here, the issue of </span><u>conflict escalation</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">–i.e. </span><u>the possibility that offensive use of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cyber attacks could escalate to the use of physical force</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> As I will show, </span><u>his concerns are entirely legitimate</u> <u>as current U.S. military cyber doctrine assumes the possibility of</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> what I call “</span><u>cross-domain responses” to cyberattacks</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. Backing Your Adversary (Mentally) into a Corner Based on the premise that completely blinding a potential adversary is a good indicator to that adversary that an attack is iminent, Ranum has argued that “</span><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">The best thing</span></u></strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;"> that you could possibly do if you want <strong>to start World War III</strong> is launch a cyber attack</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. [...] When people talk about cyber war like it’s a practical thing, what they’re really doing is messing with the OK button for starting World War III. We need to get them to sit the f-k down and shut the f-k up.” [2] He is making a point similar to one that I have made in the past: Taking away an adversary’s ability to make rational decisions could backfire. [3] For example, Gregory Witol cautions that “attacking the decision maker’s ability to perform rational calculations may cause more problems than it hopes to resolve. </span><u>Removing the capacity for rational action may result in completely unforeseen consequences, including longer and bloodier battles than may otherwise have been</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">.” [4] Cross-Domain Response So, from a theoretical standpoint, I think his concerns are well founded. But th</span><u>e current state of U.S. policy may be cause for even greater concern. It’s not just worrisome that a hypothetical blinding attack via cyberspace could send a signal of imminent attack and therefore trigger an irrational response from the adversary. What is also cause for concern is that current <strong>U.S. policy indicates that “kinetic attacks</strong>”</u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">(i.e. physical use of force) </span><strong><u>are seen as</u></strong> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">potentially </span><strong><u>legitimate responses to cyber attacks</u></strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. Most worrisome is that </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">current U.S. policy implies that a <strong>nuclear response is possible</strong></span></u><u>, something that policy makers have not denied in recent press reports</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. The reason, in part, is that </span><u>the U.S. defense community has increasingly come to see cyberspace as a “domain of warfare” equivalent to air, land, sea, and space.</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> The definition of cyberspace as its own domain of warfare helps in its own right to blur the online/offline, physical-space/cyberspace boundary. But thinking logically about the potential consequences of this framing leads to some disconcerting conclusions. </span><u>If cyberspace is a domain of warfare, then it becomes possible to define “cyber attacks”</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> (whatever those may be said to entail) </span><u>as acts of war.</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> But </span><u>what happens <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if the U.S. is attacked in any of the other domains? It retaliates</span>.</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> But it usually does not respond only within the domain in which it was attacked. Rather, </span><u>responses are typically “cross-domain responses”–i.e. a massive bombing on U.S. soil or vital U.S. interests abroad</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> (e.g. think 9/11 or Pearl Harbor) </span><u>might lead to air strikes against the attacker</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. Ev</span><u>en more likely given a U.S. military “way of warfare” that emphasizes multidimensional, “joint” operations is a massive conventional</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> (i.e. non-nuclear) </span><u>response against the attacker in all domains</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> (air, land, sea, space), </span><u>simultaneously</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">. </span><u>The possibility of “kinetic action” in response to cyber attack, or as part of offensive U.S. cyber operations, is part of the current</u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">(2006) N</span><u>ational Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations</u> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">[5]: Of course, the possibility that a cyber attack on the U.S. could lead to a U.S. nuclear reply constitutes possibly the ultimate in “cross-domain response.” And while this may seem far fetched, it has not been ruled out by U.S. defense policy makers and is, in fact, implied in current U.S. defense policy documents. From the National Military Strategy of the United States (2004): “The term WMD/E relates to a broad range of adversary capabilities that pose potentially devastating impacts. WMD/E includes chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and enhanced high explosive weapons as well as other, more asymmetrical ‘weapons’. They may rely more on disruptive impact than destructive kinetic effects. For example, cyber attacks on US commercial information systems or attacks against transportation networks may have a greater economic or psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent.” [6] The authors of a 2009 National Academies of Science report on cyberwarfare respond to this by saying, “Coupled with the declaratory policy on nuclear weapons described earlier, this statement implies that </span><u>the United States will regard certain kinds of cyberattacks against the United States as being in the same category as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons, and thus that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a nuclear response to certain kinds of cyberattacks</span></u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> (namely, cyberattacks with devastating impacts) </span><u>may be possible.</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;"> It also sets a relevant scale–a cyberattack that has an impact larger than that associated with a relatively small release of a lethal agent is regarded with the same or greater seriousness.” [7] Asked by the New York Times to comment on this, </span><u>U.S. defense officials would not deny that nuclear retaliation remains an option for response to a massive cyberattack</u><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">: </span></span><br />

<em>“Since the invention of the first computer-assisted industrial control system (ICS) device over 40 years ago, both the technical and national security communities have voiced concerns about software and hardware vulnerabilities and potential security risks associated with these devices. Such concerns have generally involved the infiltration of a computer system for purposes of degrading its capabilities, manipulating data, or using the device to launch cyber attacks on other systems. <u>The Stuxnet worm</u>, which was first reported in June 2010 by a security firm in Belarus, appears to be the first malicious <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.investingcontrarian.com/index.php/financial-news-network/stuxnet-at-least-its-not-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__software__</a> (malware<u>) designed specifically to attack</u> a particular type of ICS: one that <u>controls nuclear plants</u>, whether for power or uranium enrichment.

It is difficult to determine the geographic origin of the malware, as cyber attackers often employ sophisticated methods such as peer-to-peer networking or spoofing IP addresses to obviate attribution. Likewise, malware placed on a removable device may contain no signatures that would identify its author. Some security analysts speculate that Stuxnet could have been developed by a Siemens insider who had direct access and knowledge of the system; others contend that the code’s sophistication suggests that a nation state was behind the worm’s development, either through proxy computer specialists or a government’s own internal government and military capabilities.</em><br />
<em>To date, numerous countries are known to have been affected by the Stuxnet worm to varying degrees of disruption in their technology systems. These include Iran, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Germany, China, and the United States. A lack of publicly available information on the damage caused by Stuxnet in these countries makes it difficult to determine the malware’s potency.”</em><br />
It is fascinating to consider how <u>bytes can be substituted for bombs</u>. It is even more fascinating when you read reports of how <u>STUXNET is wreaking havoc on its apparent target, the Iranian nuclear program</u>. <br />

<span style="font-family: Arnhem-Blond,serif;">The U.S. will also work in partnership with our Host Cities, and where possible include these national football initiatives in the “green zones” that some of these cities have established.

Green zones feature initiatives such as home weatherization and building retrofits for energy efficiency; funding from the U.S. Smart Grid project; new economic investment tools; workforce development, job training, and green collar job creation; and utilization of vacant lots as a resource for community gardens and playing fields.

<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Our domestic initiatives focus on the nation’s most pressing social issues by addressing its gravest health and social concerns</span></u><br />
<span style="font-family: Arnhem-Blond,serif;">America’s most pressing social issue today is health care. And <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">America’s gravest health issue is obesity</span></u>, which is now the most rapidly growing cause of disease and death. Obesity has many causes, including consumption of fast food, the lack of nutritional knowledge, and sedentary behavior. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Approximately one in six children suffers from a lack of nutritious food due to the absence of healthy options</span></u> (or even a supermarket), in many poorer neighborhoods. These neighborhoods, sometimes called “food deserts,” often lack after-school programs and safe places to play, which can lead young people to anti-social as well as self-destructive behaviors. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arnhem-Blond,serif;">Nearly one third of American children and adolescents are overweight or obese. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This epidemic is threatening the health and lives of millions of people in this country</span></u> as well as in countries throughout Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. During the past four decades, obesity rates have soared among all age groups in the United States, increasing more than four-fold among children ages 6 to 11. That translates to more than 23 million children and teenagers in the U.S. alone. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arnhem-Blond,serif;">Significant disparities exist within these numbers. For example, 38 percent of Mexican-American children and 34.9 percent of African-American children ages 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, compared to 30.7 percent of white children in the same age range. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arnhem-Blond,serif;">There are also significant disparities in terms of access to healthy food and safe places to play. A study of more than 200 neighborhoods found four times as many supermarkets in predominantly white neighborhoods as in black neighborhoods, leaving many poorer communities stranded in the “food deserts” mentioned above. In addition, communities with high levels of poverty are significantly less likely to have places where people can be physically active, such as parks and playing fields. </span><br />
<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The most alarming aspect of this epidemic is the rapid rise of childhood obesity</span></u>, which has been linked to early onset of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes has substantial impacts on life expectancy and quality of life. Further, obese and overweight children are more likely to suffer in the classroom. Obesity has been linked to low school performances as well as low self-esteem. Needless to say, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">obesity also poses a tremendous threat to the U.S. economy and health care system</span></u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It is estimated that the obesity epidemic costs the nation $117 billion per year in direct medical expenses and indirect costs, including lost productivity.</span></u> Childhood obesity alone carries a huge price tag – up to $14 billion per year in direct health care costs. <br />
<u><span style="font-family: Arnhem-Blond,serif;">Preventing obesity during childhood is critical because adult habits are frequently formed during youth. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If we do not act to reverse the childhood obesity epidemic, the U.S. is in danger of many disturbing potential outcomes, among them raising the first generation of American children who may live sicker and die younger than the generation before them</span>. </span></u><br />
<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-family: Arnhem-Blond,serif;">U.S. Soccer and the U.S. Soccer Foundation are <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">uniquely</span></strong> positioned to take a major role in this fight given that a large segment of the sport’s fan base is Hispanic, the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population and a group that suffers from discrimination as well as obesity.</span></u><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions. It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world 's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, </span>however,<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> it is relatively stable and less likely to produce a major war between great powers. </span>It is also comparatively benevolent, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value. American predominance does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world. The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it. The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large powers is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">, both with the United States and with each other. National ambition drives China's foreign policy today, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, the Chinese are powerfully motivated to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia. They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is passé; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. Japan, meanwhile, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power -- with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending -- now appears embarked on a more traditional national course. Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea 's nuclear weapons. But it is also driven by Japan's own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or &quot;little brother&quot; to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other 's rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component. Their competition is such that a nation like South Korea, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, is once again worrying both about a &quot;greater China&quot; and about the return of Japanese nationalism. As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe's past than its present. But it also looks like Asia's past. Russian foreign policy, too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the EU and NATO, would not insist on predominant influence over its &quot;near abroad,&quot; and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia 's international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from NATO and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia's complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia 's relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. India 's regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a panEuropean national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond. Like national movements elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as &quot;No. 1&quot; and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">-- its regional as well as its global predominance. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Were the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></span>nited <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to diminish its influence </span>in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the other nations would settle disputes </span>as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">through confrontation and wars</span> of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">such a multipolar world </span>is that most of these powers <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">would possess nuclear weapons.</span> That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role </span>the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, </span>of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world 's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. War could erupt between China and Taiwan </span>and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Russia and Georgia</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, forcing the United States and its European allies to</span> decide whether to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">intervene</span> or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">India and Pakistan </span>remains possible, as does conflict between <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the U</span>nited <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span>tates<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. Such conflicts</span> may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> are more likely to erupt if the U</span>nited<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> S</span>tates <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, </span>where most nations agree that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a reliable </span>American <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region</span>. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">even China</span>, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an </span>ambitious, independent, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nationalist Japan. </span>In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; </span>-- this <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia</span> and its near neighbors, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which could in turn draw the U</span>nited<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> S</span>tates <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">back in </span>under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The alternative to </span>American <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. </span>The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path. </span><br />

If the U.S. is selected to host the</span></u> 2018 or <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">2022 FIFA World Cup™, we will go beyond the expected</span></u>. We will use the best part of ourselves on behalf of the world community created by football. <u>We will propose universal ideas that are put into practice community by community. We will mobilize the football world and empower one person at a time</u>, <em>One on One, One by One</em>. Each and every fan who witnesses the matches in the stadium or on television in more than 200 countries around the world has a stake in the future and will be encouraged to play a role and make a change. Environmental Challenges <u>The world faces a series of environmental challenges that all of us – business, government, and civil society – must face together</u>. <u>The core issues include climate change, energy, water, deforestation, biodiversity loss, chemicals and toxics, air and water pollution, waste management, ozone layer depletion, and the rapid decline of our oceans</u>. In an article that was published by the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> on November 30, 2009, U.S. media personality Jeff Corwin described the world’s current situation: “<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Somewhere on Earth, every 20 minutes, one animal species dies out. At this rate, we will lose 50 percent of all species by the end of the century. Time is running out to turn the tide.”</span></u> In some areas, such as the ozone layer and certain air regions, we are seeing improvement. But <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">most natural systems are in serious decline</span></u>. Putting aside some controversies and political wrangling, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the science on climate change is overwhelming. The world is warming and humans are behind it</span></u>. Our choices in energy sources tie directly to climate and to local air quality and health. Water issues are easily identified – when regions face droughts and millions of people die of water-borne illness, there is no debate on the science. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Land use and deforestation are not only creating roughly 20 percent of the greenhouse gas problem, but are also contributing mightily to what is being considered “<strong>the sixth extinction event”</strong> in the five-billion-year history of the planet</span></u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The consensus among biologists is that the earth is faced with a mounting <strong>loss of species</strong> that threatens to rival the five great <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">mass</span></strong> extinctions of the geological past.</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The U.S. will make the FIFA World Cup™ a self-sustaining energy event as well as a “living showcase” that connects people to novel technologies and new behaviors that benefit our planet</span></u>. <u>The gravitational pull of the World Cup will draw people in and change them from passive observers to eager activists working toward a goal that all of us – in every country – can share.</u> <u>A FIFA World Cup™ in the U.S. will be a call to action</u>. It will represent bold thinking and big goals that reflect the optimism and energy so characteristic of both FIFA and our country. A sustainable FIFA World Cup™ is not window dressing or something that would be “nice to have.” <u>To the U.S., a sustainable World Cup is the only option</u>. How FIFA’s vision and past American environmental initiatives have inspired the U.S. World Cup proposal <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The world is at a <strong>tipping</strong> <strong>point</strong>. So say scientists and business and political leaders around the world, in a rare consensus</span>.</u> The task of our generation is to address these significant environmental issues. The manner in which we do so – in a way that protects the needs of both current and future generations – will be our legacy. Understanding the challenges we face is the very first step. By dedicating the FIFA World Cup™ to sustainability in all its forms, the U.S. acknowledges that the future is upon us and that we will take responsibility for it. Concerns about chemicals and what is in our bodies – and our children’s bodies – continue to rise, and countries around the world are enacting ever more strict toxics legislation. Our oceans are in critical condition, with coral dying around the world and very few major fisheries managed in a sustainable way. The United Nations’ extensive Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 declared that nearly all the 24 major natural support systems the UN studied are in decline. And they have not improved in the last five years. It’s far from a pretty picture, but there are several bright spots on the horizon. In fits and starts, <u>the world is starting to tackle climate change more aggressively. Businesses around the world are increasingly leading the charge, not fighting it.</u> As former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and others tell us, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">many of the technologies we need to create a much more sustainable world are already here</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">History of Environmental Leadership in the U.S</span></u><strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; color: white;">. </span></u></strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">America’s commitment to environmental stewardship dates back more than 100 years</span></u>, thanks to the leadership of far-sighted individuals, businesses, educators, researchers, and legislators. Some of the most important examples that have inspired our proposals are described next. <strong><u>The National Parks</u></strong> The U.S. pioneered land preservation by safeguarding large portions of the country for future generations. The establishment of national parks (beginning in 1872) and the extensive network of local parks throughout the country are a testament to this bedrock American principle. The U.S. now has 391 national parks across the country under the management of the National Park Service. It has also protected approximately 340,000 square kilometers of land, an area almost equal in size to the Republic of Congo and larger than countries such as Italy, Ecuador, and the United Kingdom. In fact, this protected land is larger than that of two-thirds of the countries in the world. The year 2016 marks the centennial of the U.S. National Park Service – one of the stepping stones the U.S. World Cup plan will make use of as we build toward 2018/2022. <strong><u>Silent Spring</u></strong> The publication of Rachel Carson’s <em>Silent Spring</em> in 1962 launched the modern environmental movement by documenting the severely detrimental effects of pesticides on the environment. The book – and the resounding response to it – facilitated the ban of the chemical DDT in 1972, but more importantly raised awareness of how humans are impacting the environment globally. <strong><u>Earth Day</u></strong> <em>Silent Spring</em> – and the general social revolution of the 1960s – helped create environmental awareness and activists in all walks of life. Concerned Americans launched the first Earth Day in 1970 to create an outlet for those passions, with approximately 20 million Americans participating. Twenty years later, Earth Day 1990 mobilized 200 million people in 141 countries and paved the way for the landmark 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Earth Day 2007, with its estimated record one billion people participating in activities around the world, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">provided an inspiring model that the U.S. will seek to emulate and eclipse for the</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> 2018/<u>2022 FIFA World Cup</u>™. <u>We will garner participation and action from billions of FIFA fans around the globe to support our sustainability cause</u></span>. Government Leadership The U.S. government passed some of the first major national environmental laws that the world had ever seen, among them the critically important Air Pollution Control Act (1955), the Clean Air Act (1963), the National Environmental Policy Act (1969), and the Clean Water Act (1972). <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These laws set standards that have been emulated in countries around the world</span></u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Arguably, the U.S. has lost some of its environmental leadership position in recent years, particularly around the greatest threat to humanity, climate change</span></u>. But that has begun to change thanks to the actions of certain government officials. As early as 1976, Al Gore, who served as Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001, held the first U.S. Congressional hearings on climate change and co-sponsored hearings on toxic waste and global warming. Following the release of the film <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> and later receipt of the Nobel Prize, he impelled a global “sea change” in environmental awareness. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. administration has turned the focus back onto environmental issues. To demonstrate his commitment, President Obama issued an Executive Order on October 5, 2009, to demonstrate that the government could take measureable action that went beyond simple words. This order mandated that federal agencies establish 2020 greenhouse gas reduction goals, as well as operational goals such as the following: <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> A 30 percent reduction in vehicle fleet petroleum use by 2020 <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> A 26 percent improvement in water efficiency by 2020 <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> A 50 percent improvement in recycling and waste diversion by 2015 That 95 percent of all applicable contracts meet sustainability requirements <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Implementation of the 2030 netzeroenergy building requirement But even before federal authorities played a major role in this area, our cities and regions stepped into the void and demonstrated world-class leadership. In 2005, then-Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels launched the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement to advance the goals of the Kyoto Protocol. Over the last five years, more than 1,000 mayors have signed the agreement, and the competition among our cities to be crowned the “greenest” has become fierce. For example, New York City’s Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg created his own greening plan, PlaNYC, which calls for a 30 percent reduction in global warming emissions by 2030. Greenworks Philadelphia, a mayoral initiative in that city, has set goals to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 20 percent, to bring local food within 10 minutes of 75 percent of residents, and to lower city government energy consumption by 30 percent – all by 2015. The U.S. is proud to state that 17 of the 18 proposed FIFA World Cup™ Host Cities have already signed the Mayors Climate Protection Agreement. The USA Bid Committee will be initiating conversations with the City of Houston, whose mayor was just elected to that position in December of 2009, to urge it to become the 18th city to sign the agreement. These cities and many other American communities have reduced emissions, built leading-edge public transportation systems, set tough green standards on city purchasing and procurement, mandated energy efficiency audits and improvements in buildings, and much more. Host City leadership of this sort is of particular importance to our proposals, since the matches will take place in 12 of our most forward-thinking metropolitan areas, thereby assisting the LOC to implement its bold initiatives. As we did during our bid process, the U.S. proposes that FIFA continue the use of sustainability criteria to screen cities and stadia in the selection of the final 12 venues for the event. Critical Partners and Best Practices <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In addition to the leadership that our </span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">proposed Host Cities will provide, and the close partnership required with FIFA to build a sustainable World Cup,</span></u> we propose to work with other important stakeholders as well. We will establish a Sustainability Advisory Board with members who are among the most respected sustainability experts in the world (see Section 5.3, Organization Plan and Governance). But it is worth highlighting <u>two specific groups that we believe would offer valuable contributions</u> at the Advisory Board level. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Business Leaders </span></u></strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Over the last decade the business world has been swept up in a green wave of rising interest and concern about environmental issues</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> On one level, none of this is new. Leading companies, such as 3M and DuPont, have been pursuing “pollution prevention” and eco-efficiency for years, even decades, and the intensity and scope of their greening efforts has grown exponentially. Aside from some of those larger early adopters and smaller sustainability-focused leaders such as Patagonia, U.S. companies were arguably a step behind in the sustainability race. In recent years a few green superpowers from the U.S. have come on strong. General Electric’s <em>ecomagination</em> program is trying to help address some of the world’s environmental ills with turbines, more efficient locomotives, water systems, and other large technologies. IBM is promoting a “smarter planet” and using information technology to make buildings, transportation, and cities more efficient and intelligent. <u>Perhaps most important, WalMart, the world’s largest retailer with $400 billion in annual sales, has set aggressive goals for its own operations, such as 100 percent renewable energy and zero waste, and has made significant strides in energy and fleet efficiency</u>. In turn, Wal-Mart is pressing its 100,000 suppliers to do much more, from reducing packaging to cutting carbon emissions. It is this new “full value-chain perspective” that we believe can change the world by affecting every link in the production and supply chain. <u>The powerful green business community in the U.S. will bring both inspiration and tactics to a U.S.hosted FIFA World Cup™,</u> and we have embraced this larger value-chain view as central to our plans: <u>A sustainable World Cup is not just about making the matches as low-impact as possible; the responsibility extends to the supply chain as well as to attendees and viewers</u>. In addition, <u>our environmental plan is modeled in many ways upon what is clearly possible at the cutting edge of the private sector</u> (as well as, of course, on what we can learn from our greenest cities). If a major automobile plant in Indiana sends zero waste to the landfill, why can’t our stadia do the same in eight or 12 years? If WalMart can drastically improved fleet efficiency and is testing biofuels and electric engines, why shouldn’t we set aggressive zero-fossil-fuel goals for FIFA World Cup™ transportation? We can also partner with the business community in choosing our vendors more carefully. For example, why shouldn’t the FIFA IT partner come with a strong environmental record and the desire to work closely with the LOC on an end-of-life plan for all event-related technology? <strong>NGOs</strong> U.S. non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also play leading domestic and international roles in environmental issues. Some examples of notable NGOs include the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), and the Nature Conservancy (TNC<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">). <u>A U.S.-hosted World Cup would seek to create partnerships with these entities and others in a manner unmatched by previous World Cups</u></span>. The USA Bid Committee has already begun to work with the NRDC, the Earth Institute at Columbia University, and other institutions in formulating the bid proposal. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These existing relationships help set the stage for the U.S. to effectively implement the initiatives</span></u> outlined in this chapter. Guiding Principles for a Sustainable FIFA World Cup™ in the U.S.A. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It is vital that the World Cup be bold in its environmental strategy. A FIFA World Cup™ in the U.S. will abide by</span></u> four guiding principles: 1) Sustainability will be the core element of the entire event. 2) We will set new standards in green operations and set tactical goals for the event such as: <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Water neutrality <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Zero waste to landfill <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Zero fossil fuels in energy generation <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Zero fossil fuels in FIFAprovided transportation <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> 100 percent compliance by suppliers and vendors to sustainability standards <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> 100 percent organic food sourced locally <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Less than 20 percent of attendees arriving by combustion engine vehicles to the matches 3) We will have a greater impact outside the core operations of the event by influencing, educating, inspiring, and empowering the following groups: <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> 5 million people ticketed for the matches <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> 25 million people at the FIFA Fan Fests™ <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Billions watching worldwide <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> Suppliers and vendors <span style="font-family: ZapfDingbatsITC;">●</span> The FIFA Family (players, coaches, teams, volunteers, workers, and communities) 4) All of the proposed sustainability initiatives will aim to enhance the experience of the FIFA World Cup™ and the game of football itself. As noted before, our efforts will begin in 2011 and build up as we utilize the eight to 12 years leading to the event. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Using the platform of the world’s greatest sporting event, the U.S. will bring a legion of innovative financial and human resources to the table to make the FIFA World Cup™ a new tipping point – a movement that could positively affect environmental and sustainability efforts around the world.</span></u></strong> In the end, the U.S. sustainability platform will provide FIFA with something very different. Our Bid campaign's tagline is “The Game is in US.” But it is not <em>about</em> us. We are merely the means to a very important end. In partnership with FIFA and the FIFA World Cup™ our legacy will aim to touch the world as a whole. <br />

No species has ever dominated its fellow species as man has. In most cases, people have assumed the God-like power of life and death -- extinction or survival -- over the plants and animals of the world. For most of history, mankind pursued this domination with a single-minded determination to master the world, tame the wilderness, and exploit nature for the maximum benefit of the human race. n67 <span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In past mass extinction episodes, as many as ninety percent of the existing species perished, and yet the world moved forward</span></span>, and new species replaced the old. <span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">So why should the world be concerned now? The prime reason is the world's survival. Like all animal life, humans live off of other species. At some point, the number of species could decline to the point at which the ecosystem fails, and then humans also would become extinct.</span></span> No one knows how many [*171] species the world needs to support human life, and to find out -- by <span class="underlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">allowing certain species to become extinct -- would not be sound policy.</span></span> In addition to food, species offer many direct and indirect benefits to mankind. n68 2. Ecological Value. -- Ecological value is the value that species have in maintaining the environment. Pest, n69 erosion, and flood control are prime benefits certain species provide to man. Plants and animals also provide additional ecological services -- pollution control, n70 oxygen production, sewage treatment, and biodegradation. n71 3. Scientific and Utilitarian Value. -- Scientific value is the use of species for research into the physical processes of the world. n72 Without plants and animals, a large portion of basic scientific research would be impossible. Utilitarian value is the direct utility humans draw from plants and animals. n73 Only a fraction of the [*172] earth's species have been examined, and mankind may someday desperately need the species that it is exterminating today. To accept that the snail darter, harelip sucker, or Dismal Swamp southeastern shrew n74 could save mankind may be difficult for some. Many, if not most, species are useless to man in a direct utilitarian sense. Nonetheless, they may be critical in an indirect role, because their extirpations could affect a directly useful species negatively. In a closely interconnected ecosystem, the loss of a species affects other species dependent on it. n75 Moreover, as the number of species decline, the effect of each new extinction on the remaining species increases dramatically. n76 4. Biological Diversity. -- The main premise of species preservation is that diversity is better than simplicity. n77 As the current mass extinction has progressed, the world's biological diversity generally has decreased. This trend occurs within ecosystems by reducing the number of species, and within species by reducing the number of individuals. Both trends carry serious future implications<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. </span><span class="underlinedChar"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 12pt;">Biologically diverse ecosystems are characterized by a large number of specialist species,</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">filling narrow ecological niches.

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">U.S. World cup in 2022 is vital to growth of soccer as a sport and making it sustainably </span></strong><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Sports Business Journal, 9-6</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"> (</span></span>Hosting 2022 World Cup could lift U.S. soccer to new heights, <span style="color: black;">September 06, 2010, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/66869" rel="nofollow">__http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/66869__</a><span style="color: black;">) </span><br />
An inspection team from FIFA will arrive in the United States this week to see whether promises made 22 years ago by the U.S. Soccer Federation have been kept. Those promises? First, <u>grant America the right to host the 1994 World Cup, and it will launch a division one professional league</u>. Second, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">hosting the World Cup in ’94 would turn America into a “soccer nation”</span></u> (probably more a hope than a promise). <br />
<u>The day of reckoning is near, and FIFA is here to judge just how far soccer in America has developed</u>. If impressed<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <u>it will grant the U.S. the right to host the event again in</u></span> either 2018 or <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">2022 and set in motion a period of unparalleled <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">growth</span></strong> and <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">wealth</span></strong> for the sport that could <strong>secure and cement its future</strong></span><strong>.</strong></u><br />
The questions to be answered are quite simple: Does the U.S. deserve to host again? Can the U.S. stage the event successfully? Is the U.S. a better option than other countries bidding? <br />
Let’s examine where the U.S. stands by narrowing the argument. First, it is commonly believed that the 2018 World Cup is heading to Europe and, as such, realistically, the U.S. is only being considered for 2022. Second, let’s remove any questions regarding whether the U.S. has the ability to stage the event. The ’94 World Cup still holds the record for the best attended World Cup ever (3.5 million fans), and the U.S. bid committee is promising 5 million next time. Let’s face it: Staging big sporting events is part of America’s DNA. <br />
So it comes down to this: Does the U.S. deserve it, and can it beat out the competition? <br />
There is no doubt in my mind that U.S. Soccer has earned and deserves the right to stage another World Cup. It also needs to. Hosting the ’94 World Cup turned around the commercial fortunes of soccer in America. Its $60 million surplus still funds grassroots soccer today, and USA’s quest to win the World Cup has turned a once near-bankrupt U.S. Soccer Federation into one that boasts $50 million in reserves and a long-term, lucrative Nike contract. <br />
<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It was the ’94 World Cup that convinced investors</span></u>, led by Phil Anschutz, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that M</span>ajor<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> L</span>eague <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span>occer<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> could work in the U.S., and those investors have since poured more than a billion dollars into the sport to prove it</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. <u>MLS has survived a long and financially precarious struggle to establish itself as a major presence on the American sports landscape</u></span>. In 2010, with nine soccer-specific stadiums, 16 teams (and planned expansion teams in Vancouver and Portland in 2011 and Montreal in 2012), and impressive new launches in Toronto, Seattle and Philadelphia, there is a buzz and excitement about what the next decade might bring. <br />
Just think what might be achieved in 2022, <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">when millions of fans pour out of World Cup stadiums to a 26-year-old, prosperous league willing, able and prepared to absorb them. It could be a game-changing moment in American sports</span></u> and complete a promise made and hopes dreamed of on July 4, 1988, <u>when the FIFA experiment to bring America into the world’s soccer family began</u>. <br />
How American soccer must wish the FIFA World Cup were held every year, for as TV ratings from South Africa 2010 showed, it would compete head-to-head with the NBA Finals, baseball’s World Series and even nip at the heels of the NFL. ESPN and Univision must be salivating at what ratings the time-zone friendly Brazil 2014 World Cup will bring. <u>America might not be a fully fledged soccer nation in many people’s minds, but I defy anyone to say it is not now a World Cup Soccer nation</u>. <br />
First, however, it has to win the bid. England and Russia are expected to battle it out for 2018, leaving 2022 between the U.S., Japan, Korea, Qatar and Australia. Japan and Korea hosted jointly in ’02 so it’s unlikely the event would return so quickly. Qatar has plenty of money, but in July, it’s also plenty hot. So, it would appear Australia is the USA’s most formidable opponent. <br />
Australia is a great sports nation and one that hosted a phenomenal 2000 Sydney Olympics. But take into consideration the 1.3 billion population Chinese market that sits at Australia’s doorstep. By FIFA’s own rules, if it gave the World Cup to Australia in 2022, it could not go back to the region until at the earliest 2030, and more likely 2034. China is now making noises that it wants to host the World Cup in 2026. It’s hard to see FIFA sacrificing the U.S. and China to deliver soccer to the Outback. <br />
Irrespective of soccer geo-politics, <u>the U.S. has kept its promise to world soccer and has made gigantic strides over the past 22 years</u>, strides made in one of the toughest and most competitive sports markets in the world. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Soccer is growing but still has a <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">ways</span> to go and <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">needs</span></strong> the continued help of the global game</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. <u>Nothing will propel and fuel this growth more than the return of the FIFA World Cup in 2022, for if the impact was huge in 1994, it will be stratospheric and unstoppable if it returns.</u></span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s key to furthering soccer globally- it’s linear </span></strong><br />

<u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Soccer can be one of the most powerful diplomatic tools a nation can have. The US has this tool at its disposal, but it is largely overlooked by politicians and diplomats. It is a tool that could be utilised to <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">ease tensions</span></strong> in the world and enhance the standing of the US as a <strong>world</strong> <strong>power</strong> intent on peace</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>Dropping soccer balls is preferable to dropping bombs</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The US is one of the most generous nations in the world. Building soccer grounds and donating soccer equipment to developing nations, as well as supplying the usual food, medicine and peacekeepers makes a lot of sense in a world besotted with the game.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States has qualified for the World Cup finals for the eighth time, which is an impressive record and one which not many countries can match. The feat is even more notable when one realises that FIFA has 205 members, making it the organisation which represents the most countries. The United Nations has only 191 members and the Olympic Federation 202. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The soccer World Cup is bigger than the Olympic Games</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in fact, and draws a larger television audience. Soccer, or football as it is known in most of the world, is also an Olympic event and regularly attracts the greatest number of spectators at the Olympic Games -- including the year when the Olympics were held in Los Angeles. Let’s put the US’s latest qualification in some sort of perspective. To become one of the 32 finalists competing in Germany, the US was one of 194 countries which participated in 847 qualifying matches and which yielded roughly 2,500 goals. The US is, in fact, placed 5th in FIFA’s world rankings, which is a credit to the nation’s soccer players and, indeed, to the nation as a whole. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">To be a good footballing country raises a nation’s <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">prestige</span></strong> in the eyes of most of the world, and that is something the United States can do with at the present time</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The coach of the American team, Bruce Arena, is the longest serving national coach at this World Cup. He has been in charge of the team for eight years. The American team is also known for one of the great giant-killing acts in World Cup history. It caused a huge upset at the 1950 tournament in Brazil when it beat England, the founder of the modern game of football, 1-0. Joe Gaetjens was the goalscorer. He would have been a hero in any other country, but his feat went largely unnoticed back home. The United States has hosted the World Cup once -- in 1994. The all-time attendance record for a World Cup was set at that tournament, with 3,567,415 spectators at the 52 matches, making an average of 68,604 a game. No World Cup in the history of the tournament, which spans 1930 to 2006, has come anywhere near those figures. There are 3.2 million youth players between the ages of 5 and 19 in the US, and over 900,000 administrators, coaches and volunteers involved in youth soccer. This represents a huge groundswell of support for, and interest in, the game. It has spawned the phenomenon of the “Soccer Mom”, who takes her sons and daughters to and from training and to games each week during the soccer season. Women’s soccer is huge in the US and the country has won the Women’s World Cup, something the men have yet to emulate. It is true that the soccer success story has not been reflected at the senior men’s levels within the US. The Major Soccer League (MLS) is but the latest in a series of national competitions which have invariably failed. MLS attendances average only 15,000 per game. The halcyon days for men’s senior soccer were in the 1970s when such world stars as Pele, George Best, Franz Beckenbauer, Johan Cruyff and Rodney Marsh played in the US for teams such as the New York Cosmos and the Los Angeles Aztecs. But </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the situation must surely improve at this top level</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, too, now that the US has qualified yet again for the world’s major sporting event. There are positive signs that the tide is turning. There are now two television channels which broadcast soccer exclusively, and all 64 games at this World Cup will be broadcast live in the US. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The opportunity is ripe, therefore, for the game to finally establish itself as a credible sport in America, and for politicians to start using it for the good of the nation and the world.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State during the Nixon presidency, was and still is a passionate soccer fan. I would not be surprised if he is at the World Cup Final on 9 July. He has been at finals before.

There is a common saying that soccer (or football for most of the world) is a universal language. </span><u>Players may not speak each other’s language, but they can play quite readily on the same team, or on opposing teams, and understand each other completely</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The game can, and has, bridged barriers</span></u> <u>of race, religion and creed.</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">It is true that soccer has led to wars, and to racial and civil conflict. In 1969, El Salvador and Honduras went to war because World Cup qualification matches between the two countries for the right to go to the 1970 World Cup in Mexico erupted in violence. Racism has reared its ugly head at soccer grounds in Italy and Spain. But </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">soccer has often also been a catalyst for peace</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The latest example is Angola, where a civil war has been raging for 27 years.</span></u> <u>Angola has qualified for the World Cup for the first time in its history and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">rival factions are laying down their arms as the tournament approaches</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The whole nation will be watching as one as their team competes.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Most of the world’s best club sides are from Europe, but their players come from many different countries. They play in harmony and get on well off the field, too. The players are heroes in their own countries as well as the world and they often engage in charitable works in their home countries, sometimes under the auspices of FIFA. The current US Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice, was photographed in March this year wearing a Blackburn Rovers shirt during a visit to the city of Blackburn in the UK, the home town of British Foreign Minister, Jack Straw. Rice was, in a way, initiated into the culture of soccer. Rice could perhaps go further than that ardent soccer fan, Henry Kissinger, did in 1971. She is looking for ways to engage Iran and North Korea in dialogue and to relieve the tensions that exist between these two countries and the US (as well as many other countries). Why not use soccer as a diplomatic tool to achieve this outcome? Iran and the US met in the 1998 World Cup in France. It was not the bloodbath on the field that some pessimists predicted. Iran won 2-1 and it was a fair sporting contest in which both sets of players respected each other. The dignity of both countries was preserved. Iran will be present again at this World Cup in Germany, although it is drawn in a different group to the US. But they are both participating in the same tournament and are, therefore, brothers in sport. North Korea, best known for its 1966 World Cup performance in England, when it beat the highly fancied Italy 1-0, did not qualify this time. But </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">soccer is a national obsession and still a source of great pride.</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The US could begin its “soccer diplomacy” by inviting youth teams from Iran and North Korea to compete in one of the many junior tournaments held throughout the</span></u> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">U</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nited </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">tates at different times of the year.

Government funding for such participation would be money well spent. This would lay the groundwork for subsequent invitations to senior club sides from these countries, and eventually, to the national sides. The US has, in the past, hosted senior tournaments involving two or three other countries, on its own soil, so why not a tournament involving the US, Iran and North Korea? Despite indifference towards soccer at senior political level and in the media -- this is despite presidents, including Bill Clinton, taking photo opportunities with world soccer stars such as Pele -- the US can count itself as a world power in soccer, regardless of how it performs at this World Cup. It clearly has the pedigree</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.

The lure of soccer can be irresistible to the masses. The soccer ball is clearly at the feet of the United States. It is up to them to play it.

Known at home as the &quot;Chollima&quot; squad, the lightly regarded North Koreans proved feisty, earning a monster upset over powerhouse Italy to advance to the quarterfinals. Many fans rooted for the underdogs as they took an early 3-0 lead against Portugal, but the Portuguese -- led by the legendary Eusebio -- surged back with five goals to put an end to the North Koreans' fairy-tale run. A lot has changed for the Koreas in the four decades since that tournament. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Back then, the North had a stronger economy</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> than the struggling South, and even the Chollima players' cleats were the envy of the South Korean team.

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">There’s currently a severe “skills shortage” undermining our space industry </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;">Stephen 10</span></strong><span style="color: black;"> – Chair of the Aerospace Industries Association Workforce Steering Committee (Rick Stephens (Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Administration @ The Boeing Company), “HEADLINE: SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MATH EDUCATION,” Committee on House Science and Technology Subcommittee on Research and Science Education, CQ Congressional Testimony, February 4, 2010 Thursday)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Let me also provide a perspective that I believe is important to set a framework and context. In 1983, a blue-ribbon panel completed a seminal piece of work called “A Nation at Risk,” which set the tone and framework for improving education in America. While it focused on primary and secondary education, I believe this work is directly related to today’s topic. Today, nearly 27 years later, I contend that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we are no longer a “Nation at Risk”; we are a “nation falling further behind</span>”—this despite the fact that, as a nation, we spend more money on education at a total level and on a per-capita basis than any other country in the world. Hundreds of organizations are focused primarily on improving education in the United States and, more specifically, on STEM disciplines. These include the National Science Teachers Association, the Business–Higher Education Forum (BHEF), the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), the American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics (AIAA), and the National Defense Industries Association (NDIA). In addition, every college and university is focused on increasing the number of graduates. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">We are proud to be among those industries that have placed the United States in its leadership role in technology, innovation and the ability to solve highly complex problems. But <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">as both the pace of innovation and the need for problem-solving accelerate </span>globally, the United States faces a competitive gap that we can close only if more of our young people pursue careers in the growing fields of STEM disciplines. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">In my industry, the Aviation Week 2009 Workforce Study (conducted in cooperation with the Aerospace Industries Association, American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics, and the National Defense Industries Association) indicates aerospace companies that are hiring need systems engineers, aerospace engineers<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, </span>mechanical engineers, programming/software engineers and program managers. Today, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">across the aerospace industry, the average age of the workforce continues to increase, and expectations are that the next three years</span>. As a result, in the very near future, our companies and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">our nation’s aerospace programs will need tens of thousands of engineers</span>—in addition to those joining the workforce today. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These are becoming difficult jobs to fill not because there is a labor shortage but because there is a <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">skills</span></strong> <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">shortage</span></strong>: Our industry needs more innovative young scientists,</span> technologists, engineers, and mathematicians to replace our disproportionately large (compared to the total U.S. workforce) population of Baby Boomers as they retire. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">At the same time that retirements are increasing, the number of American workers with STEM degrees is declining</span>, as the National Science Board pointed out in 2008. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This skills shortage is a global concern across the board in all high-tech sectors—public as well as private.</span> </span><br />

For many of the same reasons that materiel was controlled (the ongoing cold war), human capital and intellectual capital are also regulated. In this area the world has experienced great change. As with technology, the regulatory requirements have not changed to meet the requirements of the modern world. <br />
Traditionally, <u>the United States had to worry about science and technology flowing out of the country.

capital. This includes world class schools with advanced curriculua in science and technology. In these, and other emerging countries, a world class education system, coupled with a viable industrial base to provide jobs, and a broadening middle class and upper middle class, makes staying near family, hearth and home an attractive option to studying, working and living in the U.S.. <u>The result is that talented human capital remains home instead of emigrating to the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span>nited <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates.</u>41 <br />

It addresses the first through substantial increases in H-1B and EB quotas and exemptions from the quotas, and the second through extension of OPT for all students and permission to file for green card status directly out of OPT. Senator Hagel's High-Tech Worker Relief Act temporarily addresses the first problem but does not deal with the second. In fact, there are innumerable ways in which these problems can be addressed. At some level, each proposal will likely involve some form of increase in quotas, either through a direct increase in the number or by exempting students from the quotas. Conceivably, the problem of the graduation date being later than the availability of visas could be dealt with by delaying the first date petitions for H-1B visas are accepted, from the beginning of April until the beginning of May or June, so that students would have a chance to compete. For the foreign student and for America's own self-interest, the best solution to these problems would be a combination of reforms to the policies governing green cards and H-lB visas; addressing one system but not the other would be less than optimal. For example, America could offer all </span><a name="8231-526"></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> foreign students H-1B visas, but those who choose to pursue U.S. citizenship (allowable under the dual-intent provisions of this visa) would still have to obtain a green card. Further, increases in the number of H-1B visas issued would soon bump up against the green card quotas unless those quotas were also raised. Offering all students green cards but not H-1B visas would be even more problematic. If all students were made automatically eligible for EB status upon graduation, acceptance at an American university would, in essence, constitute a near guarantee of future citizenship. Thus, to maintain its power to control citizenship, the government would have to exercise even stricter control over the granting of student visas. These procedural hurdles could act as a disincentive if not an actual barrier to foreign students interested in studying at American universities. </span><a name="r197"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=5d608e553b400c0cec3d9312885ff591&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkAz&amp;_md5=7bc28cd5212fa3165c37ffa43401c7c4#n197" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**197**</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Additionally, working under a green card has procedural hurdles of its own, not associated with the H-1B visa program (notably, labor certification). As such, foreign students who do not wish to stay in the United States beyond a temporary period of work would face the choice of accepting the green card and becoming a permanent resident, or leaving immediately upon the termination of F-1 status. Furthermore, in terms of America's own interest, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">some fields of study, such as aerospace</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> engineering or physics, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are more valuable in terms of supply and demand than others</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, such as the liberal arts. The issue is not that science and technology are superior to the liberal arts, but that there are far fewer American students majoring in science and technology than in the liberal arts. Policies governing foreign students in America should take into account this disequilibrium. Upon graduation from American universities, those foreign students whose presence would constitute a real benefit to America should be presented with three long-term options: accept an H-1B temporary work visa, accept EB green card status, or return to their native countries. The question is: which students are desirable? Although there is obviously no easy answer, the United States might be guided by the policies of Australia and Canada, which have set up general skill-based immigration systems. </span><a name="r198"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=5d608e553b400c0cec3d9312885ff591&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkAz&amp;_md5=7bc28cd5212fa3165c37ffa43401c7c4#n198" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**198**</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Their laws are modified regularly to reflect the changing demands of the economy. General skill-based immigration is beyond the scope of this article, but a similar system could be applied with relative ease to America's student visa system. It might be argued (as a topic for another paper) that any quotas set on foreign students and foreign workers with desired skill sets are counterproductive to the interests of America. However, as a potentially better alternative within a system that does employ quotas, Congress could delegate to a </span><a name="8231-527"></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> bipartisan committee </span><a name="r199"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=5d608e553b400c0cec3d9312885ff591&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkAz&amp;_md5=7bc28cd5212fa3165c37ffa43401c7c4#n199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**199**</a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the authority to determine which skill sets are deemed desirable now and in the future given the overall direction of the United States' economy. Such a committee would make its decisions based on economic studies, analysis of macroeconomic trends, and input from private industry. These determinations would be summarized in a statement outlining recommended policies for the special issuance of H-1B visas and green cards to foreign students in areas of academic concentration deemed desirable (possibly with specific quotas set for each of these fields of study); in contrast, foreign students majoring in other subjects would have to compete for H-1B visas and green cards issued within the limits of their respective general quotas. There is some parallel in the self-adjusting system in place. That is, the overall state of economy should be reflected by which employers make filings, on behalf of their prospective employees, for EB status or H-1B visas. However, the cap distorts the theoretically optimal results that one would otherwise expect to see. When too many applications for H-lB visas are filed at once, a lottery determines who gets the visas; consequently, visas are granted on a random basis rather than a basis directed at helping to meet America's current and anticipated needs. Employment-based green cards are granted on a first-come, first-served system, and there is currently a three-year backlog for the EB3 visa, creating a time lag in meeting America's needs. By delegating such authority to an expert committee, the federal government could retain control over immigration while resolving many of the above-described problems. Obviously, if Congress disagrees with the committee's decisions or wishes to promote an agenda outside of the scope of the committee, it always retains the power to pass laws granting certain foreign students the option of remaining in this country. For example, even if the price of fossil fuels were low and there were little motivation to invest in alternative energy by the private sector, Congress, concerned about the national security implications of dependence on foreign oil, could permit students with expertise in green energy to remain in the United States. Such a system would have the advantage of guaranteeing either an H-1B visa or an EB green card to students upon graduation, conditional upon them finding employment, while retaining federal control of the immigration system. V. CONCLUSION Foreign students at America's universities face real problems upon graduation. </span><u>Many graduating seniors are unable to obtain H-1B visas and are not <a name="8231-528"></a> legally eligible for EB3 status given that the F-1 student visa does not permit dual intent</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Additionally, those students who do receive H-1B visas are often unable to begin work until the beginning of the fiscal year. These problems could be addressed by reform of either the H-1B program or the green card system. The SKIL bill is an ambitious and comprehensive attempt to address many of the issues facing foreign students at American universities wishing to work in the United States upon graduation. The days when immigrants were merely manual labor have passed.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">“Merchant Shipping” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The United States would do well to keep a low profile for its military space program and burnish its technological image by showcasing its commercial and scientific space programs. Doing so would enable it to accumulate rather than hemorrhage soft power. Such a rationale is not lost on the Chinese, who certainly have had their successes in recent years in building soft power and using it to extend their influence around the globe. According to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) administrator Michael Griffin, the </span><u>Chinese have a carefully thought-out human-spaceflight program that will take them up to parity with the United States and Russia.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> They’re investing to make China a strategic world power second to none in order to reap the deals and advantages that flow to world leaders.30 </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The most recent space race reflects the changing dynamics of global power. “Technonationalism” remains the impetus for many nations’ space programs, particularly in Asia: “In contrast to the Cold War space race between the United States and the former Soviet Union, </span><u>the global competition today is being driven by national pride</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, newly earned wealth, a growing cadre of highly educated men and women, </span><u>and the confidence that achievements in space will bring substantial soft power as well as military benefits</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The planet-wide eagerness to join the space-faring club is palpable.”34 India and Japan are also aggressively developing their own space programs.35 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">But </span><u>the United States does not necessarily have to choose between civilian and military space programs since much of the technology developed for space is dual use</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u>The space industry provides a tremendous opportunity for militaries that desire more affordable access and space assets that can significantly augment terrestrial force</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">s. As Alfred Thayer Mahan pointed out, “Building up a great merchant shipping lays the broad base for the military shipping.”<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">36</span></span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The US military can maximize its resources</span>, not only financially but also politically, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by packaging as much military space activity as possible into commercial space activity.</span></u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">One example involves satellite communications. The arrangement the Pentagon has with Iridium Satellite LLC gives the military unlimited access to its </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">network and allows users to place both secure and nonsecure calls or send and receive text messages almost anywhere in the world.37 Another example involves space imagery. Even though the government must maintain sophisticated imaging capabilities for special situations, it could easily meet the vast majority of its routine requirements at lower cost by obtaining commercially available imagery.38 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The Air Force could also use space transportation, another emerging industry, to maximize its resources. Private ventures now under way are reducing the costs of space access considerably. It is possible that one enterprise could become an alternative to Russian Soyuz spacecraft for NASA’s missions to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the International Space Station.39 Such enterprises could prove attractive, cost-effective options for delivering the Air Force’s less-sensitive payloads to Earth orbit. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Space tourism,</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a growing industry, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">could enable the Air Force to procure affordable capabilities </span>to routinely operate 60 to 90 miles above Earth</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.40</span> <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Advances that entrepreneurs are making in suborbital space flight could eventually evolve to a point where the Air Force would find it far easier</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, politically as well as financially, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to acquire platforms capable of delivering munitions from space</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Conclusion </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">A glance at the global strategic situation reveals many nations rushing to develop space capabilities. Ostensibly civilian, the capabilities in development around </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the world are largely dual use and will have profound effects on the balance of power</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The United States, therefore, would be foolish to slow the pace of its own space development. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The issue at hand is not whether to proceed with space weapons but how to proceed with these capabilities</span> and effectively manage the security dilemmas that will inevitably arise.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">By assuming a posture which suggests that its intentions in space are competitive scientific and commercial pursuits—and which does not suggest the desire to barricade the medium in times of peace for the purpose of geopolitical leverage—</span><u>the United States can proceed without causing undue angst in the international community. Once we have laid the foundation for commercial activities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (i.e., “merchant shipping”), </span><u>military capabilities</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—or “military shipping”—</span><u>will follow in due course and with far less controversy</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If US policy makers can showcase scientific and commercial space endeavors while avoiding the perception of orbital despotism, they can steadily build dominant military space capabilities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and retain soft power. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The military options for Russia and China are not very appealing since neither can compete directly with the United States in space on an equal financial, military, or technical footing.

The ramifications have included a gradual political, economic, and social realignment, otherwise known as “multipolarism” and translated as waning US power and influence. “Soft power, therefore, is not just a matter of ephemeral popularity; it is a means of obtaining outcomes the United States wants. . . .

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Strategists in the United States and in China are clearly monitoring the other’s developments in space. How the United States judges Chinese intentions and capabilities will determine Washington’s response; of course, the reverse is equally true. As each side eyes the other, </span><u>the potential for mutual misperceptions can have serious and destabilizing consequences in the long term</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In particular, both </span><u>countries’ <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">exaggerated views of each other could lead unnecessarily to competitive action-reaction cycles</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. What exactly does such an action-reaction cycle mean? What would a bilateral space race look like? Hypothetically, in the next 10 years, </span><u>some critical sectors of China’s economy and military could become increasingly vulnerable to disruptions in space.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> During this same period, </span><u>Sino-U.S. relations may not improve appreciably</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and the Taiwan question could remain unresolved. If Washington and Beijing could increasingly hold each other’s space infrastructure hostage by threatening to use military options in times of crisis, then potentially risky paths to preemption could emerge in the policy planning processes in both capitals. In preparing for a major contingency in the Taiwan Strait, </span><u>both the United States and China might be compelled to plan for a disabling, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">blinding attack on the other’s space systems before the onset of hostilities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The most troubling dimension to this scenario is that </span><u>some elements of preemption</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (already evident in U.S. global doctrine) </span><u>could become a permanent feature of U.S. and Chinese strategies in space.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Indeed, Chinese strategic writings today suggest that the leadership in Beijing believes that preemption is the rational way to prevent future U.S. military intervention. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If leaders in Beijing and Washington were to position themselves to preempt each other, </span><u>t<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">hen the two sides would enter an era of mutual hostility, one that might include destabilizing, hair-trigger defense postures</span> in space where both sides stand ready to launch a first strike</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> on a moment’s notice. One scenario involves the use of weapons, such as lasers or jammers, which seek to blind sensors on imaging satellites or disable satellites that provide warning of missile launches. Imagine, for example, Washington’s reaction if China disabled U.S. missile warning satellites or vice versa. In that case, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Sino-U.S. relations would be highly vulnerable to the misinterpretations and miscalculations that could lead to a conflict in space.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Although attacks against space assets would likely be </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a precursor</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or a complement </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to a broader</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> crisis or </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">conflict</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, and although conflicts in the space theater may not generate many casualties or massive physical destruction, the economic costs of conflict in space alone for both sides, and for the international community, would be extraordinary given that many states depend on satellites for their economic well-being. </span><br />

<span class="Underline">The dizzying speed of space warfare would introduce intense ‘use or lose’ pressure into strategic calculations, with the spectre of split-second attacks creating incentives to rig orbiting. Death Start with automated ‘hair trigger’ devices. In theory, this automation would enhance survivability of vulnerable space weapon platforms. However, by taking the decision to commit violence out of human hands and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">endowing computers with authority to make war, military planners could sow insidious seeds of accidental conflict</span>. </span><br />
<span class="Underline">Yale sociologist Charles Perrow has analyzed ‘<em>complexlyinteractive,</em> tightly coupled’ industrial systems such as space weapons, which have many sophisticated components that all depend on each other’s flawless performance. According to Perrow, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this interlocking complexity makes it impossible to foresee</span> all the different ways such systems could fail. As Perrow explains, ‘<em>[t]he odd term “normal accident” is meant to signal that, given the system characteristics, multiple and unexpected interactions of failures are inevitable’.36</em> Deployment of space weapons with predelegated authority to fire death rays or unleash killer projectiles would likely make war itself inevitable, given the susceptibility of such systems to <em>“normal accidents’.</em> </span><br />
<span class="Underline">It is chilling to contemplate the possible effects of a space war. According to retired Lt. Col. Robert M. Bowman, <em>‘<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">even a tiny projectile reentering from space strikes the earth with such high velocity that it can do enormous damage- even more than would be done by a nuclear weapon of the same size</span>!’.37</em> In the same Star Wars technology touted as a quintessential tool of peace, defence analyst David Langford sees <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">one of the most destabilizing offensive weapons ever conceived: <em>’One imagines dead cities of microwave-grilled people’.</em></span> Given this unique potential for destruction, it is not hard to imagine that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">any nation subjected to space weapon attack would retaliate with maximum force, including use of nuclear biological, and/or chemical weapons.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">NASA e now past 50 e is well into middle age and seemingly experiencing a mid-life crisis. Any honest assessment of its performance over the past two decades leads to the inexorable conclusion that it is time for some serious reviewdand even more serious reform. National U.S. Space Study Commissions have been recommending major reform for some years and finally someone has listened. President </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Obama has had the political and programmatic courage to make some serious shifts in how NASA does its business</span>. It is no longer sufficient to move some boxes around and declare this is the new and improved NASA</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. One of the key messages from the 2004 Aldridge Commission report, which was quickly buried by NASA, was words to this effect: “</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Let enterprising space entrepreneurs do what they can do better than NASA and leave a more focused NASA do what it does bestdnamely space science and truly long range innovation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” <span style="color: #00167c;">[1]</span>. If one goes back almost 25 years to the Rogers Commission <span style="color: #00167c;">[2] </span>and the Paine Commission <span style="color: #00167c;">[3] </span>one can find deep dissatisfaction with NASA productivity, with its handling of its various space transportation systems, and with its ability to adapt to current circumstances as well as its ability to embark on truly visionary space goals for the future. Anyone who rereads the Paine Commission report today almost aches for the vision set forth as a roadmap to the future in this amazing document. True there have been outstanding scientific success stories, such as the Hubble Telescope, but these have been the exception and not the rule. The first step, of course, would be </span><u>to retool and restructure NASA from top to bottom and not just tweak it a little around the edges. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The first step would be to explore what space activities can truly be commercialized and see where NASA could be most effective by stimulating innovation in the private sector rather than undertaking the full mission itself</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> XPrize Founder Peter Diamandis has noted that we don't have governments operating taxi companies, building computers, or running airlinesdand this is for a very good reason. Commercial organizations are, on balance, better managed, more agile, more innovative, and more market responsive than government agencies. People as diverse as movie maker James Cameron and Peter Diamandis feel that the best way forward is to let space entrepreneurs play a greater role in space development and innovation. Cameron strongly endorsed </span><u>a greater role for commercial creativity in U.S. space programs</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in a February 2010 Washington Post article and explained why he felt this was the best way forward in humanity's greatest adventure: “I applaud President Obama's bold decision for NASA to focus on building a space exploration program that can drive innovation and provide inspiration to the world. This is the path that can make our dreams in space a reality” <span style="color: #00167c;">[4]</span>. One of the more eloquent yet haunting calls for change came some six years ago. The occasion was when Space X founder Elon Musk testified before the US Senate in April, 2004 at a Hearing on The Future of Launch Vehicles: “The past few decades have been a dark age for development of a new human space transportation system. One multi-billion dollar Government program after another has failed..When America landed on the Moon, I believe that wemade a promise and gave people a dream. It seemed then that.someone who was not a billionaire, not an Astronaut with the “Right Stuff”, but just a normal person, might one day see Earth from space. That dream is nothing but broken disappointment today. If we do not now take action different from the past, it will remain that way” <span style="color: #00167c;">[5]</span>. One might think that, since Muskwas seeking to develop his own launch capability, he was exaggerating; but a review of the record suggests otherwise. Today nearly 25 years after the Rogers and Paine Commission reports that followed the Challenger disaster, we find that the recommendations for NASA to develop a reliable and costeffective vehicle to replace the Shuttle is somewhere between being a disappointment and a fiasco. Billions of dollars have gone into various spaceplane and reusable launch vehicle developments by NASA over the past 20 years</span><u>. Spaceplane projects have been started by NASA time and again amid great fanfare and major expectations and then a few years later either cancelled in failure or closed out with a whimper</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The programs that NASA has given up on now include the Delta Clipper, the HL-20, X-33, the X-34, X-37, X-38, and X-43 after billions of US funds and billions more of private money have been sacrificed to the cause <span style="color: #00167c;">[6]</span>. In the field of space research NASA has a long and distinguished career. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In the area of space transportation</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and space station </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">construction its record over the past 30 years has largely been a record of failure.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The Space Shuttle was supposed to have been an efficient space truck that would fly every two weeks and bring cargo to orbit at a fraction of the cost of early space transportation systemsdperhaps a few thousand dollars per pound to low-Earth orbit. In fact, the fully allocated cost of the Shuttle is over $1 billion a flight and it is by far the most expensive space transportation system ever. After the Columbia accident NASA spent years and billions more dollars to correct serious safety problems with the Space Shuttle and still was never able to fulfill the specific recommendations of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. Yes, that's correct. After grounding the Space Shuttle for some 2.5 years (from February 2004 to August 2006) and expending $1.75 billion dollars in the wake of the CAIB report, NASA was not able to correct the identified problems and complete the tasks asked of it. Then, after the foam insulation problem re-emerged with Discovery and STS flight 114, hundreds of millions more dollars were spent to solve the problem again, bringing the grand total to over $2 billion <span style="color: #00167c;">[7]</span>. The first rendition of a space station was scheduled during the Reagan years to have been completed in 1991 for several billions of dollars. The projected completion date extended to 1994 when the project was redesigned and it became the International Space Station (ISS). Today the ISS is not only late, but its total cost has ballooned to over $100 billion <span style="color: #00167c;">[8]</span>. Project Constellation, with a projected cost of over $100 billion until its recent cancellation by President Obama, seemed to loom as an eerie repetition of the ISS e another mega-project always over budget, always late, and with constantly lowered expectations. Henry Spencer, writing for the New Scientist, has characterized Project Constellation as an “Illusion, Wrapped in Denial.” His specific observations about the NASA Moon/Mars program were as follows: First, it probably wasn't going to work. Even so early in its life, the programme was already deep into a death spiral of “solving” every problem by reducing expectation of what the systems would do. Actually reaching the moon would probably have required a major redesign, which wasn't going to be funded <span style="color: #00167c;">[9]</span>. Any private company with NASA's record on the Space Shuttle, the ISS deployment and spaceplane development, would have gone bankrupt decades ago. In all three cases the US Congress has been told by NASA essentially what it wanted to hear rather than the grim facts as to cost, schedule and performance. I personally remember when Congress was being told quite unbelievable things about the cost and expected performance of the Space Shuttle. We at Intelsat presented testimony that strongly contradicted NASA's statements on cost and performance. There are dozens of examples of entrepreneurial space enterprises that have generated innovative ideas that seemed to show us how we could have gotten ourselves into space faster, cheaper and better. - A private, Boulder, CO-based company called the External Tanks Corporation (ETC) suggested in the 1980s thatwe could just add a little more thrust to the External Tanks for the Space Transportation System (i.e. the Space Shuttle) and lo and behold we could put them into Low-Earth Orbit. Dr. Randolph “Stick” Ware of the ETC explained that one could then strap these tanks together and create the structure of a space station at a fraction of the cost of the ISS, and much more quickly as well. - Bob Zubrin has for years championed the idea of sending methane generators to Mars to produce the fuel for the astronauts' return trip. The cost of a Mars mission with a refueling station on Mars would be dramatically lower. - Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites took a few million dollars of backing from Microsoft's Paul Allen and developed the White Knight carrier craft and the SpaceShipOne spaceplane. This vehicle system, which won the X Prize, set the stage for a space adventures industry that will begin launches in 2011. When this experimental spaceplane landed at Edwards Air Force Base in 2004, a spectator's sign said it all: “SpaceShipOne e NASA Zero”. Some have suggested that President Barack Obama's cancellation of the unwieldy and expensive Project Constellation to send astronauts back to the Moon for a few exploratory missions was a blow to NASA and the start of the end of the US space program. The truth is just the reverse. Project Constellation, accurately described by former NASA Administrator Michael Griffin as “Apollo on Steroids” provided little new technology or innovation and had an astronomical price tag. It was clearly too much for too little. If the opportunity costs of Project Constellation are examined (i.e. if we think what could have been done with an extra $100 billion of space funds), dumping it defies argument. With much less invested in a questionable Project Constellation enterprise we can do much more in space astronomy.We can invest more wisely in space science to learn more about the Sun, the Earth and threats from Near Earth Objects. David Thompson, Chairman and CEO of Orbital Sciences said the following in a speech that endorsed the new commercial thrust of the NASA space policies on Nine February 2010: “</span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Let us, the commercial space industry, develop the space taxis we need to get our Astronauts into orbit and to ferry those wanting to go into space to get to where they want to go.We are in danger of falling behind in many critical areas of space unless we shift our priorities</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">” <span style="color: #00167c;">[10]</span>.

Pelton / Space Policy 26 (2010) 78e80 79 beaming clean solar energy from space to Earth in 2016 via a tri-part solar power system. Its three key components are: 1) a lightweight solar concentrator; 2) a high performance solar cell array that will see the equivalent of many suns 24 h a day; and 3) a transmission system from space to Earth. Solar power satellites could be a major new part of the new mix of “green energy systems” we need to reduce our addiction to carbonbased fuels. Serious efforts are now underway not only in the USA but in Japan and other countries seeking a new source of clean energy <span style="color: #00167c;">[11]</span>. - Commercial spaceplanes and space stations: Space adventure tours to go into dark sky to see the big Blue Marble from space may become reality as soon as 2011.

<u>Investment in orbital access and other space infrastructure will facilitate the establishment of settlements on the Moon</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Mars, asteroids and in man-made space structures. In the first phase, development of new regulatory infrastructure in various Earth orbits, including property/usufruct rights, real estate, mortgage financing and insurance, traffic management, piloting, policing and other services will enable the population living in Earth orbits to grow very large. </span><u>Such activities aimed at making near-Earth space habitable are the logical extension of humans' historical spread over the surface of the Earth.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> As trade spreads through near-Earth space, settlements are sure to follow, of which the inhabitants will add to the wealth of different cultures which humans have created in the many different environments in which they live. </span><br />

<u>It is hard to think of any objective that is more important than preserving peace</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Weapons developed in recent decades are so destructive, and have such horrific, long-term side-effects that their use should be discouraged as strongly as possible by the international community. Hence, </span><u>reducing the incentive to use weapons by rapidly developing the ability to use space-based resources on a large scale is surely equally important</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [15, 20, 28</span><u>]. The achievement of this depends on the low space travel costs which, at the present time, appear to be achievable only through the development of a vigorous space tourism industry.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">SUMMARY </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As discussed above, if space travel services had started during the 1950s when they first could, the space industry would be enormously more developed than it is today. Hence the failure to develop passenger space travel has seriously distorted the path taken by humans' technological and economic development since WW2, away from the path which would have been followed if capitalism and democracy operated as intended. Technological know-how which could have been used to supply services which are known to be very popular with a large proportion of the general public has not been used for that purpose, while suffering due to the unemployment and environmental damage caused by the resulting lack of new industries have increased. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In response, policies should be implemented urgently to correct this error, and to catch up with the possibilities for industrial and economic growth that have been ignored for so long. </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This policy renewal is urgent because of the growing danger of</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> unemployment, economic stagnation, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">climate change</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, educational and cultural decline, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">resource wars and loss of civil liberties which face civilisation today</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In order to achieve the necessary progress there is a particular need for collaboration between those working in the two fields of civil aviation and civil space. Although the word &quot;aerospace&quot; is widely used, it is largely a misnomer since these two fields are in practice quite separate. True &quot;aerospace&quot; collaboration to realise passenger space travel will develop the wonderful profusion of possibilities outlined above. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Humans' Urgent Choice: Heaven or Hell on Earth? </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As discussed above, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the claim that resources are running out can be used to justify wars which may never end</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: present-day rhetoric about &quot;the long war&quot; or &quot;100 years war&quot; in Iraq are current examples. If political leaders do not change their viewpoint, the recent aggression by the rich, &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; countries and their cutting back of traditional civil liberties are ominous for the future. However, </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this &quot;hellish&quot; vision of endless war is based on an assumption about a single number</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> – the future cost of travel to orbit – </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">about which a different assumption leads to a literally &quot;heavenly&quot; vision of peace</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and ever-rising living standards for everyone forever. If this cost stays above 10,000 Euros/kg, where it has been unchanged for nearly 50 years, the prospects for humanity are bleak. But </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if humans make the necessary effort, and use the tiny amount of resources needed to develop passenger space vehicles</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, then this cost will fall to 100 Euros/kg, the use of extra-terrestrial resources will become economic, and </span><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">arguments for resource wars will evaporate entirely</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. This is not a decision for the far future or the 22nd Century. It has to be made very soon if humans are to have a reasonable future. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The main reason why this step has not been taken yet seems to be lack of understanding by investors and policy-makers of the myriad opportunities that space travel will create. Now that the potential to catch up half a century’s delay in the growth of space travel is becoming understood, continuing to spend 20 billion Euro equivalents/year on government space activities while continuing to invest nothing in developing passenger space travel would be a gross failure of economic policy, and strongly contrary to the economic and social interests of the public. As this policy error is corrected, and </span><u>investment in profitable space projects grows rapidly in coming years, we can look forward to a growing world-wide boom.</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Viewed as a whole, humans' industrial growth has been seriously underperforming for decades, due to the failure to exploit these immensely promising fields of activity. The tens of thousands of unemployed space engineers in Russia, America and Europe alone are a huge waste. The millions of disappointed young people who have been taught that they cannot travel in space are another enormous wasted resource </span><br />

Such a competition will place at risk existing military, commercial, and scientific activities.<br />
With the events of September 11, 2001, the subsequent &quot;war on terrorism,&quot; and the U.S. occupation of Iraq dominating the headlines, the issue of national missile defense, and with it the larger issue of the control and weaponization of space, has receded from the front pages.

This Article develops the case for a more refined, rule-based regime for outer space. In Part II of the Article, I describe the current challenge to the space regime posed by the U.S. <em>pursuit of national dominance in space</em>. After summarizing the current legal regime, I outline three alternative scenarios for the future of space - national dominance, &quot;muddling through,&quot; and a strengthened legal regime - and suggest why the first two are unlikely to lead to stable outcomes over the long term. In Part III of the Article, I argue that <u>the traditional high seas analogy for outer space is no longer an adequate basis for rule-making for space</u>, and in Part IV, I make the case for a strengthened, rule-based regime organized around new guiding principles: comprehensive security, equal protection in space, and equity in access to space. These principles would form the core of a space sanctuary regime. I justify each of <a name="8243-365"></a> the principles and suggest some guidelines for operationalizing them in practice.

II. The Current Challenge: Law Versus Power in Outer Space<br />
The dominant challenge to the future of outer space lies in the existence of two competing visions of how activities in space should be organized, managed, and controlled. The first view emphasizes <u>the central role of law in preserving space for peaceful purposes and in promoting international cooperation in the use and exploitation of space for the benefit of all</u>. This view emphasizes the benefits of a multilateral legal regime as the best way to balance the various interests in space, to manage the possible interference of activities, and to ensure that no single power dominates and possibly jeopardizes access to space by others. Power is constrained by law, and national interests are pursued in the context of a developed and articulated legal framework and an assumption of mutual and reciprocal interests. This is the logic of the current legal regime for space (however weak and incomplete), as reflected in a set of outer space, arms control, and commercial treaties and agreements beginning in the 1960s. <a name="r3"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**3**</a><br />

Although this doctrine was once advanced exclusively by SPACECOM, prominent civilian defense officials have endorsed the global engagement strategy, and have begun to implement changes in Pentagon doctrine, organization, and budgets to move in that direction. The January 2001 Rumsfeld Commission report on the management of U.S. space assets, produced by a study commission chaired by Donald Rumsfeld before he became Secretary of Defense, signaled his strong support for the need to project force in space in order to counter presumed threats to U.S. military security there. <a name="r9"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**9**</a> Although it stopped short of directly advocating space weapons, no one could miss the point. In late September 2001, the Quadrennial Defense Review Report, a wide-ranging assessment of U.S defense policy, called for beefing up military space surveillance, communications, and other applications of earth-orbiting spacecraft. It also underscored the need to deny the use of space by adversaries, and to address U.S. vulnerabilities in space with aggressive development of space capabilities. <a name="r10"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**10**</a><br />
Most tellingly, the Department of Defense's Nuclear Posture Review, portions of which were leaked in March 2002, reportedly advocates the use of space-based assets to enhance conventional and nuclear strike capabilities. <a name="r11"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n11" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**11**</a> In October 2002, SPACECOM merged with the U.S. Strategic Command, which controls U.S. nuclear forces, to create a single entity responsible for early warning, missile defense, and long-range strikes. <a name="r12"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**12**</a> The Pentagon requested $ 1.6 billion dollars over FY 2003-2007 to develop space-based lasers and kinetic kill vehicles to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles (and to destroy satellites). <a name="r13"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n13" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**13**</a> Providing further evidence of high-level support for the global engagement strategy, the current Bush administration's decision to <a name="8243-367"></a> withdraw from the 30-year-old Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty <a name="r14"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n14" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**14**</a> appeared to be less of a necessary move driven by technical demands of missile defense testing (since much testing could be done within the terms of the treaty, and deployment of a feasible system is not imminent) than a symbolic move to sweep away inconvenient legal obstacles to U.S. power projection in space. <a name="r15"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n15" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**15**</a><br />

A contest over national superiority in space could extinguish the explicit equal right to use space that all nations enjoy, creating instead a de facto regime of control over access and use by the first nation to successfully deploy weapons based in space or weapons on the ground that target satellites. Given the immense value of outer space and its resources, other nations might develop their own antisatellite weapons designed to break this monopoly. Countries that lack the capabilities to build such weapons might purchase them. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: lime; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Space-based weapons would also generate instability due to the incentives for preemptive attack that powerful but vulnerable weapons systems seem likely to create</span></u>. <a name="r18"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=8f120f893e22206cfb63fde0c8885326&amp;csvc=le&amp;cform=&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;docnum=1&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLzVtb-zSkAW&amp;_md5=23ebe62a798de9a1fa74a7d38a9cee6a#n18" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">**18**</a><br />

The problem posed is how to balance the interests of the United States with those of the rest of the world. The SPACECOM position, if seriously pursued, would pit the United States against everyone else, and the support of even close allies could be in question. Equally if not more important, other significant interests of the United States in space would be jeopardized if an extended battle over space superiority were to develop. Given the inherent vulnerability of space activities, traditional military support activities (including space-tracking, early warning, communications, reconnaissance, weather monitoring, and navigation) would be placed in jeopardy. The viability of commercial and scientific activities in space would come into serious question as well. <u>In a conflict, terrestrial components of space activities could become objects of attack</u>, while attacks against satellites could litter space with speeding debris that might rip into commercial satellites and space vehicles, disrupting commercial and scientific activity and communications on the ground. <br />

Innovation is key to global leadership. <br />

(A Strategy for Success: Innovation Will Renew American Leadership, Orbis, Volume 51, Issue 2) <br />
Much of the foreign policy discussion in the United States today is focused upon the dilemma posed by the Iraq War and the threat posed by Islamist terrorism. These problems are, of course, both immediate and important. However, America also faces other challenges to its physical security and economic prosperity, and these are more long-term and probably <strong>more profound</strong>. There is, first, the threat posed by our declining competitiveness in the global economy, a threat most obviously represented by such rising economic powers as China and India.1 There is, second, the threat posed by our increasing dependence on oil imports from the Middle East. Moreover, these two threats are increasingly connected, as China and India themselves are greatly increasing their demand for Middle East oil.2 The United States of course faced great challenges to its security and economy in the past, most obviously from Germany and Japan in the first half of the twentieth century and from the Soviet Union in the second half. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Crucial to America's ability to prevail over these past challenges was our technological</span> and industrial <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">leadership, </span>and especially our ability to continuously recreate it.

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions. It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world 's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, </span>however,<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> it is relatively stable and less likely to produce a major war between great powers. </span>It is also comparatively benevolent, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value. American predominance does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world. The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it. The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large powers is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">, both with the United States and with each other. National ambition drives China's foreign policy today, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, the Chinese are powerfully motivated to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia. They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is passé; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. Japan, meanwhile, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power -- with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending -- now appears embarked on a more traditional national course. Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea 's nuclear weapons. But it is also driven by Japan's own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or &quot;little brother&quot; to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other 's rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component. Their competition is such that a nation like South Korea, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, is once again worrying both about a &quot;greater China&quot; and about the return of Japanese nationalism. As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe's past than its present. But it also looks like Asia's past. Russian foreign policy, too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the EU and NATO, would not insist on predominant influence over its &quot;near abroad,&quot; and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia 's international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from NATO and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia's complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia 's relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. India 's regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a panEuropean national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond. Like national movements elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as &quot;No. 1&quot; and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">-- its regional as well as its global predominance. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Were the <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">U</span></span>nited <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">S</span>tates <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to diminish its influence </span>in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the other nations would settle disputes </span>as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">through confrontation and wars</span> of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">such a multipolar world </span>is that most of these powers <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">would possess nuclear weapons.</span> That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role </span>the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, </span>of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world 's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. War could erupt between China and Taiwan </span>and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Russia and Georgia</span>, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">India and Pakistan </span>remains possible, as does conflict between <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the U</span>nited <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span>tates<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. Such conflicts</span> may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> are more likely to erupt if the U</span>nited<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> S</span>tates <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, </span>where most nations agree that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a reliable </span>American <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region</span>. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">even China</span>, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an </span>ambitious, independent, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nationalist Japan. </span>In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; </span>-- this <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia</span> and its near neighbors, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which could in turn draw the U</span>nited<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> S</span>tates <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">back in </span>under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The alternative to </span>American <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. </span>The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path. </span><br />

Advantage One is Innovation<br />
<br />
The US is falling behind due to lack of high skilled workers?matching green cards with diplomas restores innovation, growth, and leadership<br />
Frank, 09 (T.A, ?Irvine Fellow at the New America Foundation and an editor of the?Washington Monthly, Green Cards for Grads, Washington Monthly,?May/June 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0905.frank.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0905.frank.html</a>)<br />
This would all be very comforting, were the prosperity of America?s technology hubs not so fragile. Unlike heavy industry, which relies on factories that are expensive to launch and hard to move, the knowledge industry is mobile. It?s also relatively simple to capitalize, because, fundamentally, information technology is all about the brains. Whoever gets the best ones wins. For years, the United States effortlessly excelled at this game. The governments of China and India made conditions too disagreeable for innovators, while Europe and Australia effectively coasted. But our run of lazy luck is long gone. Today, China, India, the European Union, Australia, and other competitors are all vying to attract the most promising talents to their shores. China and India have greatly improved conditions for would-be entrepreneurs, and the EU is considering a skills-based &quot;blue card&quot; to compete with the green card offered here. Now, we are starting to see our rivals pull ahead of us. In 2007, high-tech exports from the United States to other countries totaled $214 billion, but imports amounted to $333 billion. If we must do the math (and in this case we must, even if India offers to help), then we arrive at an ugly result: a high-tech trade deficit of nearly $119 billion. When the world?s leader in innovation can?t break even, it?s a dubious leader. One way to regain our dominance in the tech sector would be to get more of the brightest people in the world to move here. According to a recent report issued by Duke University and the University of California at Berkeley, roughly a quarter of technology and engineering start-ups in the United States have founders who were born abroad. Over half of Silicon Valley start-ups have at least one immigrant founder. And, according to Microsoft, 35 percent of its patents filed last year came from visa and green card holders. Skilled immigration has become central to innovation and entrepreneurship in the United States. As things stand, however, we?re not exactly making new talent feel welcome. The United States provides advanced degrees to thousands of the world?s most gifted students and then sends them home, where they can work for our competitors. That we pursue such a policy only increases my concern that all the smart people in the United States have already left. Students who wish to stay here after graduating must undergo arduous procedures that encourage people to exit rather than stay. Some are lucky enough to obtain O-1 visas or green cards purely on the basis of &quot;extraordinary ability,&quot; but requirements are so stringent that few students can meet them early in their careers. Most face years of working on H-1B visas, for which demand dwarfs supply. Because the H-1B relies on employer sponsorship, which can easily be revoked, foreign workers are vulnerable to exploitation, which makes the prospect of working here less attractive and drives down wages for everyone. And once the clock runs out on an H-1B visa, the line for an employment-based green card is daunting, with more than a million applicants waiting for just over 100,000 spots each year. What?s more, a maximum of 7 percent of employment-based green cards may go to citizens of any one country, meaning that Chinese and Indians are at an immense disadvantage to, say, Tuvaluans. For many applicants, no option remains but to leave the country. Although precise numbers aren?t available, newspaper reports and statements by college professors and students suggest that today, in contrast to only five or ten years ago, students from China and India are more likely to return home after completing their education in the United States. Capitol Hill isn?t entirely oblivious to such problems. While there is immense disagreement over how to resolve the status of those who are in the country illegally, most members of Congress recognize that legally employed, accomplished immigrants are valuable to the economy. Even a hard-liner like Republican Tom Tancredo has conceded that &quot;the kind of immigration that would have a positive impact would most likely be the kind that is made up of high-income, high-skilled people.&quot; Nevertheless, because the entire topic of immigration has become so poisonous, even the most milquetoast stand-alone legislative proposals have stalled. One bill that seemed to have a decent chance at passage was sponsored by Republican Senator John Cornyn in 2007 and would have removed caps on employment-based green cards for workers with advanced degrees. (The bill wouldn?t have scrapped H-1Bs, but it would have made them more easily available, which is better than nothing.) This went nowhere. Arlen Specter proposed something similar. This went nowhere. Last year, congressional Democrats such as Zoe Lofgren of San Jose proposed lifting the 7-percent-per-country cap on green cards. Guess where that went. Lately, with the country in recession, Senators Charles Grassley and Dick Durbin have tried to restrict H-1Bs even further, stating that Americans should get an easier shot at available jobs. One especially prominent opponent of increased H-1B immigration is Professor Norm Matloff, a computer scientist at the University of California at Davis. Matloff believes that Silicon Valley is blinded by two vices: greed and ageism. Because of greed, technology companies hire H-1B immigrants, who save them money. Because of ageism, Silicon Valley pushes out older programmers who are perfectly qualified to do the work. Such practices not only force talented older Americans out of the technology industry, they also discourage bright young Americans from entering it, thus squandering some of the country?s finest potential talents. American technology workers would be doing better if there were fewer foreign workers, says Matloff, and Silicon Valley would be just as profitable and innovative, if not more so. Now, there?s no way to say for sure that Matloff is wrong. But two points work against his overall line of thinking. The first is that high-skilled U.S. workers have enjoyed tremendous increases in wages in the past few decades, while low-skilled workers have seen losses and stagnation. To the extent that immigration has had a negative effect on the wages of American-born workers, the burden hasn?t been borne by graduates of MIT. The second is that from the perspective of the United States as a whole, it?s worth remembering that even if Matloff is right about ageism in Silicon Valley (and if he is, we have a legal system to address such claims), the point of nourishing such a place isn?t only to provide American technology workers with employment. It?s to provide the nation with wealth and a technological edge. It?s to help right our trade balance through high-tech, high-income industries. And to do that, we need to do more than simply fill available vacancies with qualified applicants. For any endeavor that aims to be the best of its sort, an oversupply of talent is necessary. For every professional violinist in the United States, dozens of nearly-as-good?or sometimes even superior?violinists are out of luck in the quest for orchestral employment. If we examine a different sector, such as professional basketball, all these principles are taken for granted. Take Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets. He?s a one-man multimillion-dollar business, and his talent creates work for hundreds of Americans who work for him directly or indirectly in support roles. Undeniably, though, he is also taking away a job that an American-born basketball player could do instead, and there are thousands of American-born basketball players unable to find employment in the field. If the point of having basketball teams is to provide as many American basketball players as possible with jobs, then the United States is following a very wrongheaded immigration policy. (Out of fewer than 500 NBA players currently employed in the United States, more than seventy are foreign-born.) But if the point is to create the most competitive teams in the world and to broaden the appeal (and export, and merchandising, and ticket sales, and broadcasts) of basketball to as wide a world market as possible, then our current policy is rather good. A sensible immigration policy would cease placing undue burdens on low-income Americans (in the form of millions of low-skill workers) and start adding to the ranks of high-skill workers, who generate greater innovation and wealth. An immigrant janitor competes for one of a limited number of janitorial jobs, and an oversupply of candidates merely drives down wages. But an immigrant inventor may devise a product that will be manufactured, distributed, marketed, and even exported?all processes that create jobs. While low-skill workers tend to take jobs, high-skill workers tend to make jobs. And high-skill workers who are displaced can at worst usually move down the job chain: an unemployed nuclear physicist may take a temporary job as a cashier. But low-skill workers who are displaced can rarely move up the job chain: an unemployed cashier cannot take a temporary job as a nuclear physicist. The way forward, then, should be pretty simple in principle. Any student with an advanced degree in science, technology, engineering, or math should be offered a reasonable chance at permanent residency in the United States, provided that she can obtain (and retain) employment in her field The overall aim of any policy we devise should be to prevent an exodus of the people we?ve educated. Yes, we?re in a recession. But that doesn?t mean we can take a break in the race for economic and technological leadership?quite the opposite. The surest way to lose a battle is to forget that the primary goal isn?t to make jobs for soldiers. It?s to avoid getting one?s ass kicked.<br />

And, US competitiveness high now despite recent decline?absent tech innovation US leadership will collapse<br />
Dabney, 10 (Michael Dabney, a former bioscience communicator at the University of California, U.S. Competitive Edge in Jeopardy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/34041/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/34041/</a>)<br />
He wrote: ?The United States appears to have thrown its gearshift into reverse. At all levels of government and even in the private sector, Americans have been cutting back crucial investments in creativity?in education, in research, in arts and culture?while pouring billions into low-return or no-return public projects like sports stadiums ? If these trends continue, the U.S. may well squander its once-considerable lead.? It is America?s declining hegemony in high-tech innovation and research that has got decision makers in the U.S.?from the Oval Office and the National Science Foundation in Washington to researchers, business leaders, and educators across the country?concerned. ?For more than half a century, the United States has led the world in scientific discovery and innovation. It has been a beacon, drawing the best scientists to its educational institutions, industries and laboratories from around the globe,? The Task Force on the Future of American Innovation wrote in the report ?The Knowledge Economy: Is the United States Losing Its Competitive Edge?? ?However, in today?s rapidly evolving competitive world, the United States can no longer take its supremacy for granted. Nations from Europe to Eastern Asia are on a fast track to pass the United States in scientific excellence and technological innovation,? the report said. Indeed, there are warnings on the horizon. Here are just some of them: Fewer graduates in science and engineering: America?s educational system was once at the forefront of producing the best scientists and engineers; but today, undergraduate science and engineering degrees in the United States are being awarded less frequently than in other countries. For example, according to the Council on Competitiveness, the ratio of first university degrees in natural sciences and engineering to the college-age population in the United States is only 5.7 degrees per 100. Some European countries, including Spain, Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, and Finland, award between 8 and 13 degrees per 100. Japan awards 8 per 100, and Taiwan and South Korea each award about 11 per 100. Stagnant growth: Although the United States remains a competitive leader in innovation, it has made the least progress of all developing nations in competiveness and innovation capacity over the last decade, according to a 2009 report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation titled ?The Atlantic Century: Benchmarking EU &amp; U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness.? A fall from grace in key high-tech sectors: From 1998 to 2003, the balance of trade in the manufacture of aircraft?which for years was one of the strongest U.S. export sectors?fell from $39 billion to $24 billion, a loss of $15 billion, reflecting increased sales of foreign-made commercial aircraft to U.S. carriers. In areas of information technology, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and fusion energy science, the United States is also losing ground to Asia and some countries in the European Union (EU). ??Can America compete?? is the nation?s new No. 1 anxiety, the topic of emotional debate,? wrote Fortune magazine?s Geoffrey Colvin. ?We?re not building human capital the way we used to. Our primary and secondary schools are falling behind the rest of the world?s. Our universities are still excellent, but the foreign students who come to them are increasingly taking their educations back home. As other nations multiply their science and engineering graduates?building the foundation for economic progress?ours are declining, in part because those fields are seen as nerdish and simply uncool.? To be sure, experts are quick to point out that despite these challenges, no one is saying that Americans can?t adapt and get back on track. The Task Force on the Future of American Innovation report stated: ?The United States still leads the world in research and discovery, but our advantage is rapidly eroding, and our global competitors may soon overtake us.? To remain competitive in the global arena, the task force said, the United States must redirect its attention to the factors that have driven American innovation for years: research (especially that which is funded through federal and private entities for science and engineering), education, the technical workforce, and economic growth. Columbia University professor Dr. Jeffrey Sachs, cited in Colvin?s article, underscores this point. In a competitive global market, he said, it is science and technological breakthroughs that fundamentally influence economic development, and in an economy where technology leadership determines the winners, education trumps everything. That?s a problem for America, Bill Gates told Fortune magazine. He said while American fourth-graders are among the world?s best in math and science, by ninth grade they?ve fallen way behind. &quot;This isn?t an accident or a flaw in the system; it is the system,? said Gates. That is why America?s decline in producing top-notch scientists and engineers is such a serious concern, experts say. While America lags, ?low-cost countries?not just China and India but also Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil, and others?are turning out large numbers of well-educated young people fully qualified to work in an information-based economy,? said Colvin. For example, he said, China in 2005 produced about 3.3 million college graduates, India 3.1 million (the majority of them English-speaking), and the United States just 1.3 million. In engineering, China?s graduates numbered over 600,000, India?s 350,000 and the United States? only about 70,000, making it highly probable that the United States may be required to outsource its research and development overseas eventually if this trend is not addressed. ?Americans who thought outsourcing only threatened factory workers and call-center operators are about to learn otherwise,? Colvin warned. While many studies exploring the competitiveness of America in science and technology indicate that America still leads other countries in key areas of these fields, the 2009 report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation found cause for both the United States and the EU to be concerned in the face of increasing Asian competition. The report evaluated and rated global innovation-based competitiveness in science and technology of 40 nations and regions (including the EU-10 and the EU-15) as they currently stand, and in terms of the progress they have made over the last decade. In it, the United States was rated fourth place in global competitiveness among all nations, and the EU 18th place. However, the study found that the United States has made the least progress of the 40 nations and regions in improvement in international competitiveness and innovation capacity over the last decade, while China was rated first in this category. The EU-15 region was found to have made more improvements over the last decade than the United States but slower than the overall average and, as a result, was ranked 29th among the 40 nations and regions. ?If the EU-15 region as a whole continues to improve at this faster rate than the United States, it would surpass the United States in innovation-based competitiveness by 2020,? the report said. However, with the positive showing of Asian nations in the study, the report?s authors Robert Atkinson and Scott Andes wrote, ?To find global leaders [in high tech], Asia is the place to look.? The study?s findings also have significant implications for Europe and the United States, the authors said. First, the rise of global economic competition means that the United States and Europe need to think of themselves as a big state or a big nation, and proactively put in place national or continental economic development strategies. ?This particularly applies to the United States, where the prevailing view among many Washington policymakers is that the United States has been number 1 for so long that it will continue to be number 1,? Atkinson and Andes wrote. However, competition between countries and regions, if conducted in the right spirit, can actually be beneficial by pumping new life blood into various sectors of the global economy. ?The competitive pressures between nations can lead them all to do better, spurring them to put in place a host of policies that drive productivity and innovation, which at the end of the day will benefit not just individual nations and regions,? Atkinson and Andes wrote. ?The United States and Europe, having led in the 20th century, have a special responsibility to lead this process in the 21st century.?<br />
Plan solves economic growth- retention of foreign nationals in STEM fields now is critical to economic recovery<br />
ACIP, 09 (American Council on International Pesonnel, Letter from ACIP to House Representative Jeff Flake, April 3, 2009)<br />
Allowing certain foreign nationals who have earned a Ph.D. degree from a U.S. educational institution in a science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) field to be exempt from both the employment-based green card and H-1B visa caps will help ensure employers continue to innovate and lay the ground-work for America?s future economic recovery and growth. Quotas on foreign national talent have always kept bright minds from coming to our country and staying in our country. At a time when our country needs its economy to recover, the STAPLE Act sends a strong message that it is in our national economic interest to benefit from the foreign national talent that we educate at home in our U.S. universities. Losing such talent in these fields to our overseas competitors at this critical economic juncture would be detrimental to America?s economic recovery. With President Obama?s call for the creation of 4 to 5 million jobs over the next ten years in key fields like healthcare, energy and education, the STAPLE Act allows U.S. employers to work toward that goal by retaining highly-educated individuals in fields where America does not have the necessary pipeline of U.S. students to position us to better compete.<br />

<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&amp;p=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&amp;p=2</a>)<br />
The damage to China's position is more subtle. The crisis has not--yet--led to the nightmare scenario that China-watchers fear: a recession or slowdown producing the kind of social unrest that could challenge the government. That may still come to pass--the recent economic news from China has been consistently worse than most experts predicted--but, even if the worst case is avoided, the financial crisis has nevertheless had significant effects. For one thing, it has reminded China that its growth remains dependent on the health of the U.S. economy.<br />
(continued?)<br />
A deceleration in China's long-term growth rate would postpone indefinitely the date when China could emerge as a peer competitor to the United States. The present global distribution of power could be changing slowly, if at all. The greatest danger both to U.S.-China relations and to American power itself is probably not that China will rise too far, too fast; it is that the current crisis might end China's growth miracle. In the worst-case scenario, the turmoil in the international economy will plunge China into a major economic downturn. The Chinese financial system will implode as loans to both state and private enterprises go bad. Millions or even tens of millions of Chinese will be unemployed in a country without an effective social safety net. The collapse of asset bubbles in the stock and property markets will wipe out the savings of a generation of the Chinese middle class. The political consequences could include dangerous unrest--and a bitter climate of anti-foreign feeling that blames others for China's woes. (Think of Weimar Germany, when both Nazi and communist politicians blamed the West for Germany's economic travails.) Worse, instability could lead to a vicious cycle, as nervous investors moved their money out of the country, further slowing growth and, in turn, fomenting ever-greater bitterness. Thanks to a generation of rapid economic growth, China has so far been able to manage the stresses and conflicts of modernization and change; nobody knows what will happen if the growth stops. India's future is also a question. Support for global integration is a fairly recent development in India, and many serious Indians remain skeptical of it. While India's 60-year-old democratic system has resisted many shocks, a deep economic recession in a country where mass poverty and even hunger are still major concerns could undermine political order, long-term growth, and India's attitude toward the United States and global economic integration. The violent Naxalite insurrection plaguing a significant swath of the country could get worse; religious extremism among both Hindus and Muslims could further polarize Indian politics; and India's economic miracle could be nipped in the bud. If current market turmoil seriously damaged the performance and prospects of India and China, the current crisis could join the Great Depression in the list of economic events that changed history, even if the recessions in the West are relatively short and mild. The United States should stand ready to assist Chinese and Indian financial authorities on an emergency basis--and work very hard to help both countries escape or at least weather any economic downturn. It may test the political will of the Obama administration, but the United States must avoid a protectionist response to the economic slowdown. U.S. moves to limit market access for Chinese and Indian producers could poison relations for years. For billions of people in nuclear-armed countries to emerge from this crisis believing either that the United States was indifferent to their well-being or that it had profited from their distress could damage U.S. foreign policy far more severely than any mistake made by George W. Bush. (continued???)<br />
This may be happening yet again. None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist<br />
system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />

The plan solves competitiveness and economic leadership in the short term<br />
Fitz, 09 (Marshall, Center For American Progress, Director of Immigration Policy at American Progress, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, key legislative strategists in support of CIR and has served as a media spokesperson on a broad array of immigration policy and legislative issues, quoted extensively across spectrum of international, national, presented at national conferences and universities on immigration matters, advised numerous members of Congress on immigration, helped draft major legislation, Prosperous Immigrants, Prosperous Americans, How to Welcome the World?s Best Educated,Boost Economic Growth, and Create Jobs, December 2009)<br />
Immigrants who come to the United States to study at our best universities and then go to work at our nation?s leading companies contribute directly and immediately to our nation?s global economic competitiveness. High-skilled immigrants who have started their own high-tech companies have created hundreds of thousands of new jobs and achieved company sales in the hundreds of billions of dollars.<br />
Yet despite the critical importance of such immigrants to the nation?s economic success in a global economy, our current high-skilled immigration system is a two-fold failure: arbitrary restrictions prevent companies from effectively tapping the full potential of this talent pool, while inadequate safeguards fail to prevent against wage depression and worker mistreatment. The reforms outlined in this paper will help establish a 21st century immigration system that serves the nation?s economic interests and upholds our responsibilities in a global economy.<br />
Of course, our current immigration policies have failed the country on many fronts beyond the high-skilled policy arena. And the urgent need for comprehensive, systemic reforms is beyond question. The national debate has understandably focused up to this point on the most visible and most highly charged issue?ending illegal immigration. Solving that riddle and ending illegal immigration is indisputably a national imperative and must be at the heart of a comprehensive overhaul of our system.<br />
But reforms to our high-skilled immigration system are an important component of that broader reform and integral to a progressive growth strategy.1 Science, technology, and innovation have been?and will continue to be?keys to U.S. economic growth. The United States must remain on the cutting edge of technological innovation if we are to continue driving the most dynamic economic engine in the world,2 and U.S. companies must be able to recruit international talent to effectively compete in the international innovation arena. To be certain, educating and training a 21st century U.S. workforce is a paramount national priority and the cornerstone of progressive growth. Improving access to topflight education for everyone in this country will be the foundation for our continued global leadership and prosperity.3 But it is shortsighted in a globalized economy to expect that we can fill all of our labor needs with a homegrown workforce. In fact, our current educational demographics point to growing shortfalls in some of the skills needed in today?s economy.4 And as global economic integration deepens, the source points for skill sets will spread?such as green engineering in Holland or nanotechnology in Israel?the breadth of skills needed to drive innovation will expand, and global labor pools must become more mobile.<br />
Reforming our high-skilled immigration system will stimulate innovation, enhance competitiveness, and help cultivate a flexible, highly-skilled U.S. workforce while protecting U.S. workers from globalization?s destabilizing effects. Our economy has benefitted enormously from being able to tap the international pool of human capital.5 Arbitrary limitations on our ability to continue doing so are ultimately self-defeating: Companies will lose out to their competitors making them less profitable, less productive, and less able to grow; or they will move their operations abroad with all the attendant negative economic consequences. And the federal treasury loses tens of billions of dollars in tax revenues by restricting the opportunities for high-skilled foreign workers to remain in the United States.6<br />
Access to high-skilled foreign workers is critical to our economic competitiveness and growth, but facilitating such access triggers equally critical flip-side considerations, in particular the potential for employers to directly or indirectly leverage foreign workers? interests against the native workforce. Current enforcement mechanisms are too weak to adequately prevent fraud and gaming of the system.7 And current regulations tie foreign workers too tightly to a single employer, which empowers employers with disproportionate control over one class of workers. That control enables unscrupulous employers to deliberately pit one group of workers against another to depress wage growth.8 Even when there is no malicious employer intent or worker mistreatment, the restriction of labor mobility inherently affects the labor market by preventing workers from pursuing income maximizing opportunities.<br />

And, competitiveness through innovation is key to global leadership.<br />

Much of the foreign policy discussion in the United States today is focused upon the dilemma posed by the Iraq War and the threat posed by Islamist terrorism. These problems are, of course, both immediate and important. However, America also faces other challenges to its physical security and economic prosperity, and these are more long-term and probably more profound. There is, first, the threat posed by our declining competitiveness in the global economy, a threat most obviously represented by such rising economic powers as China and India.1 There is, second, the threat posed by our increasing dependence on oil imports from the Middle East. Moreover, these two threats are increasingly connected, as China and India themselves are greatly increasing their demand for Middle East oil.2 The United States of course faced great challenges to its security and economy in the past, most obviously from Germany and Japan in the first half of the twentieth century and from the Soviet Union in the second half. Crucial to America's ability to prevail over these past challenges was our technological and industrial leadership, and especially our ability to continuously recreate it. Indeed, the United States has been unique among great powers in its ability to keep on creating and recreating new technologies and new industries, generation after generation. Perpetual innovation and technological leadership might even be said to be the American way of maintaining primacy in world affairs. They are almost certainly what America will have to pursue in order to prevail over the contemporary challenges involving economic competitiveness and energy dependence. There is therefore an urgent need for America to resume its historic emphasis on innovation. The United States needs a national strategy focused upon developing new technologies and creating new industries. Every successful strategy must define an objective or mission, determine a solution, and assemble the means of execution. In this case, the objective is economic superiority; the solution is new industries which build upon the contemporary revolution in information technology; and the means of execution will have to include a partnership of industry, government, and people.3<br />

Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity<br />
for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the<br />
United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems,<br />
such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help<br />
preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including<br />
a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />

This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions. It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world 's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, however, it is relatively stable and less likely to produce a major war between great powers. It is also comparatively benevolent, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value. American predominance does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world. The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it. The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large powers is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance, both with the United States and with each other. National ambition drives China's foreign policy today, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, the Chinese are powerfully motivated to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia. They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is pass?; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. Japan, meanwhile, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power -- with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending -- now appears embarked on a more traditional national course. Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea 's nuclear weapons. But it is also driven by Japan's own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or &quot;little brother&quot; to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other 's rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component. Their competition is such that a nation like South Korea, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, is once again worrying both about a &quot;greater China&quot; and about the return of Japanese nationalism. As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe's past than its present. But it also looks like Asia's past. Russian foreign policy, too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the EU and NATO, would not insist on predominant influence over its &quot;near abroad,&quot; and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia 's international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from NATO and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia's complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia 's relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. India 's regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a panEuropean national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond. Like national movements elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as &quot;No. 1&quot; and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. Nationalism in all its forms is back, if it ever went away, and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying -- its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the United States to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past: sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but often through confrontation and wars of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them less likely, or it could simply make them more catastrophic. It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War i and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today Europe 's stability depends on the guarantee, however distant and one hopes unnecessary, that the United States could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of world war. People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world 's great powers. Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt between Russia and Georgia, forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict between India and Pakistan remains possible, as does conflict between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. But they are more likely to erupt if the United States weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance. This is especially true in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. In Europe, too, the departure of the United States from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its periphery. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. If the United States withdrew from Europe -- if it adopted what some call a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could in time increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances. It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn 't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. The alternative to American predominance in the region is not balance and peace. It is further competition. The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.<br />

Additionally, the US must maintain leadership?competition relies on international leapfrogging for growth and economic stability<br />
Howes and Singh 2000<br />
Candace Howes and Ajit Singh 2000 Competitiveness Matters The Limitations of the Krugman Thesis. pages 3-6.<br />
Underlying Krugman's critique of the concept of national competitiveness is a standard neoclassical model in which the effects of trade on a country's standard of living manifest themselves mainly through changes in the terms of trade brought about by the equilibrating adjustments of exchange rates.2 Because complete wage price flexibility is assumed, and because demand for traded goods is assumed to be perfectly elastic at world prices, balance of payments disequilibria, including those that may arise between countries due to differences in rates of productivity growth, can be smoothly resolved by exchange rate adjustments. Under neoclassical assumptions then, differences in relative productivity growth and the trade imbalances that may follow cannot have any effect on demand, output, employment, or inflation. However, in the real world of incomplete wage price flexibility, the adjustment process may be far from smooth. It may entail leapfrogging inflation and considerable adjustment in quantities, that is, in real output and employment. These difficulties may be illustrated by considering the experience of an advanced country (the United Kingdom in the mid 1970s). Following the first oil price shock in 1973 74, the U.K. economy, which was not then a major producer and exporter of oil, suffered an adverse movement in its terms of trade due to the OPEC oil price increase. The size of the shock was estimated to have amounted to about 4 percent of CDP. Instead of a smooth adjustment of the economy through movements in the exchange rates, there was a protracted process that involved redistributive struggles between various social groups over the diminished national pie. The net result was a doubling of the rate of unemployment, a quadrupling of the rate of inflation, a lull blown financial crisis, and ultimately the humiliation for an advanced industrial country of being forced to accept an IMP rescue package, before internal and external equilibria could be restored.' Thus even a relatively small terms of trade shock can have serious repercussions even in an advanced country for an economy, depending on the dynamics of the adjustment process. The validity of Krugman's analysis of national competitiveness requires an abstraction from such labor market dynamics. There is a further more serious problem with the Krugman model of equilibrating adjustment between countries through prices, that is, changes in exchange rates. This arises not so much from the abstractions made with respect to the labor market dynamics but, importantly, it is caused by the neglect of certain essential features of the contemporary product markets. In a wide range of manufactured products these markets are characterized by oligopolistic structures. This leads to a situation that competition now takes place to a considerable extent on the basis of nonprice factors such as quality, marketing, design, reliability, and service. This aspect of international trade is related to the empirical paradox originally observed by Kaldor (1978). He found that for countries like Germany and Japan that increased their share of world markets in manufactures in the 1960s and the early 1970s, prices and costs relative to other countries (expressed in a common currency) rose rather than declined. On the other hand, the share of the United Kingdom and the United States in the world exports of manufactured goods fell despite the fact that their prices and costs relative to other countries were decreasing. Fagerherg (1996, table 1) has updated Kaldor's original analysis for the years 1963 through 1975 to the period 1978 through 1994; he has also extended it to include twelve leading countries for manufactured exports. He finds a positive relationship still exists between world market share and relative unit labor costs.' It is notable that the East Asian NICs, which have gained large increases in market share, have recorded rising relative unit labor costs. From a neoclassical perspective, there would appear then to be a generally perverse relationship between a country's world market share and its relative prices. On the other hand, Fagerberg also observed, seemingly consistent with neoclassical theory, a positive correlation between a country's rate of productivity growth and its change in world market share. An important explanation for these observed phenomena lies partly in the fact mentioned earlier, that is, the increasing role of technology and other nonprice factors its international trade. The reason for the positive association between productivity growth and market share is that countries with high rates of productivity growth also have high rates of investment and output growth. Such countries thereby achieve faster turnover of machines, faster technical progress (to the extent that technical progress is embodied in new capital goods), greater learning by doing, and quicker development of new products.5 As a consequence, as Kaldor (1981, 603) observed: &quot;Basically in a growing world economy the growth of exports is mainly to be explained by the income elasticity of demand of foreign countries for a country's products; but it is a matter of the innovative ability and adaptive capacity of its manufacturers whether this income elasticity will tend to be relatively large or small.&quot; Kaldor's emphasis on technological development as the key nonprice factor in international competition also finds confirmation in the data on R&amp;D analyzed by Fagerberg. He shows there is a significant positive relationship between the change in a country's R&amp;D as a share of GOP and growth in its world market share.' Empirically, then, market share growth is better explained by relative productivity growth (and the associated growth of investment) than by falling relative unit labor costs. These analytical and empirical findings, when coupled with the concept of cumulative causation, have serious implications for the Krugman analysis. It will be recalled that one of Krugman's main points is to suggest that a nation's standard of living is determined by its own long term productivity growth rather than its productivity growth relative to others (subject to a terms of trade effect discussed earlier). However, if countries' relative productivity growth is an indicator of their relative nonprice competitiveness, it means that a country with relatively slow productivity growth will not only have a smaller growth of market share but that because of cumulative causation, its performance may decline further. Corporations in countries that become technologically uncompetitive and start to lose market share will see their profits fall, leading to a lower rate of investment, slower technical progress, and hence even greater noncompetitiveness than before. Left to themselves these dynamic market forces can therefore lead to a cumulative decline in a country's share of world markets making it thereby more difficult for its economy to operate at full potential. To counteract such vicious circle dynamics requires supply side measures that can improve a country's technological capabilities. This point can also be looked at from another perspective. What are the implications of technical change abroad for a country's standard of living? To analyze this issue, let us suppose that one of the United States' main trading partners (say Japan) has increased its trend rate of technical progress due, for example, to an acceleration in the rate of investment in higher education and science. This has no immediate effect on U.S. productivity growth. Suppose further, however, that this technical change in Japan, although to some extent complementary in the sense of increasing the demand for U.S. goods in Japan, is largely &quot;competitive,&quot; that is, Japan starts to export better quality goods in those industries where it competes with the United States. The end result of this process through cumulative causation may be a further decline in U.S. competitiveness and hence productivity growth in the way outlined above, unless the United States is able to adapt to new circumstances either by imitation or by technological development of its own. In the real world of international competition today, such adaptation is crucial to maintain a mix of exports for which the world income elasticity of demand and the potential for productivity growth are sufficient to encourage a virtuous circle of growth, investment, and technical change. To sum up, contrary to Krugman, there are good analytical and empirical reasons for the view that relative productivity growth does matter profoundly. With so much trade based on nonprice competitiveness, the trade balance can rarely be achieved solely through exchange rate manipulation or only at great cost in terms of employment and real income growth! More?over, greater productivity growth abroad, as a result of faster technical prog?ress there, is likely to have negative consequences for productivity growth in the home economy unless corrective measures are taken to enhance the country's technological capabilities. Thus even an advanced country cannot afford to ignore its international competitive position if it wishes to improve its standard of living in the long run.' Turning to Krugman's normative objections to the concept of international competitiveness as carrying the implication that trade is a zero sum game, the foregoing analysis suggests that this objection is also not well founded. To the extent that international competitiveness requires leapfrogging competition between countries in technological developments, this may result in a Pareto improvement in world welfare. To sum up, once the severe limitations of Krugman's model in its application to the real world are recognized, his analytical and empirical critique of the concept of national competitiveness loses much of its force.<br />

Contention Two: Science Diplomacy<br />
<br />
The plans critical to scientific leadership?giving green cards to diplomas is a key incentive to attracting and retaining foreign students for science cooperation<br />
Pearson and Yang, 08 (Jon Pearson, director of the Bechtel International Center at Stanford University, testifying on behalf of my professional association, NAFSA, the Association of International Educators. NAFSA is the world's largest professional association dedicated to the promotion and advancement of international education and exchange, Dr. Yongjie Yang, a Ph.D. degree in genetics and neuroscience, his lab is one of the best leading labs in the research of this disease in the world. Federal News Service, Capitol Hill Hearing, June 12, 2008 Thursday, Of The Subcommittee On Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security And International Law Of The House Committee On The Judiciary; Subject: The Need For Green Cards For Highly Skilled Workers) My remarks today will focus on the broad challenges the United States now faces in attracting and retaining international students. Specific interest, of course, is the current law capping the number of green cards issued annually, even to those who graduate from U.S. colleges and universities with higher degrees. The United States is in a global competition for international students and scholars. That may seem like an unremarkable statement, but often, U.S. law and policy do not always reflect an understanding of this reality. Though the U.S. is renowned and still renowned for being home to the majority of the top colleges and universities in the world, the international student market is being transformed in this century. There are many new players in the game acting much more purposefully and strategically than ever before. Competitor countries have implemented strategies for capturing a greater share of this market. Their governments are acting to create more streamlined visa and entry processes and more welcoming environments and are setting goals for international student recruitment. Our neighbor Canada recently changed its employment policy to allow international graduates to work for up to three years after graduation, and in fact Canada does recruit our international students on our own campuses, including my own. They have visited Stanford three times in the last few years to talk to students about opportunities in Canada. At Stanford, we have been recently dealing with the Homeland Security extension on practical training for STEM students. A broader context is that France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada have all made similar changes to the possibilities for international students remaining in those countries and working after graduation. New competitors will also enter the market for international students. Primary among them is the European higher education area, which comprises the signatories to the Bologna Declaration. This goal is to create a seamless higher education system in Europe by 2010, with credits entirely transferable among their higher education institutions and often instruction in English. The European Union is also considering a blue card, similar to our green card, to be more competitive for non-European talent. Other countries are recognizing the value of educating the next generation of leaders in attracting the world's scientific, technological and intellectual elite. U.S. immigration law and policy has not yet effectively been adapted to this era of globalization. My own institution has been witness to this as we also offer services to higher foreign-born faculty and researchers. But even so, many of the best and the brightest around the world still wish to come here and study. We should welcome them by creating a clearer path to the green card status for them that is not tied to these low caps on the green cards available annually. In a global job market, employers look for the talent they need wherever they can find it, and students and highly talented workers look for the places to study and work that offer them the most opportunity. This means that options for employment after graduation are integral to attracting bright and talented international students. Employment prospects are often a part of that calculus in deciding where to study, work and live. Not all students who arrive in the U.S. wish to remain. Some have commitments to their home country, but others discover their potential in the environment of U.S. higher education and their career and life goals are changed. Google, Hotmail, Yahoo and Sun are examples in Stanford's own backyard of former students who have remained in the United States. I don't think it's a secret the U.S. immigration law often makes it difficult for international students to work after graduating, even from the most prestigious U.S. higher education institutions. The annual H-1B cap lottery is reported internationally, highlighting that the entire annual allotment is depleted in a day or two. In conclusion, what better way to capture the world's best and brightest who want to become part of our nation and to make it easier for them to remain to contribute to American economic and scientific leadership after they graduate from U.S. universities? It's with these comments that I am delighted to support H.R. bill 6039. Thank you very much. REP. LOFGREN: Thank you very much, Mr. Pearson. Dr. Yang, we'd be delighted to hear from you. MR. YANG: Good afternoon, Madame Chairwoman and Congressman King and members of committee. I want to first thank our Representative Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for giving this opportunity for me to testify here, and I'd like to share my personal experience on permanent residency application with this panel. And along with other people's testimony, I'd like to draw attention to -- for the Americans' need to change the laws regarding the highly skilled immigrants. My name's Yongjie Yang. I was born in China and came here in 2000, when I was admitted to the neuroscience center genetics program in Iowa State University, and there I basically focused on the mechanisms for environmental toxin-induced nerve cell degeneration, which is highly relevant to the Parkinson's disease research. I was awarded a Ph.D. degree in genetics and neuroscience in 2005. That same year, my wife also was awarded the master degrees from also Iowa State University. Currently I'm now a research scientist in the department of neurology at Johns Hopkins University, and my current work also focuses on the pathogenic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Our lab is one of the best leading labs in the research of this disease in the world. By better understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease, we hope to develop effective neuroprotective strategies to cure or delay the progression of this disease. We hope to find the cure here. On a personal note, I married my wife while we were both at Iowa State University, and my wife also works at Johns Hopkins University as a specialist in Parkinson's disease research. We have a U.S. citizen daughter who is about four years old, and we recently just bought a house in Ellicott City, Maryland. So we do plan to stay here long. I currently have H-1B status which will expire next year. Also, I have filed my immigrant visa petition in May 2006 and got approved last year in February, but I haven't received my green card yet because of the severe backlog of employment-based visa numbers. And I don't know now, because of the situation, how long I have to wait before I can become the permanent resident and also become the U.S. citizen. I'd like to emphasize the three major obstacles that the immigration status poses on my situation as well as other people's. The first one is because of the unavailability of the green card, I'm not eligible to apply for many federal grants from National Institute of Sciences or from National Institute of Health or National Science Foundation and from other federal agencies, although my research is very promising to identify the drug target to cure or delay the ALS. The second obstacle is because of the situation, not me but some other people who share a similar background as me cannot work for the federal agencies such as FDA, NIH or other federal agencies, although they possess specialized skill that is very much needed for these agencies. The third obstacle obviously is the travel inconvenience. For example, next -- last year, I had an opportunity to go to London for international conference which is very important in my field, but I couldn't go because if I go, I have to go back to China to reapply for my H-1B stamp and then come back to Baltimore, which could take months. So opportunity like this got wasted, and for scientific research it is vital to have discussions to meet with colleagues to talk about the latest research programs, and also that's also a problem to establish the long-term collaboration with your international colleagues. So as I understand it, the whole point of the employment-based immigration system is to keep the brightest, the best of the foreign minds people in this land, in this land of opportunities. However, we cannot become the U.S. citizen before we got the green card, the permanent residence. Because of all these problems, we cannot travel freely, we cannot apply for some federal grants, we cannot apply jobs for the federal agencies, even though we are doing very cutting-edge researches and the important -- developing important technologies which might bring -- might create new job opportunities for the U.S. The Legal Immigrant Association I represent was formed by scientists, engineers and other professionals in the United States. Most of us received advanced degrees from United States academic institutions and most of us are also from China, and we are doing the petitioning to let the government know and the Congress know what we need to let our voice be heard. So on behalf of the LIA, I want to thank the Congress, the subcommittee for giving this opportunity, and I urge you to pass the legislation that would benefit eventually America by recognizing that putting highly skilled, highly educated people like us directly on the path to U.S. citizenship, and this will eventually benefit the best interests of the United States.<br />

That?s critical to prevent conflict with North Korea?science diplomacy uniquely spills over to relations<br />
Thorson and Seo, 09 (Dr. Stuart Thorson is with the Maxwell School, SyracuseUniversity; Hyunjin Seo is with the S. I. Newhouse School ofPublic Communications, Syracuse University, Academic Science Engagement with North Korea, April 2009 ? Volume 4 ? Number 4)<br />
Science diplomacy refers to international scientific cooperation aimed simultaneously at advancing scientific knowledge and improving and strengthening broader relations between participating countries and groups. Science diplomacy has proved to be especially helpful in engaging countries where traditional diplomatic relations have been problematic. Successful science depends on the trusted application of shared protocols and thus encourages the development of trust among participants. In this paper we present evidence from a long-term academic science engagement between the United States and North Korea (DPRK; the Democratic People?s Republic of Korea) that (1) sustained science engagement provides a valuable context for developing trust between individuals from countries with strong political differences, and (2) this trust can spill over into more traditional diplomatic engagements.<br />
We describe an academic engagement in the area of information science between Syracuse University (SU) in the United States and Kim Chaek University of Technology (KUT) in North Korea. This engagement has been carried out in close cooperation with the Korea Society, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) located in New York City. The science engagement was initiated in 2001 and has to date resulted in 13 exchanges of scientifi c personnel and in the construction and implementation of the first digital library in North Korea. The trust-centric nature of collaborative science is especially relevant in engaging North Korea because, as with some other Northeast Asian countries, trust flows more from relationships than from quid pro quo contracts. Thus, we argue, science engagement provides a useful context for developing the relationships ultimately required for more broad-gauged cooperation.<br />
We then discuss several follow-on science collaborations, including the four-nation Regional Scholars and Leaders Seminar Program for Chinese, North Korean, South Korean, and U.S. information scientists and linguists; the first-ever participation by North Korean undergraduate students in the Association for Computing Machinery?s International Collegiate Programming Contest; and the U.S.-DPRK Scientific Engagement Consortium based in Washington, D.C.<br />
The paper concludes with a discussion of lessons learned regarding the role academic scientists, acting both as educators and researchers, can play in helping to create the conditions for more familiar forms of diplomacy. This is of particular relevance in the United States, where academic institutions have an enhanced (though nonetheless constrained) legal capability to deal with academics in countries such as North Korea where many other modes of cooperation might be nearly impossible. When properly administered, science diplomacy can leverage the global credibility of U.S. science to provide an important mechanism for supporting more traditional diplomatic relationships.<br />
Science and Diplomacy<br />
There are many, often incompatible, definitions of diplomacy and related terms such as cultural diplomacy, science diplomacy, and public diplomacy. Although these definitional differences are interesting and have scholarly consequence, a systematic treatment of them is beyond the scope of this paper. For our present purpose, diplomacy can be understood as engagements that include, but need not be limited to, the intent to enhance cooperative relations between the participating parties. In this paper we are interested in a particular kind of diplomacy?that which involves the building of robust trusted engagement between science entities in countries where there are minimal offi cial diplomatic relations.<br />
Prior to getting to the case, however, we want to make a few more general points regarding science diplomacy and how it relates to more traditional forms of diplomacy. In its strictest sense, international diplomacy refers to negotiations among offi cial representatives of nations. However, the science and technology of a nation are an important factor that can influence foreign publics? views on the nation. For example, the Pew Global Attitudes Project showed in 2002 that people around the world have high admiration for U.S. science and technology despite their rejection of ?Americanism,? such as the diffusion of U.S. ideas and customs.1<br />
Historically, science engagement helped countries with minimal official diplomatic relations build mutual trust. Examples include U.S. civilian scientifi c exchanges with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, U.S.-Japan science and technology cooperation in the 1960s, and the U.S.-China Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology in 1979.2 However, the issues can become especially complex in this case.<br />

North Korean conflict causes extinction<br />
Africa News ?99, (10-25, Lexis)<br />
If there is one place today where the much-dreaded Third World War could easily erupt and probably reduce earth to a huge smouldering cinder it is the Korean Peninsula in Far East Asia. Ever since the end of the savage three-year Korean war in the early 1950s, military tension between the hard-line communist north and the American backed South Korea has remained dangerously high. In fact the Koreas are technically still at war. A foreign visitor to either Pyongyong in the North or Seoul in South Korea will quickly notice that the divided country is always on maximum alert for any eventuality. North Korea or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has never forgiven the US for coming to the aid of South Korea during the Korean war. She still regards the US as an occupation force in South Korea and wholly to blame for the non-reunification of the country. North Korean media constantly churns out a tirade of attacks on &quot;imperialist&quot; America and its &quot;running dog&quot; South Korea. The DPRK is one of the most secretive countries in the world where a visitor is given the impression that the people's hatred for the US is absolute while the love for their government is total. Whether this is really so, it is extremely difficult to conclude. In the DPRK, a visitor is never given a chance to speak to ordinary Koreans about the politics of their country. No visitor moves around alone without government escort. The American government argues that its presence in South Korea was because of the constant danger of an invasion from the north. America has vast economic interests in South Korea. She points out that the north has dug numerous tunnels along the demilitarised zone as part of the invasion plans. She also accuses the north of violating South Korean territorial waters. Early this year, a small North Korean submarine was caught in South Korean waters after getting entangled in fishing nets. Both the Americans and South Koreans claim the submarine was on a military spying mission. However, the intension of the alleged intrusion will probably never be known because the craft's crew were all found with fatal gunshot wounds to their heads in what has been described as suicide pact to hide the truth of the mission. The US mistrust of the north's intentions is so deep that it is no secret that today Washington has the largest concentration of soldiers and weaponry of all descriptions in south Korea than anywhere else in the World, apart from America itself. Some of the armada that was deployed in the recent bombing of Iraq and in Operation Desert Storm against the same country following its invasion of Kuwait was from the fleet permanently stationed on the Korean Peninsula. It is true too that at the moment the North/South Korean border is the most fortified in the world. The border line is littered with anti-tank and anti-personnel landmines, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles and is constantly patrolled by warplanes from both sides. It is common knowledge that America also keeps an eye on any military movement or build-up in the north through spy satellites. The DPRK is said to have an estimated one million soldiers and a huge arsenal of various weapons. Although the DPRK regards herself as a developing country, she can however be classified as a super-power in terms of military might. The DPRK is capable of producing medium and long-range missiles. Last year, for example, she test-fired a medium range missile over Japan, an action that greatly shook and alarmed the US, Japan and South Korea. The DPRK says the projectile was a satellite. There have also been fears that she was planning to test another ballistic missile capable of reaching North America. Naturally, the world is anxious that military tension on the Korean Peninsula must be defused to avoid an apocalypse on earth. It is therefore significant that the American government announced a few days ago that it was moving towards normalising relations with North Korea.<br />

Even minor conflict would cause nuclear exchange<br />
Landay 2k [Jonathan S., national security and intelligence correspondent, March 10, 2k, Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Lexis]<br />
The 3,700-mile arc that begins at the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea and ends on the glacier where Indian and Pakistani troops skirmish almost every day has earned the dubious title of most dangerous part of the world. Few if any experts think China and Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea, or India and Pakistan are spoiling to fight. But even a minor miscalculation by any of them could destabilize Asia, jolt the global economy and even start a nuclear war. India, Pakistan and China all have nuclear weapons, and North Korea may have a few, too. Asia lacks the kinds of organizations, negotiations and diplomatic relationships that helped keep an uneasy peace for five decades in Cold War Europe. &quot;Nowhere else on Earth are the stakes as high and relationships so fragile,&quot; said Bates Gill, director of northeast Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. &quot;We see the convergence of great power interest overlaid with lingering confrontations with no institutionalized security mechanism in place. There are elements for potential disaster.&quot; In an effort to cool the region's tempers, President Clinton, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger all will hopscotch Asia's capitals this month. For America, the stakes could hardly be higher. There are 100,000 U.S. troops in Asia committed to defending Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and the United States would instantly become embroiled if Beijing moved against Taiwan or North Korea attacked South Korea. While Washington has no defense commitments to either India or Pakistan, a conflict between the two could end the global taboo against using nuclear weapons and demolish the already shaky international nonproliferation regime.<br />

And, US needs to exercise more leadership by increasing visas to effectively solve global problems including conflict, warming, disease, malnutrition and ocean depletion<br />

More opportunities needed for U.S. researchers to work with foreign counterparts<br />
In 1979, a science and technology agreement between the United States and China paved the way for bilateral scientific cooperation that continues to benefit American science and society more broadly. Now, science diplomacy may help America open a door toward improved relations with Pyongyang, too. In December, six Americans representing leading scientific organizations sat down with their North Korean counterparts. The meeting took place on the heels of U.S. Special Envoy Stephen Bosworth's first official bilateral meeting with North Korea. Science, an international enterprise that relies on a lively exchange of ideas and data, can help build trust and expand understanding when government-to-government contacts may be strained. The North Korea visit, plus the first-ever U.S. science envoys, represent a fine beginning to a new era of international research cooperation. But the White House, the State Department and Congress must do far more to bolster science diplomacy. In particular, the U.S. government should quickly and significantly increase the number of H1-B visas being approved for specialized foreign workers such as doctors, scientists and engineers. Their contributions are critical to improving human welfare as well as our economy. Foreign scientists working or studying in U.S. universities also become informal goodwill ambassadors for America globally -- an important benefit in the developing world, where senior scientists and engineers often enter national politics. More broadly, we urgently need to expand and deepen links between the U.S. and foreign scientific communities to advance solutions to common challenges. Climate change, sustainable development, pandemic disease, malnutrition, protection for oceans and wildlife, national security and innovative energy technologies all demand solutions that draw on science and technology. Fortunately, U.S. technological leadership is admired worldwide, suggesting a way to promote dialogue with countries where we otherwise lack access and leverage. A June 2004 Zogby International poll commissioned by the Arab American Institute found that only 11 percent of Moroccans surveyed had a favorable overall view of the United States -- but 90 percent had a positive view of U.S. science and technology. Only 15 percent of Jordanians had a positive overall view, but 83 percent registered admiration for U.S. science and technology. Similarly, Pew polling data from 43 countries show that favorable views of U.S. science and technology exceed overall views of the United States by an average of 23 points. The recent mission to North Korea exemplified the vast potential of science for U.S. diplomacy. Within the scientific community, after all, journals routinely publish articles co-written by scientists from different nations, and scholars convene frequent conferences to extend those ties. Science demands an intellectually honest atmosphere, peer review and a common language for professional discourse. Basic values of transparency, vigorous inquiry and respectful debate are all inherent to science. Nations that cooperate on science strengthen the same values that support peaceful conflict resolution and improved public safety. U.S. and Soviet nongovernmental organizations contributed to a thaw in the Cold War through scientific exchanges, with little government support other than travel visas. The U.S. government is off to a good start in leveraging science diplomacy, with 43 bilateral umbrella science and technology agreements now in force. The Obama administration further elevated science engagement, beginning with the president's June speech in Cairo. Then, in November, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appointed three science envoys to foster new partnerships and address common challenges, especially within Muslim-majority countries. She also announced the Global Technology and Innovation Fund, through which the Overseas Private Investment Corporation will spur private-sector investments in science and technology industries abroad. These steps are commendable, but the White House and the State Department need to exercise even greater leadership to build government capacity and partnerships that advance U.S. science diplomacy globally. Congress should lead as well, with greater recognition of science engagement and increased funding for science capacity-building. Both chambers must work together to give the executive branch the resources it needs. In an era of complex global challenges, science diplomacy is a critical tool for U.S. foreign policy. The opportunity to strengthen that tool and advance our diplomatic goals should not be missed.<br />

Pandemic disease causes extinction<br />
Trucksess, 03 [Chris ? Swarthmore College of Environmental Population growth requires technological improvements to maintain quality of life&quot; Studies, ?Population growth requires technological improvements to maintain quality of life?] <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~ENVS2/S2003/ctrucks1/essay04.html" rel="nofollow">http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~ENVS2/S2003/ctrucks1/essay04.html</a><br />
<br />
A virus can only spread if it can find someone else to infect before it kills the carrier. A fatal disease that leads to death after a long period of time increases the chance that the carrier can infect other people, in turn bringing population closer to extinction. In terms of transportation, if people and goods in the world are too well connected, then a fatal disease that has the potential to lead to extinction would be able to infect many people over large area since the disease can spread quickly over trade routes. The World Health Organization has found that the current spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS is facilitated by international travel and can quickly infect many people around the world. Originating in Southeast Asia, speedy transportation has turned SARS from a regional problem into an international issue (World Health Organization, 2003). To avoid the risk of mass deaths due to rapidly spreading diseases, international policymakers need to avoid the creation of a level of world interconnectedness that is too quick. A slightly disconnected world may mean goods may not reach all places where in demand, but the risk of fatal diseases affecting large regions of population would be less. The ideal model of resource distribution is to have necessities be located near areas of population. Localized resources would reduce the need for goods to travel long distances over a lengthened period of time to avoid the spread of disease. Increased levels of population could live well off of added amounts of food that are nearby. This best case of locating populations near resources would be difficult to obtain in practice as resources and populations are already in fixed locations. If people were unwilling to move near where food is available it would be difficult, except in times of war and famine, to force them to relocate. A compromise solution would accept the fact that not all people of the world will be able to have a high standard of living but the potential for improved quality exists. This potential cannot be reached immediately since resources and population remain geographically separate and faster transportation would increase the spread of fatal diseases. Improvements in resource production such as increased crop yields makes it possible to support higher populations and improve the quality of life at least at a local level.<br />

Food shortages cause World War III<br />
William H. Calvin, theoretical neurophysiologist at the University of Washington, January 1998, The Atlantic Monthly, v281 i1 pcover,47-50,52+, ?Great climate flip-flop,? infotrac<br />
The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands--if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem--and could lead to a Third World War--but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.<br />

Ocean collapse causes extinction<br />
Craig, 2003 [ Robin Kundis, associate professor of law at Indiana University School of Law, Winter, McGeorge Law Review, 34 McGeorge L. Rev. 155, p. 265-266]<br />
Biodiversity and ecosystem function arguments for conserving marine ecosystems also exist, just as they do for terrestrial ecosystems, but these arguments have thus far rarely been raised in political debates. For example, besides significant tourism values - the most economically valuable ecosystem service coral reefs provide, worldwide - coral reefs protect against storms and dampen other environmental fluctuations, services worth more than ten times the reefs? value for food production. Waste treatment is another significant, non-extractive ecosystem function that intact coral reef ecosystems provide. More generally, ?ocean ecosystems play a major role in the global geochemical cycling of all the elements that represent the basic building blocks of living organisms, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur, as well as other less abundant but necessary elements.? In a very real and direct sense, therefore, human degradation of marine ecosystems impairs the planet?s ability to support life. Maintaining biodiversity is often critical to maintaining the functions of marine ecosystems. Current evidence shows that, in general, an ecosystem?s ability to keep functioning in the face of disturbance is strongly dependent on its biodiversity, ?indicating that more diverse ecosystems are more stable.? Coral reef ecosystems are particularly dependent on their biodiversity. Most ecologists agree that the complexity of interactions and degree of interrelatedness among component species is higher on coral reefs than in any other marine environment. This implies that the ecosystem functioning that produces the most highly valued components is also complex and that many otherwise insignificant species have strong effects on sustaining the rest of the reef system. Thus, maintaining and restoring the biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to maintaining and restoring the ecosystem services that they provide. Non-use biodiversity values for marine ecosystems have been calculated in the wake of marine disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. Similar calculations could derive preservation values for marine wilderness. However, economic value, or economic value equivalents, should not be ?the sole or even primary justification for conservation of ocean ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have considerable force and merit.? At the forefront of such arguments should be a recognition of how little we know about the sea - and about the actual effect of human activities on marine ecosystems. The United States has traditionally failed to protect marine ecosystems because it was difficult to detect anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now know that such harm is occurring - even though we are not completely sure about causation or about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like the NWHI coral reef ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers to admit that most of the time we really do not know what we are doing to the sea and hence should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we can - especially when the United States has within its territory relatively pristine marine ecosystems that may be unique in the world. We may not know much about the sea, but we do know this much: if we kill the ocean we kill ourselves, and we will take most of the biosphere with us.<br />

Raymond Spencer, an Australian-born entrepreneur based in Chicago, has a window on the future?and a gusto for investing after founding a high-technology consulting company that sold for more than $1 billion in 2006. ?I have investments in maybe 10 start-ups, all of which fall within a broad umbrella of a ?green? theme,? he said. ?And it?s interesting, the vast majority are either led by immigrants or have key technical people who are immigrants.? It should come as no surprise that immigrants will help drive the green revolution. America?s young scientists and engineers, especially the ones drawn to emerging industries like alternative energy, tend to speak with an accent. The 2000 Census found that immigrants, while accounting for 12 percent of the population, made up nearly half of the all scientists and engineers with doctorate degrees. Their importance will only grow. Nearly 70 percent of the men and women who entered the fields of science and engineering from 1995 to 2006 were immigrants. Yet, the connection between immigration and the development and commercialization of alternative energy technology is rarely discussed. Policymakers envision millions of new jobs as the nation pursues renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power, and builds a smart grid to tap it. But Dan Arvizu, the leading expert on solar power and the director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy in Golden, Colorado, warns that much of the clean-technology talent lies overseas, in nations that began pursuing alternative energy sources decades ago. Expanding our own clean-tech industry will require working closely with foreign nations and foreign-born scientists, he said. Immigration restrictions are making collaboration difficult. His lab?s efforts to work with a Chinese energy lab, for example, were stalled due to U.S. immigration barriers. ?We can?t get researchers over here,? Arvizu, the son of a once-undocumented immigrant from Mexico, said in an interview in March 2009, his voice tinged with dismay. ?It makes no sense to me. We need a much more enlightened approach.? Dr. Zhao Gang, the Vice Director of the Renewable Energy and New Energy International Cooperation Planning Office of the Ministry of Science and Technology in China, says that America needs that enlightenment fast. ?The Chinese government continues to impress upon the Obama administration that immigration restrictions are creating major impediments to U.S.-China collaboration on clean energy development,? he said during a recent speech in Cleveland. So what?s the problem? Some of it can be attributed to national security restrictions that impede international collaboration on clean energy. But Arvizu places greater weight on immigration barriers, suggesting that national secrecy is less important in the fast-paced world of green-tech development. ?We are innovating so fast here, what we do today is often outdated tomorrow. Finding solutions to alternative energy is a complex, global problem that requires global teamwork,? he said. We need an immigration system that prioritizes the attraction and retention of scarce, high-end talent needed to invent and commercialize alternative energy technology and other emerging technologies. One idea we floated by Arvizu was a new immigrant ?Energy Scientist Visa,? providing fast-track green cards for Ph.D.s with the most promising energy research, as reviewed by a panel of top U.S. scientists. Arvizu enthusiastically responded, ?Wow, that?s a brilliant idea.? As the recent submission of the Startup Visa Act bill suggests, there?s really no shortage of good ideas of leveraging immigration to jumpstart the economy. The challenge is getting the American people to understand that high-skill immigration creates jobs, that the current system is broken, and that action is required now. Suffering an Antiquated System ? While unlimited H1-B visas are available to foreign workers at U.S. government and university research labs, the antiquated green-card system creates a disincentive for immigrant researchers who seek a more permanent stay and status in the U.S. Anyone coming to America from a foreign land experiences the U.S. immigration system. They seldom forget the experience. This vast bureaucracy, with tentacles reaching into myriad federal agencies, wields enormous power over the lives of people trying to follow its directives. Federal immigration authorities decide if a persecuted family can escape Congo, if a prospective college student from Germany will start the school year on time in Cleveland, or if a Honduran family separated for years will be reunited in Miami. U.S. immigration law dictates who can enter America and how long they can stay. Congress can enact new immigration policies as it deems fit?and it did so in 1986 and in 1990. But the foundation of the system remains the Federal Immigration and Nationality Acts of 1965 and 1952. The 1965 act diversified America by opening immigration to new parts of the world, but it also levied restrictions that soon become dated and counterproductive. In a manufacturing era, the act made family reunification an overarching goal, while paying relatively little attention to the migration of highly skilled workers. In fact, it imposed rigid nationality quotas on skilled immigrants. The result, critics say, is a dinosaur of a system ill-equipped to deal with the demands of a fast-changing, global economy.] ?Our immigration laws discriminate pretty heavily against highly talented scientists and engineers who want to come to this country and be part of our technological establishment,? Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told a Congressional panel in May 2009. Of particular concern to employers and economists are two sets of quotas: one that limits the number of visas available to skilled workers, and another that limits the visas available to a nationality. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) issues about 1 million green cards per year. Also known as immigrant visas, green cards bestow permanent residency, or the right to live and work permanently in America. A green card puts one on the path to citizenship. In a typical year, the vast majority of green cards go to people sponsored by a family member already here. There is no limit to the numbers of green cards that can be issued to the spouses, parents, and unmarried children of naturalized U.S. citizens. America accepts far fewer people whose main reason for coming is to practice a profession, to pursue science, or to start a company?even if that person possesses extraordinary ability. The government is restricted by law to issuing 140,000 employment or skill-based green cards each year to applicants and their immediate family members. That?s about 15 percent of the immigrant visa pool. A chunk of green cards are set aside for religious workers and wealthy investors, so the United States actually offers 120,000 employment-based green cards each year. Within the employment visa categories, known as EB visas, are several subcategories that acknowledge skill levels. For example, 40,000 visas are designated for persons of extraordinary ability?outstanding professors, researchers, and multinational executives. Another 40,000 visas are designated for professionals with advanced academic degrees whose work will serve U.S. national interests. And another 10,000 visas are available for wealthy people who commit to investing in a U.S. enterprise and creating jobs. So, out of 1 million green cards issued in an average year, 90,000, or about 9 percent, are reserved for persons with advanced degrees, exceptional skills, or capital to create jobs. Put another way, about 9 percent of immigrant visas are reserved for high-skill immigrants?the people driving the New Economy. It?s a scant amount in the context of a U.S. labor force of 154 million people. Should those exceptional immigrants hail from a nation whose workers are in high demand?for example, India and China?they face delays imposed by a nationality quota system. The 1965 immigration law sets per-country limits on employment visas. People from any one nation cannot use more than 7 percent of the visas available that year. This means that workers from large sending countries are forced to wait, sometimes more than 8 years, because their visa allotment has been ?oversubscribed? by their fellow citizens. The 7 percent quota applies equally to every nation on Earth, regardless of its size or the potential number of immigrants it sends to America. For example, Malawi, which has a population of 10.5 million people, is allocated the same amount of employment visas as India, which has a population of over 1 billion. In any given year, only 5,600 green cards are reserved for Indians with advanced academic degrees or extraordinary ability, the same number available to nationals of Malawi. Congress has sought to circumvent the quotas and respond to industry demands?especially in high technology?with guest worker visas like the H1-B, a source of some controversy. The H-1B is a temporary visa for a professional offered a job by a U.S. company that agrees to pay the prevailing market wage. Only 65,000 regular H-1B visas are available each year, a quota set in the early 1990s and temporarily increased to 195,000 from 2001 to 2003. Many employers say the cap is set too low to meet their needs, especially as they seek to staff engineering and software positions. Some lawmakers would like to help them with a higher quota. These skilled immigrants often come to America as students, then go to work in growing industries. A 2008 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that for each worker hired on an H-1B visa, at least five new jobs were created. But many labor groups argue that the cap is already set too high. Only a bachelor?s degree is required to qualify for this visa, and critics charge the H-1B visas crowd skilled Americans out of the workplace, suppress wages, and make it easier for employers to outsource jobs to low-cost countries like India. Even immigrant advocates criticize the H-1B as a second-class visa that produces an anxious life. Tied to their employers, the guest workers cannot switch jobs unless their new employer is willing to sponsor their visa, and their spouses are not allowed to work. The three-year visa can be renewed once. But after six years, the visa holder must go home unless he or she is able to get a green-card sponsor. The national-origin quotas, coupled with a limit of 90,000 immigrant visas reserved for highly skilled professionals or investors, helps to explain why so many talented immigrants?many of them H-1B visa holders?wait in vain for permission to live and work in America. Many are now leaving the U.S., or simply not coming to study or work on an H1B. After revealing the high-skill visa backlog in 2007, Vivek Wadhwa and his researchers at Duke University began to examine the impact. With the support of the Kauffman Foundation, they surveyed about 1,200 Chinese and Indian professionals who had studied or worked in America and returned home. The returnees were an impressive bunch, overwhelmingly young, smart, and ambitious, as described in the March 2009 report, ?America?s Loss is the World?s Gain.? Nearly 90 percent held master?s or doctorate degrees. Many said they expected to start their own companies. Homesickness was common among the immigrants who went back, and many expressed frustration with the U.S. immigration system. But even more said the home country suddenly offered good jobs and bright career prospects. That is the new reality that demands a response, Wadhwa argues. Foreign-born mathematicians, engineers, and chemists can now find world-class companies in Bangalore, Beijing, Tel Aviv, Seoul, and Singapore. With high-tech opportunities blossoming elsewhere, and anti-immigrant attitudes hardening in America, Wadhwa said his adopted homeland faces a crisis. ?The United States is no longer the only place where talented people can put their skills to work,? he writes. ?It can no longer expect them to endure the indignities and inefficiencies of an indifferent immigration system, and it must now actively compete to attract these people with good jobs, security and other amenities.? The competition is heating up. In an earlier study, Wadhwa pointed out that most high-skilled immigrants obtained their primary education before coming to America, meaning that the United States inherited the benefits of schooling that was paid for elsewhere. Some countries are looking to recoup that investment and attract their diasporas back home. Alberta, Canada, sensing an opportunity to snatch talent from America, is sending recruiting teams to U.S. cities to lure disgruntled foreign professional workers on temporary H-1B visas. The province is offering expedited permanent-residency cards and quicker pathways to entrepreneurship. Many researchers believe these immigrant-attraction strategies will show results. ?The reality of the global economy is that employers and their capital will follow the talent?wherever that talent is permitted to work and flourish,? Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, wrote in 2007. ?While members of Congress often talk about ?protecting? American jobs, those who persist in pursuing restriction on hiring skilled foreign nationals unfortunately are inhibiting creation and innovation in the United States.? In 2007, Microsoft opened up a research and development facility in Vancouver, Canada, just over the border from its Seattle headquarters. Microsoft defended its decision by citing U.S. immigration restrictions on high-skilled talent. Perhaps no country understands better the role of foreign talent in creating jobs for its people than Singapore. In July 2008, Singapore?s Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, declared that Singapore must be open to foreign talent to achieve a ?critical mass? for innovation and entrepreneurship. Even with the global recession in full swing, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng announced that restricting the entry of high-skill immigrants would be ?short sighted? and ?could ultimately lead to more job losses for Singaporeans.? America loses more than innovation if newly minted graduates go elsewhere; it loses tax dollars. A 2009 report by the respected Technology Policy Institute found that immigration restrictions cost billions in lost opportunity, taxes, and wages. The institute concluded that legislation considered by Congress to loosen green-card and H-1B visa restrictions could reduce the federal deficit on the order of $100 billion across 10 years. In short, fantastic opportunities are being lost as high-skill immigrants are steered elsewhere. We need to polish our welcome. For starters, Wadhwa argues, the United States could reduce the huge backlog of visa requests simply by making more visas available to skilled immigrants and by accelerating the processing times. His is one voice in a growing chorus that hopes to wrest the spotlight from illegal immigration and illuminate the larger wave, its potential, and the consequences of inaction. But the academic studies, while critically important, do not seem to cut through the noise and connect with the American people. The American people are not demanding high-skill immigration reform. They don?t see it as a job-creation opportunity. The word ?immigrant? almost automatically summons an angry response that immigrants ?take jobs.? Something else is needed. Time for a New Narrative ? Stories connect us to each other. Drawing from the same well of human aspiration, triumph and failure, our personal stories create an emotional bond that transforms strangers into familiar faces. As America once again struggles with the question of whether and how to welcome the immigrant stranger, the telling of new immigrant stories is needed to help heal the chasm between ?us? and ?them,? and between our personal immigrant past and our nation?s immigrant present and future. During this Great Recession, with unemployment near 10%, the immigration narrative also needs to offer hope for Americans?hope that tomorrow will be better. Hope today comes in the form of good old American jobs. We have been told that maybe 4 million blue and white-collar jobs may be created by advances in alternative energy technology, and that wind, solar, thermal, and other sources of energy will move us closer to energy independence, greater national security and a healthier planet. But so far, we haven?t been that interested in asking the question, ?who will create and commercialize this new green technology? Much like the role that immigrants played, in partnership with American-born colleagues, in the information technology revolution and the elevation of Silicon Valley to almost mythical status, immigrants are now emerging as key drivers of America?s quest for world-class clean energy technology. A glance at recent research on the contributions of immigrants supports the expectation that immigrants are helping to lead the green economy and other emerging industries: Immigrants are nearly twice as likely as native-born Americans to start a business. Immigrants are filing patents at twice the rate of the American-born. Immigrants founded more than half of the high-tech companies in Silicon Valley. Immigrants are much more likely to earn an advanced degree than the native-born. (Continued??. (Feel Free to ask for the deleted text) Throughout Michigan and the Midwest, civic and union leaders cheered the made-in-America strategy. U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan told the national media that a company founded by immigrants was moving the country in the right direction. ?We need a twenty-first century manufacturing strategy in this country,? she said. ?Companies like A1234 are not only creating quality, good-paying jobs in Michigan, but are insuring that we do not move from a dependence on foreign oil to a dependence on foreign technology.? John Dingell, a member of Congress from Michigan, called the A123-Chrysler partnership momentous on two levels. ?The future of this country is dependent upon addressing two vital challenges?stopping the spread of global warming, and creating the next generation of manufacturing jobs here in the United States,? he said. ?This project gets us closer to achieving both of those goals.?<br />

And, we must act now?most recent scientific consensus shows CO2 is the main cause of warming and costs MASSIVELY outweigh the benefits<br />
Environmental Defense Fund, a US-based nonprofit environmental advocacy group, ?Global Warming Myths and Facts,? 1/13/2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mrgreenbiz.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/global-warming-myths-and-facts-2/" rel="nofollow">http://mrgreenbiz.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/global-warming-myths-and-facts-2/</a><br />
There is no debate among scientists about the basic facts of global warming. The most respected scientific bodies have stated unequivocally that global warming is occurring, and people are causing it by burning fossil fuels (like coal, oil and natural gas) and cutting down forests. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, which in 2005 the White House called &quot;the gold standard of objective scientific assessment,&quot; issued a joint statement with 10 other National Academies of Science saying &quot;the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action. It is vital that all nations identify cost-effective steps that they can take now, to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions.&quot; (Joint Statement of Science Academies: Global Response to Climate Change [PDF], 2005) The only debate in the science community about global warming is about how much and how fast warming will continue as a result of heat-trapping emissions. Scientists have given a clear warning about global warming, and we have more than enough facts ? about causes and fixes ? to implement solutions right now. MYTH Even if global warming is a problem, addressing it will hurt American industry and workers. FACT A well designed trading program will harness American ingenuity to decrease heat-trapping pollution cost-effectively, jumpstarting a new carbon economy. Claims that fighting global warming will cripple the economy and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs are unfounded. In fact, companies that are already reducing their heat-trapping emissions have discovered that cutting pollution can save money. The cost of a comprehensive national greenhouse gas reduction program will depend on the precise emissions targets, the timing for the reductions and the means of implementation. An independent MIT study found that a modest cap-and-trade system would cost less than $20 per household annually and have no negative impact on employment. Experience has shown that properly designed emissions trading programs can reduce compliance costs significantly compared with other regulatory approaches. For example, the U.S. acid rain program reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 30 percent from 1990 levels and cost industry a fraction of what the government originally estimated, according to EPA. Furthermore, a mandatory cap on emissions could spur technological innovation that could create jobs and wealth. Letting global warming continue until we are forced to address it on an emergency basis could disrupt and severely damage our economy. It is far wiser and more cost-effective to act now. MYTH Water vapor is the most important, abundant greenhouse gas. So if we?re going to control a greenhouse gas, why don?t we control it instead of carbon dioxide (CO2)? FACT Although water vapor traps more heat than CO2, because of the relationships among CO2, water vapor and climate, to fight global warming nations must focus on controlling CO2. Atmospheric levels of CO2 are determined by how much coal, natural gas and oil we burn and how many trees we cut down, as well as by natural processes like plant growth. Atmospheric levels of water vapor, on the other hand, cannot be directly controlled by people; rather, they are determined by temperatures. The warmer the atmosphere, the more water vapor it can hold. As a result, water vapor is part of an amplifying effect. Greenhouse gases like CO2 warm the air, which in turn adds to the stock of water vapor, which in turn traps more heat and accelerates warming. Scientists know this because of satellite measurements documenting a rise in water vapor concentrations as the globe has warmed. The best way to lower temperature and thus reduce water vapor levels is to reduce CO2 emissions. MYTH Global warming and extra CO2 will actually be beneficial ? they reduce cold-related deaths and stimulate crop growth. FACT Any beneficial effects will be far outweighed by damage and disruption. Even a warming in just the middle range of scientific projections would have devastating impacts on many sectors of the economy. Rising seas would inundate coastal communities, contaminate water supplies with salt and increase the risk of flooding by storm surge, affecting tens of millions of people globally. Moreover, extreme weather events, including heat waves, droughts and floods, are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity, causing loss of lives and property and throwing agriculture into turmoil. Even though higher levels of CO2 can act as a plant fertilizer under some conditions, scientists now think that the &quot;CO2 fertilization&quot; effect on crops has been overstated; in natural ecosystems, the fertilization effect can diminish after a few years as plants acclimate. Furthermore, increased CO2 may benefit undesirable, weedy species more than desirable species. Higher levels of CO2 have already caused ocean acidification, and scientists are warning of potentially devastating effects on marine life and fisheries. Moreover, higher levels of regional ozone (smog), a result of warmer temperatures, could worsen respiratory illnesses. Less developed countries and natural ecosystems may not have the capacity to adapt. The notion that there will be regional ?winners? and ?losers? in global warming is based on a world-view from the 1950?s. We live in a global community. Never mind the moral implications ? when an environmental catastrophe creates millions of refugees half-way around the world, Americans are affected. MYTH Global warming is just part of a natural cycle. The Arctic has warmed up in the past. FACT The global warming we are experiencing is not natural. People are causing it. People are causing global warming by burning fossil fuels (like oil, coal and natural gas) and cutting down forests. Scientists have shown that these activities are pumping far more CO2 into the atmosphere than was ever released in hundreds of thousands of years. This buildup of CO2 is the biggest cause of global warming. Since 1895, scientists have known that CO2 and other greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the earth. As the warming has intensified over the past three decades, scientific scrutiny has increased along with it. Scientists have considered and ruled out other, natural explanations such as sunlight, volcanic eruptions and cosmic rays. (IPCC 2001) Though natural amounts of CO2 have varied from 180 to 300 parts per million (ppm), today's CO2 levels are around 380 ppm. That's 25% more than the highest natural levels over the past 650,000 years. Increased CO2 levels have contributed to periods of higher average temperatures throughout that long record. (Boden, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center) As for previous Arctic warming, it is true that there were stretches of warm periods over the Arctic earlier in the 20th century. The limited records available for that time period indicate that the warmth did not affect as many areas or persist from year to year as much as the current warmth. But that episode, however warm it was, is not relevant to the issue at hand. Why? For one, a brief regional trend does not discount a longer global phenomenon. We know that the planet has been warming over the past several decades and Arctic ice has been melting persistently. And unlike the earlier periods of Arctic warmth, there is no expectation that the current upward trend in Arctic temperatures will reverse; the rising concentrations of greenhouse gases will prevent that from happening. MYTH We can adapt to climate change ? civilization has survived droughts and temperature shifts before. FACT Although humans as a whole have survived the vagaries of drought, stretches of warmth and cold and more, entire societies have collapsed from dramatic climatic shifts. The current warming of our climate will bring major hardships and economic dislocations ? untold human suffering, especially for our children and grandchildren. We are already seeing significant costs from today's global warming which is caused by greenhouse gas pollution. Climate has changed in the past and human societies have survived, but today six billion people depend on interconnected ecosystems and complex technological infrastructure. What's more, unless we limit the amount of heat-trapping gases we are putting into the atmosphere, we will face a warming trend unseen since human civilization began 10,000 years ago. (IPCC 2001) The consequences of continued warming at current rates are likely to be dire. Many densely populated areas, such as low-lying coastal regions, are highly vulnerable to climate shifts. A middle-of-the-range projection is that the homes of 13 to 88 million people around the world would be flooded by the sea each year in the 2080s. Poorer countries and small island nations will have the hardest time adapting. (McLean et al. 2001) In what appears to be the first forced move resulting from climate change, 100 residents of Tegua island in the Pacific Ocean were evacuated by the government because rising sea levels were flooding their island. Some 2,000 other islanders plan a similar move to escape rising waters. In the United States, the village of Shishmaref in Alaska, which has been inhabited for 400 years, is collapsing from melting permafrost. Relocation plans are in the works. &lt;continues?&gt;<br />
Scarcity of water and food could lead to major conflicts with broad ripple effects throughout the globe. Even if people find a way to adapt, the wildlife and plants on which we depend may be unable to adapt to rapid climate change. While the world itself will not end, the world as we know it may disappear. MYTH Recent cold winters and cool summers don?t feel like global warming to me. FACT While different pockets of the country have experienced some cold winters here and there, the overall trend is warmer winters. Measurements show that over the last century the Earth?s climate has warmed overall, in all seasons, and in most regions. Climate skeptics mislead the public when they claim that the winter of 2003?2004 was the coldest ever in the northeastern United States. That winter was only the 33rd coldest in the region since records began in 1896. Furthermore, a single year of cold weather in one region of the globe is not an indication of a trend in the global climate, which refers to a long-term average over the entire planet. MYTH Global warming can?t be happening because some glaciers and ice sheets are growing, not shrinking. FACT In most parts of the world, the retreat of glaciers has been dramatic. The best available scientific data indicate that Greenland's massive ice sheet is shrinking. Between 1961 and 1997, the world?s glaciers lost 890 cubic miles of ice. The consensus among scientists is that rising air temperatures are the most important factor behind the retreat of glaciers on a global scale over long time periods. Some glaciers in western Norway, Iceland and New Zealand have been expanding during the past few decades. That expansion is a result of regional increases in storm frequency and snowfall rather than colder temperatures ? not at all incompatible with a global warming trend. In Greenland, a NASA satellite that can measure the ice mass over the whole continent has found that although there is variation from month to month, over the longer term, the ice is disappearing. In fact, there are worrisome signs that melting is accelerating: glaciers are moving into the ocean twice as fast as a decade ago, and, over time, more and more glaciers have started to accelerate. What is most alarming is the prediction, based on model calculations and historical evidence, that an approximately 5.4 degree Fahrenheit increase in local Greenland temperatures will lead to irreversible meltdown and a sea-level rise of over 20 feet. Since the Arctic is warming 2-3 times faster than the global average, this tipping point is not far away. The only study that has shown increasing ice mass in Greenland only looked at the interior of the ice sheet, not at the edges where melting occurs. This is actually in line with climate model predictions that global warming would lead to a short-term accumulation of ice in the cold interior due to heavier snowfall. (Similarly, scientists have predicted that Antarctica overall will gain ice in the near future due to heavier snowfall.) The scientists who published the study were careful to point out that their results should not be used to conclude that Greenland's ice mass as a whole is growing. In addition, their data suggested that the accumulation of snow in the middle of the continent is likely to decrease over time as global warming continues. MYTH Accurate weather predictions a few days in advance are hard to come by. Why on earth should we have confidence in climate projections decades from now? FACT Climate prediction is fundamentally different from weather prediction, just as climate is different from weather. It is often more difficult to make an accurate weather forecast than a climate prediction. The accuracy of weather forecasting is critically dependent upon being able to exactly and comprehensively characterize the present state of the global atmosphere. Climate prediction relies on other, longer ranging factors. For instance, we might not know if it will be below freezing on a specific December day in New England, but we know from our understanding of the region's climate that the temperatures during the month will generally be low. Similarly, climate tells us that Seattle and London tend to be rainy, Florida and southern California are usually warm, and the Southwest is often dry and hot. Today?s climate models can now reproduce the observed global average climates over the past century and beyond. Such findings have reinforced scientist?s confidence in the capacity of models to produce reliable projections of future climate. Current climate assessments typically consider the results from a range of models and scenarios for future heat-trapping emissions in order to identify the most likely range for future climatic change.<br />

Most recent studies show warming is speeding up? negative feedback and CO2 ag arguments are now empirically denied.<br />
Kari Lyderson, Washington Post, ?Scientists: Pace of Climate Change Exceeds Estimates,? 2/15/2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/14/AR2009021401757.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/14/AR2009021401757.html</a><br />
The pace of global warming is likely to be much faster than recent predictions, because industrial greenhouse gas emissions have increased more quickly than expected and higher temperatures are triggering self-reinforcing feedback mechanisms in global ecosystems, scientists said Saturday. &quot;We are basically looking now at a future climate that's beyond anything we've considered seriously in climate model simulations,&quot; Christopher Field, founding director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology at Stanford University, said at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Field, a member of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said emissions from burning fossil fuels since 2000 have largely outpaced the estimates used in the U.N. panel's 2007 reports. The higher emissions are largely the result of the increased burning of coal in developing countries, he said. Unexpectedly large amounts of carbon dioxide are being released into the atmosphere as the result of &quot;feedback loops&quot; that are speeding up natural processes. Prominent among these, evidence indicates, is a cycle in which higher temperatures are beginning to melt the arctic permafrost, which could release hundreds of billions of tons of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, said several scientists on a panel at the meeting. The permafrost holds 1 trillion tons of carbon, and as much as 10 percent of that could be released this century, Field said. Along with carbon dioxide melting permafrost releases methane, which is 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. &quot;It's a vicious cycle of feedback where warming causes the release of carbon from permafrost, which causes more warming, which causes more release from permafrost,&quot; Field said. Evidence is also accumulating that terrestrial and marine ecosystems cannot remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as earlier estimates suggested, Field said. In the oceans, warmer weather is driving stronger winds that are exposing deeper layers of water, which are already saturated with carbon and not as able to absorb as much from the atmosphere. The carbon is making the oceans more acidic, which also reduces their ability to absorb carbon. On land, rising carbon dioxide levels had been expected to boost plant growth and result in greater sequestration of carbon dioxide. As plants undergo photosynthesis to draw energy from the sun, carbon is drawn out of the atmosphere and trapped in the plant matter. But especially in northern latitudes, this effect may be offset significantly by the fact that vegetation-covered land absorbs much more of the sun's heat than snow-covered terrain, said scientists on the panel. Earlier snowmelt, the shrinking arctic ice cover and the northward spread of vegetation are causing the Northern Hemisphere to absorb, rather than reflect, more of the sun's energy and reinforce the warming trend. While it takes a relatively long time for plants to take carbon out of the atmosphere, that carbon can be released rapidly by wildfires, which contribute about a third as much carbon to the atmosphere as burning fossil fuels, according to a paper Field co-authored. Fires such as the recent deadly blazes in southern Australia have increased in recent years, and that trend is expected to continue, Field said. Warmer weather, earlier snowmelt, drought and beetle infestations facilitated by warmer climates are all contributing to the rising number of fires linked to climate change. Across large swaths of the United States and Canada, bark beetles have killed many mature trees, making forests more flammable. And tropical rain forests that were not susceptible to forest fires in the past are likely to become drier as temperatures rise, growing more vulnerable. Preventing deforestation in the tropics is more important than in northern latitudes, the panel agreed, since lush tropical forests sequester more carbon than sparser northern forests. And deforestation in northern areas has benefits, since larger areas end up covered in exposed, heat-reflecting snow. Many scientists and policymakers are advocating increased incentives for preserving tropical forests, especially in the face of demand for clearing forest to grow biofuel crops such as soy. Promoting biofuels without also creating forest-preservation incentives would be &quot;like weatherizing your house and deliberately keeping your windows open,&quot; said Peter Frumhoff, chief of the Union of Concerned Scientists' climate program. &quot;It's just not a smart policy.&quot; Field said the U.N. panel's next assessment of Earth's climate trends, scheduled for release in 2014, will for the first time incorporate policy proposals. It will also include complicated models of interconnected ecosystem feedbacks. The panel's last report noted that preliminary knowledge of such feedbacks suggested that an additional 100 billion to 500 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions would have to be prevented in the next century to avoid dangerous global warming. Currently, about 10 billion tons of carbon are emitted each year.<br />

In addition to supporting domestic job creation, clean energy is an important and fastest growing?international sector, and one where overseas policy can be used to support poor developing?regions ? such as Africa (Jacobsen and Kammen, 2007) and Central America ? as well as?regaining market share in solar, fuel cell and wind technologies, where European nations and?Japan have invested heavily and are reaping the benefits of month to year backlogs in clean?energy orders. Some of those orders are for U. S. installations, but many more could be if we?choose to make clean and green energy a national priority for both domestic installation and?overseas export. Technology exports have impacts well beyond domestic job creation. In fact, if properly?managed, the development of a thriving ?cleantech? sector can address a vital global issues,?namely the emissions trajectories of major developing nations. China and India are often singled?out for attention as major, emerging global emitters. China, in fact, will become the world?s?largest greenhouse emitter in the near future, if it has not already. This fact, is often used ??mistakenly in my view ? to argue against unilateral climate protection efforts by nations such as the United States. ?This view is shortsighted in two vital respects. First, China is demonstrably?already suffering from the impacts of fossil fuel use. Crop yields in many parts of China are?significantly lower than they would be without the significant sulfur and particulate burden that?results from domestic coal combustion. (In fact, coal combustions emissions from China have?significant air quality impacts on Japan, and can be measured in the U. S. as well.) Crop losses?of over 20% have been reported in part of China, with the decrease unambiguously linked to air?pollution. China also experiences significant human health impacts from this pollution burden as?well. Second, China has committed, on paper, to a ?circular economy? where waste is reduced and?overall productivity is enhanced. If the United States were to become a major exporter, or even a?partner, in the production of low-emissions technologies ? from truly carbon-capture coal-fired?power plants, to increased numbers of solar, wind, and biofuel technologies ? China would be an?eager trading partner, so that they could install increasing numbers of low-emissions?technologies. This would directly help the Chinese economy and their environmental and public?health situation. On both of these grounds, U. S. domestic expansion of the clean energy sector will likely positively impact the ability and the actions of a number of emerging economies to ?go green?.<br />

Warming outweighs all other concerns it?s the controlling impact<br />

(Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Vol. 64, No. 2)<br />
The larger question at hand for both developing and developed countries is whether the effects of climate change will exacerbate existing risks and conflicts or will lead to new ones. While much of the early research literature remains undecided on this question, several recent policy-oriented studies take a more pronounced position. In April 2007, the CNA Corporation, a U.S.-based think tank, and the Military Advisory Board, a blue-ribbon panel of retired admirals and generals, published a report on the connection between climate change and national security. The report resolutely identifies climate change as a ?threat multiplier of instability? that ?will seriously exacerbate already marginal living standards in many Asian, African, and Middle Eastern nations, causing widespread political instability and the likelihood of failed states.?19 Already fragile regions are susceptible to large-scale migrations, increased border tensions, the spread of disease, and conflicts over food and water, and could become breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism, the report finds. The threat could affect Americans at home, impact U.S. military operations, and heighten global tensions. The report recommends integrating climate change into U.S. national security strategy ?to help stabilize climate change at levels that will avoid significant disruption to global security and stability.?The findings of the CSIS panel, which included former CIA director James Woolsey and Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling, similarly concluded that global warming could ?destabilize virtually every aspect of modern life? and would likely breed new conflicts and magnify existing problems, from the desertification of Darfur and competition for water in the Middle East to the disruptive monsoons in Asia, all of which increase the pressure for land.20 As temperatures increase, so may the potential for conflict. A temperature rise of 1.3 degrees Celsius, which scientists expect by 2040, would heighten internal and cross-border tensions caused by large-scale migrations; spark conflict over resource scarcity; increase the spread of diseases; and reorder geopolitics as nations adjust to shifts in resources and prevalence of disease, according to the panel?s findings. Severe climate change, a temperature rise of 2.6 degrees Celsius by 2040, could induce massive nonlinear societal events, including a dramatic rise in migration; changes in agricultural patterns and water availability; the emergence of pandemic diseases; and the flooding of coastal communities around the world. Armed conflict between nations over resources is likely, and nuclear war is possible, according to the CSIS panel?s findings. An even higher temperature change ?would pose almost inconceivable challenges for human society.?<br />

Plus, it causes Extinction<br />

The ozone hole expands, driven by a monstrous synergy with global warming that puts more catalytic ice crystals into the stratosphere, but this affects the far north and south and not the major nations? heartlands. The seas rise, the tropics roast but the media networks no longer cover it. The Amazon rainforest becomes the Amazon desert. Oxygen levels fall, but profits rise for those who can provide it in bottles. An equatorial high pressure zone forms, forcing drought in central Africa and Brazil, the Nile dries up and the monsoons fail. Then inevitably, at some unlucky point in time, a major unexpected event occurs?a major volcanic eruption, a sudden and dramatic shift in ocean circulation or a large asteroid impact (those who think freakish accidents do not occur have paid little attention to life or Mars), or a nuclear war that starts between Pakistan and India and escalates to involve China and Russia . . . Suddenly the gradual climb in global temperatures goes on a mad excursion as the oceans warm and release large amounts of dissolved carbon dioxide from their lower depths into the atmosphere. Oxygen levels go down precipitously as oxygen replaces lost oceanic carbon dioxide. Asthma cases double and then double again. Now a third of the world fears breathing. As the oceans dump carbon dioxide, the greenhouse effect increases, which further warms the oceans, causing them to dump even more carbon. Because of the heat, plants die and burn in enormous fires which release more carbon dioxide, and the oceans evaporate, adding more water vapor to the greenhouse. Soon, we are in what is termed a runaway greenhouse effect, as happened to Venus eons ago. The last two surviving scientists inevitably argue, one telling the other, ?See! I told you the missing sink was in the ocean!?Earth, as we know it, dies. After this Venusian excursion in temperatures, the oxygen disappears into the soil, the oceans evaporate and are lost and the dead Earth loses its ozone layer completely. Earth is too far from the Sun for it to be the second Venus for long. Its atmosphere is slowly lost?as is its water?because of ultraviolet bombardment breaking up all the molecules apart from carbon dioxide. As the atmosphere becomes thin, the Earth becomes colder. For a short while temperatures are nearly normal, but the ultraviolet sears any life that tries to make a comeback. The carbon dioxide thins out to form a thin veneer with a few wispy clouds and dust devils. Earth becomes the second Mars?red, desolate, with perhaps a few hardy microbes surviving.<br />

And, no risk of brain drain the plan spills over to the global economy and developing countries<br />
Hart, 06 (David M. Hart, Prof at GMU of Public Policy, award-winning teacher, offering general courses on policy-making and political strategy as well as specialized courses dealing with technological innovation, governance, and the global knowledge economy, worked with an array of public and private organizations in the U.S. and abroad, including the U.S. National Research Council, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, the National Natural Sciences Foundation of China, and the U.K. Treasury Department ?From Brain Drain to Mutual Gain: Sharing the Benefits of High-Skill Migration, ?Fall 2006 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/services/engineering-accounting-research-management/4083734-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allbusiness.com/services/engineering-accounting-research-management/4083734-1.html</a>)<br />
The news on high-skill migration (HSM) is good and getting better. More highly skilled people are moving across borders for education and work than ever before. Judging by figures on graduate-school?applications?from abroad that were released in March 2006 by the Council of Graduate Schools, the United States is recovering from its overreaction in the wake of the September 11,2001, terrorist attacks and reestablishing its position as the most desirable destination for the world's talented and restless. HSM benefits the migrants themselves, the knowledge-producing community, and the global economy as a whole. Managed wisely, HSM might also benefit many of the countries in the developing world that traditionally have been thought to be hurt by it.<br />
Although the aggregate benefits of HSM outweigh the aggregate costs, these benefits and costs are unevenly distributed. Indeed, at the national level, HSM has typically been seen as a zero-sum game, a brain drain that makes the rich richer and the poor poorer. Attachment to the brain drain metaphor these days, however, obscures as much as it illuminates. New research suggests that knowledge acquired abroad by talented migrants and the benefits that derive from that knowledge are returning home more often than in the past, even when the &quot;brains&quot; themselves do not. What's more, under some conditions, the prospect of migration may enhance, rather than reduce, human capital formation within source countries.<br />
Before consigning the brain drain to the dustbin of history, though, a heaping helping of caution is in order. The incipient shift toward mutual gain is limited in scope and may prove fragile. Small developing countries remain vulnerable to human capital flight. Larger ones confront constraints on their capacity to absorb and use new ideas effectively. Migrants from all source countries face the prospect of a potent backlash within the receiving countries, animated by anti-immigrant sentiment and concern about the offshoring of jobs.<br />
Policymakers around the world should seize emerging opportunities to expand the mutual gains that might be made through HSM. To do so, they will need to change the way they think about the issue and let go of the zero-sum metaphors of &quot;brain drain&quot; and &quot;war for talent.&quot; Having done so, they will be better prepared to take creative steps toward achieving two objectives: strengthening the capacity of source countries, especially small ones, to absorb knowledge and extract benefits from it, and nurturing knowledge spillovers from receiving countries to source countries.<br />
The first rule of migration studies is to visualize large error bars around virtually every statement one reads. Data are spotty at best, limiting researchers' confidence in comparisons over long periods of time, across many countries, and among ill-defined subpopulations such as the highly skilled. Researchers sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and World Bank, among others, have only just begun to sort out and systematize information that has been collected by diverse national border control and census agencies.<br />
The data, such as they are, suggest that there is a rising tide of HSM. IMF and World Bank studies consistently find a high correlation between education and legal migration. In 2000, for instance, a person with a college or graduateschool education was six times more likely to migrate legally than was one with less than a high-school education. 37% of the legal immigrant stock in OECD countries, more than 20 million people all told, fell into the high-skill category, compared with 33% a decade earlier. Another 600,000 or so highly skilled people work outside of their native land on temporary visas at any given moment. And some 1.6 million men and women are studying abroad at the undergraduate or graduate-school levels, a number that has approximately doubled during the past 20 years.<br />
Many of these highly skilled migrants hail from developing countries and reside in rich ones. About 70% of the foreign-born in the U.S. science and engineering workforce whose place of birth was identified by the National Science Foundation, for instance, are natives of non-OECD countries. In addition, the vast majority of expatriate workers on temporary visas come to the OECD from developing countries. Some 700,000 of OECD foreign students, about half of the total, are citizens of developing countries as well. Migration specialists B. Lindsay Lowell, Allan Findlay, and Emma Stewart conclude that &quot;nearly one in ten tertiary educated adults born in the developing world resided in North America, Australia, or Western Europe in 2001.&quot;<br />
Unless the receiving countries erect barriers for political reasons, the tide is not likely to ebb any time soon. The population-age profile of most of the developing world is still a pyramid, whereas that of the OECD (and of China, thanks to the one-child policy put in place nearly 30 years ago) resembles an apartment building. Differences in salaries and opportunities between source and receiving countries remain large, and awareness of these differences is becoming more widespread thanks to the penetration of information?technology?into even the most backward villages.<br />
These demographic and economic trends have fueled an international competition to offer, as Devesh Kapur and John McHaIe put it in their recent book, better deals to highly skilled migrants. Australia and Canada, among others, have moved aggressively to compete with the United States for their services, and even Germany has shown signs of softening its traditional immigration phobia. Some important source countries, such as China and South Korea, have also been working hard to retain talented citizens and induce those who have already gone abroad to return home.<br />
If the data on flows of people are spotty, the data on who gains and who loses from migration might be characterized as dotty: Analysts need to use both sophisticated theories and common sense to connect data points that, standing alone, provide a far from comprehensive picture. For the past few decades, these experts have largely agreed that benefits follow the highly skilled when they move from one country to another.<br />
Simulations by L. Alan Winters, director of the World Bank's development research group, and his colleagues provide some sense of the scale of the aggregate benefits of migration. According to their model, if the labor force of the OECD countries were to be increased by 3% by temporary migration, world welfare would expand by $150 billion, resulting in, they write, &quot;greater gains than the removal of all restrictions on goods trade!&quot; Not all of these gains come from cheaper haircuts and housecleaning; lifting immigration quotas only on skilled workers produces aggregate benefits of roughly $45 billion in this model.<br />
As Winters et al. are quick to emphasize, these estimates should not be taken literally. They are based on using existing human capital more effectively by matching it to complementary resources, such as other talented people, stateof-the-art equipment, and organizational wherewithal. They do not account for contributions made by migrants to the stock of knowledge, which continue to pay off over a long period of time.<br />
Yet as Paula Stephan and Sharon Levin have shown, foreign-born and foreign-educated workers in U.S. science and engineering (S&amp;E) fields make disproportionately large and valuable contributions to knowledge. For example, they are overrepresented (relative to their share of the S&amp;E workforce) among authors of the most-cited scientific papers and inventors of highly cited patents. The aggregate benefits of freer flows of talented people may well be underestimated by conventional economic models.<br />
Aggregate benefits, of course, often mask distributional costs, and that has long been accepted to be so in this case. In the Winters et al. model described above, for instance, the migrants themselves and the economies that receive them derive benefits, whereas those left behind in the source countries are made worse off. The losses total some $21 billion in the full model and $34 billion in the model that includes only HSM.<br />
A lopsided distribution of gains and losses from migration remains plausible even when we account, as above, for the unique economic properties of knowledge. Most of the gains attributable to advances in knowledge are not captured by those who make them, but rather spill over to society more broadly. Such spillovers tend to be geographically localized, clustering near where the ideas were originally generated. Source countries thus lose more than the income that the migrants would have earned had they stayed home; they also lose the spillovers associated with the migrants' ideas. Even if those ideas would have been less valuable had their creators never left home, the source countries would have gotten a much larger share of that smaller pie.<br />
These presumed losses constitute the drain in the brain drain. For the past 30 years or so, developing countries have sought unsuccessfully to be compensated for these losses out of the net contributions their natives have made to the wellbeing of their adopted countries. With a few exceptions, the receiving countries have accepted the<br />
<br />
premise that HSM constitutes a brain drain, even though they have made little more than token gestures toward compensating source countries. In the past few years, though, this premise has been subjected to more rigorous scrutiny than before.<br />
Recent research has opened two lines of attack on the conventional wisdom about the distributional consequences of HSM. One claims that the prospect of migration induces greater investment in skills and education within the source countries. The other suggests that migration precipitates knowledge spillovers from the receiving countries to the source countries. Together, the two arguments suggest that HSM is not a brain drain but, paradoxically, may even lead to a net gain for source countries.<br />
The induced investment argument assumes that potential migrants (or their parents) believe that good preparation at home will increase their chances of reaping the economic bonanza associated with going abroad. The vagaries of migration are such, however, that they are unable to make such investments in a fully informed and rational manner. They act more like venture capitalists (or maybe even lottery participants) than like bond buyers (who receive a fixed return) when they acquire skills and education.<br />
The combination of poor information and high aspiration, the argument continues, means that more people in the source countries will try to make themselves attractive candidates for migration than are actually able to migrate. Those who have made the investment but cannot leave need not write it off entirely. They can still put their hard-won knowledge to work in the domestic economy. This result is not the big payoff of migration, but it may still represent a positive return on an individual's educational investment. The domestic economy tallies these additional wages, but, more important, it benefits from the localized spillovers associated with the expansion in knowledge work as well.<br />
The second challenge to the conventional wisdom uses the idea of knowledge spillovers differently. Improvements in information and communication technology, its advocates argue, allow people to capitalize on knowledge over much larger distances than ever before. Cheap transportation makes possible more frequent personal meetings and visits. Massive bandwidth and sophisticated software facilitate rich and extended electronically mediated interactions. In the not too distant future, virtual reality communication channels may even enable the long-distance transfer of tacit knowledge, such as cutting-edge scientific techniques, which currently requires direct contact. These technological opportunities are being realized by new kinds of scientific and business organizations. Global collaborative networks in both sectors help to create trust that lowers the risk and raises the reward of knowledge exchange.<br />
The general expansion of the geographical scope of knowledge spillovers has specific consequences for the HSM debate. Highly skilled migrants are more likely to generate international knowledge spillovers than they used to be, brain drain skeptics argue, and the benefits of these spillovers are more likely to be captured in the source countries than elsewhere. Migrants are able to maintain strong relationships with the friends they left behind, and they are better positioned to build new international linkages with colleagues in source countries than anywhere else. These bilateral networks, which may be scientific, financial, or commercial, tend to become self-reinforcing. Multinational firms that employ?expatriates, for instance, are inclined to site operations in the source countries, which in turn, may strengthen the firms' connections to suppliers, academic institutions, and other potential recipients of knowledge spillovers there.<br />
Neither of these arguments presumes that the brains that were &quot;drained&quot; ever return to the source countries for good. In fact, as long as the migrants are perceived to do sufficiently well after they leave (in the induced investment argument) and maintain sufficiently intensive knowledge-based relationships with their former compatriots (in the knowledge spillover argument), the source countries may even be better off if they never come back. The sustained incentives to invest in skills and education and the continuing flows of useful knowledge, in the view of the most enthusiastic adherents of these positions, more than compensate for the loss of the human capital of the departed.<br />
These challenges to the conventional wisdom that HSM must be a brain drain are logically coherent. They appeal to the instincts of the Western scientific and technical community, with its long tradition of internationalism and respect for individual choice, not to mention its wish to justify its existing practices. We should be wary, however, of leaping to the comforting conclusion that the transformation of drain into gain is inevitable and irreversible. Both the induced investment and the knowledge spillover arguments rest on assumptions that may not be accurate in all circumstances. Whether the push for the gain outweighs the pull of the drain, or vice versa, is ultimately an empirical matter.<br />
It is surely the case that the prospect of emigration induces the desire for skills and education among some who might benefit by leaving, especially when the potential payoff is very large relative to opportunities at home. But this desire cannot always be acted on. Those with the desire may lack the means to invest in themselves or their children. Even if they can express a demand for knowledge, financially or politically, the domestic system of education and training maybe too rigid to respond to it. In addition, those who are able to equip themselves for emigration may not do so in way that adds significantly to their contributions should they wind up staying home. The source country may not be able to use the skills and knowledge they obtain, and they may feel frustrated.<br />
The most thorough efforts to test the induced investment argument empirically suggest that large countries, especially those in which educational levels are very low, may benefit from HSM, whereas small countries are often big losers. Frederic Docquier and his colleagues, for instance, have calculated that China and India, among others, are net beneficiaries of HSM at its current level and would benefit even more if outflows were to rise. At the other extreme, Guyana, Haiti, and Jamaica, which have lost more than 80% of their college-educated population to migration, have, unsurprisingly, been made worse off as a result. Docquier and his coauthors conclude that although more of the 50 developing countries in their sample are &quot;losers&quot; than &quot;winners,&quot; the winners contain some 80% of the total population.<br />
This conclusion must be treated as tentative, given the state of the data and the ongoing debate about the models, but it makes sense. Migration opportunities are not necessarily offered by receiving countries in proportion to the population of the sending countries. Citizens of the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Jamaica (with a combined population of less than 20 million) are more than 100 times more likely to be admitted as legal immigrants to the United States, for instance, than those of India and China (with a population of more than 2 billion). The induced investment argument suggests that there are so many people in large countries competing for so few migration slots that the &quot;surplus&quot; human capital generated by the competition is substantial. In addition, large countries probably have more diverse institutional structures in education and the economy than small ones. They are therefore better able to adapt to changes in demand for training and to absorb the surplus. Looking at India, for instance, Simon Commander and his colleagues find &quot;compelling evidence&quot; of a supplyside response to the demand for information technology-related training, especially among private educational suppliers.<br />
The counterclaims against the knowledge spillover argument resemble those offered to rebut the induced investment argument. The knowledge gained by highly skilled migrants may not always be valuable in the source countries. Even if it is potentially valuable, these countries may be unable to benefit from it because they lack &quot;absorptive capacity,&quot; a somewhat mysterious mix of capabilities, incentives, organizations, and institutions associated with knowledge-based growth. Migrants may also face obstacles to establishing productive scientific, commercial, and financial connections to their former homelands.<br />
The evidence that there are some knowledge spillovers from receiving to source countries is incontrovertible. Annalee Saxenian, for instance, has shown that a healthy traffic in knowledge and information between?SiliconValley, California, and Bangalore, India, mediated by?Indian?expatriates, helps to account for the emergence of the high-technology cluster there. Similarly, in their exposition of &quot;third generation globalization,&quot; Leonard Lynn and Hal Salzman link the establishment by multinational corporations of engineering operations in developing countries to the presence of highly skilled migrants among the employees of these corporations.<br />

<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">For most of their history, labor unions <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thesocialcontract.com/artman2/publish/tsc_17_4/tsc_17_4_briggs.shtml" rel="nofollow">**opposed**</a> attempts at loosening immigration laws</span> and often threw their weight behind restrictionist measures. During the most recent overhaul effort in 2007, a schism among unions cracked an otherwise willing liberal coalition and helped defeat the reform bill. But now, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in the wake of Arizona’s <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html" rel="nofollow">**strict and highly controversial new immigration law**</a>, labor has united to support immigration reform with <strong>unprecedented</strong> vigor.</span><br />
<span style="color: #333333;">Richard Trumka, president of the 11.5-million-member <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">AFL-CIO,</span> gave a pivotal speech on June 18 at the City Club of Cleveland that crystallized labor’s shift in outlook. Trumka, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the nation’s most powerful labor voice</span>, </span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 8.0pt;">made a moral and economic case for reform and pledged to “face head-on our own contradictions, hypocrisy and history on immigration.” AFL-CIO has joined forces with the 2.2-million-strong Service Employees International Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union to pour resources into the fight, and the three have written a <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.seiu.org/2010/03/afl-cio-seiu-ufcw-urge-senate-leaders-to-move-comprehensive-immigration-reform-forward.php" rel="nofollow">**joint letter**</a> to Congress detailing labor’s “unified position and unfailing commitment” to sweeping reform.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Labor leaders have come to view an immigration overhaul as an opportunity rather than a threat to their interests. A large population of unlawful immigrants undercuts both the working class and the influence of unions, while legalized immigrants could be tapped to expand union membership. Likewise, joining forces with the pro-reform and growing Hispanic community can help secure the movement’s future. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Labor unions’ share of the U.S. workforce has <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/28/AR2009012801621.html" rel="nofollow">**declined**</a> steadily since the 1950s, when the figure peaked at roughly one-third. Last year it was 12.3 percent, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf" rel="nofollow">**according to**</a> the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">“Immigrant workers are the growth sector in today’s labor movement, so they’re a big part of its future,” said Kate Bronfenbrenner, director of labor education research at Cornell University. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Mark Krikorian, executive director of the restrictionist, “<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cis.org/About" rel="nofollow">**low-immigration**</a>” Center for Immigration Studies, put it more bluntly. “Unions obviously see immigration as their only chance at future growth,” he said, “since American workers have pretty much given up on them.” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">A January <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2010/01/raising_the_floor.html" rel="nofollow">**report**</a> by the liberal Center for American Progress and Immigration Policy Center noted that a large population of unauthorized immigrants — <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/11/local/la-me-immig11-2010feb11" rel="nofollow">**10**</a> to <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://pewhispanic.org/reports/report.php?ReportID=107" rel="nofollow">**12**</a> million, per most estimates — depresses wages for low-skilled jobs. Unscrupulous employers can hire and underpay unlawful workers, who have no ability to unionize or push back politically. In other words, the larger the undocumented population, the smaller the clout of organized labor. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Legalizing unlawful immigrants and ensuring the rights of all workers, the CAP and IPC study concluded, would “help American workers” by “rais[ing] the ‘wage floor’ for the entire U.S. economy.” Newly naturalized workers could also give unions a boost, particularly if they view them as allies early on. </span><br />
“<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We want a strong legalization program</span>, and we want to legalize as many workers as fast as possible,” said Ana Avendaño, director of immigration at AFL-CIO, adding that the AFL-CIO supports the creation of an “independent commission” to structure requirements for future immigration inflows based on the needs of the economy. <br />
While these undercurrents have been brewing for years, the newly galvanizing force for labor is the Arizona crackdown on illegal immigration, which requires law enforcement officials to probe the residency status of suspect individuals during lawful encounters. <br />
“Right now, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the big fire that’s pushing the labor movement is what’s happening in Arizona</span>,”<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> said Bronfenbrenner. “It’s hurting workers all over the country.” Trumka forcefully criticized the law in his Cleveland speech as part of “a hate campaign” against “working people,” one that’s designed to “make anyone who might look like an immigrant live in fear of the police.” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Civil rights groups say the law will disproportionately target Latinos — the fastest-growing U.S. demographic, and one that <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/hispanics_oppose_az_immigratio.html" rel="nofollow">**strongly backs**</a> an immigration overhaul. Unions are already leveraging their pro-reform stance to <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lclaa.org/home_page/what-can-unions-do-for-latinos.html" rel="nofollow">**reach**</a> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blog.aflcio.org/2009/04/02/lclaa-union-membership-good-for-latino-community/" rel="nofollow">**out**</a> to Hispanics — an effort that, if successful, could substantially boost their membership prospects in the long run. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The battle over this issue is ongoing, as five states are currently developing similar laws to Arizona’s, and 17 more have shown interest in it, according to the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ndn.org/blog/2010/06/sb1070-copy-cat-laws" rel="nofollow">**think tank NDN**</a>. “We’re very concerned that Arizona is going to become the model for the United States,” Avendaño said. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">A sticking point for labor continues to be the expansion of the current guest worker program, the primary reason for AFL-CIO’s opposition in 2007. This business-backed clause comprises non-immigrant visas such as the H-1B, which grants skilled foreigners the temporary right to live and work in the United States. But because these short-term workers have limited job flexibility and are essentially unable to unionize, the provision has been a roadblock to labor’s goals of having a politically active workforce and protecting low-skilled domestic talent. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Trumka, who calls recipients of these visas “vulnerable, indentured workers,” reiterated his union’s opposition to them in Cleveland. “We will not support the return to outdated guest worker programs that give immigrants no security, no future here in the United States, no rights and no hope of being part of the American Dream,” he said, demanding that all workers be “able to assert their legal rights, including the right to organize, without fear of retaliation.” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">But Avendaño declined to say whether AFL-CIO and other unions might again seek to kill reform over this provision. “It’s really hard to picture how this will end up,” she said, adding that labor “won’t support reform that puts working people in a bad position.” </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">During the 2007 effort, dissenting progressives such as</span> Sens.

Fearing <strong>political</strong> <strong>fallout</strong>, senior Senators McCain (R-AZ) and Kennedy (D-MA) retreated from the H-1B and Immigration Reform bill battlefield last week. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The McCain/Kennedy <strong><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">coalition split</span></strong> </span>and opted not to release the immigration reform bill they've been working on.

Conservative voters are strongly against guest worker programs which, many feel, leads to amnesty for illegal aliens. The H-1B program is not related to illegal immigration but it is growing into an equally controversal guest worker program with <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">heavyweight</span></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> <strong>opponents</strong> such as IEEE-USA</span>, the AFL-CIO, the CWA and many others who are joining in as the immigration battle progresses. <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Kennedy gave up completely on developing any new ideas and has reverted to supporting the immigration reform bill version that the Senate proposed last year, an already anachronistic bill which is popular with large corporations but unpopular with the majority of voters. </span>This is an exciting time in American history where politicians are stuck in the middle of a well-publicized <strong>tug of war</strong> between their campaign contributors and their voters. At stake is no less than control of the soul of the country. When it comes to immigration, it seems that members of congress simply cannot appease their corporate supporters without risking losing their next election. Sooner or later, both Houses will have to face the donnybrook and somehow come up with viable solutions for all parties. <strong><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">IEEE-USA army finds empty battlefield</span></strong> In the mean time, IEEE engineers arrived last week ready for a fight but found no bill to contest. Undeterred, they marched into House and Senate offices to ask for support if and when the battle begins.

The IEEE-USA position is much more appealing and kinder to the future scientists of America by offering them citizenship up front. </span>The IEEE-USA proposal protects American engineers by insisting on reform and enforcement of the current H-1B program and a cap freeze until enacted. As U.S. citizens, immigrant professionals will be competing on an even playing field with current citizens. This will allow <strong>wages to rise for all</strong>, eliminating the disadvantage of competing against indentured guest workers. The IEEE-USA proposal helps foreign engineers by providing them with a clear path towards permanent citizenship, replacing an unstable atmosphere of <strong>fear</strong> created by the guest worker program. The IEEE-USA proposal helps tech companies hire the best and brightest by expanding the EB and F-4 immigration visas. With these visas, they can permanently hire and retain engineers here in America. <strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;">National security</span></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> is also strengthened with this proposal due to the more vigorous demands of legal immigration, whereas now, the H-1B guest worker program is considered a &quot;<strong>rubber stamp</strong>&quot; process which may be vulnerable to <strong>terrorism</strong>.</span> Recent government reports conclude that the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">H-1B</span> Guest Worker program is now doing the opposite of what it was intended to do. Instead of bringing in the best and brightest, it is actually <strong><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">expediting outsourcing by creating a revolving door for outsourcing companies</span></strong> such as Wipro and Infosys. <strong><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Washington is run by twenty-year olds</span></strong> Last week, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">IEEE engineers ascended</span> on Capitol Hill looking for Senate and House leaders who will honestly confront the H-1B Guest Worker program head-on. They spent their time targeting members of the Judiciary Committees in the House and Senate but spoke to any member of congress who would listen. Many engineers spoke directly to Senators and House members but most were only able <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to speak with staffers</span>. Most congressional staffers are in their twenties or early thirties. They work very hard and earn next to nothing. They are continuously busy planning and conducting meetings with lobbyists and constituents as well as performing many other important functions. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">They are the ones doing most of the actual grunt work</span> on Capitol Hill. You can tell by the focus in their eyes, that these are some of the best and brightest young people America has to offer. The inside joke in D.C. is that &quot;<em><strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">Washington is run by twenty-year olds</span></strong></em>&quot;. Most of them appear to be doing an exemplary job though, adroitly handling multiple tasks concurrently while remaining acutely aware of proceedings around them.
