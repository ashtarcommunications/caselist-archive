<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Likewise, Queer immigrants are ineligible for visas under the family reunification policy which clearly defines and establishes the heteronormative nuclear family as the standard against which competing definitions of family are devalued and rejected </span><br />

<span style="color: #141413; font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt;">The heteronormative governance of migrants implicates the status of groups who hold official citizenship but are nonetheless marked as suspect, subaltern, and second-class members of the nation.

<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The INA’s static definition of the family is directly in line with modern technology and its race to eliminate difference in an impossible quest for ontological certainy and an objective grounds for identity construction </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Intersecting forms of racial, gendered, and heteronormative oppression are actualized through technological reduction of identity to binaries—Only the ontological criticism of the affirmative can sever these binary mode of being that solidifies material hierarchies of oppression. </span><br />

 <span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Current immigration policy is steeped in the rhetoric and policy of the war on terror. This ideology is rooted in a geopolitical anxiety that refuses to relinquish an antiquated national identity in favor of violently lashing out against anything that does not fit within our global purview.</span><br />

 1. C/I Resolve is steadfastedness to think- the resolution should be affirmed as a thought experiment.<br />
a. Enframing fails, inevitably results in the withdrawal of the object causing the depolitcized violence that blames the other for their own exclusion- this violence can only produce more unpredictability in debate- that's mitchell.<br />
b. Will to will- our interpretation is necessary to terrorize debate in order to prevent it from calcifying- we open debate to NEW forms of education and political agency OUTSIDE of current self-referential values<br />
c. Ontology is inevitable- util and realism usually taken for ranted- clarifying in the 1ac solves 2ac moving taget<br />
<br />
2. Prefer substantive impacts<br />
a. our argument is a precursor to determining the quality of the ground they lose- ground is pointless if it produces a violent form of debate and poor educaiton<br />
b. our interpretation doesn't prevent policy debate<br />
<br />
3. Unpredictability is inevitable- policy deate incentivizes obscure advantags- prioritizing ground porduces the ability to be caught of gaurd.<br />
<br />
4. Reasonability- the question should not be whose interp is the BEST for debate but does the aff's interpretation make debate IMPOSSIBLE for the neg- otherwise competing interpretations leads to a race to the bottom and the aff would always lose.<br />
