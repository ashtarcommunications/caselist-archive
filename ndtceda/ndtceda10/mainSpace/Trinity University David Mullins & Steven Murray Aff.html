 The image of the family crushes the potential of any revolution. The family persists as the primary birthing point of internalized hierarchy and fascism, a system of implicit domination which excludes and denies any alternative formations within society. It is the dominant master signifier of the family structure which prevents freedom against oppression<br />
<br />
Hardt and Negri 2009 (Michael Hardt, Professor of Literature at Duke and Antonio Negri, taught at Université de Vincennes with K all-stars Foucault, Deleuze and Derrida. Commonwealth. 2009. p. 160-2.)<br />

The three most significant social institutions of AND to realize the equal and free participation in the common that the family promises and constantly denies and corrupts.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Plan&quot; &lt;The United States federal government should expand beneficiary eligibility for family-based visas by eliminating all restrictions on the conception of family.&gt;<br />
<br />
An explanation: We affirm the concept of state action not as a literal plan of operations but as an interesting case study for our method of rhizomatic politics. We are not a linear movement seeking retribution from the state nor are we a singular demand delivered at Washington.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We affirm the politics of the rhizome. We are a horizontal movement, spreading outwards creating new offshoots and branches and subsets that all act independently. In order for our politics to be successful, we must break free of the confines instituted by the state – we must move beyond the stranglehold of family, borders, and ordered language. Our politics is one of disrupting the static and constantly invoking a multiplicity of change<br />

<br />
<br />
In their dialogues and collaborations, Gilles Deleuze and Félix AND with its ‘order-words’, has to be fought until, finally, it withers away and, in accord with any and every utopian scenario, all identity is undone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is insufficient to simply blame the family for the failings of the modern political. Rather, the impediment of the family is another incarnation of the infection of fascism into the individual. It is at the site of the preconscious that we fight – we must recognize the horrific power of the family Oedipus as part and parcel of a challenge against internalized fascism<br />
<br />
Seem 1972 (Mark Seem, Translators introduction to Anti-Oedipus by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, xx-xxiii)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To be anti-oedipal is to be anti-ego AND of a society: not that desire is asocial; on the contrary. But it is explosive; there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our solution begins with the way political formations occur in the status quo – groups formulate themselves around broader ideological and political reference points which act as transcendent signifiers constantly coding and directing potential. Desire is strangled by the formations of the status quo, turning life against itself, preventing the existence of immaculate joy<br />
<br />

<br />
Libidinal investment does not bear upon the regime AND the limit, bringing the social machines back to the elementary forces of desire that form them.<br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Status quo movements for same sex visas are failing miserably. Couples are regulated by the state, forced to conform to a predetermined vision of the “good” Americanized queer.  </span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Capitalism has overcoded visa applications – enough cash money can overcome moral failings and green-light entrance to the United States. All the while, any successful applicants reinscribe a model of the proper citizen properly following proper protocols – a model which is impossible to match for a majority of individuals across the globe – which means that same sex visa applicants are unknowingly and unwillingly creating the means for their own exclusion. </span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In order to understand why this micropolitical movement is failing, we must understand the history of capitalist accumulation and power politics which have resulted in the modern political ethos. In order to fight for the queer rights, we must fight the very conception of a proper family, proper interpersonal connections, and a proper relation towards the state. We must fight for a vision of the family which has no predetermined image, accepting that what an individual considers their family can look any which way at all and has no transcendent meaning. Because the point of contention upon which we fight is an ever shifting line of struggle to be successful requires a fluid political strategy that can overcome the blockages of neo-imperialism </span></span><br />

<span style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> We are a theory of politics and movements, spreading outwards creating new offshoots and branches and subsets that all act independently. We are not the start of a larger movement, instead we affirm our particular challenge to state politics as another instance of becoming – a becoming revolutionary act that resonates with already existing micropolitics. We exist in an age of becoming – constant changes and upheavals like those of gay rights activists demanding same-sex marriage visas challenge the hegemony of the upper class white male. However these movements are also constantly challenged and arrested by the state and its systems of ordering. Our affirmation makes these movements, these challenges, these becomings, into self-sufficient actions that are constantly shifting and fluctuating to surpass the barriers erected by the state.  </span></span></span><br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">It is insufficient to simply blame the family for the failings of the modern political. Rather, the impediment of the family is another incarnation of the infection of fascism into the individual. Fascism is not located in the proper state in Washington, rather it is situated in the self and resonates between beings, constructing the totalitarian conception of state which constructs barriers between movements and confines desire. Fascism is a destructive force which creates an ethic of non-life – a repression of joy and an active desire to cede life in the unconscious. We must engage in a bottom-up style of politics which begins with the self – we must recognize the horrific power of the family Oedipus as part and parcel of a challenge against internalized fascism </span></span><br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Our discussion must begin with Desire. It is worthless to talk of state politics without recognizing our responsibility in shaping our current political landscape. Fascism is not handed down from the USFG to the masses, rather fascism originates in the desires of the masses. It was the citizens of Germany and Italy who demanded the rise of Hitler and Mussolini – the masses were not duped, they were not tricked, they simply acted on their desires. Before change can take place at the macrolevel we must challenge the very fascist inside of us </span></span><br />
