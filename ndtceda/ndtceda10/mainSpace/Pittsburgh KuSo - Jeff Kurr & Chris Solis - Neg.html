 Group the time is circular, eternal recurrence debate. Two responses.<br />
A. Time is linear. 3 reasons - paradoxes, cause/effect, feedback<br />
Hawking 5/3/2010 - Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge (Stephen, “How to build a time machine,” The Daily Mail, Lexis, JAK)<br />
So I've combined two of my favourite ... for dinosaur hunters and a relief for historians.<br />
<br />
B. Circular time doesn’t support eternal recurrence.<br />
Small 90 - University of Auckland (Robin, April, “Nietzsche, Dühring, and Time,” Journal of the History of Philosophy, Vol. 28, No. 2, p. 229-250, Johns Hopkins University Press, JAK)<br />
Why the two should appear to be ... shows how easily a tempta- tion arises to identify circular time with eternal recurrence. <br />

 Group the consciousness shift debate.<br />
A. You can’t separate the mind from the body. Their author.<br />
Lanza, – Robert Lanza. MD, is considered one of the leading cell scientists in the world. He is currently Chief Scientific Officer at Advanced Cell Technology, and a professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and Berman 2k9 Bob Berman is an author and the most widely read astronomer in the world, he is director of the Storm King Observatory in Cornwall, New York, and of the Overlook Observatory inWoodstock, New York, he is an adjunct professor of astronomy at Marymount Manhattan College. Biocentrism. 2009. p. 39<br />
Second, and more to the point of this book ... sides of the same coin and cannot be separated.<br />
<br />
B. It requires a leap of faith thats not evident in the affirmative’s advocacy. Their author.<br />

What created the Big Bang? A: No “dead” ... of biocentrism if they are to succeed.<br />
<br />
Two impacts to leaps of faith.<br />
First, they can’t solve. Rhizomatic thinking is incompatible with leaps of faith, as the latter requires singular modes of thought. This provides terminal defense to all their consciousness arguments<br />
Westphal, Philosophy Department Fordham University, 06<br />
&lt;Soren Kierkegaard: Critical Assessments of Leading Philosophers, pg 314-315&gt;<br />
But if there is no Alpha, there is no Omega ... in terms of which the text is at once a fixed identity and a totality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, leaps of faith leads to more micro-fascism and is incompatible with Guattari’s work, which turns the impacts of the aff.<br />
Guatarri 05 (Felix, Three Ecologies, p. 16)<br />
From a cosmic perspective the human race is at ... our heterogeneity and resist the insidious normalization of our lives.<br />
<br />
C. Lanza’s work isn’t scientifically ground break. Multiple scientists agree he doesnt prove anything.<br />
Herper 3/09/2007 - Senior Editor at Forbes (Matthew, “A Biotech Provocateur Takes On Physics,” Forbes, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/03/09/lanza-theories-physics-biotech-oped-cx_mh_0309lanza.html?partner=yahootix" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/2007/03/09/lanza-theories-physics-biotech-oped-cx_mh_0309lanza.html?partner=yahootix</a><br />
But many physicists who were sent the essay ... where the fun begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
D. They have no internal link to changing how we view the world. Lanza and Berman’s work about biocentrism on which their arguments about consciousness rely are articulated to changing how we understand physics. That means they can never have the shift of consciousness they talk about.<br />
Lanza &amp; Berman 2009 (THE BIOCENTRIC UNIVERSE. By: Lanza, Robert, Berman, Bob, Discover, 02747529, May2009, Vol. 30, Issue 5)<br />

 Biocentric approaches posit the existence of the universe as relying on humans as the forefront<br />
Lanza &amp; Berman 2009 (THE BIOCENTRIC UNIVERSE. By: Lanza, Robert, Berman, Bob, Discover, 02747529, May2009, Vol. 30, Issue 5)<br />
The farther we peer into space, the ... could not exist without us.<br />
<br />
Placing humans on a pedestal reifies terracentric survival driven values and disables a postmodern cosmology from developing.<br />
Zimmerman 02 - Professor of Philosophy at Tulane [Michael. “Encountering Alien Otherness,” The Concept of the Foreign, Lexington Books]<br />
Many Enlightenment thinkers, showing ... taken by the Hubble Telescope.<br />
<br />
That viewpoint makes extinction without the necessary conscious shift to view it. You should vote neg to reject the affirmative’s biocentric assumptions regarding the universe.<br />

The call for the abolition of distinctions on the basis of inside and outside presumes such a pure politics is possible—the aff attempts to present as stable and whole a political that is nevertheless always in motion and still riven with exclusions<br />

Your affirmative places the cart of “policing” before the horse of “politics” The affirmative’s friendly gift of visa eligibility for all is, a banal politics that does nothing to reorganize the structural power arrangements of the political—because the aff already possesses formal markers of citizenship and deigns to distribute them this actually short circuits the emergence of a real politics, signaled by the emergence of “wrong” as a meaningful political category<br />

<strong>1. Criticism is readily commodified by the general discursive economy that it is produced in. The act of taking a critical position, of engaging in explicit critical programs always renders criticism visible and eliminates its power.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>2. Links:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A) The call to the debate community to affirm a genealogy of whiteness rests on the debate community taking action. However, the aff posits themselves as the agents while their advocacy posits themselves as the object. This means their solvency hinges on the community including them in the first place. This makes their project the starting point and end point, which further entrenches their meaning into the fluidity of the debate community’s search for the new thing.</strong><br />

<strong>B) Ignoring the topic means we engage in a politic of pure victimization. This ignores the privilege we derive from our position as debaters. Their singular conception ignores other forms of victimization. Only by talking about the topic are we forced us to talk about our privilege.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C) Coalition building. They force the debate to be centered on white supremacy. Their explicit references to blackness deviate away incoherently from the starting point. Always making the debate about white supremacy posits that the debate is always about them. If the advocacy is about building the debate community, then the affirmative precludes other marginalized groups.</strong><br />

<strong>3. Impacts:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A) Multi-cultural capitalism.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative’s project just becomes another sign of the Other circulating in the debate community’s discursive economy. Since this project is a product of the community’s discursive economy, it can never become successful because it is a mere commodity. The community has already deemed their project as another “goo aff” no different than the rest of the “goo affs.” This means they lose their potential for the radical as the tie to the original ideological stance is severed and the inclusion saps the other of its potential embodied by being the other.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>When we make these pushes for inclusion and create an order of identity side by side, these identities lose what makes them special. This is exemplified with the creation of Black Entertainment Television. BET was originally created to increase black representation on TV and decrease the negative representation appearing on other channels. Zornell Hurston observed that various geographic areas, such as Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and the South, each had different language codes that made them distinct from another. After BET gained popularity, blackness became homogenized throughout the country. BET showed what it meant to be black, and different language codes in these diverse areas were lost.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>B) Mirroring.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>They dictate how we should orient ourselves to our identities. They only respond to the normalized white image of the debater. People come in, watch your debates, then they mimic you. This is true whether teams are policy or critical. They argue that people should “debate how you want” but then they say they should “affirm genealogies of whiteness from the standpoint of blackness.” This pushes all minorities into a single group, which means these debaters just end up role playing as each other, which stifles education</strong><br />

<strong>In the UDL the year after Towson won CEDA Nats, teams started running identity aesthetic. Young minds instead of being trained in multiplicitous about how think and debate, they literally copy what it means to be successful to a “T.” High schoolers are having their identities scripted for them. Since this process by which these identities are being scripted is true, we should be cautious to how we script them. This is distinct from the rest of debate methods because it forecloses other forms of debate.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C) Ethics.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative forecloses ethics. Last year, one way people engaged the high school energy topic was by discussing brown fields. As a result, people were learning to orient themselves politically. By only focusing on identity, it makes more difficult to have conversations on how to affect change in the world. A combination of understanding how the world works and the assumptions behind its working provides the best basis for creating actual change.</strong><br />

The call to the debate community to _ rests on the debate community taking action. However, the aff posits themselves as the agents while their advocacy posits themselves as the object. This means their solvency hinges on the community including them in the first place. This makes their project the starting point and end point, which further entrenches their meaning into the fluidity of the debate community’s search for the new thing.<br />

The institution of debate is inextricably intertwined with our own position within academic institutions. This affiliation means that our resistance is not only ineffective, but actually counterproductive, turning debate into a R&amp;D agency for new weapons to be deployed by the institution against resistance.

Their wish to represent past atrocities is an attempt to assume the place and authority of the dead. This approach is the most aggressive attempt approach. Every discourse of the other brings us in confrontation with the absolute otherness of the other. This means they can’t solve, their representations of past atrocities still leaves us distinct from the people they describe, they are never humans to us<br />

1. Interpretations<br />
A. Title 1 Section 7 sets the definition of marriage and spouse for ALL law<br />
Title 1, Sect 7 (1 USCS § 7. Title 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS. Chapter 1. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. § 7. Definition of “marriage” and “spouse”. Current through February 1, 2010. Legal Information Institute at Cornell. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode01/usc_sec_01_00000007----000-.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode01/usc_sec_01_00000007----000-.html</a>, JAK)<br />
In determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word “marriage” means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word “spouse” refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.<br />
<br />
B. Under Title 8, Section 1151, IR visas use this definition of spouse<br />
Title 8, Sect 1151 (8 USCS § 1151. Title 8. Aliens and Nationality. Chapter 12. IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY. Subchapter II. IMMIGRATION. Part I. Selection System. § 1151. Worldwide level of immigration. Current through February 1, 2010.

(b)(2)(A)(i)<br />
(b) Aliens not subject to direct numerical limitations<br />
Aliens described in this subsection, who are not subject to the worldwide levels or numerical limitations of subsection (a) of this section, are as follows:<br />
(1)<br />
(A) Special immigrants described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 1101 (a)(27) of this title.<br />
(B) Aliens who are admitted under section 1157 of this title or whose status is adjusted under section 1159 of this title.<br />

(D) Aliens whose removal is canceled under section 1229b (a) of this title.<br />
(E) Aliens provided permanent resident status under section 1259 of this title.<br />
(2)<br />
(A)<br />
(i) Immediate relatives.— For purposes of this subsection, the term “immediate relatives” means the children, spouses, and parents of a citizen of the United States, except that, in the case of parents, such citizens shall be at least 21 years of age. In the case of an alien who was the spouse of a citizen of the United States and was not legally separated from the citizen at the time of the citizen’s death, the alien (and each child of the alien) shall be considered, for purposes of this subsection, to remain an immediate relative after the date of the citizen’s death but only if the spouse files a petition under section 1154 (a)(1)(A)(ii) of this title within 2 years after such date and only until the date the spouse remarries. For purposes of this clause, an alien who has filed a petition under clause (iii) or (iv) of section 1154 (a)(1)(A) of this title remains an immediate relative in the event that the United States citizen spouse or parent loses United States citizenship on account of the abuse.<br />
(ii) Aliens admitted under section 1181 (a) of this title on the basis of a prior issuance of a visa to their accompanying parent who is such an immediate relative.<br />
(B) Aliens born to an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence during a temporary visit abroad.<br />
<br />
C. Under Title 8, Section 1154, the only way to expand spouse eligibility is through petitioning the A.G.<br />

(ii) An alien spouse described in the second sentence of section 1151 (b)(2)(A)(i) of this title also may file a petition with the Attorney General under this subparagraph for classification of the alien (and the alien’s children) under such section.<br />
<br />
D. Under Title 8, Section 1153, the only eligibility for a spouse visa is being a spouse of a citizen or LPR<br />
Title 8, Sect 1153 (8 USCS § 1153. Title 8. Aliens and Nationality. Chapter 12. IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY. Subchapter II. IMMIGRATION. Part I. Selection System. § 1153.

(a) Preference allocation for family-sponsored immigrants<br />
Aliens subject to the worldwide level specified in section 1151 (c) of this title for family-sponsored immigrants shall be allotted visas as follows:<br />
(1) Unmarried sons and daughters of citizens<br />
Qualified immigrants who are the unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the United States shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed 23,400, plus any visas not required for the class specified in paragraph (4).<br />
(2) Spouses and unmarried sons and unmarried daughters of permanent resident aliens<br />
Qualified immigrants—<br />
(A) who are the spouses or children of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or<br />
(B) who are the unmarried sons or unmarried daughters (but are not the children) of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,<br />
shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed 114,200, plus the number (if any) by which such worldwide level exceeds 226,000, plus any visas not required for the class specified in paragraph (1); except that not less than 77 percent of such visa numbers shall be allocated to aliens described in subparagraph (A).<br />
<br />
E. The only eligibility criteria for IR-1 that can be removed for this visa are under Title 8, Section 1182.<br />
State Dept 10 (Bureau of Consular Affairs, State Department, May 7, 2010 “Immigrant Visa for a Spouse (IR1 or CR1),” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/types/types_2991.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/visa/immigrants/types/types_2991.html</a>, JAK)<br />
Ineligibilities for Visas - What If the Applicant Is Ineligible for a Visa?<br />
Certain conditions and activities may make an applicant ineligible for a visa. Examples of these ineligibilities include: drug trafficking; overstaying a previous visa; and submitting fraudulent documents. If you are ineligible for a visa, you will be informed by the consular officer and advised whether there is a waiver of the ineligibility and what the waiver process is. You can see the complete list of ineligibilities by clicking on Classes of Aliens Ineligible to Receive Visas.<br />
<br />
Note that link takes you to INA 212(a) which is 8 USC 1182. It lists the inadmissibility criteria that pertains to all visas, which are the ineligibilities for IR-1 visas<br />
<br />
2. Violations:<br />
A. The aff is extra-topical because it changes the definition of spouse/marriage for ALL law<br />
B. The aff is effectually topical because it requires petitioning the attorney general for eligibility<br />
C. The aff is not topical because it doesn’t address any of the eligibility criteria tied to IR-1 visas.<br />
<br />
3. Reasons to vote neg:<br />
<br />
A. Limits - they allow affs to claim extra-topical advantages based on fiating changing actual U.S. law. They could say they legalize gay marriage in the U.S.. That unlimits affs as they no longer have discuss immigration law. They also justify expanding eligibilities for visas that don’t even affect the specific visa<br />
<br />
B. Ground - it skews negative ground because we’d always have to run a counterplan to get balance their extra-topical advantages and plan planks.<br />
<br />
C. Topic Education - changing broader U.S law moots the discussion of immigration law. Even if their aff is reasonably topical, education outweighs.<br />

3. Standards<br />
Limits: Allowing affs to change eligibility of single visa classifications allows a number of small affs, such as giving Australian E-3 visas to non-Australians. This allows any eligibility change to any of the 34 different visa affirmatives plus their combinations leaving the neg to always play catch up<br />

Ground: Allowing the additional 34 affirmatives only increases aff ground. The only comparable negative ground would be an increase in case specific strategies. The only generic disads are malthus and politics.<br />

2. Violation: The affirmative does not substantially increase the number of visas in the temporary nonimmigrant worker visa group because visas is a plural count noun referring to the broader group not one class.<br />
<br />
3. Reasons to vote neg<br />
<br />
Limits: Allowing affs to increase the number of single visa classifications allows a number of small affs, such as increasing E-3 visas for Australians or H-1B3 visas for fashion models. This allows 34 different visa affirmatives plus their combinations leaving the neg to always play catch up<br />
<br />
Ground: Allowing the additional 34 affirmatives only increases aff ground. The only comparable negative ground would be an increase in case specific strategies. The only generic disads are malthus and politics.<br />
<br />
Education: Literature addresses broad changes in immigration policies. Focusing the discussion on minute changes in things like fashion model visas does a disservice to the topic.<br />

2. Violation: The aff is extra topical because they grant blue card status.<br />
<br />
3. Standards<br />
<br />
Ground: Allowing affs to grant/issue certain status allows the aff to fiat around core negative strategies such as DHS overstretch and terrorism disads. It also skews process-based counterplans such as Parole and Waivers.<br />
<br />
Limits: Being able to issue status justifies any number of affs such as issue visas to workers who dont exist. <br />
<br />
Jurisdiction: Issue was excluded from the resolution for a purpose. Issuing inherently moots out increase, which means they don’t meet the resolution.<br />

The United States federal government should enter into negotiations with the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, offering that The United States federal government should remove the numerical cap on Special Immigrant Visas designated to translators and interpreters in Afghanistan and/or Iraq. The United States federal government should make individuals affiliated with/or employed by contractors working for the United States federal government in Afghanistan and/or Iraq eligible to receive Special Immigrant visas on the condition that European member states participating in Afghan reconstruction agree to contribute greater resources to development and governance activities and to Provisional Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan.

Borders and geopolitical control were achieved through violence – the states’ attempt to regulate its borders and the borders of other states is marked by an attempt to remove elements of centrifugal otherness that poses threats to the tenuous hold over territories and identities. As former stabilities of the bordered world turn into instabilities, violence is proliferated within the world and will continue to proliferation unless the impetus for control is removed.<br />

 Group the time is circular, eternal recurrence debate. Two responses.<br />
A. Time is linear. 3 reasons - paradoxes, cause/effect, feedback<br />
Hawking 5/3/2010 - Director of Research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge (Stephen, “How to build a time machine,” The Daily Mail, Lexis, JAK)<br />
So I've combined two of my favourite things to see if time travel from the future to the past is possible. Let's imagine I'm throwing a party, a welcome reception for future time travellers. But there's a twist. I'm not letting anyone know about it until after the party has happened. I've drawn up an invitation giving the exact coordinates in time and space. I am hoping copies of it, in one form or another, will be around for many thousands of years. Maybe one day someone living in the future will find the information on the invitation and use a wormhole time machine to come back to my party, proving that time travel will, one day, be possible. In the meantime, my time traveller guests should be arriving any moment now. Five, four, three, two, one. But as I say this, no one has arrived. What a shame. I was hoping at least a future Miss Universe was going to step through the door. So why didn't the experiment work? One of the reasons might be because of a well-known problem with time travel to the past, the problem of what we call paradoxes. Paradoxes are fun to think about. The most famous one is usually called the Grandfather paradox. I have a new, simpler version I call the Mad Scientist paradox. I don't like the way scientists in movies are often described as mad, but in this case, it's true. This chap is determined to create a paradox, even if it costs him his life. Imagine, somehow, he's built a wormhole, a time tunnel that stretches just one minute into the past. Through the wormhole, the scientist can see himself as he was one minute ago. But what if our scientist uses the wormhole to shoot his earlier self? He's now dead. So who fired the shot? It's a paradox. It just doesn't make sense. It's the sort of situation that gives cosmologists nightmares. This kind of time machine would violate a fundamental rule that governs the entire universe - that causes happen before effects, and never the other way around. I believe things can't make themselves impossible. If they could then there'd be nothing to stop the whole universe from descending into chaos. So I think something will always happen that prevents the paradox. Somehow there must be a reason why our scientist will never find himself in a situation where he could shoot himself. And in this case, I'm sorry to say, the wormhole itself is the problem. In the end, I think a wormhole like this one can't exist. And the reason for that is feedback. If you've ever been to a rock gig, you'll probably recognise this screeching noise. It's feedback. What causes it is simple. Sound enters the microphone. It's transmitted along the wires, made louder by the amplifier, and comes out at the speakers. But if too much of the sound from the speakers goes back into the mic it goes around and around in a loop getting louder each time. If no one stops it, feedback can destroy the sound system. The same thing will happen with a wormhole, only with radiation instead of sound. As soon as the wormhole expands, natural radiation will enter it, and end up in a loop. The feedback will become so strong it destroys the wormhole. So although tiny wormholes do exist, and it may be possible to inflate one some day, it won't last long enough to be of use as a time machine. That's the real reason no one could come back in time to my party. Any kind of time travel to the past through wormholes or any other method is probably impossible, otherwise paradoxes would occur. So sadly, it looks like time travel to the past is never going to happen. A disappointment for dinosaur hunters and a relief for historians.<br />
<br />
B. Circular time doesn’t support eternal recurrence.<br />
Small 90 - University of Auckland (Robin, April, “Nietzsche, Dühring, and Time,” Journal of the History of Philosophy, Vol. 28, No. 2, p. 229-250, Johns Hopkins University Press, JAK)<br />
Why the two should appear to be different involves the idea of a circular time. This need not be taken as depending on a relational concept of time: some philosophers have taken time to be circular for reasons having nothing to do with the course of events, although it must be admitted that these are not very convincing. If any argument for a circularity of time is worth consider- ing, it is a line of thought which has two stages. It first establishes a cyclical course of events, and then appeals to an identification of moments of time with events to conclude that time itself is circular in form. Perhaps it is because this second step is so taken for granted by many writers that they refer to &quot;cyclical time. ''4° In fact, that phrase is not just a misnomer, but an incoherent expression. It is events that may be cyclical, not the time in which they occur. The mistake is to overlook the fact that the outcome of the first stage of the argument--a cyclical course of events--is cancelled by the second stage. For that reason, it is inappropriate to carry over the earlier terminology into the conclusion of the argument as a whole. But whatever its cause, use of the phrase 'cyclical time' (or 'cyclical theory of time') is a sign of confusion. In any case, the idea of eternal recurrence is not the same as the idea of a circular time. Indeed, the two appear to be inconsistent with each other. If we assume that in a circular time some finite period of time would be the longest possible interval between events, then any one state could recur only a finite number of times. All this is, or ought to be, quite straightforward. Yet one often encounters remarks such as: &quot;The doctrine of eternal recurrence amounts to the assumption that time is a vast circle.&quot;47 The symbolization of eternal recurrence in a circle is a very natural one, but one should bear in mind what is symbolized and what is not. The events or states of affairs that recur eternally are represented by the circle, which allows us to see at a glance that they occur both before and after each other. What the circle does not show, however, is that its circumference is traversed again and again. That belongs to our use of the model, not to the model itself. Only by appealing to a relational theory of time can we make the further step towards understanding the model as representing time itself; but in that case we are, as before, moving from a concept of eternal recurrence to a concept of finite hut closed time. The notion that a circular model of time implies a doctrine of eternal recurrence relies on a similar error. In this case, it consists in a kind of reluc- tance to allow that time has been represented within the diagram. The same thing happens, of course, when time is represented as an infinite line. Some- one who wants to have time not only in the model but also, as it were, present in person, imagines that it consists in the movement of a point, which symbol- izes the present moment, along the line. But in thinking this way, we are committing ourselves to a doubling of time, without any theoretical basis for such a move. Again, the problem is to grasp what is represented in the model and what is not represented, but belongs instead to the use we make of it.48 Someone adopting a circular model of time may be puzzled by the following question. What happens when a point representing the present moment trav- els around the circle and arrives back at its starting place? Does it come to a halt there, or does it travel around once again? The question is based on a misconception of the kind already described. But it shows how easily a tempta- tion arises to identify circular time with eternal recurrence. <br />

Biocentrism. 2009. p. 39<br />
Second, and more to the point of this book and chapter, modern knowledge of the brain shows that what appears “out there” is actually occurring within our own minds, with visual and tacile experiences located not in some external disconnected location that we have grown accustomed to regarding as being distant from ourselves. Looking around, we see only our own mind or, perhaps, it’s better put that there is no true disconnect between external and internal. Instead, we can label all cognition as an amalgam of our experiential selves and whatever energy fields may pervade the cosmos. To avoid such awkward phrasing, we’ll allude to it by simply calling it awareness or consciousness. With this in mind (no pun intended), we’ll see how any “theory of everything” must incorproate this biocentrism - or else be a train on a track to nowhere.<br />
To sum sup:<br />
First principle of Biocentrism: What we perceive as reality is a process that involves our consciousness.<br />
Second principle of Biocentrism: Our external and internal perceptions are inexticably intertwined. They are different sides of the same coin and cannot be separated.<br />

B. It requires a leap of faith thats not evident in the affirmative’s advocacy. Their author.<br />
Lanza, – Robert Lanza. MD, is considered one of the leading cell scientists in the world. He is currently Chief Scientific Officer at Advanced Cell Technology, and a professor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, and Berman 2k9 Bob Berman is an author and the most widely read astronomer in the world, he is director of the Storm King Observatory in Cornwall, New York, and of the Overlook Observatory inWoodstock, New York, he is an adjunct professor of astronomy at Marymount Manhattan College. Biocentrism. 2009. p. 160-2<br />
What created the Big Bang? A: No “dead” universe ever existed outside of Mind. “Nothingness” is a meaningless concept. Which came first, rocks or life? A: Time is a form of animal-sense perception. What is the universe? A: An active, life-based process.<br />
Our concepts about the universe are reminiscent of a common classroom world globe, which is a tool allowing us to think about Earth as a whole. However, the Grand Canyon or Taj Mahal are only real when you go there. And having a globe doesn’t guarantee you can actually get to the North Pole or Antarctica. Likewise, the universe is a concept we use to represent everything that is theoretically possible in experience in space and time. It’s like a CD - the music only leaps into reality when you play one of the songs.<br />
One issue that can arise with biocentrism is solipsism - the notion that all is one, that a single consciousness pervades everything, and that appearances of individuality are real only on a relative level but are not true fundamentally. The authors don’t insist on this and allow that it may or may not be so. Certainly, there is a strong appearance of verisimilitude of separate organism, each with its own consciousness. And the “many beings” viewpoint overwhelmingly dominates public belief in all parts of the world. It may seem mad to entertain any view to the contrary.<br />
Still, nagging hints that “All is One” peek from cracks in every discipline - the universal applicability of numerous constants and physical laws, the insistence of many people in all cultures and throughout history of having had a “revelatory experience” that carried “no doubt” that All is One. We can be sure of one thing only: our perceptions themselves - nothing else. Then, too, the connectedness in quantum theory’s EPR correlations, where objects vastly far apart remain intimately connected, make perfect sense if solipsism is true. Thus, we have occasional subjective experience, reports of mystical revelation, unity of physical constants and laws, entangled particle phenomena, and a certain appealing esthetics (of the type that Einstein put so much stock in) that serve as little hints of this potential Oneness. Indeed, it is the tacit engine behind physicists’ tireless for a Grand Unified Theory. In any case, it may be true; it may not be, If it is, it clinches biocentrism. If it isn’t, it doesn’t matter.<br />
Looking back over the various world views, it’s clear that biocentrism is distinct from previous models. It has commonality with classical science in that studies of the brain, further efforts to understand consciousness scientifically, and many of the efforts to experimental neurobiology will help expand our grasp of the cosmos. On the other hand, it has some similarities to some of the tenets of some Eastern religions as well.<br />
Biocentrism is perhaps most valuable in helping us decide what not to waste time with - areas where biocentrism suggests our efforts at attempting to better understand the universe as a whole may be futile. “Theories of Everything” that do not account for life or consciousness will certainly lead ultimately to dead-ends, and this includes string theory. models that are strictly time-based, such as further work on understanding the Big bang as the putative natal event of the cosmos, will never deliver full satisfaction or closure. Conversely, biocentrism is in no way anti-science; science dedicated to processes or technological leaps create untold benefits within their circumscribed fields of endeavor. but those that attempt to provide deep or ultimate answers - to a population that remains hungry for them - must ultimately turn to some form of biocentrism if they are to succeed.<br />
<br />
Two impacts to leaps of faith.<br />
First, they can’t solve. Rhizomatic thinking is incompatible with leaps of faith, as the latter requires singular modes of thought. This provides terminal defense to all their consciousness arguments<br />
Westphal, Philosophy Department Fordham University, 06<br />
&lt;Soren Kierkegaard: Critical Assessments of Leading Philosophers, pg 314-315&gt;<br />
But if there is no Alpha, there is no Omega either, and the same point can be made in terms of finality and completion. “To give a text an Author is to impose a limit on that text, to furnish it with a final signified, to close the writing.” Previously the single meaning of the text was temporally before its inscription; now its “ultimate meaning” is to be found spatially beneath the work. The task of reading is thus “to decipher a text” by “discovering the Author ... beneath the work.” If writing is expression, reading is deciphering.<br />
By contrast Barthes insists that “everything is to be disentangled, nothing deciphered” because “there is nothing beneath” the text. He is again explicit about the theological character of this denial. When we refuse “to assign a ‘secret’, an ultimate meaning, to the text (and to the world as text),” we engage in “what may be called an anti-teological activity ... since to refuse to fix meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases - reason, science, law” (DA 147).<br />
We must be wary of two confusions about the theological dimension of this discussion. First, there is a non sequitur to be avoided. The evidence to which Barthes appeals concerns the character of texts produced by human scriptors. If he is right (and I think he is) that they are never able to be Authors, the Alpha and Omega of their texts, nothing whatever follows about the possibility of God as the Alpha and Omega of the world. Of course, if, with Barthes, we deny that the “world as text” has an “ultimate meaning” we are denying God. But if Barthes wants to suggest that the case against treating human texts as having a single, fixed meaning is also a case against treating the world (as text) in that way, his argument is fallacious. Kevin Hart charitably attributes to this intention only what he is entitled to claim: “Perhaps Barthes’s aim lies not so much in making out a case against theism but in developing another vocabulary for interpretation, one in which ‘God’ plays no important role.”8 The question whether the world has a single, ultimate meaning and the question whether human texts have this character are two different questions. It is wishful and confused thinking to infer the finitude of being as such from the finitude of human being.<br />
But the main issue all along has been not God as Author of the world but the Author as God of the text. The Author whose death Barthes celebrates is the human writer to whom divine attributes are assigned. Thus the phrase “Author-God” (DA 146) expresses the theological character of a certain view of writing. The Author is the arche from whom the telos emerges in terms of which the text is at once a fixed identity and a totality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, leaps of faith leads to more micro-fascism and is incompatible with Guattari’s work, which turns the impacts of the aff.<br />
Guatarri 05 (Felix, Three Ecologies, p. 16)<br />
From a cosmic perspective the human race is at the beginning of the evolutionary process. There is time for life to spread beyond the Earth throughout the entire Cosmos, provided the planet's biosphere isn't destroyed. While it is trapped on Spaceship Earth, and now that it has entered the nuclear and biotechnological age, our species remains vulnerable. In order for it to survive, the twenty-first century must be atheist in the best sense: a positive disbelief in God, concerned only with, and respectful of, terrestrial life. It will require the development of an immanent, materialist ethics, coupled with an atheist awareness of finitude, of the mortality of the species, the planet and the entire universe, and not an illusory belief in immortality, which is only a misplaced contempt for life. A proper understanding of our terrestriality and and mortality does not imply any restriction of our horizons. There will always be new ways of life to be invented, for there are as many different ways of living as there are people; provided we rediscover our heterogeneity and resist the insidious normalization of our lives.<br />

C. Lanza’s work isn’t scientifically ground break. Multiple scientists agree he doesnt prove anything.<br />
Herper 3/09/2007 - Senior Editor at Forbes (Matthew, “A Biotech Provocateur Takes On Physics,” Forbes, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.forbes.com/2007/03/09/lanza-theories-physics-biotech-oped-cx_mh_0309lanza.html?partner=yahootix" rel="nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/2007/03/09/lanza-theories-physics-biotech-oped-cx_mh_0309lanza.html?partner=yahootix</a><br />
But many physicists who were sent the essay were underwhelmed. Several said that the work should be published in a scientific journal. All said Lanza's theory needs to make clear predictions of experimental results, so that it can be tested. Lanza believes experiments already in progress or recently completed could validate his idea, but many scientists disagree.<br />
&quot;This looks like a philosophical essay,&quot; wrote Lawrence Krauss, a professor of physics at Case-Western Reserve University, in an e-mail. &quot;There are no scientific breakthroughs about anything, as far as I can see. It may represent interesting philosophy, but it doesn't look, at first glance, as if it will change anything about science.&quot;<br />
In common speech, the word &quot;theory&quot; is often used to refer to ideas that have not been proven, but to scientists and philosophers it has a completely different meaning. A theory is a rigid intellectual construction that builds a way of thinking about the universe. To scientists, a theory must make clear predictions of how things work. Einstein's theory of special relativity predicts how light behaves; Darwin's theory of evolution predicts how different species evolve. Researchers can design experiments to test whether these predictions are true.<br />
&quot;I don't see it as a new theory, I don't even see it as a new philosophy,&quot; says Arthur Zajonc, a physicist at Amherst University, who says that many of Lanza's arguments have been made by others over the last century. &quot;I see it as a new voicing. He pushes hard. He makes dramatic statements. Whether it's convincing is another question.&quot;<br />
Zajonc's own work relates to an idea called Wheeler's delayed choice experiment, which forms part of the basis for Lanza's idea. In this experiment, which was originally a thought experiment but has recently been conducted, time seems to run backward. The decision of whether or not to observe a light particle affects how the light behaves beforehand. &quot;I do think the issue for me that he's raising is an interesting one,&quot; says Zajonc. &quot;The role of subjectivity is too easily dismissed, even now.&quot;<br />
Daniel C. Dennett, a Tufts University philosopher whose work on consciousness and free will has fundamentally influenced many scientists who study the brain, says he does not think Lanza's thinking meets the standard of a philosophical theory either.<br />
&quot;It looks like an opposite of a theory, because he doesn't explain how it happens at all,&quot; Dennett says. &quot;What is wonderful about biology is it has these reductive explanations of how healing works, how reproduction works, how self-repair works.&quot; Lanza, he says, isn't explaining how consciousness works, or influences the world around it. &quot;He's stopping where the fun begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
D. They have no internal link to changing how we view the world. Lanza and Berman’s work about biocentrism on which their arguments about consciousness rely are articulated to changing how we understand physics. That means they can never have the shift of consciousness they talk about.<br />

UNLOCKING THE CAGE<br />
In daily life, space and time are harmless illusions. A problem arises only because, by treating these as fundamental and independent things, science picks a completely wrong starting point for investigations into the nature of reality. Most researchers still believe they can build from one side of nature, the physical, without the other side, the living. By inclination and training these scientists are obsessed with mathematical descriptions of the world. If only, after leaving work, they would look out with equal seriousness over a pond and watch the schools of minnows rise to the surface. The fish, the ducks, and the cormorants, paddling out beyond the pads and the cattails, are all part of the greater answer.<br />
Recent quantum studies help illustrate what a new biocentric science would look like. Just months ago, Nicolas Gisin announced a new twist on his entanglement experiment; in this case, he thinks the results could be visible to the naked eye. At the University of Vienna, Anton Zeilinger's work with huge molecules called buckyballs pushes quantum reality closer to the macroscopic world. In an exciting extension of this work — proposed by Roger Penrose, the renowned Oxford physicist — not just light but a small mirror that reflects it becomes part of an entangled quantum system, one that is billions of times larger than a buckyball. If the proposed experiment ends up confirming Penrose's idea, it would also confirm that quantum effects apply to human-scale objects.<br />
Biocentrism should unlock the cages in which Western science has unwittingly confined itself. Allowing the observer into the equation should open new approaches to understanding cognition, from unraveling the nature of consciousness to developing thinking machines that experience the world the same way we do. Biocentrism should also provide stronger bases for solving problems associated with quantum physics and the Big Bang. Accepting space and time as forms of animal sense perception (that is, as biological), rather than as external physical objects, offers a new way of understanding everything from the microworld (for instance, the reason for strange results in the two-slit experiment) to the forces, constants, and laws that shape the universe.At a minimum, it should help halt such dead-end efforts as string theory.<br />
Above all, biocentrism offers a more promising way to bring together all of physics, as scientists have been trying to do since Einstein's unsuccessful unified field theories of eight decades ago. Until we recognize the essential role of biology, our attempts to truly unify the universe will remain a train to nowhere. <br />

 Biocentric approaches posit the existence of the universe as relying on humans as the forefront<br />
Lanza &amp; Berman 2009 (THE BIOCENTRIC UNIVERSE. By: Lanza, Robert, Berman, Bob, Discover, 02747529, May2009, Vol. 30, Issue 5)<br />
The farther we peer into space, the more we realize that the nature of the universe cannot be understood fully by inspecting spiral galaxies or watching distant supernovas. It lies deeper. It involves our very selves.<br />
This insight snapped into focus one day while one of us (Lanza) was walking through the woods. Looking up, he saw a huge golden orb web spider tethered to the overhead boughs. There the creature sat on a single thread, reaching out across its web to detect the vibrations of a trapped insect struggling to escape. The spider surveyed its universe, but everything beyond that gossamer pinwheel was incomprehensible. The human observer seemed as far-off to the spider as telescopic objects seem to us. Yet there was something kindred: We humans, too, lie at the heart of a great web of space and time whose threads are connected according to laws that dwell in our minds.<br />
Is the web possible without the spider? Are space and time physical objects that would continue to exist even if living creatures were removed from the scene?<br />
Figuring out the nature of the real world has obsessed scientists and philosophers for millennia. Three hundred years ago, the Irish empiricist George Berkeley contributed a particularly prescient observation: The only thing we can perceive are our perceptions. In other words, consciousness is the matrix upon which the cosmos is apprehended. Color, sound, temperature, and the like exist only as perceptions in our head, not as absolute essences. In the broadest sense, we cannot be sure of an outside universe at all.<br />
For centuries, scientists regarded Berkeley's argument as a philosophical sideshow and continued to build physical models based on the assumption of a separate universe &quot;out there&quot; into which we have each individually arrived. These models presume the existence of one essential reality that prevails with us or without us. Yet since the 1920s, quantum physics experiments have routinely shown the opposite: Results do depend on whether anyone is observing. This is perhaps most vividly illustrated by the famous two-slit experiment.When someone watches a subatomic particle or a bit of light pass through the slits, the particle behaves like a bullet, passing through one hole or the other. But if no one observes the particle, it exhibits the behavior of a wave that can inhabit all possibilities — including somehow passing through both holes at the same time.<br />
Some of the greatest physicists have described these results as so confounding they are impossible to comprehend fully, beyond the reach of metaphor, visualization, and language itself. But there is another interpretation that makes them sensible. Instead of assuming a reality that predates life and even creates it, we propose a biocentric picture of reality. From this point of view, life — particularly consciousness — creates the universe, and the universe could not exist without us.<br />

Placing humans on a pedestal reifies terracentric survival driven values and disables a postmodern cosmology from developing.<br />
Zimmerman 02 - Professor of Philosophy at Tulane [Michael. “Encountering Alien Otherness,” The Concept of the Foreign, Lexington Books]<br />
Many Enlightenment thinkers, showing the influence of the Biblical tradition, emphasized that man was special because he alone was endowed with reason and moral freedom, by virtue of which (so concluded a number of lumières) he has the right to dominate the planet to further human progress. Following Nietzsche, however, who warned of the nihilism resulting from a scientific-utilitarian cosmology, Heidegger (and others) argued that technological man frames the world such that entities can reveal themselves only in terms amenable to his own categories and instrumental goals. Instead of being the object of the gaze of the classical gods or the Biblical creator, modern man elevated himself to the status of all-seeing subject, for whom the world is merely an object to be known and controlled for human ends. Eventually disclosing even himself as a complex natural entity, technological man becomes the laborer who is disciplined for and consumed in the process of gaining control of the planet, and eventually of the universe. The truculent character of this project suggests that technological man is &quot;acting out,&quot; so as to conceal something from himself, namely, that the technological project will not succeed in achieving Western man's goal of immortality. In this discussion of Western anthropocentrism, I hasten to add that many educated moderns, including Enlightenment philosopher-scientists such as Kant, have been enthralled by the possibility extraterrestrial intelligence. Progressive thinkers believed that discovery of E.T.s would show that the cosmos is in fact everywhere evolving toward greater complexity, differentiation, and freedom. Darwinists such Jacques Monod and Stephen Jay Gould are far more skeptical about the existence of E.T.s, however, because evolutionary processes are allegedly so subject to random events, that life would probably never again emerge even on Earth, should life be extinguished here, much less on other planets. By devising a cosmology in which human life is a weird accident, modern science has not only discouraged belief in God and cosmic purpose, but has also encouraged people to conceive of human life primarily in terms of survival, for which the acquisition of power over others is essential. Contrary to such Darwinism, however, postmodern cosmologists maintain that the basic structures of the universe tend to promote the progressive emergence of ever more complex systems, including intelligent life. Physicist Paul Davies opines that the most important upshot of the discovery of extraterrestrial life would be to restore to human beings something of the dignity of which science has robbed them. Far from exposing Homo sapiens as an inferior creature in the vast cosmos, the certain existence of alien beings would give us cause to believe that we, in our humble way, are part of a larger, majestic process of cosmic self-knowledge. Despite significant modern interest in E.T.s, and despite the fact that a progressive postmodern cosmology is beginning to come into its own, Western institutions, ideologies, and philosophies, including much of contemporary continental philosophy, despite its vaunted &quot;anti-humanism.&quot; Elements of anthropocentrism (or at least terracentrism) is discernible not only in the work of outspoken humanists like Sartre, but also in the writings of Heidegger, Levinas, Derrida, and Foucault. Most continental philosophers have agreed (though often in highly qualified and indirect ways) that humans are the most intelligent (or linguistically endowed, ontologically open, guilty, creative/productive, self-conscious) of all beings. Early Heidegger, for example, radically distinguished between human Dasein and other entities. Lacking human language, he maintained, animals cannot constitute a &quot;world&quot; in which entities can be encountered as entities. Describing solipsism as a psuedo-problem, he insisted that human Dasein is always already &quot;with&quot; others in a world of shared concern. Even in later years, as he sought to overcome a residual anthropocentrism, Heidegger insisted that an abyss lies between animals and humans, who alone are appropriated capable of &quot;dwelling on the earth.&quot; Hence, he ignored the possibility that other beings--including dolphins and whales, not to mention extraterrestrials--may be endowed with ontologically disclosive capacities analogous to and possibly even superior to our own. Opposed to space exploration, he was horrified by photos taken of the hidden side of the Moon by a space probe. Until recently, the status of non-human others was only infrequently addressed by continental philosophers, including those, such as Levinas and Derrida, who have explored in much greater depth than did Heidegger the moral claims that the other makes upon me, the socio-linguistic constitution of self and other, and how the binary of majority (&quot;self&quot;) vs. minority (&quot;other&quot;) is used to justify oppression. In his ethics of heteronomy, Levinas argues that the look of the other makes upon me a moral claim, obligating me to intervene on behalf of the weak and oppressed. Though such attempts to emphasize the other are laudable, they have assumed that only human beings constitute the class of the &quot;other&quot;. This assumption has legitimated harsh and even contemptuous treatment of living nature. Recently, however, some continental philosophers have begun questioning the anthropocentric assumptions which deny that animals can be &quot;other&quot; to humankind, and which thereby routinely exclude animals from the moral landscape. In Daimon Life, for example, David Krell challenges Heidegger's suggestive, but tendentious analysis of the being of animals. Further, Derrida has begun speaking critically of the Jewish-Greek-Christian &quot;carno-phallogocentrism,&quot; a &quot;sacrificial economy&quot; that involves human-centered, meat-eating acts of slaughter. Commenting on Derrida, John D. Caputo notes that Heidegger and Levinas, despite their great differences, share &quot;a common devalorizing of the animal....&quot; Attempts sharply to discriminate between humans and animals ultimately fail, Caputo asserts. &quot;Killing tends to generalize itself. Killing (other) animals bleeds into killing other people. The dominant scheme is a generalized anthropophagic, man-eating violence.&quot; Though challenging one assumption of anthropocentrism, namely, that humans are &quot;above&quot; animals, Caputo is not ready to challenge another assumption, namely, that there are no entities &quot;above&quot; humankind. Echoing the despair associated with Western nihilism, reinforced a century ago by the conclusion that our entropic universe will eventually suffer &quot;heat death,&quot; Caputo maintains that Kant's &quot;starry sky&quot; fills him not with awe, but instead reminds him that the cosmos--&quot;so much will to power,... a veritable monster of energy, decreasing here, increasing there, blessing itself in its sheer innocence&quot;--is indifferent to &quot;our fragile mortal fates.&quot; Caputo writes that &quot;No one we know of knows we are here, on the little star. We are like orphans--and widows and strangers. The stars do not care, do not take care of us. We are disasters all.&quot; Lost in a monstrous, dying universe from which the gods have fled, we frail humans feel ourselves to be suffering &quot;others,&quot; but there is no one--no higher &quot;self&quot;--to affirm our humanity and to intercede on our behalf. Though emphasizing human weakness, Caputo seems to think that human intelligence--even if less grandiose than as customarily envisioned by anthropocentric humanists--still leaves us alone at the top of the dying, meaningless cosmic heap. In echoing in certain (but by no means all) respects Nietzsche's fatalism and fin de siècle despondency, Caputo ignores the postmodern cosmology that, as we discussed earlier, maintains that the universe exhibits a nisus toward ever greater complexity, differentiation, and consciousness. That the universe may be evolving so as to become self-conscious suggests that there is meaning in cosmic history. Far from being a sheer accident, human life may be only one of many instances of self-conscious life have evolved in the universe, the number of whose galaxies has been increased tenfold according to photos recently taken by the Hubble Telescope.<br />

We HUMANS ARE at the center of a vast, cosmic adventure. Earth is four and a half billion years old, and its future stretches out for billions more years. Although the sun is slowly getting hotter, it will provide Earth with a perfectly livable amount of heat and light for at least several hundred million years1—an almost unimaginably long time. As the sun slowly heats up, our descendants will have plenty of time— millions of generations—to move to another suitable planetary system or move Earth farther from the sun.2 Eventually, in about six billion years, the sun will evolve into a red giant star that will swallow the inner planets Mercury and Venus. Around that time, our Milky Way will be colliding with the other big galaxy in our Local Group, the great galaxy in Andromeda. But since the distance between individual stars is so great compared to their sizes, almost no stars will actually collide as these two large galaxies join over about a billion years to form a new elliptical galaxy.3 New stars will continue to form in the united galaxy of Milky Andromeda, although more slowly. The smaller stars will continue to shine for many hundreds of billions of years, and at least some of their planets will be habitable. Thus our descendants could have many billions of years to live together—if we can just get through the next few decades without disaster. This is the challenge to the human species today: it is as though we are on a great migration across a huge and treacherous mountain range. To get through these mountains we must gain control of human impacts on the earth and develop a sustainable relationship with our planet. The higher we are all forced to climb, the more dangerous it becomes and the more people will fall into crevasses and off cliffs or die from lack of oxygen. We need to find the lowest possible openings between the rocks. We have neither experience nor a reliable map, and we’re dragging tons of baggage. We may have to jettison some of it and tie ourselves together to survive. But the goal of a sustainable global civilization is worth it. This chapter is about re-envisioning the world through new metaphors that can help us begin to think cosmically about the future of our planet. “Thinking cosmically” doesn’t require zipping around the Galaxy visiting aliens. It simply means integrating the new cosmic reality into our thinking whenever we try to understand what’s going on in our world. Earth as a planet is integrated into the cosmos, but our current thinking about it is not, and therein lies the root of many problems: we are out of tune with our planet and our universe. People today are still picturing a Newtonian universe, or in some cases even a medieval earth- centered universe, while exploiting technologies based on relativity quantum mechanics, and other new science. The major threats to human survival today—world environmental degradation, extinction of species, climate destabilization, nuclear war, terrorists with weapons of mass destruction—result from unrestrained use of such new technologies without a cosmology that makes sense of the nature and scale of their power. Today many people whose destructive acts may reverberate for thousands and possibly millions of years are thinking on minuscule time- scales and therefore only see short-term costs and benefits as real. One reason for this is that human beings can only perceive threats that make sense in their cosmology. For example, no one in medieval Europe recorded the sudden appearance in 1054 of a new star in the sky that burned so brightly it could be seen in daytime. In their cosmology of eternally unchanging crystal spheres such a new star was inconceivable. We know there was a supernova then because Chinese astronomers and others recorded it; they were living in a different cosmology.4 With modem technologies, we are exercising power the long-term effects of which are as invisible to us as the 1054 supernova was to medieval Europe. As the figure below shows, a typical person in the United States uses his or her weight in materials, fuel, and food every day. For every-one in the world to reach present U.S. levels of consumption, as billions aspire to do, would with present technology require four more planet Earths.6 Increases in greenhouse gases are now causing worldwide climate changes,7 the effects of which we are already seeing in the form of record-breaking hurricanes, deadly heat waves, and the melting of the polar icecaps. We are running out of fresh water and topsoil worldwide. 8 We have destroyed more than half of the earth’s forests and wetlands, and we are appropriating for human consumption a large and increasing fraction of the biological productivity of the entire earth.9 Our actions are killing not just individual organisms but wiping out entire species at the greatest rate since the extinction of the dinosaurs and many other species 65 million years ago. We are only adding height to the mountains we must cross. There is also a second reason why people today don’t see long-term consequences: the still-dominant Newtonian cosmology implies that humans are of no particular significance in the universe. This reinforces our collective irresponsibility, because if we are of no significance, how much of a problem can our actions really be? Some people embrace time-myopia for religious reasons, because they think “the end” is coming soon. Some do it for financial reasons, because the quarterly bottom line is their highest standard. Some do it in pursuit of power, because nothing matters beyond the next election. But most people simply don’t know yet how to think any other way. Thus our popular cosmology cannot explain our world, and we think it doesn’t matter anyway. We try as a culture to ground ourselves in each other, rather than in the earth and the universe, but we might as well try to stand still in a riptide. We humans need to ground ourselves in something real that is greater than we are. The new universe is as real as anything can be. It’s happening here on Earth, as it is everywhere— that’s why our technologies work! But cosmic truths will be useless if they are merely Post-it notes stuck on a Newtonian image of reality. If we want to survive and thrive, we must factor such truths, to the extent we understand them, into our policies, plans, and actions. Thinking cosmically can change our behavior globally, but to think cosmically we must begin to see through cosmic metaphors. By “cosmic metaphors” we don’t mean just figures of speech but mental reframings of reality itself.<br />

a. Judicial incorporation of international law into US domestic law diminishes the rule of law<br />
Kochan 2006 (Donald J., professor of law at Chapman University School of Law, “Sovereignty and the American Courts at the Cocktail Party of International Law: The Dangers of Domestic Judicial Invocations of Foreign and International Law,” 29 Fordham Int’l L.J. 507, p. Lexis) pitt-mf<br />
<br />
There are multiple problems with the judiciary's reliance on extraterritorial and extra-constitutional foreign or international sources to guide its decisions. 9 Perhaps the most fundamental flaw is its interference with rule of law values. 10 To borrow from [*509] Judge Harold Leventhal, the use of international sources in judicial decision-making might be described as &quot;the equivalent of entering a crowded cocktail party and looking over the heads of the guests for one's friends.&quot; 11 When judges are allowed to cherry-pick from laws around the world to define and interpret their laws at home, activism is emboldened and the rule of law is diminished. 12  The &quot;cocktail party&quot; analogy and debate recently reached the U.S. Senate floor when the newly appointed Chief Justice John Roberts went through his confirmation hearings. 13 Responding to questions on the trend of using foreign or international laws, Chief Justice Roberts rejected its legitimacy and cautioned its dangers:  Domestic precedent can confine and shape the discretion of the judges. Foreign law, you can find anything you want. If you don't find it in the decisions of France or Italy, it's in the decisions of Somalia or Japan or Indonesia or wherever. As somebody said in another context, looking at foreign law for support is like looking out over a crowd and picking out your friends. You can find them. They're there. And that actually expands the discretion of the judge. It allows the judge to incorporate his or her own personal preferences, cloak them [*510] with the authority of precedent - because they're finding precedent in foreign law - and use that to determine the meaning of the Constitution. 14<br />

b. Collapse of rule of law results in unchecked power that risks nuclear war and extinction<br />
Forrester 89 - Professor, Hastings College of the Law (Ray, August 1989, ESSAY: Presidential Wars in the Nuclear Age: An Unresolved Problem, 57 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 1636)<br />
There is a recurring relevation of a paranoia of power throughout human history that has impelled one leader after another to draw their people into wars which, in hindsight, were foolish, unnecessary, and, in some instances, downright insane. Whatever may be the psychological influences that drive the single decisionmaker to these irrational commitments of the lives and fortunes of others, the fact remains that the behavior is a predictable one in any government that does not provide an effective check and balance against uncontrolled power in the hands of one human. We, naturally, like to think that our leaders are above such irrational behavior. Eventually, however, human nature, with all its weakness, asserts itself whatever the setting. At least that is the evidence that experience and history give us, even in our own relatively benign society, where the Executive is subject to the rule of law. [*1640] Vietnam and other more recent engagements show that it can happen and has happened here. But the &quot;nuclear football&quot;--the ominous &quot;black bag&quot; --remains in the sole possession of the President. And, most important, his decision to launch a nuclear missile would be, in fact if not in law, a declaration of nuclear war, one which the nation and, indeed, humanity in general, probably would be unable to survive.<br />

2. Turn- democracy- a. Democracy coming now<br />
Moore 2004 (John Norton, professor of law at UVA, “Beyond the Democratic Peace: Solving the War Puzzle,” 44 Va. J. Int’l L. 341, p. Lexis) pitt-mf<br />
This evidence of the relationship between government structures and performance on the principal goals of mankind, some of it initially funded and disseminated by the United States Institute of Peace, is so compelling that leaders all over the world now pepper their speeches with references to democracy and the rule of law. The Clinton administration had made &quot;democracy enlargement&quot; the core intellectual theme of its foreign policy. And the World Bank has unmistakably shifted to understanding that the key fundament for economic development is not resources, infrastructure, or even education, but rather government structures, the rule of law, and levels of human freedom in economic matters. By itself the evidence of the advantages of government rooted in democracy and the rule of law is sufficiently compelling that democracy enlargement certainly should be a long term or milieu goal of every nation. Indeed, the United States in the National Endowment for Democracy, the United Kingdom in the Westminster Foundation, and other European allies have already built into their foreign policies at least some mechanism for encouragement of democracy. 41 And two years ago, under the influence of a Freedom [*352] House initiative, Warsaw witnessed an impressive gathering committed to democracy in the first meeting of the &quot;Community of Democracies.&quot; 42 Most recently, in July 2001, German Chancellor Gerhard Schr&lt;um o&gt;der and Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji have agreed to a two-year program for a dialogue on democratic governance.<br />

b. Incorporation of international law erodes US democracy by removing citizens from decisions of law<br />
Kochan 2006 (Donald J., professor of law at Chapman University School of Law, “Sovereignty and the American Courts at the Cocktail Party of International Law: The Dangers of Domestic Judicial Invocations of Foreign and International Law,” 29 Fordham Int’l L.J. 507, p. Lexis) pitt-mf<br />
These historical references underscore the idea that democracy demands that the people be the masters of their own domain. Judicial injection of foreign and supposed international law violates this principle and denigrates the reverence many have had for the uniqueness of the U.S. system. Federal judges are largely unaccountable to democratic controls. 172 Thus, the allowance for judges to adopt or import foreign laws presents them with un-democratic lawmaking power. The foundation of democratic governance lies in the people's ability, responsibility, and power to create law or control the mechanisms by which law is created. 173 Democratic control is lost when sources outside the domestic political processes serve as the bases of decision. Kenneth Anderson accurately opines that the government in the United States receives its consent from the people and should be constrained by their expressed judgment as to what laws should and should not exist: Without fidelity to the principle of democratic, self-governing provenance over substantive content in the utilization of constitutional adjudicatory materials, a court becomes merely a purveyor of its own view of best policy. Yet this is not solely an issue of an unconstrained Court. It is, more importantly, a violation of the compact between government and governed, free people who choose to give up a measure of their liberties [*549] in return for the benefits of government - a particular pact with a particular community, in which the materials used in the countermajoritarian act of judging them nonetheless have, in some fashion, even indirectly, democratic provenance and consent. 174<br />

c. US democracy is modeled internationally<br />

<em>Hemispheres: How did the recent U.S. elections affect credibility abroad? IRI: I think overall [that] it was very positive.

Certainly there was a lot of international comment, but every single person that I dealt with overseas, both before this election and after the election, says there’s a reason they want us there. They know the United States is a model for democracy, and if anything, I think this last election demonstrates that. While there has certainly been plenty of comment about it, overall I think it has been very positive.</em><br />

<em>d. Democracy is key to prevent multiple scenarios for extinction</em><br />
<em>Diamond 95 - Hoover Institution senior fellow, co-editor of the Journal of Democracy (Larry Diamond, December 1995, A Report to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, “Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and Instruments, Issues and Imperatives,”)</em><br />
<em>This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of tenuous, democratic ones. Nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons continue to proliferate. The very source of life on Earth, the global ecosystem, appears increasingly endangered. Most of these new and unconventional threats to security are associated with or aggravated by the weakness or absence of democracy, with its provisions for legality, accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. The experience of this century offers important lessons. Countries that govern themselves in a truly democratic fashion do not go to war with one another. They do not aggress against their neighbors to aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. Democratic governments do not ethnically &quot;cleanse&quot; their own populations, and they are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency. Democracies do not sponsor terrorism against one another. They do not build weapons of mass destruction to use on or to threaten one another. Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates for investment. They are more environmentally responsible because they must answer to their own citizens, who organize to protest the destruction of their environments. They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable foundation on which a new world order of international security and prosperity can be built.</em><br />

<em>Further, subject matter jurisdiction under the statute is limited to a small number of norms of customary international law and jus cogens, and does not cover all human rights and environmental abuses. 212 In particular, courts have been reluctant [*36] to extend the ATS to environmental harms. 213 Foreign claimants must explore other bases for subject matter jurisdiction, even when human rights and environmental abuses are involved. 214 The importance of environmental claims is highlighted by the fact that many of the allegations of corporate misdeeds center on environmental abuses. Some scholars believe that the ATS should cover environment-related cases on the grounds that a right to a clean environment exists in international law. 215 Even cases that fit the ATS rarely make their way to U.S. courts because of financial costs and other constraints. Thus, many victims are left without an effective remedy.</em><br />

The environment has been linked to women's rights through several [*330] U.N. Conferences, the most significant of which was the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, with its associated Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. 244 The Beijing Declaration, a legally non-binding document, 245 addresses human rights issues affecting the condition of women around the world. In particular, environmental concerns are linked to women's rights through the effects of poverty on women. 246 Within the Chapters of the Declaration, it is suggested that the eradication of poverty and its particular burden on women should be based on sustainable development and environmental protection, as set forth in the Rio Declaration; 247 that the human rights of women are an inalienable and indivisible part of universal human rights, with the rights of indigenous women particularly emphasized; 248 and that environmental threats to women are recognized as both local (e.g., urban and rural poverty issues) and global (e.g., global warming). 249 [*331] Two additional instruments that link the rights of women to the environment are the Rio Declaration 250 and Agenda 21, 251 while the Vienna Declaration firmly declares the rights of women to be an inalienable part of human rights. 252<br />

c. ATS litigation results in depressed US economy<br />
Duruigbo 2004 (Emeka, Research Fellow at Standford University’s Program on Energy and Sustainable Development at the Center for Environmental Science and Policy, “The Economic Cost of Alien Tort Litigation: A Response to Awakening Monster: The Alien Tort Statute of 1789,” 14 Minn. J. Global Trade 1, p. Lexis) // pitt-mf<br />
A hallmark of Awakening Monster is its preoccupation with the economic implications of the continued use of the ATS to sue multinational corporations that are based in, or have a connection to, the United States. The observation has been made that international litigation confers some economic and non-economic benefits on the forum State. According to Cheshire and North's Private International Law, &quot;when foreigners litigate in England, this forms valuable invisible export, and confirms judicial pride in the English legal system.&quot; 148 The current wave of international litigation in U.S. courts is viewed in some quarters as tantamount to an export of U.S. legal values and an American conception of law, similar to what Britain did in the nineteenth century. 149 The authors of the Awakening Monster stake an opposite and opposing position: that cases brought by foreign litigants under the ATS portend serious economic consequences for the United States. 150 They construct what they refer to as a &quot;nightmare scenario&quot; that could become a reality if adequate [*26] measures are not instituted to check the disturbing trend. 151 Noting that trade ties, foreign direct investment (FDI), and extension of credit to government agencies could expose a company to liability under the ATS, the authors begin to take stock of what such economic connections could mean for American businesses. 152 With a U.S. FDI stock of $ 220 billion in target countries and world FDI stock of about $ 1,365 billion in these countries, a lot of money is involved. 153 Additionally, target countries hold a total public debt of $ 1,229 billion. 154 While some of the debt is owed to international lending agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which are immune to ATS litigation, more than half of the debt represents credit extended by private lenders. 155 Thus, these private creditors, usually international banks, also face exposure to suits for public and publicly guaranteed debts owed by target countries. 156 Some insurance companies and investment trusts are also exposed through their bond holdings. 157 The authors believe that ATS litigation could do enormous damage to U.S. trade and foreign investment. 158 Support can be found from both the pro-ATS and anti-ATS camps for the proposition that ATS litigation operates as a form of economic sanction on countries allegedly perpetrating human rights abuses. 159 The authors use the issue of sanctions to illustrate the lurking [*27] dangers: A parameter that can help size up the potential damage to trade flows can be drawn from the analysis of economic sanctions. Gravity model estimates indicate that extensive economic sanctions depress U.S. trade (merchandise imports and exports) with target countries by more than 95 percent. ATS litigation would not depress trade to nearly the same extent, but billion-dollar awards, predicated on corporate trade with the target country, would certainly dampen commerce. Trade tainted with links to the foreign government - oil and mineral imports, and exports to government agencies - would be most affected by the ATS. 160 Going by the assumption of a ten-percent depression of overall U.S. trade in target countries from current levels as a result of ATS litigation, there is the possibility of a loss of $ 42 billion in U.S. imports and $ 21 billion in U.S. exports. In the case of the industries they consider to be the most vulnerable to ATS suits, such as oil and minerals, they envisage a 50% depression in U.S. imports of oil and minerals and U.S. exports to government agencies. This prediction translates to about $ 37 billion loss in U.S. imports and a $ 13 billion loss in U.S. exports. 161 Manufactured goods constitute the bulk of these exports. Based on data that indicate that $ 1 billion of manufactured shipments keep approximately 8,300 U.S. manufacturing workers employed, over 100,000 jobs could be put at risk due to litigation under the ATS. 162<br />

d. US key to the global economy<br />
Caploe 09 (David Caploe is CEO of the Singapore-incorporated American Centre for Applied Liberal Arts and Humanities in Asia., “Focus still on America to lead global recovery”, April 7, The Strait Times, lexis)<br />
IN THE aftermath of the G-20 summit, most observers seem to have missed perhaps the most crucial statement of the entire event, made by United States President Barack Obama at his pre-conference meeting with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown: 'The world has become accustomed to the US being a voracious consumer market, the engine that drives a lot of economic growth worldwide,' he said. 'If there is going to be renewed growth, it just can't be the US as the engine.' While superficially sensible, this view is deeply problematic. To begin with, it ignores the fact that the global economy has in fact been 'America-centred' for more than 60 years. Countries - China, Japan, Canada, Brazil, Korea, Mexico and so on - either sell to the US or they sell to countries that sell to the US. This system has generally been advantageous for all concerned. America gained certain historically unprecedented benefits, but the system also enabled participating countries - first in Western Europe and Japan, and later, many in the Third World - to achieve undreamt-of prosperity. At the same time, this deep inter-connection between the US and the rest of the world also explains how the collapse of a relatively small sector of the US economy - 'sub-prime' housing, logarithmically exponentialised by Wall Street's ingenious chicanery - has cascaded into the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression. To put it simply, Mr Obama doesn't seem to understand that there is no other engine for the world economy - and hasn't been for the last six decades. If the US does not drive global economic growth, growth is not going to happen. Thus, US policies to deal with the current crisis are critical not just domestically, but also to the entire world. Consequently, it is a matter of global concern that the Obama administration seems to be following Japan's 'model' from the 1990s: allowing major banks to avoid declaring massive losses openly and transparently, and so perpetuating 'zombie' banks - technically alive but in reality dead. As analysts like Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have pointed out, the administration's unwillingness to confront US banks is the main reason why they are continuing their increasingly inexplicable credit freeze, thus ravaging the American and global economies.<br />

e. Impact is extinction.<br />
Mead 09 [Walter Russell, Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, “Only Makes You Stronger: Why the recession bolstered America.” New Republic, February 4]<br />
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />

The call to the debate community to _ rests on the debate community taking action. However, the aff posits themselves as the agents while their advocacy posits themselves as the object. This means their solvency hinges on the community including them in the first place. This makes their project the starting point and end point, which further entrenches their meaning into the fluidity of the debate community’s search for the new thing.<br />

Mann in 95. Paul. Professor @ Pomona. “Stupid Undergrounds.” Postmodern Culture. May 1995<br />
We cannot leave this icon without noting another of its elements: the serial character of the stupid guru, the rock star, the &quot;role model&quot;: never an absolute master, because he can be exchanged at any moment for another figure, another other; he is a place holder for a rapidly shifting field of empty, ephemeral, and tenuous attachments. No viable cult will ever grow around him, only an ever-shattering hall of mirrors, a high-velocity phase-space of weak and yet perpetual narcissistic identifications. One surfs through stupid gurus, as one surfs through cable channels or the channels in the video-porno booth, in a process that is the very model of the entropy of such attachments, always in search for the next one, the true and proper identification, which never arrives, which the process itself realizes as unrealizable, until desire is distributed and dissipated across the entire field. I have on my desk a volume entitled Threat By Example, a series of brief interviews with &quot;inspiring&quot; figures from the &quot;punk underground.&quot;21 The format of the book--pictures and interviews lasting no more than a page or two, followed immediately by another, and another, and another--formalizes the linear movement of this narcissistic guru-surfing: continuous deferral to the promise of a greater imminent satisfaction that never occurs, until the velocity of selection itself becomes the empty signifier of the Other. The accelerated substitution of figures of power, authority, and identification reveals, by a kind of cinematic effect, the hollow at their center, but without thereby releasing us from their hold. The fabled abyss is flattened out, but it is no less fantastic or fatal.<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s insistence on making the past appear is an elimination of the possibility of disappearance, silence, and tactical approaches.<br />
<br />
Mann 95 - Professor of Literature (Paul Mann, professor of Literature at Pomona College, May 1995, “Stupid Undergrounds”, Postmodern Culture, Vol. 5, No. 3)<br />
Nothing could be more quintessentially American than the stupid underground. It is more basic, more historical, than all the structures and pseudo-guarantees of liberal democracy. If America as such can be mythologized as a nation of dropouts and a shadow underground of Europe, it also immediately begins to generate its own dropouts--a subunderground that is the &quot;first&quot; of the stupid undergrounds, of those who went &quot;native,&quot; which is to say: disappeared. The stupid underground is the latest bordertown, the liminal scene of this disappearance, and of the becoming-imperceptible of American history itself. This history has always moved simultaneously toward the spectacle and toward the invisible; that is why there is a familiarly native intensity to the figure of the solitary, hermetic hacker jacked into the so-called Net. It is also why two stories could be told by those who found this legend carved into a tree at Roanoke: Gone to Croatan. The standard history text tells us that no one knows what &quot;Croatan&quot; means, that the settlers disappeared. But other accounts claim that everyone knew Croatan was the name of a local tribe, and the message quite clearly stipulated that the settlers had gone to join it; the official suppression of this fact is only a sign of the sort of racism that was as likely to execute people who had lived with Indians as it was to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; them.8 It is as if someone stood before that tree and deliberately misunderstood its message, didn't want to know or admit where the colony had gone. We have, in other words, two thin myths: the racist one and the romantic-racialist one, wherein going native and mixing races is by itself a kind of Rousseauian good. Now it will be argued that the revisonary account is not only truer but better, since it liberates a suppressed fact and casts the native other in a more positive light. But perhaps we should not abandon the old textbook version too quickly. If it functions, at one level, merely as further proof, as if we needed one, of the racist suppression of the facts of American history, it remains, in another way, quite seductive: it might once have been possible to disappear from the screens of history, to leave only an indecipherable trace, only the mark of a secret that points toward an invisibility that we should not be too quick to correct. But once again critical intelligence has stupidly closed off an exit.<br />
<br />
The institution of debate is inextricably intertwined with our own position within academic institutions. This affiliation means that our resistance is not only ineffective, but actually counterproductive, turning debate into a R&amp;D agency for new weapons to be deployed by the institution against resistance. We must seek tactical forms of resistance<br />
<br />
Mann 96 - Professor of Literature (Paul Mann, professor of Literature at Pomona College, January 1996, “The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare”, Postmodern Culture, Vol: 6, No: 2)<br />
Without exception, all positions are oriented toward the institutional apparatus. Marginality here is only relative and temporary: the moment black studies or women's studies or queer theory conceives of itself as a discipline, its primary orientation is toward the institution. The fact that the institution might treat it badly hardly constitutes an ethical privilege. Any intellectual who holds a position is a function of this apparatus; his or her marginality is, for the most part, only an operational device. It is a critical commonplace that the state is not a monolithic hegemony but rather a constellation of disorganized and fragmentary agencies of production. This is often taken as a validation for the political potential of marginal critical movements: inside-outside relations can be facilely deconstructed and critics can still congratulate themselves on their &quot;resistance.&quot; But the contrary is clearly the case. The most profitable intellectual production does not take place at the center (e.g., Romance Philology), where mostly obsolete weapons are produced; the real growth industries are located precisely on the self-proclaimed margins. It will be argued that resistance is still possible; nothing I propose here argues against such a possibility. I wish only to insist that effective resistance will never be located in the position, however oppositional it imagines itself to be. Resistance is first of all a function of the apparatus itself. What would seem to be the transgressive potential of such institutional agencies as certain orders of gender criticism might demonstrate the entropy of the institution, but it does nothing to prove the counterpolitical claims of the position. Fantasies of resistance often serve as alibis for collusion. Any position is a state agency, and its relative marginality is a mode of orientation, not an exception. Effective resistance must be located in other tactical forms.<br />
<br />
Their wish to represent past atrocities is an attempt to assume the place and authority of the dead. This approach is the most aggressive attempt approach. Every discourse of the other brings us in confrontation with the absolute otherness of the other. This means they can’t solve, their representations of past atrocities still leaves us distinct from the people they describe, they are never humans to us<br />
<br />
Mann 96 - Prof of Literature (Paul Mann, professor of Literature at Pomona College, 1994, “Masocriticism”, Substance, Vol. 23, No. 3)<br />
32. The critic, the interpreter, the translator, wants to speak for the dead, to subject himself to a truth he instructs the dead to teach us. To speak for the dead is to identify with the dead. In some sense to wish oneself dead. One assumes (in every sense of the word) the place of the dead, assumes their authority and their absence, their historicity and the fixity of their discourse. That is why criticism has often seemed a priestly discipline: it poses as a hierophany of the dead. One gives oneself over, displaces oneself through some critical meth- odology, in order to represent the other, to speak the other's voice. (No one really believes this for an instant.) But the cold lesson of masocritical science is that nothing is more aggressive than the desire to serve the other. The refusal to speak any longer for dead white European males chan- ges nothing. Every discourse of the other is a discourse against the other. The arrangements remain the same: someone is always sacrificed so that we can pretend to take the place of the dead. But the dead never appear. The text never recognizes us. It neither assents to nor dissents from our reading, our desire. Whatever validations we establish, it remains silent throughout our reading. At the end of each reading it returns as a Greek. At the end of each masocritical scene one is abandoned to the absolute otherness of the other. One suffers an utter loss of agency, out of and against which a new scene or new reading must be projected. Only the dead speak, but they speak to us through our own voices, and what they say is the end of language. And we pretend to hear them and never hear them and do their will, or something else. 33. Everything is true, nothing is permitted<br />
<br />
Turning criticism on itself is like the mythical bird that flies in ever tighter circles until it disappears up its own asshole. We offer the possibility of disappearance, even if it is through the painful and humiliating method of masocriticism.<br />
<br />
Mann 95 - Professor of Literature (Paul Mann, professor of Literature at Pomona College, May 1995, “Stupid Undergrounds”, Postmodern Culture, Vol. 5, No. 3)<br />
Criticism as stupidity; the inanity of intelligence and the intelligence of inanity; the absurd hybrid of critical theory and blatant foolishness that today constitutes all that is left of the critical. One must assess the force of this stupidity without simply reasserting for oneself, however tacitly, the superiority of critical intelligence. Stupid is no more a term of derision here than it is a term of praise; it is crucial not to mistake this epithet for a gesture of rejection, an attempt to mark out and claim for oneself any critical distance. It indicates a cultural condition that can hardly be embraced but that the pathetic enterprise of criticism is powerless to overcome by the application of more rigorous intellectual tools. We are pursuing a logic for which we have no taste; it binds and tangles one's writing in the most maddening ways; but ultimately the stupid underground constitutes a critique of criticism that must be taken up, however aggravating it is, precisely because it is aggravating. The spectacle of the masocritic trying to give stupidity its due while thinking it through with all the proper rigor, using it to judge himself judging, to judge judgment itself, humiliating himself, elaborating his own discourse as the vehicle of a death that is anything but heroic or sublime: let us take this as the true spectacle of criticism. Stupid vigilance, resistance to what one has already made certain would occur, and would have occurred in any case. Such a project will appear to you merely frivolous, self-indulgently self-defeating, like the course of the fabulous bird that flies in tighter and tighter circles until it disappears up its own asshole. Masocriticism must not defend itself against this perfect and proper charge. What it seeks is precisely guilt by association, stupid abasement. If it is therefore impossible for me to be either on the side of this essay or at any remove from it, that is, for me, its &quot;value.&quot; Its ethical value: its stupid value.<br />

De-emphasizing the U.S. role in Asia via less deterrence improves the Japan-ROK alliance<br />

Second, from a U.S. as well as a regional perspective, one of the most important bilateral relationships in East Asia is the Korean-Japanese partnership. Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of Korea's colonization by Japan. Significant historical disputes exist but it's time to move forward. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has refused to exploit sporadic tensions in the Korean-Japanese relationship for political purposes and has expended political capital to ensure a closer partnership across the political, economic and even security sectors. As an expression of his commitment to fundamentally resetting his ties with Korea, Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama chose Seoul as his first foreign destination last month.<br />
Maintaining a robust U.S.-Japan alliance is crucial to buttressing stronger ties between Korea and Japan since the U.S. serves as a common security denominator for Seoul and Tokyo. The Korean-Japanese relationship was traditionally the weakest link in the U.S.-Japan-Korea triangle but that's no longer the case. As President Obama reconfigures strategic linkages with Prime Minister Hatoyama, he should bear in mind the powerful synergy that flows from this critical and comprehensive trilateral democratic partnership.<br />

Japan-ROK relations are key to check conflict escalation over Dokdo – causes escalating fish wars<br />

As the Cold War ended at the beginning of the 1990’s, the Takeshima/Dokdo issue resurfaced as an important factor in Japan-South Korean relations. One reason for this was that the U.N. Law of the Sea (LOS) with its 200 nautical-mile EEZ stipulation took effect. The small islands, which have caused disputes between Japan and its neighbors, have become considerably more important since the passage of the LOS in November 1994. The LOS gives states the right to claim EEZ’s within 200 nautical miles around their sovereign territory. And sovereignty gives states exclusive access to any oil reserves found within their EEZ’s.42<br />
This has considerably increased the significance of otherwise strategically and economically insignificant islands in the region. The disputed islands have been viewed as having far greater potential economic importance than was the case in the earlier period. Chinese marine research and oil drilling activities near the Senkakus/Diaoyus were factors in Japan’s decision to extend its 200 nautical-mile EEZ to the islands.43<br />
As regional populations grow and become more affluent, the demand for fish continues to rise, while fish stocks are declining due to overexploitation. One consequence is that access to fish stocks within the 200 nautical-mile EEZ has become a major issue in regional resource politics. What the Japanese saw as overfishing by Chinese and South Korean vessels in waters surrounding the disputed islands was an important factor in determining Tokyo’s decision to extend the EEZ to cover the disputed island waters. Competition over fishery resources obviously complicates efforts to resolve sovereignty questions, and the 1965 Japan-South Korea fisheries agreements are hopelessly out of date. If two states claim an EEZ and each seeks to defend its claim by preventing the fishing fleets of the rival claimant from fishing in its waters, the potential for conflict escalation is obvious.44<br />

Tension over Dokdo is imminent – will escalate<br />
Park 09 [Cheol Hee , Graduate School of International Studies (GSIS), Seoul National University, 10-30-2009, “The Pattern of Cooperation and Conflict between Korea and Japan: Theoretical Expectations and Empirical Realities” Japanese Journal of Political Studieshttp://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=6487420&amp;jid=JJP&amp;volumeId=10&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=6487412]<br />
A closer look at the realities, however, suggests that cooperation is not fully guaranteed. Unlike the rational expectations of realist optimism, the possibility of unwanted and unintended military conflicts between Korea and Japan cannot be discounted. Escalation of frictions concerning Dokdo/Takeshima is a possible area of concern. In 2006, when Japan dispatched a coastal guard ship to the Dokdo area, crisis was imminent. Military tension is probable in the context of rising nationalism related to territorial sovereignty. Emotional conflicts charged with nationalist fervor, if not controlled properly, can lead to irrational behaviors.<br />
The perception, not the reality, of Japan as a rapidly emerging regional military power can reshape the mindset of the Korean people. Ongoing suspicions over Japanese intent, as well as a lack of fully fledged trust in Japanese intentions can lead to spirals of prolonged conflict between the two countries. An assertive and proactive Japan may serve US interests in East Asia (Green, 2007), but Japan as an active state can generate rising tensions with its neighbors, including Korea (Arase, 2007: 582). Without transparency and accountability to neighboring countries, a Japanese assertive move, especially in the security arena, could bring about a vicious cycle of suspicion and loss of confidence between the two.<br />

Fish wars cause global instability<br />
Pomeroy et al 07 (Robert, Grant, University of Connecticut, John Parksb, Richard Pollnacc, Tammy Campsond, Emmanuel Genioe, Cliff Marlessyf, Elizabeth Holleg, Michael Pidoh, Ayut Nissapai, Somsak Boromthanarati, Nguyen Thu Huej ” Fish wars: Conflict and collaboration in fisheries management in Southeast Asia”, March, online at Science Direct)<br />
The result of overfishing and multiple sources of fishing pressure in Southeast Asian coastal waters is the reduction or collapse of important fishery populations, leading to high levels of conflict among different users over remaining stocks [12]. A complex, negative feedback cycle is created in this situation, whereby rapid population growth paralleled by fewer economic opportunities and access to land increases the number of people living in the coastal zone dependent on fishery resources and thus the number of fishers. Increased fishing pressure results in fish population declines and stock collapses and increased resource competition, both between fishers and scales of fishing operation (e.g., small vs. commercial). The result is reduced income and food security, increased poverty, and a lower overall standard of living and national welfare. This in turn drives users to employ more destructive and over efficient fishing technologies in the ‘‘rush’’ to catch what remains, thereby further depleting fishery populations. These factors lead to further increased user competition, and thus higher rates and probabilities of human conflict, over remaining stocks. This destructive cycle leads to a pattern of self-reinforcing ‘‘fish wars’’ with deteriorating social and environmental consequences. Decreasing fish stocks combined with increasing conflict are driving some people out of the fishery. This is leading to increasing unemployment in many rural areas. This added level of instability is thought to fuel national levels of social unrest and political instability, thereby acting as a powerful and destabilizing risk factor to regional and global security concerns. <br />

This goes nuclear<br />
Landay 00 [Jonathan S., national security and intelligence correspondent, March 10, 2k, Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service, Lexis]<br />
Few if any experts think China and Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea, or India and Pakistan are spoiling to fight. But even a minor miscalculation by any of them could destabilize Asia, jolt the global economy and even start a nuclear war. India, Pakistan and China all have nuclear weapons, and North Korea may have a few, too. Asia lacks the kinds of organizations, negotiations and diplomatic relationships that helped keep an uneasy peace for five decades in Cold War Europe. “Nowhere else on Earth are the stakes as high and relationships so fragile,” said Bates Gill, director of northeast Asian policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. “We see the convergence of great power interest overlaid with lingering confrontations with no institutionalized security mechanism in place. There are elements for potential disaster.” In an effort to cool the region’s tempers, President Clinton, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger all will hopscotch Asia’s capitals this month. For America, the stakes could hardly be higher. There are 100,000 U.S. troops in Asia committed to defending Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, and the United States would instantly become embroiled if Beijing moved against Taiwan or North Korea attacked South Korea. While Washington has no defense commitments to either India or Pakistan, a conflict between the two could end the global taboo against using nuclear weapons and demolish the already shaky international nonproliferation regime. In addition, globalization has made a stable Asia with its massive markets, cheap labor, exports and resources indispensable to the U.S. economy. Numerous U.S. firms and millions of American jobs depend on trade with Asia that totaled $600 billion last year, according to the Commerce Department.<br />

a. The Visa Application Process Generally, the admissions process involves three main steps. Unless the non-citizen must secure a labor certification or is part of a visa waiver [*57] program, the first step generally involves filing a visa petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). n8 The petitioner, who is usually an employer or a family member with USC or LPR status, files a visa petition on behalf of a non-citizen beneficiary who is seeking entry into the U.S. n9 The visa petition gives the beneficiary the opportunity to show that she falls into an appropriate visa category. n10 If the USCIS approves the petition, the information is provided to the National Visa Center (NVC), which then transmits it to the consular officer in the country of residence of the beneficiary. If the non-citizen is temporarily residing in the U.S., the non-citizen's last residence abroad serves as the appropriate consular district. The second step involves filing a visa application with the U.S. consulate in the appropriate country. The beneficiary must show that he falls into an appropriate visa category and that she is not subject to any of the inadmissibility grounds. The third step involves seeking admission to the U.S. at a valid port of entry. The beneficiary may be subjected to a final examination by a Customs and Border Patrol (CPB) officer. n11<br />

2. Violation: The affirmative changes beneficiary eligibility for &lt;&lt;insert visa&gt;&gt; and not the broader group. The affirmative does not specify what Title 8 ineligibility criteria they remove.<br />
<br />
3. Standards<br />
Limits: Allowing affs to change eligibility of single visa classifications allows a number of small affs, such as giving Australian E-3 visas to non-Australians. This allows any eligibility change to any of the 34 different visa affirmatives plus their combinations leaving the neg to always play catch up<br />
<br />
Ground: Allowing the additional 34 affirmatives only increases aff ground. The only comparable negative ground would be an increase in case specific strategies. The only generic disads are malthus and politics.<br />
<br />
Education: Literature addresses broad changes in immigration policies. Focusing the discussion on minute changes in things like Australian visas doesn’t check.<br />
Grammar: Our interpretation gives meaning to “its visas.” Each word in the resolution must have value and if they don’t meet part of the resolution, they don’t meet. Grammar is the only predictable way to read the resolution in context.<br />

Also related to the waiver issue is appellees' defense relying on a provision of the insurance policy that suspends coverage where the risk is increased by any means within the knowledge or control of the insured. However, the term &quot;increase&quot; connotes change. To show change, appellees would have been required to present evidence of the condition of the building at the time the policy was issued. See 5 J. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 2941 at 4-5 (1970). Because no such evidence was presented, this court cannot determine, on this record, whether the risk has, in fact, been increased. Indeed, the answer to this question may depend on Mr. Glassley's knowledge of the condition of the building at the time the policy was issued, see 17 J. Appleman &amp; J. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice, § 9602 at 515-16 (1981), since the fundamental issue is whether the appellees contemplated insuring the risk which incurred the loss.<br />

Justice Scalia says much in this brief excerpt. Before explaining my disagreement with that view, however, I will highlight the three major thoughts revealed in this passage. First, he asserts the primacy of statutory text. The words of a statute are not just the most authoritative, but the only definitive source of congressional intent. 21 The task for courts is not to determine the meaning of a &quot;statute&quot; by reference to events and statements that preceded, or even occasionally followed, the statute's enactment. Rather, the courts' job is to determine what particular &quot;words&quot; mean within the four corners of the statute itself. To accomplish this, judges are to depend exclusively on their own knowledge, perhaps with the aid of a dictionary, to determine the meaning of words in statutes, supplementing &quot;ordinary usage&quot; only by reference to the context in which the words are found within the statutes themselves. Second, Justice Scalia paints a thumbnail sketch explaining the justification of the textual approach. Because the text of the statute is the only thing that the legislators actually referred to when they [*283] voted, only the language itself was enacted into law. 22 Justice Scalia's views on this score were outlined with greater detail in Blanchard v. Bergeron, 23 where the Court confronted the question whether an award of a &quot;reasonable attorney's fee&quot; allowed under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 24 is limited to the amount provided in a contingent fee arrangement entered into by the plaintiff and his or her counsel. 25 Both the House and Senate reports on section 1988 had made explicit reference to a twelve-factor analysis of what constituted a &quot;reasonable&quot; fee set forth in a Fifth Circuit case decided before the statute's enactment. 26 <br />

A brief digression into a debate between the future Dr. Travis Taylor and Dr. Carl Sagan is given in Section 1.7. There are multiple points to this section — some subtle and some not so subtle. The major emphasis is that as a species we are accepting from the “popular science” community that the probability of an alien invasion does not really exist. Statistics argue against that position. The probability of an invasion is as equally likely as not being invaded when the limited knowledge at mankind’s disposal on the subject is considered. Perhaps as we understand the makeup of the universe better in the future we will understand the probabilities better. But for now, ignoring the probability is in essence “putting all our eggs in one basket” that the aliens either will not show up or if they do they will have “evolved above war” as is so often suggested by the Sagan philosophy. <br />

It is not known, scientifically, that UFOs are not ETs, and to reject the ETH is therefore to risk a Type II error in statistics, or rejecting a true explanation . Of course, this does not mean that UFOs are ETs, either (inviting a Type I error), but it shifts the burden of proof onto skeptics to show that a Type II error has not been made .33 The UFO taboo is then puzzling, and open to political critique. “There is No Evidence” Echoing Hume’s discussion of miracles, Carl Sagan once said about UFOs that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” and the empirical evidence for the ETH is certainly not that. If there is any ET signal in the noise of UFO reports it is very weak. However, some evidence warrants reasonable doubt. Physical evidence. Usually the first objection to the ETH is the lack of direct physical evidence of alien presence. Some ET believers contest this, claiming that the U.S. government is hiding wreckage from a 1947 crash at Roswell, New Mexico, but such claims are based on conspiracy theories that we shall set aside here. Not because they are necessarily wrong (although they cannot be falsified in the present context of UFO secrecy), but because like UFO skepticism they are anthropocentric, only now We know that UFOs are ETs but “They” (the government) aren’t telling. Such an assumption leads critique toward issues of official secrecy and away from the absence of systematic study, which is the real puzzle. In our view secrecy is a symptom of the UFO taboo, not its heart. While there is no direct physical evidence for the ETH , however, there is considerable indirect physical evidence for it, in the form of UFO anomalies that lack apparent conventional explanations —and for which ETs are therefore one possibility.34 These anomalies take four forms: ground traces, electro-magnetic interference with aircraft and motor vehicles, photographs and videos, and radar sightings like the Belgian F-16 case. Such anomalies cannot be dismissed simply because they are only indirect evidence for ETs, since science relies heavily on such evidence, as in the recent discovery of over 300 extra-solar planets (and counting).35 For if UFO anomalies are not potentially ETs, what else are they? Testimonial evidence. Most UFO reports consist primarily of eyewitness testimony . Although all observation is in a sense testimonial, by itself testimony cannot ground a scientific claim unless it can be replicated independently, which UFO testimony cannot. Such testimony is problematic in other respects as well. It reports seemingly impossible things, much is of poor quality, witnesses may have incentives to lie, honest observers may lack knowledge, and even experts can make mistakes. In view of these problems skeptics dismiss UFO testimony as meaningless. Problems notwithstanding, this conclusion is unwarranted. First, testimony should not be dismissed lightly, since none of us can verify for ourselves even a fraction of the knowledge we take for granted .36 In both law and social science, testimony has considerable epistemic weight in determining the facts . While sometimes wrong, given its importance in society, testimony is rejected only if there are strong reasons to do so. Second, <br />
<br />
there is a very large volume of UFO testimony, with some events witnessed by literally thousands of people . Third, some of these people were “expert witnesses ”— civilian and military pilots, air traffic controllers, astronauts, astronomers, and other scientists. Finally, some of this testimony is corroborated by physical evidence, as in “radar/visual” cases . In short, the empirical evidence alone does not warrant rejecting the ETH. It does not warrant acceptance either, but this sets the bar too high. <br />

As the visitor or as the visited, we will need to know how to engage ET. We will need rules of engagement. Those rules will vary according to the category of ET as discussed in Table 2.1 and the motivations given in Table 3.1. The comparison of the alien invaders to the data in these tables will also drive the first contact protocols given in Figure 2.19. It would be a shame to treat a Benevolent ET as a Hostile ET. We would risk losing the benefits of that benevolence . It could be a tragedy to treat a Hostile ET as we would a Benevolent ET. We could lose our civilization or worse - our lives including those of the entire population of Earth. This Is the fallacy of the SET1 approach of welcome one and all ETs to Earth, especially without preparation . Which, if any, ET will heed SETI’s invitation? We are unable to predict at this time, but we’d better hope for the best. We realize we mention this several times throughout this book, but there seems to be no greater point to make than we don’t know what is out there so we had better be careful who we invite to come visit us. Regardless of the category of ET the most significant challenge is that of determining the ETs intentions and then his military capabilities. If an alien invader shows up it might be easier to determine how best to deal with that invasion if we understand what they are after. This is the reason for this chapter. We should start thinking about what the alien wants and what it would take to get him to leave. If the invasion is from a mindless machine army bent on terraforming for future owners (von Neumann probes ) then the only motivation for them is to eat raw materials and build infrastructure (and/or self replicate) then move on to the next target. The only defense for that type of invasion is to destroy every single one of the probes. Understanding the motivation will help pick a tactic. A good science fiction example of this is Von Neumann ‘s War by John Ringo and Travis S. Taylor. <br />

ET is going to be uninformed with respect to the treaties and accords we use as RULES OF ENGAGEMENT when conducting war . At last inspection, ET was absent from the roster of NATO members. And they certainly have yet to be invited to join the ranks of the U nited N ations. Would he join if invited? He is outside our global political and diplomatic channels. One should expect that he will chose to stay outside those arenas. ET may have studied our gentlemanly rules for conducting warfare such as the Geneva Convention. However, as a nonparticipant in their development, he is free from those rules by which gentlemen try to make the horrible act of war at least somewhat civilized. In truth, war is ugly when we are unable to put a name or face on other combatants. Through our conventions and treaties, we have tried to make war civilized when combatants are face to face with the ability to recognize each other and especially when one clearly has the upper hand. We believe that it is lright to kill the nameless and faceless, but that we must respect the civil rights of the captured. ET may believe that war is brutal and cruel . He may believe that it is equally suitable to kill those under his control just as it is to brutalize and kill those he is unable to distinguish. He may act in total and complete opposition to our gentlemanly rules of engagement. He may even find that he can use our rules against us. Since we espouse that these rules are a part of our values, we are bound by them. After all, it has been said that values are so integral to our very being that we rarely, if ever, change them. We would be constrained by our rules of engagement even as ET is free to behave in a fashion consistent with his values. It would be inappropriate for us to criticize him for adhering to his values just as it would be inappropriate for him to criticize us for following our own. Then again, ET might simply consider us pests and plan to exterminate us. Do we consider the rules of engagement that warring fire ant colonies do when eradicating fire ant hills from our lawns? <br />

Article 24 creates the necessary protections for individuals who act as witnesses to crimes<br />
Avery 10 (Ryan, Summer 2010, “Fair Shake or an Offer They Can’t Refuse? The Protection of Cooperating Alien Witnesses under United States Law,” 33 Suffolk Transnat'l L. Rev. 347, Lexis, JAK)<br />
<br />
B. The Need for Article 24 Legislation Having exposed the inadequacy of legal remedies sought by cooperating alien witnesses in the past, the emergence of language from the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (CATOC) in federal court appears significant. n126 The conclusion here is simple: Article 24 of CATOC, which calls specifically for the protection of aliens assisting in the investigation of transnational crime, is the best method to protect that endangered class. n127 Due to an absence of statutory legislation implementing Article 24 within the United States and the non-self-executing nature of CATOC, it is clear that Article 24 currently lacks domestic force and must be provided meaning by way of federal statute. n128<br />
1. Absence of Sufficient Legislation in Place The language of CATOC Article 24 is strikingly similar in tone to that included within both CAT Article 1 and FARRA, the federal law that requires judicial review of CAT claims made pursuant to a final order of removal against an alien petitioner. n129 Unfortunately, no federal law currently extends such protection to applicants seeking witness protection under CATOC. n130 Close scrutiny reveals that Article 24 is moot and ineffective under federal law today, despite language from the [*372] executive branch disavowing the need for any further clarification or legislative action with respect to CATOC. n131<br />
Thus far, the only suggestion offered for incorporating Article 24 into domestic law has been to apply the state-created danger doctrine and invoke Fifth Amendment Due Process. n132 Yet federal courts already question the state-created danger doctrine as an acceptable basis for providing immigration relief, and traditionally display vast deference toward the regulatory powers of Congress. n133 To incorporate Article 24 into domestic law through constitutional doctrine will require a radical shift away from that position, and transform every petition under CATOC into a constitutional challenge. n134 Furthermore, there appears to be no precedent for substituting a due process claim in place of federal statutory law as the default basis for invoking the protections of a simple treaty article. n135<br />
Any attempt to force together the language of Article 24 with the requisite elements of a state-created danger claim is improper, and will likely devolve into a dissertation on constitutional law. n136 In an area where courts caution against reckless expansion, treating the state-created danger doctrine as a panacea is both unrealistic and inappropriate. n137 [*373] 2. (Un-) Enforceability of CATOC Treaty Language As of yet, no court has interpreted CATOC treaty language on its face or analyzed whether its articles are self-executing, i.e., enforceable by individuals in court. n138 Recommendations made to President Bush by the Department of State in 2004 explicitly advised against self-execution, and although the United States failed to withhold any reservations to this effect, the absence of a treaty depository is non-dispositive per U.S. Supreme Court precedent. n139 Recently, the Office of the U.S. Attorney General presented its opinion that CATOC introduced &quot;no new measure of protection&quot; for aliens upon ratification. n140 Such indicia support the presumption developed over the past fifteen years against enforcing private treaty rights. n141 Although Article 24 of CATOC arguably implicates the Fifth Amendment right to life, liberty, and property, the absence of any express judicial remedy within its language precludes a finding of self-execution. n142 This situation creates a pressing need for domestic legislation implementing Article 24 of CATOC. n143 3. Adoption of Article 24 Statutory Language As argued above, Article 24 of CATOC affords protection to a specific class of applicants, namely noncitizens who testify [*374] under oath as witnesses to acts of transnational crime and thereafter face removal from the United States and retaliation abroad. n144 Similar to the Convention Against Torture's prohibition on the removal of aliens who will likely be subjected to torture, Article 24 calls for the adoption of self-executing statutory language that will transform its 'request' to the international community into judicially enforceable domestic law. n145 This can be accomplished by incorporating the relevant language of Article 24 into FARRA, thereby distinguishing 'torture' from witness retaliation and intimidation. n146 While administrative regulations setting forth the grounds for establishing an Article 24 claim must be promulgated, many of these could be borrowed directly from the regulations implementing CAT, including those governing federal court jurisdiction, burden of proof, and the relief granted to successful claimants. n147 V. Conclusion The prevention of transnational crime, an issue of growing concern to countries around the world, necessitates the recruitment and protection of witnesses with first-hand knowledge of criminal activity. n148 Unfortunately, U.S. federal courts consistently order cooperating alien witnesses back home to countries harboring the very criminals against whom they testify. n149 The Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime is a new legal instrument that holds the potential to cure this deficiency [*375] under U.S. immigration law. n150 Like most modern treaties, however, domestic legislation is required in order for its language to become judicially enforceable. n151 By incorporating Article 24 of the Convention into federal law, the United States will fulfill its international treaty obligations and address what is today a confusing and unjust anomaly within its own body of law. n152<br />

Switching the priority on family leads to more applications for t-visas<br />

<br />
The availability of the T-visa has failed to make a major impact on the protection of alien witnesses. n52 Although T-visas may be issued to the family members of a victim, in reality this will only occur after the completion of an often-lengthy criminal investigation or prosecution. n53 Many victims, therefore, choose not to cooperate with law enforcement, fearing immediate reprisal against their family members abroad. n54 Moreover, T status affords protection only to witnesses who are victims of human [*357] trafficking; this pool of applicants is further watered down by statutory language requiring a &quot;severe&quot; form of trafficking and the likelihood of undue hardship upon return home. n55<br />

<br />
Any amendment to the TVPA must begin with targeting locales with a high concentration of human trafficking activity. Hence, the first step of reform should be to analyze those locales and begin to move more resources to them. Law enforcement in these cities must be equipped with federal funds to identify victims of human trafficking, break up trafficking rings, and prosecute offenders. In addition, federal funds should be allocated for the training and employment of mental health practitioners, who are integral to victim recovery. A well-trained cadre of these experts should be available in those cities where trafficking victims are concentrated in order to counsel the victims, thereby facilitating their cooperation with the law enforcement process.<br />

Providing prior medical assistance solves for victimization while still solving for trafficking<br />

<br />
C. Step 3: Mental Health Assistance Beyond the Initial Contact Finally, and most importantly, the TVPA must address the mental health needs of rescued victims. n79 Mental health assistance for victims of human trafficking has received very little policy and legal attention due to the persistent view of victims of human trafficking as prostitutes and illegal immigrants. n80 Without this necessary attention, any legal and policy discourse regarding adequate mental health services for victims of human trafficking will always fall short. Victims of human trafficking are individuals who have endured rape, emotional and physical trauma, and, in some instances, near death experiences. n81<br />
There exist mechanisms to help rape victims cope with the trauma that results from the experience: many rape victims seek mental health assistance in order recover from the traumatizing experience. n82 Why, then, is mental health assistance for victims of human trafficking, who have similarly endured rape and physical and emotional battery, virtually unavailable? Under the current regime, any kind of government-provided mental health assistance can only be obtained after an arduous process that only exacerbates victims' emotional and physical trauma. n83<br />
Because the psychological needs of victims of human trafficking are so woefully ignored, the training of law enforcement officials and legal practitioners should not only focus on identifying a victim of human trafficking, but also in understanding these victims' emotional suffering. n84 Law [*342] enforcement should also remember that the victims of human trafficking do not get to keep their &quot;earnings,&quot; nor do they voluntarily choose to engage in illegal activity. n85 And, while victims of human trafficking voluntarily choose to illegally immigrate to the U.S., this action is influenced by traffickers' lies or compelled by violence. n86 An untrained law enforcement official or legal practitioner might fail to consider that, while victims of human trafficking have engaged in illegal behavior, the mens rea to engage in such behavior is certainly missing.<br />
There is no difference between a rape victim, a victim of physical and emotional abuse, and a victim of human trafficking. Proper training of law enforcement officials and legal practitioners will not only help to more effectively identify victims of human trafficking, but will also reinforce the fact that these women and girls are victims, not criminals. n87<br />
Mental health assistance for these victims should be offered at the initial encounter with law enforcement. This initial assistance will play a crucial role in the overall healing process that will enable the victim of human trafficking to re-enter the society from which she was unjustly removed. n88<br />
Further, provision of mental health assistance at the initial stage of identification is essential to fulfilling the three essential goals of the TVPA discussed above. Initial mental health assistance will help combat human trafficking by laying the groundwork for the victim to re-enter society. It would also help prevent victims from again falling prey to traffickers [*343] and would encourage and enable victims to better cooperate with authorities, possibly leading to the apprehension and prosecution of more traffickers.<br />
Continuing mental health assistance is imperative, especially during the prosecution phase, in order to assist the victim in coping with the stress of a trial. Providing continuous mental health assistance throughout the trial will ensure not only the victim's well-being, but also the victim's ability to testify for law enforcement. It is critical that victims are healthy enough to effectively cooperate with law enforcement and testify, as only the victims can provide critical information about their captors. At this stage, the victim has to relive his or her experiences, as well as disassociate from previously held trust in the victim's traffickers. If no mental health assistance is provided or the assistance provided is inadequate, the capability of the victim to cooperate with law enforcement diminishes.<br />
Furthermore, because a prosecution may fail due to the victim's inability to testify, the unassisted victim must face the harsh reality that his or her failure to testify contributed to the traffickers' victory. Even more troubling is the reality that, following an unsuccessful prosecution, the utility of the victim to law enforcement ends, leaving the victim vulnerable to being re-absorbed into the trafficking market.<br />
Ultimately, a victim of human trafficking can prove essential to the prosecution of traffickers only if the victim is psychologically healthy enough to cooperate with law enforcement. Thus, the provision of adequate mental health services throughout the prosecution process will help the victim of human trafficking to better cope with the realities and pressures of a trial, while simultaneously providing legal practitioners with a key source of information. Consequently, providing mental health assistance at the prosecution stage can serve to better fulfill the stated goals of the TVPA.<br />
Even after the prosecution phase, continuing provision of free mental health assistance will play a crucial role in allowing the victim of human trafficking to re-enter society without falling prey, once again, to the trafficking cycle. It will also facilitate the victim's transition from the world of forced prostitution, rape, and physical abuse into a normal way of life. It is important to remember that socio-political weakness is the primary risk factor for falling victim to human traffickers. n89 Thus, the United States should facilitate victim rehabilitation in order to reduce the number of potential victims of trafficking, another goal of the TVPA. n90<br />
[*344] In order to provide this extensive and ongoing mental health service, the TVPA should allocate federal funding for the training of mental health professionals. Qualified professionals are crucial to providing these much-needed services, but they will not be available without substantial federal commitment to funding. In the long-run, however, valuable federal resources will be saved by funding rehabilitation of victims who can help put traffickers behind bars.<br />
Millions of dollars in foreign aid are wasted abroad by corrupt governments that do not put the funds toward combating the problem of trafficking. n91 It is precisely these funds that should be reallocated to a program of victim rehabilitation through extensive mental health services. If corrupt governments abroad cannot deter the trafficking of humans into the United States, perhaps trained mental health professionals can help fight the problem at home.<br />
The TVPA should be amended to recognize the emotional and psychological vulnerability of victims of human trafficking by funding mental health services for these traumatized men, women, and children. Doing so would further the stated aims of the statute by enabling victims to cooperate with law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. In addition, continued mental healthcare for victims will help reintegrate them into society - either in the U.S. or abroad - while giving them the tools to avoid becoming victims of trafficking for a second time. By adequately caring for future repeat victims, mental health professions can help prevent trafficking before it begins.<br />

Uniqueness and internal link. Commerce clause is weak now leading to a repeal of health care<br />
UPI 10 (Michael Kirkland, March 22, 2010, “U.S. Supreme Court: Challenges could burst healthcare triumph,” UPI, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/03/22/US-Supreme-Court-Challenges-could-burst-healthcare-triumph/UPI-53811269283884/#ixzz1AfQB4WsZ" rel="nofollow">http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/03/22/US-Supreme-Court-Challenges-could-burst-healthcare-triumph/UPI-53811269283884/#ixzz1AfQB4WsZ</a>, JAK)<br />
An analysis by United Press International in January said the success of any commerce clause challenge on healthcare would depend on whether the modern Supreme Court follows the lead of the Supreme Court under the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, which pinned back the commerce clause in the 1990s and 2000.<br />
The Commerce Clause, in Article I of the Constitution, gives Congress the authority to &quot;regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.&quot;<br />
A challenge to the new healthcare reform law is strengthened as well by the high court's jurisprudence, which for the most part recognizes the regulation of insurance, an intangible good, is the province of the states, not the federal government. The federal government has traditionally regulated the interstate commerce of tangible goods.<br />
For much of its history, the commerce power of Congress was limited to the regulation of the movement of tangible goods across state boundaries through roads and rivers. That power was massively expanded in 1942's Wickard vs. Filburn.<br />
In Wickard, the Supreme Court ruled the commerce clause, for the first time, allowed the regulation of goods produced and consumed solely within a state.<br />
Wickard opened the floodgates, and for more than 50 years Congress used the commerce clause to enact a vast number of laws that had only a tangential connection to interstate commerce.<br />
However, in 1995 the Rehnquist Supreme Court unexpectedly reined in the scope of the commerce clause. In a 5-4 vote, the justices struck down the federal Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which forbade anyone from knowingly carrying a firearm in a school zone.<br />
In the majority opinion, Rehnquist said the law was &quot;invalid as beyond Congress' power under the commerce clause.&quot;<br />
The &quot;possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition elsewhere, have ... a substantial effect on interstate commerce,&quot; the opinion said.<br />
A second major blow to congressional commerce power came in 2000's U.S. vs. Morrison, when the same five-justice majority struck down provisions of the federal Violence Against Women Act.<br />
A woman who said she had been raped by two other students at Virginia Polytechnic Institute filed suit for damages under the civil provisions of the federal act. But the narrow Rehnquist majority said the civil provisions of the act &quot;cannot be sustained under the commerce clause or section 5 of the 14th Amendment,&quot; which allows Congress to use legislation to enforce &quot;the constitutional guarantee that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process or deny any person equal protection of the laws.&quot;<br />
The only hitch on the steady curtailment of commerce clause power came in 2005's Gonzalez vs. Raich when a couple of conservatives apologetically joined the four-member liberal bloc to rule 6-3 that Congress had the authority to regulate home-grown quantities of prescribed marijuana under its commerce power.<br />
However, despite Raich, the weight of Supreme Court jurisprudence seems to favor a commerce clause challenge in a healthcare reform case brought by McCollum or anyone else with standing.<br />
<br />
Immigration law is justified on notions of sovereignty making the commerce clause take a back seat. Counterplan reverses this trend and strengthens the commerce clause.<br />
Augustine-Adams 05 - Professor of Law at BYU (Kif, March 2005, “Symposium: Immigration and Civil Rights after September 11: The Impact on California: The Plenary Power Doctrine at September 11,” 38 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 701, JAK)<br />
One of the major arguments for bringing immigration law into mainstream constitutional law begins with criticism of sovereignty as the justification for the plenary power doctrine. We should &quot;end appeals to &quot;ancient principles of the international law of nation-states' in determining the source and scope of the immigration power&quot; because doing so will &quot;help decision makers recognize that the immigration power does not stand above or before the Constitution.&quot; n64 When rejecting sovereignty as a justification for plenary power, many scholars identify the Commerce Clause as an explicit constitutional text that empowers the federal government to control immigration into the United States. n65 The argument usually rests on two grounds. First, because the Supreme Court has held the movement of people across state borders to be interstate commerce, the movement of people across international boundaries is commerce among nations. n66 Second, [*719] Supreme Court precedent in the Head Money Cases, n67 decided five years before the Chinese Exclusion Case, founded regulation of immigration in the Commerce Clause. n68 The assertion, then, is that with immigration law firmly grounded in the Commerce Clause, immigration law would be brought into the mainstream of constitutional law &quot;because there is no question that the commerce authority is limited by the Bill of Rights.&quot; n69<br />

Health care reform is the only way to prevent the impact to bioterror<br />
Green 4 (Shane, Ph.D., Director of Outreach at the Ontario Genomics Institute, “Bioterrorism and Health Care Reform: No Preparedness Without Access,” May Virtual Mentor, the AMA Journal of Ethics, Vol. 6, No. 5)<br />
But with the US presently engaged in a “war on terror,” in which not only soldiers but also civilians are targets, a healthy fighting force is no longer enough to ensure national security; the time has come for this country to take up reforms that promote the health of all Americans.<br />
Reassuringly, this is not a novel proposal. Reflecting upon statements made in 1944 by American medical historian Henry E. Sigerist, MD, concerning the power of external security threats to stimulate reform, a recent editorial in the American Journal of Public Health suggested that, “[t]his incendiary moment may be just the time for rekindling reform&quot; [2]. Similarly, emergency physician and medical ethicist C. Griffin Trotter, MD, PhD, recently declared: “National security, I submit, is the new banner for health care reform&quot; [3].<br />
Consider the threat of bioterrorism: the potential use of biological weapons against this country raises the specter of a unique kind of war in which battles will be fought not against soldiers and artillery but against epidemics. Without significant reform to ensure access to health care for all Americans, the US will be unable to fight such battles effectively.<br />
Why Access?<br />
Using infectious diseases as weapons, bioterrorism threatens to weaken the civilian workforce and, hence, a nation's ability to go about its daily business. Moreover, in the case of diseases that are transmissible person to person, each infected individual becomes a human weapon, infecting others, who then infect others, and so on, tying up medical responders and overwhelming medical resources. <br />
A nation's greatest defense against bioterrorism, both in preparation for and in response to an attack, is a population in which an introduced biological agent cannot get a foothold, ie, healthy people with easy access to health care.<br />

Extinction results.<br />

Of all the Weapons of Mass Destruction, the genetically engineered biological weapons, many without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of nuclear weapons, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they are easier to control. Biological weapons, on the other hand, can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. <br />

IV. International Law and the Supreme Court's Decision in Lawrence Support Extending Immigration Benefits to Same-Sex Couples The Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence relied heavily upon international norms to strike down a Texas state anti-sodomy law. In so doing, the Court affirmed the right to form and sustain loving personal relationships, regardless of the partners' genders, and to lead private lives free of government restriction and legal condemnation. Current immigration law acts to restrict the right of bi-national same-sex couples to sustain loving personal relationships. Many bi-national same-sex couples are forced by law to separate because the U.S. citizen or lawful resident cannot sponsor his or her foreign-national partner for immigration benefits. Such reality is contrary to the internationally recognized right to family and family unity as well as the liberty right recognized by Lawrence. In adopting non-discriminatory immigration legislation and policy, eighteen countries have recognized the importance of family unity to same-sex couples. By passing the UAFA, Congress will further comply with its obligations under international law to protect the right to family and family unity. Moreover, Congress will further the liberty interest of same-sex couples, recognized by Lawrence, to form and sustain loving personal relationships without the governmental intrusion of forced separation. A. The International Right to Family and Family Unity and Its Application to Immigration Law and Policy There is broad international consensus on the importance of the family. International human rights law protects the right to family life. As one court has noted, &quot;the essence of family life is the right to live together.&quot; n78 Moreover, a variety of different treaty provisions suggest that current international law contains norms [*582] against involuntary family separation. n79 The protection of the international right to family life and unity is of particular relevance to foreign nationals, both in matters of entry and deportation, as well as in the conditions of residence. Immigration equality is necessary to protect the families and family unity of same-sex couples. 1. International Law Mandates that the United States Protect the Right to Family Life and Family Unity International treaty law renders a duty upon State Parties to uphold the provisions set forth within a given treaty instrument. n80 States become Party to an international treaty upon signature and ratification of the instrument. Upon such ratification, State Parties are obliged to implement national legislation consistent with the duties and obligations to which the treaty alludes. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (&quot;Universal Declaration&quot;); the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; and three regional human rights conventions for Europe, the Americas, and Africa entered into force in 1953, 1978, and 1986, respectively, all contain specific provisions affecting families and have implications for the development of an international norm against involuntary family separation. The international right to family integrity is an aspect of the right to privacy, which is protected by a number of international conventions. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.&quot; n81 Similar language focusing on a standard of arbitrariness is found in Article 17 of the ICCPR, n82 Article 11 of the American Convention [*583] on Human Rights (&quot;American Convention&quot;), n83 Article 16 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, n84 and Article 10 of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child. n85 Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&quot;European Convention&quot;) provides similar protection in that &quot;everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.&quot; n86 Instead of using the term &quot;arbitrary,&quot; the European Convention spells out the conditions under which the State may interfere with family life: There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. n87 Various treaty provisions also &quot;seek to protect the family unit, as opposed to the rights of individuals to remain with their families. These provisions focus on the family as an institution and its relationship to society as a whole.&quot; n88 For instance, Article 16(3) of the Universal Declaration states: &quot;The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.&quot; n89 Article 23(1) of the ICCPR n90 and Article 17(1) of the American Convention n91 contain identical language to that contained within the Universal Declaration. &quot;Implicit in this right is the right of family members to live together,&quot; according to [*584] one American court's interpretation of the ICCPR. n92 To protect the fundamental right of families to live together, the ICCPR provides that &quot;no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his ... family ... .&quot; n93 The Preamble to the Convention on the Rights of the Child similarly describes the family as the &quot;fundamental group of society.&quot; n94 Protections for family life are also espoused in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). n95 Article 18 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights goes into further detail regarding the family's cultural role and the State's obligations: 1. The family shall be the natural unit and basis of society. It shall be protected by the State which shall take care of its physical health and morals. 2. The State shall have the duty to assist the family which is the custodian of morals and traditional values recognized by the community. n96 These treaties explicitly promote and protect the rights to family life and family unity. The United States, being a State Party to the ICCPR and the American Convention, has a duty under international treaty law to implement national legislation consistent with the duties and obligations alluded to within these instruments, including the right to family and family unity. n97 [*585] Furthermore, as a member of the United Nations, the United States has a duty to respect the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter. The U.N. Charter is a treaty which binds member states of the United Nations. n98 The U.N. Charter reads, in relevant part, that the purpose of the United Nations is to promote and encourage respect for human rights. n99 While the U.N. Charter fails to define what human rights are, such rights may be defined by reference to the various human rights conventions subsequently adopted by the United Nations, known as the International Bill of Human Rights. n100 The Universal Declaration and the ICCPR, instruments included within the International Bill of Human Rights, recognize the international right to family. The rights contained within the International Bill of Human Rights are incorporated into the larger definition of human rights under the U.N. Charter that should be adhered to by the United States. Lastly, the United States may have a duty under customary international law to protect and preserve the right to family and family unity as recognized by the Universal Declaration and ICCPR. Customary international law, which is comprised of the customs and usages among nations of the world, is part of the law of the United States. n101 The United States applies the international customary law of human rights, which is part of the greater body of law. n102 Treaty law can be evidence of customary international law in [*586] that treaties tend to reflect customary norms. n103 When a treaty codifies customary international law, the provisions that originated as customary law remain binding on all states, while any new provisions bind only the states that ratify the treaty. n104 The provisions within the ICCPR and Universal Declaration of Human Rights reflect customary international law. n105 As such, the rights to be free from arbitrary interference with family life and from arbitrary expulsion are human rights that are part of customary international law that the United States must respect.<br />

Counterplan is net beneficial. DHR doesnt require self determination.<br />
Hannum 93 - Associate Professor of International Law, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University (Hurst, Fall 1993, “Rethinking Self-Determination,” 34 Va. J. Int’l L. 1, Lexis, JAK)<br />
In part because of the inconsistent manner in which it was applied following the First World War, the principle of self-determination was not recognized initially as a fundamental right under the United Nations regime created in 1945. In addition, there was great reluctance to revive a concept used to justify Hitler's attempts to reunify the German &quot;nation.&quot;<br />
The &quot;principle&quot; of self-determination is mentioned only twice in the 1945 Charter of the United Nations, both times in the limiting context of developing &quot;friendly relations among nations&quot; and in conjunction with the principle of &quot;equal rights ... of peoples.&quot; n40 The reference to &quot;peoples&quot; clearly encompasses a group beyond states and includes at least non-self-governing territories &quot;whose peoples have not yet attained a full measure of self-government.&quot; n41 Furthermore, the reference to friendly relations among &quot;nations&quot; carried no connotation of ethnicity or culture; it merely reflected the name of an organization, the &quot;United Nations,&quot; composed of states. The equation of &quot;nation&quot; and &quot;state&quot; in the Charter is evidenced by paragraph 4 of article 1, which identifies as a purpose of the organization its serving as &quot;a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these common ends.&quot; n42 [*12] <br />
Neither self-determination nor minority rights is mentioned in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, although the Declaration does contain a preambular reference to developing amicable international relations. n43 Whatever its political significance, the principle of self-determination had not attained the status of a rule of international law by the time of the drafting of the United Nations Charter or in the early United Nations era.<br />

However, discussion began in the international community in 1966 that the concept of self-determination may extend beyond the colonial context with the adoption of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). n70 Article I of both covenants states that &quot;all peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.&quot; n71 While recognizing the right to self-determination, actual international support for self-determination has been mixed. n72 International support in non-colonial self-determination contexts has fared worse and is often viewed as tantamount to secession, an unacceptable proposition for a state-centered international framework. n73<br />
To clarify what &quot;peoples&quot; were entitled to self-determination, a final report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defined &quot;peoplehood&quot; as:<br />
[A] group of individual human beings who enjoy some or all of the following common features: (a) a common historical tradition; (b) racial or ethnic identity; (c) cultural homogeneity; (d) linguistic unity; (e) religious or ideological affinity; (f) territorial connection; (g) common economic life [...] [T]he group as a whole must have the will to be identified as a people or the consciousness of being a people. . . n74<br />
[*99] UNESCO further considered representative institutions as a prerequisite to self-determination. n75 Finally, to qualify for self-determination and statehood, a people must, presumably, declare it or ask for it. n76 How Taiwan fits within this framework is a bit murky.<br />
2. Taiwanese Non-Colonial Self-Determination<br />
First, while Taiwan has not officially declared independence, it has taken many steps that imply that it considers itself independent. For example, Taiwan has repeatedly applied for admission to the UN, n77 and according to the UN Charter, only states may apply for membership. n78 Moreover, Taiwan &quot;clearly looks, acts, and functions like a sovereign state.&quot; n79 The main reason, therefore, that Taiwan has not officially declared independence or asked for self-determination is that doing so would be tantamount to inviting invasion by the PRC. n80<br />

Roth 9 - Associate Professor of Political Science &amp; Law, Wayne State University. J.D., Harvard University, 1987, Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley (Brad R., 2009, “The Entity that Dare not Speak its Name: Unrecognized Taiwan as a Right-Bearer in the International Legal Order,” 4 E.

Taiwan's legal status is best understood to be indeterminate and fluid. Although an authoritative treatment of this topic would require a comprehensive review of the details of Taiwan's external relations and of PRC and international reactions to each aspect, it suffices for present purposes to note that there is much concrete behavior of the community of states toward Taiwan that confutes the official rhetoric of non-recognition of Taiwan's independence. n89 The case for attributing to Taiwan the full range of rights, powers, obligations, and immunities attendant to statehood improves the more that Taipei can establish external relationships beyond the permissible confines of mere de facto recognition and inconsistent with the PRC assertions of sovereign prerogative over Taiwan's external affairs.<br />
For precisely this reason, however, each such effort will prove to be a political irritant, straining cross-Strait relations and embarrassing Taiwan's most important ally, the United States. Although the United States has behaved in a manner manifestly inconsistent with the PRC's legal position, it has made every diplomatic effort to obfuscate this [*123] contradiction. As President Clinton's 1998 &quot;Three Noes&quot; statement (&quot;we don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or one Taiwan-one China&quot;) made clear, the United States refuses to support Taiwan's membership &quot;in any organization for which statehood is a requirement,&quot; n90 so as to avoid bringing the question to a head. Steps designed to improve the legal argument may thus have prohibitive political costs, given that the legal argument's practical significance lies primarily in its contribution to the garnering of political support. n91<br />

Nuclear war<br />
Bandow 2k - Senior Fellow, Cato (Doug, April 22, “Going to War for Taiwan,” Cato, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/03-02-00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/dailys/03-02-00.html</a>) <br />
Unfortunately, although Republican critics of administration policy are more consistent, they are also more dangerous. GOP congressmen are pushing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which would enhance the military relationship between Taiwan and the United States. Some conservative activists want to formally recognize Taiwan as the Republic of China. They would threaten to use force if Beijing acted against Taipei.<br />
The risks of such an approach are many. China would likely sever diplomatic relations with the United States and, despite its modest military, could not easily ignore an American decision to recognize Taipei, let alone a Taiwanese declaration of independence. A measured Chinese response - seizing some essentially indefensible Taiwanese offshore islands, for instance - would force Washington to choose between humiliating retreat and dangerous escalation. In neither case could the United States count on the support of its East Asian allies. Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines have all emphasized that their &quot;mutual&quot; defense treaties with the United States do not cover contingencies in the Taiwan Strait.<br />
The United States should adopt a new policy of conflict avoidance. Taiwan's future should be up to Taiwan's people, not the Communist rulers in Beijing. However, responsibility for defense, like the decision on independence, should be left with Taipei.<br />
Washington should make clear that Taiwan will pay the price for miscalculating any move toward independence. The capitalist and democratic island is a valuable friend, but America has at stake no interests that justify risking war with the nuclear-armed PRC. Washington should, however, sell Taipei the weapons that would allow it to defend itself.<br />
Obviously, the PRC would be foolish to confront the United States militarily. But nationalism sometimes causes nations to do stupid things, and Beijing rationally believes Washington has less at stake in Taiwan than does China.<br />
Although the Clinton administration has proved sadly ready to go to war, so far its adversaries have been pitiful. Conflict involving the PRC would be vastly different. Washington needs to extricate itself from potential conflict before war erupts in the Taiwan Strait.<br />

 <br />
The United States federal government should enter into negotiations with the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, offering that The United States federal government should remove the numerical cap on Special Immigrant Visas designated to translators and interpreters in Afghanistan and/or Iraq. The United States federal government should make individuals affiliated with/or employed by contractors working for the United States federal government in Afghanistan and/or Iraq eligible to receive Special Immigrant visas on the condition that European member states participating in Afghan reconstruction agree to contribute greater resources to development and governance activities and to Provisional Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan. The United States Federal Government should implement the outcome. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
US should condition Afghan policies on European contributions – they’ll say yes<br />
Korski, 2008 (Daniel, Senior Policy Fellow – European Council on Foreign Relations, “The EU is Missing In Action In Afghanistan”, Today’s Zaman, January 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=132932" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=132932</a>)<br />
<br />
On paper, the EU effort looks impressive. Twenty-five EU nations have contributed troops to NATO's 35,000-strong army in Afghanistan and now represent more than half of all troops. EU states command a third of all Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) and together with the European Commission have paid for a third of the country's post-2001 reconstruction.But European support for the Afghan mission is in fact limited and cooperation between the biggest EU donor governments and the European Commission remains inadequate. <br />
Public support for Europe's engagement has been plummeting and most EU governments have failed to act on NATO's request to boost troop levels. One exception is the United Kingdom, which has recently pledged to increase its troop numbers in the restive poppy-growing province of Helmand. But European troop contributions continue to fall short of the 17,000 US troops deployed with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and its 8,000 Coalition Force troops outside of ISAF.<br />
Apart from 1,500 Dutch soldiers in the neighboring Uruzgan province and a Polish and Romanian presence in Ghazni, Paktika and Zabul, no other EU nations are willing to operate in the insurgency-ridden southern and eastern parts of the country, giving the Taliban free reign. Overall, there are at least 60 such operating restrictions -- known as &quot;caveats&quot; -- on European troops, preventing commanders from deploying military assets where they are most needed.<br />
In areas such as policing, the rule of law and counter-narcotics, EU states have pursued policies entirely independently of each other. The EU Police Mission (EUPOL), launched in June 2007, was meant to address this lack of coordination but in the end its focus was narrowed to police reform, with the commission funding a separate judicial program. EUPOL started poorly, losing its first commander and faces serious problems recruiting high-caliber staff.<br />
Finally, the commission's annual development assistance to Afghanistan is falling this year, from 200 million euros to 150 million euros. Individual commitments are also being cut -- for example, France's five-year, 33-million-euro pledge for reconstruction support is strikingly low compared to its total foreign-aid budget of 9 billion euros. The EU cannot alter the international coalition's strategy alone. But a united EU can act as a powerful advocate for a better and more coordinated international approach. <br />
The US has argued that more troops are needed to dominate the terrain, lambasting EU governments for failing to step up their efforts as the US commits 3,500 additional marines to the fray. European countries, meanwhile, criticize the current military strategy. They fear that more troops may only lead to more civilian casualties, antagonizing Afghans.<br />
Without a grand bargain between the US and the EU that ensures increased European support and troops, success in Afghanistan will be elusive and alliance-testing tensions with the US will remain.<br />
Such a bargain must contain two elements. First, the EU should commit to sending more troops, trainers and civilians to the Afghan mission, as well as lifting all remaining &quot;caveats&quot; on its troops. The mission needs a 10 percent troop increase, more military and police trainers and more military equipment, including helicopters. In addition, the commission should reverse the decline in assistance and spend more money though local governments and the PRTs.<br />
In exchange, the US should accept a strategic shift from combat operations to human security. Such a strategy means focusing more attention on ordinary Afghans, gradually expanding NATO's security presence outward from population centers, and working hand-in-glove with state and local authorities.<br />
<br />
Net-benefit – <br />
<br />
First, Afghanistan – only an augmented European role can stabilize Afghanistan<br />
Smith, 2007 (Julianne, Director of the Europe Program at CSIS, “The Importance of Staying the Course in Afghanistan”,<br />
Summer, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.boell.de/weltweit/asien/asien-4221.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boell.de/weltweit/asien/asien-4221.html</a>)<br />
<br />
If, for any reason, Germany fails to find the political will or public support to continue its mission in Afghanistan, at the very least it should push for a strong EU role on the ground. After all, all the allies agree that even a doubling of the NATO force in Afghanistan would fail to guarantee success. Again, stabilization and development efforts must be pursued in tandem, and the EU is the obvious candidate to shoulder the development tasks.<br />
The EU has been in Afghanistan since December 2001. Brussels has provided large sums of development and judicial reform assistance, partnered with other international organizations on reconstruction projects, and agreed to send 160 police officers to assist with police training. While the EU and nation-specific contributions are laudable, they are increasingly considered insufficient. Afghans, Non-Governmental Organizations, NATO, and an array of international partners on the ground have repeatedly called for more aid, faster and expanded training, and an increase in the EU’s civilian presence.<br />
Given its current toolbox of capabilities and institutional strengths, the EU should assume a stronger leadership role in Afghanistan. Such an initiative would produce several tangible benefits. First, a stronger EU presence on the ground would bring much-needed resources to the local population. The EU has a wealth of experience in judicial reform, establishment of the rule of law, agriculture, education, and police training. Greater use of those skills, and of the EU’s pool of trained civilians, would help Afghans match each stabilization victory with a reconstruction strategy.<br />
Second, by assuming a greater coordinating role, the EU could fill one of the biggest gaps in the reconstruction effort. Coordination is a problem on multiple levels—among the hundreds of NGOs, government agencies, and international institutions operating on the ground; among EU member states; and between military and civilian actors. The EU could play a constructive role in all of these areas. By establishing a coordination mechanism simply for its own member states, the EU could significantly reduce the waste and duplication that has been well documented.<br />
Third, the EU, which is widely perceived around the world as an honest broker, could play a much greater diplomatic role, using its good offices to convene some of the regional players for a dialogue about Afghanistan’s future and border security. The United States is currently unable to assume this role, given its tattered global image, its complex and politically charged relationship with Pakistan, and its lack of diplomatic ties with Iran. <br />
<br />
Second, alliance credibility – lobbying Europe to participate in additional non- military roles restores burden-sharing – solving a collapse of NATO cohesion that spills over<br />
Hunter, 2008 (Robert, Senior Advisor – RAND Corporation, “In Afghanistan, NATO Caveats Can Be Made to Work<br />
Better for the Alliance”, European Affairs, 2-8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NATO+caveats+can+be+made+to+work+better+for+the+alliance.-a0182202617" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefreelibrary.com/NATO+caveats+can+be+made+to+work+better+for+the+alliance.-a0182202617</a>)<br />
<br />
This is one reason among several--including the nature and locus of future threats at some distance from Europe and the desirability of NATO's becoming engaged in countering them--that the war in Afghanistan is of such consequence for the alliance. It is not just that continuing tensions between the combat ready and the combat-reluctant allies could jeopardize future NATO military operations: the tensions could call into question the core value of the cohesion of the alliance. Bad blood between the two camps could have an impact measured far beyond issues related only to Afghanistan. <br />
Given the political composition (often involving coalition governments) in allied nations--and the fact that Afghanistan is, obviously, a long way from Europe--there is no way to &quot;square the circle&quot; and eliminate caveats. NATO's taking decisions to act as a whole has value in sending a signal to the people in allied nations, to friends elsewhere, and to potential adversaries that allied cohesion means something more than just a &quot;coalition of the willing and able.&quot; To protect that value, some limitations on what individual allies are prepared to do militarily in particular circumstances will have to be accepted. Even Article 5, the NATO cornerstone, does not commit allies to take any particular or collective military action, but only for each to consider by it own constitutional processes what it is prepared to do. <br />
In addition to pressing allies to &quot;think again&quot; and to consider the impact on all allied nations if the venture in Afghanistan fails, there is also a need to consider a half-measure, as undesirable as it may be. This compromise could center on developing standards for compensation. Allies less able or willing to be engaged militarily--and which therefore impose caveats--could be asked to provide much greater resources and engagement in development and governance activities together with bigger contributions to PRTs. (This highlights another concern about Germany--its failure to live up to its commitment on Afghan police training, an area where it accepted the lead responsibility two years ago in the Compact for Afghanistan signed by nations meeting in London.) After all, these areas--the battleground for &quot;hearts and minds&quot;--will be decisive in the outcome in Afghanistan, as NATO's military and civilian leadership has stressed repeatedly. <br />
In a common idiom, military caveats are clearly a &quot;lemon;&quot; but if those nations that insist upon them will provide significant leadership, resources, and engagement in the non-military part of the Afghanistan campaign, there can still be &quot;lemonade,&quot; even if, for the allies that are suffering casualties, it is sour indeed. Reaching such a compromise is not only necessary tactically in Afghanistan; it may be the only way to prevent lasting damage to the NATO alliance. <br />

Refusing to use the name “Afghanistan” in the place of Khorasan is key to solve linguistic colonialism and domination – also, focus on Afghanistan turns case<br />
Tajikam ‘8 [Team Tajikam is a team of Tajiks who are upset with the current oppression and Pashto domination. February 5 2008. “I am Tajik, not Afghan.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?article424" rel="nofollow">http://www.fravahr.org/spip.php?article424</a>]<br />
The threat of being called a “traitor” and a “foreigner” hangs over those who dare tread upon the topic of national identity. For the longest time, the term “Afghan” has been pushed upon every ethnic group of Afghanistan and for years, that is what Tajiks, Hazaras, Uzbeks, Turkmans, and other non-Pashtuns were known by the rest of the world. Today, however, it needs to be made clear that “Afghan” is not the rightful national identity for the country. The history behind the word “Afghan” is disputable due to various sources of where it originated from. However, one thing is clear: “Afghan” has always been synonymous with Pashtun. Writers and travellers to and from the country have stated that the word “Afghan” was always used to distinguish between the Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns such as the Tajiks, Hazaras, etc. The name of country is believed to have been given by the British when they first invaded it in the 19th century. The areas that they encountered were predominantly Pashtun and since they knew “Afghan” as synonymous with “Pashtun”. They therefore erroneously declared the entire country as “Land of the Afghan” or Afghanistan. And even though the majority of Afghanistan isn’t even Afghans, the name has stuck since then. Before the invention of the “Afghanistan”, the land used to be known as other names: Ariana and Khorasan, with the most recent being Khorasan. The region was called Khorasan for 1500 years and the name was fairer and represented the state as well as the people better. It clearly doesn’t favour one ethnicity over another. As Khorasan, the region was once an advancing civilization and embodied many ethnicities. However, as the Pashtun nomads entered and invaded the regions, they scattered and spread over, imposing their existence as well as a need for a country. Now, it doesn’t take a Ph.D. — self-taught or not — to figure out that those events were not just. And no matter what changes the country and the people have gone through, the term “Afghan” is not a legitimate one. Tajiks and Hazaras and Uzbeks and other non-Pashtuns were never and will never be Afghan. When the literal term of a word obviously means something you are not why would you be crazy enough to fight for the right to be called one? By non-Pashtuns adamantly choosing to call themselves Afghan just because they want peace and quiet, they are inadvertently throwing their rights and their heritage away. Losing your identity as a Hazara or a Tajik, Uzbek, or Turkman, you are being oppressed and your heritage and history is being rewritten to those who crawled out of the Suleiman Mountains. When you don’t even speak the language of an Afghan (supposedly Pashto) then why call yourself one? There are a lot of people that will threaten you if you refuse to call yourself an Afghan when you aren’t one. They will call you a “traitor” or “foreigner” and try to get the mass against you. There is a full culture and history behind the names of “Tajik” and “Hazara”, etc. When the world thinks of “Afghans” hardly anything good will come to mind. It is often associated with the horrors of Ahmad Shah Abdali, paedophilia, the Taliban, and now drug dealers. Though there are some bad within non-Pashtuns, they, however, have contributed greatly to the world and to civilization. When you begin to associate yourself with what you rightfully are, you will see just how rich your past is. Rumi, Avicenna, Ferdowsi, they were not Afghans and would never have called themselves one. The national identity is constantly surrounded by lies and deceit. Pashto is trying to be pushed upon those who have no need for it, the word Afghan is insisted upon even though the majority of Afghanistan isn’t even Pashtun. Afghans have always and will always be known as Pashtuns only. A Tajik and an Uzbek and other non-Pashtuns are separate and they should be known as separate. When this comes to light, only then will the people be able to gain the rest of their rights. Only then will the name of the country be forced to change because it isn’t a fair representation of the majority of the people. The people who don’t wish to call themselves Afghan are not trying to start trouble. Instead, they have opened their eyes and trying to open the eyes of others to the mistake and the lie that has covered the entire people. Issues like these need to be discussed because even though they might seem minor, they are in fact major. If the name non-Pashtuns choose to call themselves isn’t such a “big deal” then why are people trying so hard to fight those that decline the name Afghan?<br />

Continued colonialist oppression will compound the genocidal effects ending in extinction<br />

<br />
Nonetheless, this otherwise natural process was dramatically altered by colonization. These colonizing efforts were accomplished by force and often with great speed, producing dramatic changes within Indigenous societies and interfering with the natural process of adaptation and change. This disruption has had a genocidal effect; groups of Indigenous peoples that existed 500 years ago no longer exist. There should be no doubt that their extinction was not an accident – it was the product of a concerted effort to subjugate and eliminate the native human population in order to allow for the pursuit of wealth and manifest destiny. As a result, extinction is the most dramatic effect of colonization. Allowed to run its full course, colonization will disrupt and destroy the natural evolutionary process of the people being colonized to the point of extinction.<br />

I have attempted to show how a foreign policy discourse created spaces for certain kinds of subjects. Through representational practices that relied upon a series of oppositions and other relations a hierarchy of subjects was created which, in turn, made certain practices possible and precluded others. I have tried to show that given the world constructed in these policy discourses some kind of intervention would be imperative. I have also attempted to broaden our conception of what foreign policy making is. The &quot;foreign,&quot; the &quot;exotic,&quot; the &quot;other,&quot; with whom foreign policy makers deal, are always being created at various sites. To the extent that similar kinds of subjects are reproduced in various sites and over periods of time, this result tells us something about the prevalence of particular representations that construct a hierarchical world. Since this study has only dealt with one particular site of foreign policy in a relatively narrow time frame, I can only claim to have shown that in this particular case, a hierarchical world was constructed.19 What needs to be done is to analyze other discourses in other settings and during different time periods.<br />

For instance, there is nothing that would bar the USCIS from allowing the beneficiary of an approved employment based I-140 or family based I-130 petition, and derivative family members, to obtain an employment authorization document (EAD) and parole. The Executive, under INA § 212(d)(5), has the authority to grant parole for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefits. The crisis in the priority dates where beneficiaries of petitions may need to wait for green cards in excess of 30 years may qualify for invoking § 212(d)(5) under “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefits.” Similarly, the authors credit David Isaacson who pointed out that the Executive has the authority to grant EAD under INA §274A(h)(3), which defines the term “unauthorized alien” as one who is not “(A) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, or (B) authorized to be so employed by this Act or by the Attorney General” (emphasis added). Under sub paragraph (B), the USCIS may grant an EAD to people who are adversely impacted by the tyranny of priority dates. Likewise, the beneficiary of an I-130 or I-140 petition who is outside the U.S. can also be paroled into the U.S. before the priority date becomes current. The principal and the applicable derivatives would enjoy permission to work and travel regardless of whether they remained in nonimmigrant visa status. Even those who are undocumented or out of status, but are beneficiaries of approved I-130 and I-140 petitions, can be granted employment authorization and parole. The retroactive grant of parole may also alleviate those who are subject to the three or ten year bars since INA § 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) defines “unlawful presence” as someone who is here “without being admitted or paroled.” Parole, therefore, eliminates the accrual of unlawful presence. While parole does not constitute an admission, one conceptual difficulty is whether parole can be granted to an individual who is already admitted on a nonimmigrant visa but has overstayed. Since parole is not considered admission, it can be granted more readily to one who entered without inspection. On the other hand, it is possible for the Executive to rescind the grant of admission under INA §212(d)(5), and instead, replace it with the grant parole. As an example, an individual who was admitted in B-2 status and is the beneficiary of an I-130 petition but whose B-2 status has expired can be required to report to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). who can retroactively rescind the grant of admission in B-2 status and instead be granted parole retroactively.<br />

Now autopsies of the putative corpse of the avant-garde usually reveal a predictable etiology. In general, it seems the avant-garde died because it was unable to sustain its alterity, its difference, its otherness. It produced too many signs of the same and hence exhausted its credibility. The avant-grade died because all major forms of anti-art or aesthetic resistance end up in the very museums and cultural institutions that they began by calling into question; because the avant-garde insistence on innovation reduced itself to the most trivial market for novelties; because its attacks on tradition became tradition; because its attacks on the culture of the commodity only produced more cultural commodities; because it could not at one and the same time oppose mainstream culture and serve as its research and development agency; because anti-art succeeded despite itself in becoming Art; because, in short, the avant-garde continually turned itself into everything it denounced: fashion, commodities, high art, museum culture, Western civilization, bourgeois self-indulgence, and academic commentary. These are the causes or symptoms of the avant-garde’s fatality in the standard accounts. For the most part, I was more interested in what those accounts suggested about the perceived order of contemporary culture than in whether or not any one of them was, strictly speaking, true; but in any case let us accent them for the moment as a set of facts and garther them into another diagnosis: The avant-garde died of exposure. It died by revealing itself to its enemies. It put itself to death by continually articulating itself within the discursive economy of the cultures it claimed to subvert. It buried itself alive in the very manifestoes, events, collages, poems, and assemblages in which it proposed to live a disruptive and utopian existence. It died by putting itself in a position where people like me can appropriate it. It died of discourse. It talked, wrote, and painted itself to death.<br />

We cannot leave this icon without noting another of its elements: the serial character of the stupid guru, the rock star, the &quot;role model&quot;: never an absolute master, because he can be exchanged at any moment for another figure, another other; he is a place holder for a rapidly shifting field of empty, ephemeral, and tenuous attachments. No viable cult will ever grow around him, only an ever-shattering hall of mirrors, a high-velocity phase-space of weak and yet perpetual narcissistic identifications. One surfs through stupid gurus, as one surfs through cable channels or the channels in the video-porno booth, in a process that is the very model of the entropy of such attachments, always in search for the next one, the true and proper identification, which never arrives, which the process itself realizes as unrealizable, until desire is distributed and dissipated across the entire field. I have on my desk a volume entitled Threat By Example, a series of brief interviews with &quot;inspiring&quot; figures from the &quot;punk underground.&quot;21 The format of the book--pictures and interviews lasting no more than a page or two, followed immediately by another, and another, and another--formalizes the linear movement of this narcissistic guru-surfing: continuous deferral to the promise of a greater imminent satisfaction that never occurs, until the velocity of selection itself becomes the empty signifier of the Other. The accelerated substitution of figures of power, authority, and identification reveals, by a kind of cinematic effect, the hollow at their center, but without thereby releasing us from their hold. The fabled abyss is flattened out, but it is no less fantastic or fatal.<br />

<strong>B) Ignoring the topic means we engage in a politic of pure victimization. This ignores the privilege we derive from our position as debaters. Their singular conception ignores other forms of victimization. Only by talking about the topic are we forced us to talk about our privilege.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C) Coalition building. They force the debate to be centered on white supremacy. Their explicit references to blackness deviate away incoherently from the starting point. Always making the debate about white supremacy posits that the debate is always about them. If the advocacy is about building the debate community, then the affirmative precludes other marginalized groups.</strong><br />

I have in mind a logo representing militancy against the public management of the AIDS crisis, a design in which the notorious pink triangle by which the Nazis designated homosexuals is linked with this equation: Silence = Death. We are thereby enjoined not to be silent but to speak out, to state the truth about AIDS and demand that the nation listen and act. Only through an organization of voices can those under sentence of death be saved. Silence here is a form of suppression, or a form of complicity with oppression. A form of moral cowardice. Of murder. One finds the same sort of equation in those hitherto marginalized or suppressed discourses of women and ethnic minorities who, after silent centuries, now explode into voice and struggle to make themselves heard. Silence here is “unnatural,” as Tillie Olsen writes, a thwarting of everything vital and creative in the human spirit. Indeed, <br />
nothing could be closer to the heart of our moral and political thinking than the necessity to speak out, to bear witness, to give voice to the truth. And nothing said here will contradict such a necessity for those who must claim it. But at the same time, as the death of the avant-garde makes manifest, in this culture one can also die by speaking. One can also play into the hands of a generalized violence against secrecy. It is here that one begins to imagine another monstrous order in which the equation of silence and death is not rejected but embraced, in which the deepest necessity is to seek this silence and death. One imagines such a silence so that one’s own writing will become untenable. Under the sign of silence and death, writing turns against itself with enormous fury; it becomes a kind of masocriticism, if you will, subjecting itself to the laws of the discursive economy it loathes in order to inflict upon itself an unprecedented suffering that will make writing, as long as it continues, impossible. That will make writing the practice of a certain disappearance. A certain silence.<br />

<strong>3. Impacts:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A) Multi-cultural capitalism.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative’s project just becomes another sign of the Other circulating in the debate community’s discursive economy. Since this project is a product of the community’s discursive economy, it can never become successful because it is a mere commodity. The community has already deemed their project as another “goo aff” no different than the rest of the “goo affs.” This means they lose their potential for the radical as the tie to the original ideological stance is severed and the inclusion saps the other of its potential embodied by being the other.</strong><br />

Even so, the first chapter, the text of a lecture entitled &quot;The Afterlife of the Avant-Garde,&quot; follows from my last book, The Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde, and serves as a further introduction to the present body of essays. The chief project of the earlier book was to develop an analysis of the &quot;discursive economy&quot; in which the productions of both the avant-garde and its critics inevitably and indifferently circulate. Every manifesto, every exhibition, every review, every monograph, every attempt to take up or tear down the banner of the avant-gardes in the critical arena, every attempt to advance the avant-garde's claims or to put them to rest: no matter what their ideological strategy or stakes, all end up serving the &quot;white economy&quot; of cultural production. It is, finally, circulation alone that matters. Even the critique, in recent years, of the structure of this economy—the critique of the museum and gallery, for instance, in the work of Broodthaers and Haacke—ends up recuperated, displayed, and circulated for profit. More than the way iconoclasm becomes tradition and the new becomes old, it is this increasing phenomenalization of the mechanism by means of which the discursive economy whites out ideological differences and collapses critical distance that constitutes the &quot;death&quot; of the avant-garde, announced in hundreds of obituaries during the past thirty years. The death of the avant-garde is not an end to its production, which continues unabated, but a theory-death, the indifferent circulation of its products in a critical atmosphere in which the very idea of cultural opposition is increasingly problematic, and no less so for being ever more shrilly proclaimed. The current, renewed interest in oppositional art often functions only by forgetting that such opposition recycles avant-garde methods and stances recuperated and discredited decades ago. In those instances where a more &quot;postmodern&quot; critical art and art criticism try to salvage the tasks of cultural opposition without repeating the mistakes of the avant-garde, with a more self-critical sense of the culture's extraordinary ability to recuperate opposition, we still find, beneath the rhetoric (&quot;spaces of contestation,'' &quot;gaps and fissures,&quot; etc.), artworks for sale and journal articles for academic symposia and curricula vitarum. If it remains necessary to oppose what Peter Bürger identified as the &quot;institution of art,&quot; all of the critical means for doing so seem rather to further its interests, and without releasing us from the necessity of opposition. The dilemma of the necessary-impossible one encounters here haunts all of the present essays: they occupy a perspective from which the impossibility of criticism is precisely as pressing as its necessity. <br />

<strong>When we make these pushes for inclusion and create an order of identity side by side, these identities lose what makes them special. This is exemplified with the creation of Black Entertainment Television. BET was originally created to increase black representation on TV and decrease the negative representation appearing on other channels. Zornell Hurston observed that various geographic areas, such as Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and the South, each had different language codes that made them distinct from another. After BET gained popularity, blackness became homogenized throughout the country. BET showed what it meant to be black, and different language codes in these diverse areas were lost.</strong><br />

<strong>They dictate how we should orient ourselves to our identities. They only respond to the normalized white image of the debater. People come in, watch your debates, then they mimic you. This is true whether teams are policy or critical. They argue that people should “debate how you want” but then they say they should “affirm genealogies of whiteness from the standpoint of blackness.” This pushes all minorities into a single group, which means these debaters just end up role playing as each other, which stifles education</strong><br />

Antonio 95 [Robert Antonio; Professor of Sociology at the University of Kansas; “Nietzsche’s Antisociology: Subjectified Culture and the End of History”; American Journal of Sociology; Volume 101, No. 1; July 1995] <br />
<br />
According to Nietzsche, the &quot;subject&quot; is Socratic culture's most central, durable foundation. This prototypic expression of ressentiment, master reification, and ultimate justification for slave morality and mass discipline &quot;separates strength from expressions of strength, as if there were a neutral substratum . . . free to express strength or not to do so. But there is no such substratum; there is no `being' behind the doing, effecting, becoming; `the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed&quot; (Nietzsche 1969b, pp. 45-46). Leveling of Socratic culture's &quot;objective&quot; foundations makes its &quot;subjective&quot; features all the more important. For example, the subject is a central focus of the new human sciences, appearing prominently in its emphases on neutral standpoints, motives as causes, and selves as entities, objects of inquiry, problems, and targets of care (Nietzsche 1966, pp. 19-21; 1968a, pp. 47-54). Arguing that subjectified culture weakens the personality, Nietzsche spoke of a &quot;remarkable antithesis between an interior which fails to correspond to any exterior and an exterior which fails to correspond to any interior&quot; (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 78-79, 83). The &quot;problem of the actor,&quot; Nietzsche said, &quot;troubled me for the longest time. &quot;12 He considered &quot;roles&quot; as &quot;external,&quot; &quot;surface,&quot; or &quot;foreground&quot; phenomena and viewed close personal identification with them as symptomatic of estrangement. While modern theorists saw differentiated roles and professions as a matrix of autonomy and reflexivity, Nietzsche held that persons (especially male professionals) in specialized occupations overidentify with their positions and engage in gross fabrications to obtain advancement. They look hesitantly to the opinion of others, asking themselves, &quot;How ought I feel about this?&quot; They are so thoroughly absorbed in simulating effective role players that they have trouble being anything but actors &quot;The role has actually become the character.&quot; This highly subjectified social self or simulator suffers devastating inauthenticity. The powerful authority given the social greatly amplifies Socratic culture's already self-indulgent &quot;inwardness.&quot; Integrity, decisiveness, spontaneity, and pleasure are undone by paralyzing overconcern about possible causes, meanings, and consequences of acts and unending internal dialogue about what others might think, expect, say, or do (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 83-86; 1986, pp. 39-40; 1974, pp. 302-4,316-17). Nervous rotation of socially appropriate &quot;masks&quot; reduces persons to hypostatized &quot;shadows,&quot; &quot;abstracts,&quot; or simulacra. One adopts &quot;many roles,&quot; playing them &quot;badly and superficially&quot; in the fashion of a stiff &quot;puppet play.&quot; Nietzsche asked, &quot;Are you genuine? Or only an actor? A representative or that which is represented? ... [Or] no more than an imitation of an actor?&quot; Simulation is so pervasive that it is hard to tell the copy from the genuine article; social selves &quot;prefer the copies to the originals&quot; (Nietzsche 1983, pp. 84-86; 1986, p. 136; 1974, pp. 23233, 259; 1969b, pp. 268, 300, 302; 1968a, pp. 26-27). Their inwardness and aleatory scripts foreclose genuine attachment to others. This type of actor cannot plan for the long term or participate in enduring networks of interdependence; such a person is neither willing nor able to be a &quot;stone&quot; in the societal &quot;edifice&quot; (Nietzsche 1974, pp. 302-4; 1986a, pp. 93-94). Superficiality rules in the arid subjectivized landscape. Neitzsche (1974, p. 259) stated, &quot;One thinks with a watch in one's hand, even as one eats one's midday meal while reading the latest news of the stock market; one lives as if one always `might miss out on something.' `Rather do anything than nothing': this principle, too, is merely a string to throttle all culture. . . . Living in a constant chase after gain compels people to expend their spirit to the point of exhaustion in continual pretense and overreaching and anticipating others.&quot; Pervasive leveling, improvising, and faking foster an inflated sense of ability and an oblivious attitude about the fortuitous circumstances that contribute to role attainment (e.g., class or ethnicity). The most mediocre people believe they can fill any position, even cultural leadership. Nietzsche respected the self-mastery of genuine ascetic priests, like Socrates, and praised their ability to redirect ressentiment creatively and to render the &quot;sick&quot; harmless. But he deeply feared the new simulated versions. Lacking the &quot;born physician's&quot; capacities, these impostors amplify the worst inclinations of the herd; they are &quot;violent, envious, exploitative, scheming, fawning, cringing, arrogant, all according to circumstances.&quot; Social selves are fodder for the &quot;great man of the masses.&quot; Nietzsche held that &quot;the less one knows how to command, the more urgently one covets someone who commands, who commands severely a god, prince, class, physician, father confessor, dogma, or party conscience.&quot; The deadly combination of desperate conforming and overreaching and untrammeled ressentiment paves the way for a new type of tyrant (Nietzsche 1986, pp. 137, 168; 1974, pp. 117-18, 213).<br />

<strong>In the UDL the year after Towson won CEDA Nats, teams started running identity aesthetic. Young minds instead of being trained in multiplicitous about how think and debate, they literally copy what it means to be successful to a “T.” High schoolers are having their identities scripted for them. Since this process by which these identities are being scripted is true, we should be cautious to how we script them. This is distinct from the rest of debate methods because it forecloses other forms of debate.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C) Ethics.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The affirmative forecloses ethics. Last year, one way people engaged the high school energy topic was by discussing brown fields. As a result, people were learning to orient themselves politically. By only focusing on identity, it makes more difficult to have conversations on how to affect change in the world. A combination of understanding how the world works and the assumptions behind its working provides the best basis for creating actual change.</strong><br />

Yet for some reason, at least partially explicated in Richard Rorty's Achieving Our Country, a book that I think is long overdue, leftist critics continue to cite and refer to the eccentric and often a priori ruminations of people like those just mentioned, and a litany of others including Derrida, Deleuze, Lyotard, Jameson, and Lacan, who are to me hugely more irrelevant than Habermas in their narrative attempts to suggest policy prescriptions (when they actually do suggest them) aimed at curing the ills of homelessness, poverty, market greed, national belligerence and racism. I would like to suggest that it is time for American social critics who are enamored with this group, those who actually want to be relevant, to recognize that they have a disease, and a disease regarding which I myself must remember to stay faithful to my own twelve step program of recovery. The disease is the need for elaborate theoretical &quot;remedies&quot; wrapped in neological and multi-syllabic jargon. These elaborate theoretical remedies are more &quot;interesting,&quot; to be sure, than the pragmatically settled questions about what shape democracy should take in various contexts, or whether private property should be protected by the state, or regarding our basic human nature (described, if not defined (heaven forbid!), in such statements as &quot;We don't like to starve&quot; and &quot;We like to speak our minds without fear of death&quot; and &quot;We like to keep our children safe from poverty&quot;). As Rorty puts it, &quot;When one of today's academic leftists says that some topic has been 'inadequately theorized,' you can be pretty certain that he or she is going to drag in either philosophy of language, or Lacanian psychoanalysis, or some neo-Marxist version of economic determinism. . . . These futile attempts to philosophize one's way into political relevance are a symptom of what happens when a Left retreats from activism and adopts a spectatorial approach to the problems of its country. Disengagement from practice produces theoretical hallucinations&quot;(italics mine).(1) Or as John Dewey put it in his The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy, &quot;I believe that philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a historical cud long since reduced to woody fiber, or an apologetics for lost causes, . . . . or a scholastic, schematic formalism, unless it can somehow bring to consciousness America's own needs and its own implicit principle of successful action.&quot; Those who suffer or have suffered from this disease Rorty refers to as the Cultural Left, which left is juxtaposed to the Political Left that Rorty prefers and prefers for good reason. Another attribute of the Cultural Left is that its members fancy themselves pure culture critics who view the successes of America and the West, rather than some of the barbarous methods for achieving those successes, as mostly evil, and who view anything like national pride as equally evil even when that pride is tempered with the knowledge and admission of the nation's shortcomings. In other words, the Cultural Left, in this country, too often dismiss American society as beyond reform and redemption. And Rorty correctly argues that this is a disastrous conclusion, i.e. disastrous for the Cultural Left. I think it may also be disastrous for our social hopes, as I will explain.m Leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents to better use if they bury some of their cynicism about America's social and political prospects and help forge public and political possibilities in a spirit of determination to, indeed, achieve our country - the country of Jefferson and King; the country of John Dewey and Malcom X; the country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin, and of the later George Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater. To invoke the words of King, and with reference to the American society, the time is always ripe to seize the opportunity to help create the &quot;beloved community,&quot; one woven with the thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that shoots for nothing less than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both same sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be able to be part of the same social reality, one wherein business interests and the university are not seen as belonging to two separate galaxies but as part of the same answer to the threat of social and ethical nihilism. We who fancy ourselves philosophers would do well to create from within ourselves and from within our ranks a new kind of public intellectual who has both a hungry theoretical mind and who is yet capable of seeing the need to move past high theory to other important questions that are less bedazzling and &quot;interesting&quot; but more important to the prospect of our flourishing - questions such as &quot;How is it possible to develop a citizenry that cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the character of the Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any other?&quot; or &quot;How can we square the political dogma that undergirds the fantasy of a missile defense system with the need to treat America as but one member in a community of nations under a &quot;law of peoples?&quot; The new public philosopher might seek to understand labor law and military and trade theory and doctrine as much as theories of surplus value; the logic of international markets and trade agreements as much as critiques of commodification, and the politics of complexity as much as the politics of power (all of which can still be done from our arm chairs.) This means going down deep into the guts of our quotidian social institutions, into the grimy pragmatic details where intellectuals are loathe to dwell but where the officers and bureaucrats of those institutions take difficult and often unpleasant, imperfect decisions that affect other peoples' lives, and it means making honest attempts to truly understand how those institutions actually function in the actual world before howling for their overthrow commences. This might help keep us from being slapped down in debates by true policy pros who actually know what they are talking about but who lack awareness of the dogmatic assumptions from which they proceed, and who have not yet found a good reason to listen to jargon-riddled lectures from philosophers and culture critics with their snobish disrespect for the so-called &quot;managerial class.&quot;<br />

<br />
Taking his cues from Primo Levy, Theodor Adorno, and Emmanuel Levinas, the scope of Gilroy’s argument in Against Race is the conceptual history of modernity. In that sense, his project is a legitimate contribution to the history of ideas akin to Léon Poliakov’s The Aryan Myth or Sander Gilman’s Difference and Pathology and Degeneration. Gilroy’s work is a significant addition to these previous efforts to understand the crucial function of the category race in the conceptual foundations of modernity. Beginning with There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack, Gilroy’s strong suit has been explicating the conceptual formations of popular culture in a manner that brings us, if we are willing, to recognize them as serious engagements with thinking. Even more than his previous work, Against Race is a thoughtful effort at understanding the politics of aesthetics. At the very least, it contributes to a better understanding of the historical and conceptual connections between the event of transatlantic slavery, the attendant emergence of the modern nation-state, the subsequent rise of fascism in the first half of this century, and the current ‘‘resurgence’’ of neofascistic nationalism attending the emergence of the global economy. The crucial question driving this project is: How can we understand such complex structures as identity, polity, memory, relative to value in an era of transnational global Capital? Gilroy insists on thinking about this question in terms of how the underlying issue of the moment is whether we can maintain a serious unwavering commitment to the idea of inherent human value. In support of such an explicit and pronounced position of universal humanism, Against Race begins by providing an account of why there is such a proliferation of racialist movements that strive to achieve political legitimacy just at this moment when the triumph of democracy and global economic integration would seem to mitigate against such. Although unabashedly humanist, this is not a liberal account but, rather, aims at something more radical by surveying the key concepts of scientific racialism in order to explain why eighteenth- and nineteenth-century conceptions of identity, from neofascism to Afrocentrism, are increasingly prevalent when the biological racialism on which they are based is in crisis. The engagement with these issues assumes the form of a critique of the conceptual as well as political basis of racialism. The result is a lengthy exploration of the ways the conceptual field of race, which Gilroy calls ‘‘raciology,’’ has developed across various fields of knowledge as well as popular discourses. What is most innovative about that exploration is the way in which it delineates how the key concepts about the nature of human identity in relation to social formation and power reoccurring in such supposedly progressive movements as multiculturalism, Afrocentrism, and varieties of ethnic essentialism and religious fundamentalism are identical to those of fascism. Against Race is arranged in three parts of three chapters each, along with an introduction. The book begins with an exposition of what Gilroy calls ‘‘the crisis of race and raciology.’’ In elaborating what he means by this crisis, he interrogates the conceptual relationship between old biological racism and its dissident traditions of antiracism inaugurated by the struggle against slavery. Not only is it the case that the ascendant anthropological sciences —from biology to ethnology and ethnography—of the nineteenth century rely heavily on the symbolic currency of race, as Gilroy puts it, but so too do its dissident movements of abolition and civil rights. They are all functions of the same conceptual framework, the same system of knowledge. Having laid this all out, Gilroy offers a promising account of how the old biological racism is displaced by the new science of microbiology, only to be relocated at the micro level as genetic trace. Taking Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Frantz Fanon as exemplary ‘‘pathologists of race’’ (15), Gilroy attempts to formulate a radically nonracial humanism that is neither Christian nor phenomenological in its foundations. Elaborating just what he means by this is the undertaking of chapter 2, ‘‘Modernity and Infrahumanity,’’ in which he brings current identity politics into the same conceptual orbit as current biological science, addressing the relationship between the hierarchical definitions of humanity characteristic of philosophical anthropology and the various movements of national, regional, cultural, and racial identity it references. The connection between all of this and African Diaspora studies is spelled out in chapter 3, ‘‘Identity, Belonging, and the Critique of Pure Sameness,’’ particularly in the section entitled ‘‘Diaspora as a Social Ecology of Identification,’’ where Gilroy argues that the ‘‘idea of diaspora offers a ready alternative to the stern discipline of primordial kinship and rooted belonging’’ (123). As an alternative to the metaphysics of race, nation, and bounded culture coded on the body, diaspora is a concept that ‘‘makes the spatialization of identity problematic and interrupts the ontologization of place’’ (122). I take Gilroy to mean by this that as a figure for the complexity of history commonly referred to as modernity, diaspora offers a way of thinking about that complexity which is nonreductionist. <br />

To elaborate my proposals for an 'agonistic pluralism&gt; I have in the previous essays mobilized several theoretical discourses. Deconstruction I have found particularly helpful for criticizing what the consensus approach in all its variants - 'deliberative' as well as 'third way' - presupposes, the availability of a non¬exclusive public sphere where a non-coercive consensus could be attained. Indeed, as Derrida shows, such an impartial standpoint is made structurally impossible by the undecidability which is at work in the construction of any form of objectivity. To see difference as me condition of the possibility of constituing unity and totality, and at the same time as constituting their essential limits, forces us to acknowledge that alterity and otherness are irreducible. The deconstructive approach reveals that the vocabulary of Kantian universalist morality, in which the universality of moral imperatives is justified by their rational form, is profoundly inadequare for thinking about ethics and politics. Derrida has repeatedly insisted that, without raking a rigorous account of undecidability, it is impossible to think of the concepts of political decision and ethical responsibility. Undecidability, he says, is not a moment to be traversed or overcome, and conflicts of duty are interminable. We can never be completely satisfied that we have made a good choice since a decision in favour of some alternative is always at the detriment of another one. It is in that sense that deconstruction can be said to be hypoliticizing. Politicization never ceases because undecibaility continues to inhabit the decision. Every consensus appears as a stabilization of something essentially unstable and chaotic. Chaos and instability are ireeducible, but this is at once a risk and a chance, since continual stability would mean the end of politics and ethics. I would like, however, to express some reserves in order to differentiate my position from some appropriation sof deoncstruction which tend to read the idea of ‘democracy to come’—which I have endorse – as if it was a regulative idea, thereby eliminating its hard edge. How should we interpret it to avoid such a conflation? I suggest that it should be grasped in relation to what Derrida says when in The Politics of Friendship he scrutinizes the enigma of ‘true friendship.’ As he indicates, two interpretations are possible: the first one conceives true friendship as an arche or a telos towards which one must strive, even if one never reaches it., The inaccessibility in this case is merely a distancing within the immensity of a homogenous space; a road to be traveled. But, such an inaccessibility can also be thought of in a second way, in terms of the alterity which makes true or eprfect friendship not only inaccessible as a conveyable telos, but inaccessible because it is inconveiable in its very essence, and hence in its telos. Here inaccessibility takes the meaning of a prohibitive bar within the very conept of friendship. Quoting Pierre Aubenequem, Derrida says that in this case one could say that ‘perfect friendship desotrys itself’. One the one hand we have therefore a conceiveable, a determinable telow which in fact cannot be reached. On the other hand, the telos remains inacecesible because it is self-cointradictory in its very eseence. Envisging the ‘to come’ of pluralist democracy along similar lines can help us tog rasp the difference between the way is conceived by a rationalist like Habvermas and in the agonistic problematic which I am advocating.. In the first case democratic consensus is a conveidd as an asymptotic approaching to the regulartive idea of a free unconstrained communication, and the obstacles are perceived as being ofan empirical nature. In the second case one acknowledges the conceptual impossibility of a democracy I which justice and harmony woud be instabntied. Perfect democracy would indeed destroy itself. This is why it should be convied as a good that exists as good only as long as it cannot be reached.<br />

Since our feeling for reality depends utterly upon appearance and therefore upon the existence of a public realm into which things can appear out of the darkness of sheltered existence, even the twilight which illuminates our private and intimate lives is ultimately derived from the much harsher light of the public realm. Yet there are a great many things which cannot withstand the implacable, bright light of the constant presence of others on the public scene; there, only what is considered to be relevant, worthy of being seen or heard, cali be tolerated, so that the irrele¬vant becomes automatically a private matter. This, to be sure, does not mean that private concerns are generally irrelevant; on the contrary, we shall see that there are very relevant matters which can survive only in the realm of the private. For instance, love in distinction from friendship, is killed, or rather extin¬guished, the moment it is displayed in public. (&quot;Never seek to tell The term signifies tWO closely interrelated but not altogether identical phenomena: It means, first, that everything that appears in public can be seen' and heard by everybOdY and has the widest possible circulation. For us, appearance-something that is being seen and heard by others as well as by ourselves--constitutes reality. Compared with the reality which comes from.1);ing seen and heard, even the greatest forces of intimate life--the passions of the heart, the thoughts of the mind, the delights of the senses-lead an uncertain, shadowy kind of existence unless and until they are trans¬ formed, deprivatized and deindividualized, as it were, into a shape to fit them for public appearance.41 The most current of such transformations occurs in storytelling and generally in artistic transposition of individual experiences. But we do not need the form of the artist to witness this transfiguration. Each time we talk about things that can be experienced only in privacy or intimacy, we bring them out into a sphere where they will assume a kind of intensity which they never could have had before. The presence of others who see wnat we see and hear what hear assures us of the reality of the world and ourselves, and while the intimacy of a fully developed private life, such as had never been known before the rise of the modern age and the concomitant decline of the public realm, will always greatly intensify and enrich the whole scale of subjective emotions and private feelings, this intensification will always come to pass at the expense of the assurance of the reality of the world and men. Indeed, the most intense feeling we know of, intense to the point of blotting out all other experiences, namely, the experience of great bodily.pain, is at the same time the most private and least 41. This is also the reason why it is impossible &quot;to write a character sketch of any slave who lived. . . . Until they emerge into freedom and notoriety, they remain shadowy types rather than persons&quot; (Barrow, Slavery in the Ruman Empire, p. 156). thy love / Love that never told can be.&quot;) Because of its inherent worldlessness, love can only become false and perverted when it is used for political purposes such as the salvation of the world. What the public realm considers irrelevant can have such an extraordinary and infectious chann that a whole people may adopt it as their way of life, without for that reason changing its essen¬ tially private character. Modern enchantment with Hsmall things,&quot; though preached by early tWentieth-cemury poetry in almost all European tongues, has found its classical presentation in the petit b(]1lheur of the French people. Since the decay of their once great and glorious public reahn, the French have become masters in the art of being happy among H small things,&quot; within the space of their own four walls, betWeen chest and bed, table and chair, dog and cat and flowerpot, extending to these things a care and tenderness which, in a world where rapid industrialization constantly kills off the things of yesterday to produce today's objeCts, may even appear to be the world's last, purely humane corner. This enlarge¬ ment of the private, the enchantment, as it were, of a whole people, does not make it public, does not constimte a public realm, but, on the contrary, means only that the public realm has ahnost completely receded, so that greatness has given way to charm every¬ where; for while the public realm may be great, it cannot be channing precisely because it is unable to harbor the irrelevant. Second, the term &quot;public&quot; signifies the world itself, in so far as it is common to all of us and distinguished from our privately owned place in it. This world, however, is not identical with the earth or with nature, as the limited space for the movement of men and the general condition of organic life. It is related, rather, to the human artifaCt, the fabrication of human hands, as well as to affairs which go on among those who inhabit the man-made world together. To live together in the world means essentially that a world of things is between those who have it in common, as a table is located between those who sit around it; the world, like every in-betWeen, relates and separates men at the same time. The public realm, as the common world, gathers us together and yet prevents our falling over each other, so to speak. What makes mass society so difficult to bear is not the number of people involved, or at least not primarily, bUt the fact that the world be¬ tWeenThem has lost its power to g~ther them togethe]j to relate j7&lt;J-~, .a..nd to separate them. The weirdness of this situation resembles a oil¬spiritualistic seance where a number of people gathered around a d.;rI;-rC«&lt; table might suddenly, through some magic trick, see the table t~ ~. vanish from their midst, so that two persons sitting opposite each \( ~! other were no longer separated but also would be entirely un- /'''' , WI; related to each other by anything tangible. Historically, we know of only one principle that was ever de¬vised to keep a community of people together who had lost their interest in the common world and felt themselves no longer related and separated by it. To find a bond between people strong enough to replace the world was the main political task of early Christian philosophy, and it was Augustine who proposed to found not only the Christian &quot;brotherhood&quot; but all human relationships on chari¬ty. But this chariry, though its worldlessness clearly corresponds to the general human experience of love, is at the same time clearly distinguished from it in being something which, like the world, is , between men: &quot;Even robbers have between them [inter se] what they call chariry.&quot;44 This surprising illustration of the Christian political principle is in fact very well chosen, because the bond of chanty between people, while it is incapable of founding a public realm of its own, is quite adequate to the main Christian principle of worldlessness and is admirably fit to carry a group of essentially worldless people through the world, a group of saintS or ,a group of criminals, provided only it is understood that the world itself is doomed and that every activity in it is undertaken with the pro¬viso quamdiu mzmdus durat (&quot;as long as the world lasts&quot;). 45 The unpolitical, public character of the Christian community was early defined in the demand that it should fonn a corpus, a &quot;body,&quot; whose members were to be related to each other like brothers of the same family.46 The structure of communal life was modeled on the relationships betWeen the members of a family because these were lmown to be non-political and even antipolitical. A public realm had never come into being between the members of a family, and it was therefore not likely to develop from Christian community life if this life was ruled by the principle of charity and nothing else. Even then, as we know from the history and the rules of the monastic orders-the only communities in which the principle of charity as a political device was ever tried-the danger that the activities undertaken under &quot;the necessity of present life&quot; (necessitas vitae praesentis) 47 would lead by themselves, because they were performed in the presence of others, to the establishment of a kind of otherworld,, a public reajm within the orders them¬ selves, was great enough to require additional rules and regula¬ tions, the most relevant one in our context being the prohibition of excellence and its subsequent pride. 48 Worldlessness as a political phenomenon is possible only on the assumption that the world Will not last; on this assumptlon, however, It IS aImost mevitable that worldlessness, mane forms of violence dominate the political scene. This happened after the downfall of the Roman Empire and, albeit for quite other reasons and in very different, perhaps even more dis¬ consolate fonns, it seems to happen again in our own days. The Christian abstention from worldly things is by nO means the only conclusion one can draw from the conviction that the human arti¬ fice, a product of mortal hands, is as mortal as its makers. This, on the contrary, may also intensify the enjoyment and consump¬ tion of the things of the world, all manners of intercourse in which the world is not primarily understood to be the koinon, that which is common to all. only the existence of a public realm and the world's subsequent transformation into a community which gathers men to one another and relates them to each other depends entirely on permanence1If the world is to contain a pu c space, it cannot be erected for one generation and planned fur the living only; it must transcend the life-span of mortal men. 'Yithout this transcendence into a potential earthly imm01:tali¬~o politics, stricdy speaking, no common world and no publi.f reaIm:, IS possible. For unlike the common good as Christianity nllaerstOod it-ilie salvation of one's soul as a concern common to all-the common world is what we enter when we are born and what we leave behind when we die. It transcends our life¬span into past and future alike; it was there before we Came and will outlast our brief sojourn in it. It is what we have in common not only with those who live with us, but also with those who were here before and with those who will come after us. But such a common world can survive the coming and going of the genera¬tions only to the extent that it appears in pU,blic. It is the publicity of the public realm which can absorb and make shine through the centuries whatever men may want to save from the natural ruin of time. Through many ages before us-but now not any more¬men entered the public realm because they wanted something of their own or something they had in common with others to be more permanent than their earthly lives. (Thus, the curse of slavery consisted not only in being deprived of freedom and of visibility, but also in the fear of these obscure people themselves &quot;that from being obscure they should pass away leaving no trace that they have existed.&quot;) 49 There is perhaps no clearer testimony to the death of the public realm in the modern age than the almost complete loss of authentic concern with imnmortaIity, a loss somewhat over¬ shadowed by the simultaneous loss of the meraphysical concern with eternity. The latter, being the concern of the philosophers and the vita crmtemplativa, must remain outside our present con¬ siderations. But the former is testified to by the current classifica¬tion of striving for immortality with the private vice of vanity. Under modem conditions, it is indeed so unlikely that anybody should earnesdy aspire to an earthly immortality that we proba¬ bly are justified in thinking it is nothing but vanity. The famous passage in Aristotle, &quot;Considering human affairs, one must not. . . consider man as he is and not consider what is mortal in monal things, but think aboUt them [only] to the extent that they have the possibility of immortalizing,&quot; occurs very prop¬ erly in his political writings.5o For the polis was for the Greeks, as the res publica was for the Romans, first of all their guarantee against the futility of individual life, the space protected against this futility and reserved for the relative permanence, if not im¬ mortality, of mortals. What the modem age thought of the public realm, after the spectacular rise of society to public prominence, was expressed by Adam Smith when, with disarming sincerity, he mentions &quot;that ~nprosperous race of men commonly called men of letters&quot; for whom &quot;public admiration. . . makes always a part of their reward. . . , a considerable part. . . in the profession of physic; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.&quot;51 Here it is self-evident that public admiration and monetary reward are of the same nature and can become substitutes for each other. Public admiration, too, is something to be used and consumed, and status, as we would say today, fulfils one need as food fulfils another: Rublic admiration is consumed by individual vanity as food is consumed by hunger. Obviously, from this Vlewpomt tbe test of r~lily does not lie in. th~ public presence of others, but rather in the greater or lesser urgency of needs to whose existence or non-existence nobOdy can ever testify except the one who happens to suffer them. And since the need for food has its demonstrable basis of realitY in the life process itself, it is also obvious that the entirely subjective pangs of hunger are more real than &quot;vainglory,&quot; as Hobbes used to call the need for public admiration. Yet, even if these needs, through some miracle of sympathy, were shared by others, their very futility would prevent their ever establishing anything so solid and durable as a common world. The point then is not that there is a lack of public admiration for poetry and philosophy in the modern world, but that such admiration does not constitUte a space in which things are saved from destruction by time. The futility of public admiration, which daily is consUmed in ever greater quantities, on the contrary, is such that monetary reward, one of the most futile things there is, can become more &quot;objective&quot; and more real. As distinguished from this &quot;objectivity,&quot; whose only basis is money as a common denominator for the fulfillment of all needs, the reality of the public reahn relies on the simultaneous presence of innumerable perspectives and aspects in which the common world presents itself and for which no common measurement or denominator can ever be devised. For though the common world is the common meeting ground of all, those who are present have different locations in it, and the location of one can no more coincide with the location of another than the location of twO objects. Being seen and being heard by others derive their significance from the fact that everybody sees and hears from a different position. This is the meaning of public life, compared to which even the richest and most satisfying family life can offer only the prolongation or multiplication of one's own position with its attend¬ing aspects and perspectives. The subjectivity of privacy can be prolonged and multiplied in a family, it can even become so strong that its weight is felt in the public realm; but this family &quot;world&quot; can never replace the reality rising out of the sum total of aspects presented by one object to a multitude of spectatOrs. Only where things can be seen by many in a variety of aspects without changing their identity, so that those who are gathered around them know they see sameness in utter diversity, can worldly reality truly and reliably appear. Under the conditions of a common world, reality is not guar¬anteed primarily by the &quot;common nature&quot; of all the men who constItute it, but rather b the fact that, differences occur as, everybody is always concerned with the same object. If the sameness of the object can no longer be discerned, no common nature of men, least of all the unnatural conformism of amass society, can prevent the destruction of the common world, which is usually preceded by the destruction of the many aspects in which it presents itself to human plurality. This can happen under conditions of radical isolation, where nobody can any longer agree with anybody else, as is usually the case in tyrannies. But it may also happen under conditions of mass society or mass hysteria, where we see al people suddenly behave as thought they were members of one family, each multiplying and prolonging the perpseective of his neighbor. In both instances, men have become entirely private, that is, they have been deprived of seeing and hearing others, of being and being heard by them., They are all imprisoned in subjectivity of their own singular experience, which does not cease be singular if the same experience is multiplied innumerable times. The end of the common world has come when it is seen only under one aspect and is permitted to present itself in only one perspective. <br />

What matters to us here, though, more than this determined philos¬ ophy, is the manner in which the apologia homes in on the relationship between the privilege of the logos and the litigious play that sets up the political stage. Before the gauging of interests and entitlements to this or that share, the dispute concerns the existence of parties as parties and the existence of a relationship that constitutes them as such. The double sense of logos, as speech and as account, is the space where this conflict is played put. The Aventine apologia allows us to reformulate Aristotle's pronouncement about the political function of the human logos and the significance of the wrong it makes manifest. The speech that causes politics to exist is the same that gauges the very gap between speech and the account of it. And the aistMsis that shows itself in this speech is the very quarrel over the constitution of the aisthesis, over this partition of the perceptible through which bodies find themselves in community. This division should be understood here in the double sense of the term: as community and as separation. It is the relationship between these that defines a division of the perceptible, and it is this relationship that is at play in the &quot;double sense&quot; of the apologia: the sense it implies and the sense required to understand it. To find out if plebs can speak is to find out if there is anything &quot;between&quot; the parties. For the patricians, there is no political stage because there are no parties. There are no parties because the plebeians, having no logos, are not. &quot;Your misfortune is not to be;' a patrician tells the plebs, &quot;and this mis¬ fortune is inescapable.&quot;2 This is the decisive point obscurely indicated by Aristotelian definition or Platonic polemics, but plainly eclipsed, on the other hand, by all the political community's notions of trade, contracts, and communication. Politics is primarily conflict over the existence of a common stage and over the existence and status of those present on it. It must first be established that the stage exists for the use of an interlocutor who can't see it and who can't see it for good reason because it doesn't exist. Parties do not exist prior to the conflict they name and l' in which they are counted as parties. The &quot;discussion&quot; of wrong is not' an exchange-not even a violent one-between constituent partners. ~ It concerns the speech situation itself and its performers. Politics does f1 not exist because men, through the privilege of speech, place their in- ~ terests in common. Politics exists because those who have no right to ~ be counted as speaking beings make themselves of some account, set - tf\¬ ting up a community by the fact of placing in common a wrong that is nothing more than this very confrontation, the contradiction of two worlds in a single world: the world where they are and the world where they are not, the world where there is something &quot;between&quot; them and those who do not acknowledge them as speaking beings who count and the world where there is nothing. The contingent, factitious nature of Athenian freedom and the excep¬tional nature of the &quot;Secession of the Plebs&quot; thus stage a fundamental conflict that is at once marked and missed by the slave war of Scythia. This conflict separates two modes of human being-together, two types of partition of the perceptible that are opposed in principle and yet bound up together in the impossible counts of proportion, as well as in the violence of conflict. There is the mode of being-together that puts bodies in their place and their role according to their &quot;properties;' according to their name or their lack of a name, the &quot;'logical&quot; or &quot;phonic&quot; nature of the sounds that come out of their mouths. The principle of this kind of being-together is simple: it gives to each the part that is his due according to the evidence of what he is. Ways of being, ways of doing, and ways of saying - or not saying - precisely reflect each per¬son's due. The Scythians, in putting out the eyes of those who need only their hands to carry out the task the Scythians demand they perform. offer the most primitive example. Patricians who can't understand the speech of those who can't possibly have any offer the classic case. The &quot;politics&quot; of communications and the opinion poll, which offer each of us, day and night, the endless spectacle of a world that has become indifferent and an exact count of what each age bracket or each socio¬ professional category thinks of the &quot;political future&quot; of this or that min¬ ister, could well be an exemplary modern form of the same thing. On the one hand, there is the logic that simply counts the lots of the parties, that distributes bodies within the space of their visibility or their invisi¬ bility aild aligns ways of being, ways of doing, and ways of saying ap¬ propriate to each. And there is the other logic, the logic that disrupts this harmony through the mere fact of achieving the contingency of the equality, neither arithmetical nor geometric, of any speaking beings whatsoever. In the initial conflict that produces a dispute about the deduction of the community of the just and the unjust from the capacity of any speak¬ ing being whatsoever, two logics of human being-together must there¬ fore be discerned. These are generally confused with politics whereas political activity is none other than the activity that parcels them out. Politics is generally seen as the set of procedures whereby the aggrega¬ tion and consent of collectivities is achieved, the organization of powers, the distribution of places and roles, and the systems for legitimizing this distribution. I propose to give this system of distribution and legit¬ imization another name. I propose t~]] it the police. This term no doubt poses a few problems. The word police normally evokes what is known as the petty police, the truncheon blows of the forces of law and order and the inquisitions of the secret police. But this narrow definition may be deemed contingent. Michel Foucault h~ shown that, as a mode of government, the police described by writers of the seventeenth and eightee1lth centuries covered everything relating to &quot;man&quot; and his &quot;happiness.&quot;3 The petty police is just a particular forrn of a more general order that arranges that tangible reality in which bodies are distributed in community. It is the weakness and not the strength of this order in certain states that inflates the petty police to the point of putting it in charge of the whole set of police functions. The evolu¬ tion of Western societies reveals a contrario that the policeman is one element in a social mechanism linking medicine, welfare, and culture. The policeman is destined to play the role of consultant and organizer as much as agent of public law and order, and no doubt the name itself will one day change, caught up as it will be in the process of eupherniza¬tion through which our societies try to promote the image, at least, of all traditionally despised functions. So from now on I will use the word police or policing as noun and adjective in this broader sense that is also &quot;neutral,&quot; no.npejorative. I dO not, however, identify the police WIth what is termed the Ustate appa¬ratus.&quot; The notion of a state apparatus is in fact bound up with the ~pposition of an opposition between State and society in which the state is portrayed as a machine, a &quot;cold monster&quot; imposing its rigid order on the life of society. This representation already presupposes a certain &quot;political philosophy,&quot; that is, a certain confusion of politics and the police. The distribution of places and roles that defines a police regime stems as much from the assumed spontaneity of social relations as from the rigidity of state functions. The police is, essentially, the law, generally implicit, that defines a party's share or lack of it. But to define this, you first must define the configuration of the perceptible in which one or the other is inscribed. The police is thus first an order of bodies that defines the allocation of ways of doing, ways of being, and ways of saying, and sees that those bodies are assigned by name to a particular place and task; it is an order of the visible and the sayable that sees that a particular activity is visible and another is not, that this speech is understood as discourse and another as noise. It is police law, for ex¬ample, that traditionally turns the workplace into a private space not regulated by the ways of seeing and saying proper to what is called the o/,{,(. public domain, where the worker's having a part is strictly defined by~,f..,.!; »j the remuneration of his work. Policing is not so much the &quot;disciplining&quot; of bodies as a rule governing their appearing, a configuration of occu- . ., . Rations and the properties of the spaces where these occupations are distributed. _. I now propose to reserve the term politics for an extremely deter¬ mined activity antagonistic to policing: whatever breaks with the tan¬gible configuration whereby parties and parts or laCk of them are defined by a presupposition that, by definition, has no place in that config::ra¬ tion _ that of the part of those who have no part. This break is manifest ,&lt; in a series of actions that reconfigure the space where parties, parts, or lack of parts have been defined. Political activity is whatever shifts a body from the place assigned to it or changes a place's destination. It makes visible what had no business being seen, and makes heard a dis¬ course where once there was only place for noise; it makes understood as discourse what was once only heard as noise. It might be the activity of Ballanche's plebeians who make use of a faculty for speech they do not &quot;possess.&quot; It might be the activity of those nineteenth-century workers who established a collective basis for work relations that were solely the product of an infinite number of relationships between private indi¬ viduals. Or again, the activity of demonstrators and those manning the barricades that literally nirned urban communitations paths into &quot;pub¬ lic space:' Spectacular or otherwise, political activity is always a mode of expression that undoes the perceptible divisions of the police order by implementing a basically heterogenous assumption, that of a part of those who have no part, an assumption that, at the end of the day, itself demonstrates the sheer contingency of the order, the equality of any speaking being with any other speaking being. Politics occurs when there is a place and a way for two heterogenous processes to meet. The first is the police process in the sense we have tried to define. The second is the process of equality. For the moment let's agree that this term means the open set of practices driven by the assumption of equality between any and every speaking being and by the concern to test this equality. The formulation of this opposition obliges us to make a few further points and entails certain corollaries. First and foremost, the police order thus defined cannot be turned into that dim leveler in which everything looks the same, everything is equivalent (&quot;at night all cows are grey&quot;). The Scythians' practice of gouging out their slaves' eyes and the prac¬ tices of modern information and communications strategies, which, conversely, put everything endlessly up for grabs, are both forms of po¬ lice procedure. Which is not to say that we can draw from this the ni¬ hilistic conclusion that the one example is the same as the other. Our situation is in every way preferable to that of the Scythian slaves. There is a worse and a better police-the better one, incidentally, not being the one that adheres to the supposedly natural order of society or the science of legislators, but the one that all the breaking and entering perpetrated by egalitarian logic has most often jolted out of its &quot;natural&quot; logic. The police can procure all sorts of good, and one kind of police may be infinitely preferable to another. This does not change the nature of the police, which is what we are exclusively dealing with here. The regime of public opinion as gauged by the poll and of the unending exhibition of the real is today the normal form the police in Western societies takes. Whether the police is sweet and kind does not make it any less the opposite of politics. It might be useful to set down what belongs to each sphere. For in¬ stance, lots of questions traditionally enlisted as concerning the rela¬tionship between morality and politics are really only concerned with the relationship between morality and the police. To decide whether any means are acceptable to ensure the tranquillity of the population and the security of the state is an issue that does not arise from political thought-which is not to say it can't provide the space for politics to sneak in sideways. Also, most of the measures that our clubs and political &quot;think tanks&quot; relentlessly come up with in a bid to change or revitalize politics by bringing the citizen closer to the state or the state closer to the citizen indeed offer the simplest alternative to politics: the simple police. For it is a representation of the community proper to the police that identifies citizenship as a property of individuals definable within a relationship of greater or lesser proximity between the place they occupy and that of public power. Politics, on the other hand, does not recognize relationships between citizens and the state. It only recognizes the mechanisms and singular manifestations by which a certain citizenship occurs but never belongs to individuals as such. <br />

And your claim to destroy the political through is analogous to capitalism’s mechanical move to replace the fragmented political world with one world of the market<br />
Donald M. Lowe 1995 (The Body in Late-Capitalist USA, Duke Univ Press) <br />
In the name of science, the discipline bifurcates the terrain of late- capitalist production/consumption into &quot;economy&quot; and &quot;politics.&quot; The former possesses rationality, equilibrium; the latter does not. In other words, &quot;economy&quot; is positive and prior, whereas &quot;politics&quot; is the negative other. The discipline then analyzes this &quot;economy&quot; in reference to its late eighteenth-century ideal of the market. Neoclassical study of the &quot;mar- ket&quot; in effect obfuscates any understanding of the full working impact of late capitalism. Whatever that does not conform to the market ideal is then attributed to the excesses of the other, i.e., &quot;government.&quot; Furthermore, by arguing that any &quot;well-informed&quot; &quot;individual&quot; can &quot;rationally&quot; and &quot;voluntarily&quot; enter into contracts of exchange on a basis of &quot;equality&quot; with other &quot;individual entities,&quot; whether corporate or hu- man, in order to realize &quot;his&quot; &quot;interest&quot; in &quot;the market&quot;—the discipline is reducing all of these signs to narrow economic denotations. It overlooks the unequal power between labor and management, between a human person and a large corporation, and prevents us from dealing with the full human dimensions of economic exchange. The second-level signifi- cation of these categorical signs in the non-&quot;economic,&quot; i.e., the so-called separate realms of &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;society&quot; by analogy prevents any dis- cussion and understanding of the real problems of &quot;individual,&quot; &quot;rea- son,&quot; &quot;choice,&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; in a late-capitalist political economy. There are gaps between the discourse of neoclassical economics and our actual lives. It is not that neoclassical economics is unrealistic, but rather that its signs constrain and discipline our bodies to profit capital. These signs are the discursive underpinnings for the production and accumulation of exchange value in late capitalism. [45-46] <br />

We’ll outline two impacts: the first is no value to life—Dillon’s argument assumes late capitalism and the reduction of one world into a market world<br />
Michael Dillon, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Lancaster, April 1999, Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2, “Another Justice,” p. 164-5<br />
<br />
Quite the reverse. The subject was never a firm foundation for justice, much less a hospitable vehicle for the reception of the call of another Justice. It was never in possession of that self-possession which was supposed to secure the certainty of itself, of a self-possession that would enable it ultimately to adjudicate everything. The very indexicality required of sovereign subjectivity gave rise rather to a commensurability much more amenable to the expendability required of the political and material economies of mass societies than it did to the singular, invaluable, and uncanny uniqueness of the self. The value of the subject became the standard unit of currency for the political arithmetic of States and the political economies of capitalism. They trade in it still to devastating global effect. The technologisation of the political has become manifest and global. Economies of evaluation necessarily require calculability. Thus no valuation without mensuration and no mensuration without indexation. Once rendered calculable, however, units of account are necessarily submissible not only to valuation but also, of course, to devaluation. Devaluation, logically, can extend to the point of counting as nothing. Hence, no mensuration without demensuration either. There is nothing abstract about this: the declension of economies of value leads to the zero point of holocaust. However liberating and emancipating systems of value-rights-may claim to be, for example, they run the risk of counting out the invaluable. Counted out, the invaluable may then lose its purchase on life. Herewith, then, the necessity of championing the invaluable itself. For we must never forget that, “we are dealing always with whatever exceeds measure.” But how does that necessity present itself? Another Justice answers: as the surplus of the duty to answer to the claim of Justice over rights. That duty, as with the advent of another Justice, is integral to the lack constitutive of the human way of being.<br />

Second impact is the environment—advance of capitalism wrecks it—causes extermination<br />
Jim Davis, Associate Vice Chancellor--Information Technology of the UCLA, Capitalism as an environmental issue, gocatgo.com, January 2006<br />
Economics describes the systematic way in which humans interact with the environment in the production and reproduction of their lives. As such, no environmental issue exists independent of economic relations. The common root of &quot;ecology&quot; and &quot;economy&quot; -- &quot;ecology&quot; as the study of the &quot;house&quot; (oikos) we live in, and &quot;economy&quot; as the &quot;management&quot; of that house -- hint at their profound interconnection. The long list of environmental crises facing our planet suggests faulty household management. Using Marxist concepts, this paper explores the interrelationship of today's economy and these environmental crises. I will show how these crises are either a direct result of, or exacerbated by, the dynamics of capitalism. As a result, the solution to these crises cannot be separated, or solved within, capitalism. The first chapter of Cunningham, Cunningham and Saigo's (2005) textbook on environmental science recounts a &quot;dismal litany of problems&quot; (p. 23): a growing world population straining global air, water, energy and food resources; an accelerated loss of biodiversity on the same scale as the dinosaur extinction; and the stark polarization of global wealth and poverty -- 200 people have more wealth than half of the world's people; almost half of the world's population lives of less that $2 per day. Scratching the surface of each of these issues quickly reveals the web of contemporary economic relationships. We live in a capitalist economy. While the capitalist system has still not yet penetrated into every corner of people's lives, it does dominate the world economy, with a few notable exceptions. Capitalism as a system is based on the private ownership of the means of production, expropriating unpaid labor (surplus value) through the production and distribution of commodities, with a goal of the maximization of profit. In Capital, Marx explored the internal dynamics of capitalism, arguing that as a system, capitalism must grow or die. At the risk of &quot;pain of going under&quot;, the capitalist has little choice about this (Marx, 1981). This internal logic prompted Marx and Engels to write in the Communist Manifesto, &quot;The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.&quot; (Marx and Engels, 1848) Historically, this chasing, nestling and settling has included the search for raw materials and new markets in the process of expansion. The maximization of profit means finding the cheapest sources, using the cheapest labor, and externalizing costs such as waste disposal and pollution. The expansion of the market takes place extensively, by pulling new geographic regions into the market; and intensively, by commodifying or privatizing previously non-market activities and actively promoting an increase in personal consumption through the manufacture of desires. Within this process, technology is constantly developing, affecting the reach and speed of economic circuits, upsetting the process of accumulation, and changing the arithmetic of value. The polarization of wealth and poverty is an emergent property of capitalism -- without any state intervention, wealth will pool in the hands of a few people, while poverty will drown the vast majority. Cunningham et al. describe the environmental consequences of this pressing poverty, but the roots of the poverty -- and hence the environmental consequences -- are in the private ownership of the means of production and the maximization of profit. For those able to consume, the heavy environmental footprint of the consumer (in particular the American consumer) is a direct result of an economic system that requires the maximization of consumption to satisfy the maximization of profit. Can capitalism be contained, toned down, or even reformed? The environmental movement of the 1970s enjoyed some success in winning legislation to control some of the worst abuses connected with capitalist economic activity, including the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act (Werber, 2005). However, these kinds of controls run counter to the logic of the maximization of profit. Crises are endemic to capitalism and the crisis of accumulation in the 1970s fueled the neoliberal push for reduced government, the opening of closed markets, and free capital flows that today we associate with globalization. The flow of capitalism runs today in the other direction -- towards less scrutiny, less control, fewer taxes, and no regulation. These are the ideal conditions for profit maximization. &quot;Green capitalism&quot;, where the production of surplus value occurs through the production of renewable energy technologies, waste reclamation, trading pollution credits or even ecotourism, may address certain facets of environmental destruction, but still replicates the relations of capitalism globally, which must function on the basis of profit maximization. A hybrid car is a good thing, but it does not address urban sprawl and habitat loss, the impoverishment of the workforce, or the resource depletion that goes into making the car. While &quot;going green&quot; makes certain sense within the logic of capitalism as a toxic environment becomes more of an internal cost, or waste can be commodified and become a new source of profit, such choices do not eliminate wealth polarization and alienation. And so the broader destructive impact of capitalism on the planet will remain (Kovel, 2002).<br />

The abolition of inhumanity through legal injuncture eradicates the possibility of true politics by substituting legal inclusion for the actual articulation of political demands. This substitution of legal inclusion will never overcome the force of calcified political identity. Your aff misrecognizes as the world’s natural state a pernicious capitalist violence<br />

<br />
The simple relationship between humanity and its denial never creates a community of political dispute, as current events never cease-to show us. Between exposure of the inhumanity suffered by the displaced or massacred populations of Bosnia, for example, and the feeling of belonging to common humanity, compassion and goodwill are not enough to knit the ties of a political subjecti:fication that would include, in the democratic practice of the Western metropolises, a bond with the victims of Serb aggression or with those men and women resisting it. The simple feeling of a common essence and the wrong done to it does not create politics, not even particular instances of politics that would, for example, place a bond with the raped women of Bosnia under the banner of the women's movement. The construction of wrong as a bond of community with those who do not belong to the same common remains lacking. All the bodies shown and all the living testimonies to the massacres in Bosnia do not create the bond that was once created, at the time of the Algerian War and the anticolonialist movements, by the bodies, completely hidden from view and from any examination, of the Algerians thrown in the Seine by the French police in October 1961. Around those bodies, which disappeared twice, a political bond was effectively created, made up not of identification with the victims or even with their cause but of a disidentification in relation to the &quot;French&quot; subject who massacred them and removed them from any count. The denial of humanity was thus constructable within the local, singular universality of a political dispute, as French citizenry's litigious relationship with itself. The feeling of injustice does not go to make up a political bond through a simple identifying that would appropriate the disappropriation of the object of wrong. In addition, there has to be the disappropriation of identity that constitutes an appropriate sub¬ject for conducting the dispute. Politics is the art of warped deductions and mixed identities. It is the art of the local and singular construc¬tion of cases of universality. Such construction is only possible as long as the singularity of the wrong - the singularity of the local argument and expression of law-is distinguished from the particularization of right attributed to collectivities according to their identity. And it is also only possible as long as its universality is separate from the naked relationship between humanity and inhumanity. The reign of globalization is not the reign of the universal. It is the opposite. It is in fact the disappearance of the places appropriate to its rationale. There is a world police and it can sometimes achieve some good.. But there is no world politics. The &quot;world&quot; can get bigger. The universal of politics does not get any bigger. There remains the universality of the singular construction of disputes, which has no more to hope for from the newfound essence of a globalization more essentially &quot;worldwide&quot; than simple identification of the universal with the rule of law. We will not claim, as the &quot;restorers&quot; do, that politics has &quot;simply&quot; to find its own principle again to get back its vitality. Politics, in its specificity, is rare. It is always local and occasional. Its actual eclipse is perfectly real and no political science exists that could map its future any more than a political ethics that would make its existence the ob¬ject solely of will. How some new politics could break the circle of cheer¬ ful consensuality and denial of humanity is scarcely foreseeable or de¬cidable right now. Yet there are good reasons for thinking that it will not be able to get around the overblown promises of identity in rela¬tion to the consensual logics of the allocation of parts or the hyper¬bole that summons thought to a more original globalization or to a more radical experience of the inhumanity of the human. <br />

<br />
In both Arendt’s time and today, what is opposed to the particularity of membership in the nation-state is the idea of individual and universal human rights. Following the “natural law” tradition of classical liberalism, the French Revolution had declared them to be innate, inalienable, and independent of any government. The sans papiers should therefore embody the concept of human rights more than anybody else: “If a human being loses his political status, he should according to the implications of the inborn and inalienable rights of man come under xactly the situation for which the declarations of such general rights provided”.54 Ironically, it is exactly the stateless that reveals the crisis of human rights. The fate of the stateless, when they appear in great numbers, calls attention to the fact that for all practical matters, the rights of man are still identified with the rights of citizens. As Arendt noted: “The Rights of Man proved to be unenforceable – even in countries whose constitution was based upon them – whenever people appeared who were no longer citizen of any sovereign state”.55 The decades that have followed the writing of Arendt’s original text have witnessed the erection and elaboration of a global human rights regime based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 complemented by regional protection mechanisms. But as the right of the state to grant or refuse residency remains unchallenged the situation, and the situation for the increasing number of sans papiers has not changed: Threatened by immediate deportation, they simply lack the presuppositions for making an individual public appearance as a subject of human rights. For Arendt, the stateless exposes the abstract, formal, individualistic, and above all, apolitical character of the concept of human rights. Arendt observes that “from the beginning the paradox involved in the declaration of inalienable human rights was that it reckoned with an ‘abstract’ human being who seemed to exist nowhere, for even savages lived in some kind of social order”.56 For Arendt, the concept of man underlying the Enlightenment notion of inalienable human rights is unrealistically worldless and atomistic: “The conception of human rights, based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such, broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred about being human. And in view of objective political conditions, it is hard to say how the concept of man upon which human rights are based – that he is created in the image of god (in the American formula), or that he is the representative of mankind, or that he harbors within himself the sacred demands of natural law (in the French formula) – could have helped to find a solution to the problem”.57 The title of Arendt’s chapter, “The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of Rights of Man”, suggests a strong link between a political thinking and reality centred on the nation-state and the concept of human rights. Natural human rights suddenly appear not as a solution to the problem of statelessness against the nation-state, but as part of the same discourse as the latter. The stateless questions the identification of man and citizen, thereby disrupting the discourse in which abstract human rights transferred to nature and the sovereignty of the state refer to each other and turn against the self-determination of the concrete plurality of human beings. For Arendt, the French Revolution confronts us “with the serious attempt to reduce the political to the natural”; a move that always arouses suspicions as to its ideological functions. The concept of individual, natural, innate rights is revealed as the means by which the sovereign state transfers the foundation of its power from god to nature. As Arendt writes, “The French declaration of human rights was from the start aimed at establishing a source of political power and authority, it claimed to be the foundation of the state and not only the fundamental means to prevent the state from abusing his power. The state itself was meant to be based on the natural rights of man”.58 An appeal to the notion of innate human rights might then affirm the sovereignty of the state based on the promise to enforce them. The stateless shows that rights are precisely not “independent of human plurality” of history and society. Arendt reminds us of the need for a practical political solution to the problems of human organisation, as opposed to a philosophical, theoretical one. A political solution that seems all the more without alternative, as history has shown that in the end, as Arendt wrote, “no one seems to be able to define what these general human rights, as distinguished from the rights of citizen really are”.59 Arendt insists, “Equality, in contrast to all that is involved in mere existence, is not given to us, but is the result of human organization insofar as it is guided by the principle of justice. We are not born equal; we become equal as members of a group on the strength of our decision to guarantee ourselves mutually equal rights”.60 Arendt is doubtful about the existence of any transcendental norms. This has disturbed many and brought against her the accusation of an irresponsible anti-foundationalism, a political existentialism, and a Nietzschean aestheticism.61 Yet, she affirms the “existence of a right to have rights”. It is the right “to live in a framework where one is judged by one’s actions and opinions”.62 Arendt’s right to have rights is precisely not an abstract right, but a claim rooted in the concrete plurality of human beings -- the fundamental human condition that we share the world with others who are both like and unlike ourselves. It is the right to participate in the discourse of plural human beings. The right to have “rights” is also the right to belong to a community that then only determines what the “rights” and “duties” of its members are. These secondary “rights” and “duties” are then not of a prepolitical nature, but the outcome of a historically particular public debate. Arendt does not show us the sans papiers only as victims, or as a disturbing signifier on the level of philosophical representation. By questioning state-centred thinking, the migrants appear also as political actors whose public appearance can be potentially explosive and liberating. I discuss how Arendt’s concept of the conscious pariah can help us understand the impact of the sans papiers movement, and how her concept of power is illustrated by their collective action. <br />

<br />
Thus, Arendt helps us appreciate the political meaning of the sans papiers’ protests. With their actions, they create spaces of public freedom. It is worth contrasting this perspective with the official view on these events. Rather than as a hostile seizure of public space from the outside, these actions appear as democratic re-conquests against the state. Etienne Balibar brings out this point: “Paradoxically, the struggles of the sans papiers – perceived by the government as disturbances of the public order, as blackmailing out of despair or products of a conspiracy the wire-pullers of which have to be identified among the immigrants’ ‘criminal sons’ – have been and are privileged moments in the development of an active citizenship (or of direct participation in public affairs) without which precisely there is no cité but just a statist form cut off from society and paralysed in its own abstraction”.78 Protesters have met fierce repression from the authorities and police. Occupied churches and building are cleared of protesters. Activists are deported despite resistance. The protests have, however, continued and have not been curbed in the climate hostile to migrants after September 11th 2001. For Arendt, there is a strong link between the shared public realm and social power. She states that human beings, by acting together by their joint presence, discover among themselves a potency quite disproportionate to their individual resources. In her famous re-definition of power in contrast to individual strength and instrumental violence, Arendt wrote, “power corresponds to the human ability not just to act, but to act in concert. Power is never the property of an individual: it belongs to a group and remains in existence only so long as the group keeps together”.79 The experience of the power “that springs up whenever people get together and act in concert”80 is reflected in many activists’ accounts. By leaving the clandestinity forced upon them and entering the public, they have, as individuals, re-gained a feeling of existence. “Before, we were only shadows”, one woman put it. With their struggle and the experience of solidarity they have reconquered a sense of dignity and power they had been denied.81 Madjiguène Cissé, for example, describes a case of direct confrontation with the violence of the state apparatus: “we have gained a status as sans papiers. To name but one example: it has now become possible for us to go to the police headquarters in Paris and say: ‘we are the sans papiers of Saint-Bernard and we have business in this building.’ And it does work. You could not have imagined this before the struggle of the sans papiers. That sans papiers come to a policeman who is told every morning: ‘go through Paris and look for sans papiers’; that sans papiers come to him and say: I am a sans papiers, I have a few things to do here. This has been very important”.82 <br />

A. The Doha trade round advances a development laden agenda aiming towards total deregulation of the world<br />
McMichael, sociology professor at Cornell, 2004 p. www.agribusinessaccountability.org/page/332/1<br />
(Philip, Global Agriculture Conference)<br />
In short, Doha concentrates international tensions and the contradictory relations which constitute ‘development.’ Currently, Doha claims further global deregulation as the premise of development. Historically, Doha replicates the GATT Uruguay Round of the 1980s, which aimed to liberalize agriculture and services (then banking, insurance and telecommunications) in which the North held a competitive advantage. At the time the global South was skeptical, as its cheaper exports of steel products, footwear, electronic products, and agricultural products were limited by Northern protections. India and Brazil led the resistance to broadening GATT, but Northern pressure and the promise of open markets, including agricultural markets, tipped the balance (Adams 1993:196-7). When GATT became the WTO, the liberalizing Agreement on Agriculture was the global South’s trade-off for accepting TRIPs and TRIMs, which “soon proved to be a double threat to food security and sovereignty in the developing world” (Wallach and Woodall 2004:193). The Doha Round continues this dance, terming GATS 2000 a trade agreement, which demands openness to ‘cross-border’ provision of services (by TNCs) as a condition for opening EU and US markets in garments, textiles, and agricultural products (Wallach 2003). Oxfam’s Kevin Watkins argues this replays the Uruguay Round, when the global North offered market access in return for protection of TNC patents (costing the South $40 billion in technology rents), suggesting that while the game has changed, the rules are the same: “The West buys your bananas and shirts if you give its banks and insurance companies unrestricted access to your markets” (2002:21). Offering perspective on the terms in which, and means by which, Doha addresses agricultural reform, the international coalition of small farmers, Via Campesina, noted: “The negotiations on agriculture still seem to be a fight between the ‘corporate elephants of the 2 agro-industry’ represented by the European Union, the United States and the Cairns group instead of negotiation on how to come to fair, equitable trade relations that give protection to domestic food production and consumption and the world’s environment” (quoted in Wallach and Woodall 2004: 215). <br />

Claims that development and trade are in the collective interest of all eradicate alternatives by erecting biopolitically constrained subjects<br />
Patel and McMichael, food institute fellow and sociology prof at Cornell, 2004 p. online<br />
(Rajeev and Philip, “Third Worldism and the Lineages of Global Fascism” Third World Quarterly, Vol 25, No 1)<br />
Second, we emphasise that global fascism, as a form of ruthless (for want of a better qualifier) biopolitics, has always been a world-historical phenomenon. This is not to say that fascism qua fascism is, and always has been, smeared across the world. We do, however, suggest that its component forces, in coming together under colonialism, have informed the project of development, albeit in attenuated form. We have only to think of the colonial project—beginning with the cultural genocide in Iberian America, through slavery to forced/contract labour in the late colonial period, and perhaps including the forced expropriation and starvation of Indians, Chinese and Brazilians, among others, documented in Late Victorian Holocausts: El Nin˜o Famines and The Making of the Third World by Mike Davis.11 Indeed, we see our project as allied to Davis. He extends the notion of ‘holocausts’, which had previously been applied to a European phenomenon, into the colonial past.12 We go one step further, pushing the historical boundaries of global fascism back into colonial time and space, and then drawing it forward, into the colonised present. We conjecture that fascist relations are immanent in global capitalism, intensify state biopolitics at moments of crisis, and may be sustained post-crisis for hegemonic purposes. Consider the 1930s, when a rogue state (Germany) was forced to structurally adjust by the League of Nations powers as a consequence of the collapse of the gold–sterling regime. The result was what has come to be known as fascism: a manoeuvring of elites and a populist appeal by the Nazi party to regenerate an idealised national culture through selective mobilization based on ethnic and racial intolerance, and dedicated to reconstructing modernity via state technologies of control. Culture is, of course, always part of capitalism. Stuart Hall’s work informs our use of culture as synonymous with ‘ideology’. The relation between culture and capital that informs our use of ‘global fascism’ is one that invokes particular relations of control between the state, media, the military, and tropes such as ‘family’, ‘homeland’, ‘nation’, ‘God’ and the market.13 Our use of ‘global fascism’ is also an attempt to represent today’s transformed international conjuncture, where the crisis of market rule is premised on the defeat of Third World utopianism, and on a definitive ‘globalisation’ of the commodity form: the combined assault on organised labour (global labour market casualisation), on peasant cultures, and public goods. As early 20th century fascism was premised on the defeat of anti-capitalist forces, so global fascism now targets forces with collective claims that stand in the way of commodification. The increasingly unaccountable institutions of market rule (including the ‘market state’) provide a mechanism for one of the key forces of ‘global fascism’ and, while this is a universal process, it is so contingently, because it continues the racist project begun under colonialism. In this sense we submit that fascism has foundational roots in European-centred development. The capitalist cultural technologies, with their origins in Europe, have now, under a US aegis, been extended under multilateral developmental institutions. This is very much in keeping with the idea of development—an idea with distinct cultural roots and heritage, but an idea that must, of necessity disavow these roots if it is successfully to claim its goal of disinterested and normalised universality. <br />

These subjects are moved and marginalized as objects—international conflicts are privileged and the economic health of the developing world becomes taken as an index of the health of the West<br />
Mignolo, argentinian semiotician and prof at Duke, 2007 p. online<br />
(Walter, “The De-Colonial Option and the Meaning of Identity in Politics”)<br />
The rhetoric of modernity (from the Christian mission since the sixteenth century, to the secular Civilizing mission, to development and modernization after WWII) occluded—under its triumphant rhetoric of salvation and the good life for all—the perpetuation of the logic of coloniality, that is, of massive appropriation of land (and today of natural resources), massive exploitation of labor (from open slavery from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, to disguised slavery, up to the twenty first century), and the dispensability of human lives from the massive killing of people in the Inca and Aztec domains to the twenty million plus people from Saint Petersburg to the Ukraine during WWII killed in the so called Eastern Front.4 Unfortunately, not all the massive killings have been recorded with the same value and the same visibility. The unspoken criteria for the value of human lives is an obvious sign (from a de-colonial interpretation) of the hidden imperial identity politics: that is, the value of human lives to which the life of the enunciator belongs becomes the measuring stick to evaluate other human lives who do not have the intellectual option and institutional power to tell the story and to classify events according to a ranking of human lives; that is, according to a racist classification.5<br />

B. Impacts—1. Taking human lives to be indexes of political phenomena eradicates the value to life<br />
Michael Dillon, professor of politics and international relations at the University of Lancaster, April 1999, Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2, “Another Justice,” p. 164-5<br />
Quite the reverse. The subject was never a firm foundation for justice, much less a hospitable vehicle for the reception of the call of another Justice. It was never in possession of that self-possession which was supposed to secure the certainty of itself, of a self-possession that would enable it ultimately to adjudicate everything. The very indexicality required of sovereign subjectivity gave rise rather to a commensurability much more amenable to the expendability required of the political and material economies of mass societies than it did to the singular, invaluable, and uncanny uniqueness of the self. The value of the subject became the standard unit of currency for the political arithmetic of States and the political economies of capitalism. They trade in it still to devastating global effect. The technologisation of the political has become manifest and global. Economies of evaluation necessarily require calculability. Thus no valuation without mensuration and no mensuration without indexation. Once rendered calculable, however, units of account are necessarily submissible not only to valuation but also, of course, to devaluation. Devaluation, logically, can extend to the point of counting as nothing. Hence, no mensuration without demensuration either. There is nothing abstract about this: the declension of economies of value leads to the zero point of holocaust. However liberating and emancipating systems of value-rights-may claim to be, for example, they run the risk of counting out the invaluable. Counted out, the invaluable may then lose its purchase on life. Herewith, then, the necessity of championing the invaluable itself. For we must never forget that, “we are dealing always with whatever exceeds measure.” But how does that necessity present itself? Another Justice answers: as the surplus of the duty to answer to the claim of Justice over rights. That duty, as with the advent of another Justice, is integral to the lack constitutive of the human way of being.<br />

2. And this enunciation of collective interest is what makes extermination thinkable and probable<br />

For a long time, one of the characteristic privileges of sovereign power was the right to decide life and death. In a formal sense, it derived no doubt from the ancient patria potestas that granted the father of the Roman family the right to “dispose” of the life of his children and his slaves; just as he had given them life, so he could take it away. By the time the right of life and death was framed by the classi¬cal theoreticians, it was in a considerably diminished form. It was no longer considered that this power of the sovereign over his subjects could be exercised in an absolute and un¬conditional way, but only in cases where the sovereign’s very existence was in jeopardy: a sort of right of rejoinder. If he were threatened by external enemies who sought to over¬throw him or contest his rights, he could then legitimately wage war, and require his subjects to take part in the defense of the state; without “directly proposing their death,” he was empowered to “expose their life”: in this sense, he wielded an “indirect” power over them of life and death. But if someone dared to rise up against him and transgress his laws, then he could exercise a direct power over the offender’s life: as punishment, the latter would be put to death. Viewed in this way, the power of life and death was not an absolute privilege: it was conditioned by the defense of the sovereign, and his own survival. Must we follow Hobbes in seeing it as the transfer to the prince of the natural right possessed by every individual to defend his life even if this meant the death of others? Or should it be regarded as a specific right that was manifested with the formation of that new juridical being, the sovereign? In any case, in its modern form—relative and limited—as in its ancient and absolute form, the right of life and death is a dissymmetrical one. The sovereign exercised his right of life only by exercising his right to kill, or by refraining from killing; he evidenced his power over life only through the death he was capable of requiring. The right which was formulated as the “power of life and death” was in reality the right to take life or let live. Its symbol, after all, was the sword. Perhaps this juridical form must be re¬ferred to a historical type of society in which power was exercised mainly as a means of deduction (prelevement), a subtraction mechanism, a right to appropriate a portion of the wealth, a tax of products, goods and services, labor and blood, levied on the subjects. Power in this instance was essentially a right of seizure: of things, time, bodies, and ultimately life itself; it culminated in the privilege to seize hold of life in order to suppress it. Since the classical age the West has undergone a very profound transformation of these mechanisms of power. “Deduction” has tended to be no longer the major form of power but merely one element among others, working to incite, reinforce, control, monitor, optimize, and organize the forces under it: a power bent on generating forces, mak¬ing them grow, and ordering them, rather than one dedicated to impeding them, making them submit, or destroying them. There has been a parallel shift in the right of death, or at least a tendency to align itself with the exigencies of a life-adminis¬tering power and to define itself accordingly. This death that was based on the right of the sovereign is now manifested as simply the reverse of the right of the social body to ensure, maintain, or develop its life. Yet wars were never as bloody as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts on their own populations. But this formidable power of death—and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits—now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to adminis¬ter, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire popula¬tions are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital. It is as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that so many regimes have been able to wage so many wars, causing so many men to be killed. And through a turn that closes the circle, as the technology of wars has caused them to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an individual’s con¬tinued existence. The principle underlying the tactics of bat¬tle-that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on living-has become the principle that defines the strategy of states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical existence of sovereignty; at stake is the biological existence of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modern powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population.<br />

(Arturo, Encountering Development)<br />
The objects with which development began to deal after 1945 were numerous and varied. Some of them stood out clearly (poverty, insufficient technology and capital, rapid population growth, inadequate public services, archaic agricultural practices, and so on), whereas others were introduced with more caution or even in surreptitious ways (such as cultural attitudes and values and the existence of racial, religious, geographic, or ethnic factors believed to be associated with backwardness). These elements emerged from a multiplicity of points: the newly formed international organizations, government offices in distant capitals, old and new institutions, universities and research centers in developed countries, and, increasingly with the passing of time, institutions in the Third World. Everything was subjected to the eye of the new experts: the poor dwellings of the rural masses, the vast agricultural fields, cities, households, factories, hospitals, schools, public offices, towns and regions, and, in the last instance, the world as a whole. The vast surface over which the discourse moved at ease practically covered the entire cultural, economic, and political geography of the Third World. However, not all the actors distributed throughout this surface could identify objects to be studied and have their problems considered. Some clear principles of authority were in operation. They concerned the role of experts, from whom certain criteria of knowledge and competence were asked; institutions such as the United Nations, which had the moral, professional, and legal authority to name subjects and define strategies; and the international lending organizations, which carried the symbols of capital and -power. These principles of authority also concerned the governments of poor countries, which commanded the legal political authority over the lives of their subjects, and the position of leadership of the rich countries, who , had the power, knowledge, and experience to decide on what was to be done. Economists, demographers, educators, and experts in agriculture, public health, and nutrition elaborated their theories, made their assessments and observations, and designed their programs from these institutional sites. Problems were continually identified, and client categories brought into existence. Development proceeded by creating &quot;abnormalities&quot; (such as the &quot;illiterate,&quot; &quot;underdeveloped,&quot; the &quot;malnourished,': &quot;small farmers,&quot; or 'landless peasants&quot;), which it would later treat and reform. Approaches that could have had positive effects in terms of easing material constraints be came, linked to this type of rationality, instruments of power and control. As time went by, new problems were progressively and selectively incorporated; once a problem was incorporated into the discourse, it had to be categorized and further specified. Some problenis were specified at a given level (such as local or regional), or at various of these levels (for instance, a nutritional deficiency identified at the level of the household could be further specified as a regional production shortage or as affecting a given population group), or in relation to a particular institution. But these refined specifications did not seek so much to illuminate possible solutions as to give 'problems&quot; a visible reality amenable to particular treatments. This seemingly endless specification of problems required detailed observations in villages, regions, and countries in the Third World. Complete dossiers of countries were elaborated, and techniques of information were designed and constantly refined. This feature of the discourse allowed for the mapping of the economic and social life of countries, constituting a hue political anatomy of the Third World.22 The end result was the creation of a space of thought and action the expansion of which was dictated in advance by the very same rules introduced during its formative stages. The development discourse defined a perceptual field structured by grids of observation, modes of inquiry and registration of problems, and forms of intervention; in short, it brought into existence a space defined not so much by the ensemble of objects with which it dealt but by a set of relations and a discursive practice that systematically produced interrelated objects, concepts, theories, strategies, and the like. To be sure, new objects have been included, new modes of operation introduced, and a number of variables modified (for instance, in relation to strategies to combat hunger, knowledge about nutritional requirements, the types of crops given priority, and the choices of technology have changed); yet the same set of relations among these elements continues to be established by the discursive practices of the institutions involved. Moreover, seemingly opposed options can easily coexist within the same discursive field (for instance, in development economics, the structuralist school and the monetaiist school seem to be in open contradiction; yet they belong to the same discursive formation and originate in the same set of relations, as will be shown in the next chapter; it can also be shown that agrarian reform, green revolution, and integrated rural development are strategies through which the same unity, &quot;hunger;&quot; is constructed, as I will do in chapter 4). In other words, although the discourse has gone through a series of structural changes, the architecture of the discursive formation laid down in the period 1945-1955 has remained unchanged, allowing the discourse to adapt to new conditions. The result has been the succession of development strategies and substrategies up to the present, always within the confines of the same discursive space.<br />

The question before you is NOT a simple referendum on globalization and multilateral trade—rather, demonstrating that things are always already as they are constitutes a productive intervention that shows “reality” itself is a construct which impedes new political thinking<br />
Foucault 2008<br />
(Michel, The Birth of Biopolitics)<br />
The question here is the same as the question I addressed with regard to madness, disease, delinquency, and sexuality. In all of these cases, it was not a question of showing how these objects were for a long time hidden before finally being discovered, nor of showing how all these objects are only wicked illusions or ideological products to be dispelled in the [light] * of reason finally having reached its zenith. It was a mat¬ter of showing by what conjunctions a whole set of practices-from the moment they become coordinated with a regime of truth-was able to make what does not exist (madness, disease, delinquency, sexuality, etcetera), nonetheless become something, something however that con¬tinues not to exist. That is to say, what I would like to show is not how an error-when I say that which does not exist becomes something, this does not mean showing how it was possible for an error to be con¬structed-or how an illusion could be born, but how a particular regime of truth, and therefore not an error, makes something that does not exist able to become something. It is not an illusion since it is precisely a set of practices, real practices, which established it and thus imperiously marks it out in reality. The point of all these investigations concerning madness, disease, delinquency, sexuality, and what I am talking about now, is to show how the coupling of a set of practices and a regime of truth form an appar¬atus (dispositif) of knowledge-power that effectively marks out in reality that which does not exist and legitimately submits it to the division between true and false. <br />

Vote negative—our alternative, that the act of voting negative by the judge is a symbolic refusal to inhabit our conventional political coordinates—by refusing the hail of the 1AC’s calls to shore up free trade, space is opened up for alternative imaginaries to the status quo<br />
Escobar, award winning anthro professor @ UNC, 1995 p. 222-223<br />
(Arturo, Encountering Development)<br />
One of the most common questions raised about a study of this kind is what it has to say about alternatives. By now it should be clear that there are no grand alternatives that can be applied to all places or all situations. To think about altematives in the manner of sustainable development, for instance, is to remain within the same model of thought that produced development and kept it in place. One must then resist the desire to formulate alternatives at an abstract, macro level; one must also resist the idea that the articulation of alternatives will take place in intellectual and academic circles, without meaning by this that academic knowledge has no role in the politics of alternative thinking. It certainly does, as we will see shortly. Where, then, lies “the alternative”? What instances must be interrogated concerning their relation to possible alternative practices? A first approach to these questions is to look for alternative practices in the resistance grassroots groups present to dominant interventions. This was the predominant approach to the question of alternatives during the 1980s, both in anthropology and critical development studies, even if the relationship between resistance and alternatives was not fully articulated as such. A different, perhaps complementary approach can be gleaned from the ethnographies discussed at tlse end of chapter 2. Those ethnographies sought to investigate the concrete forms and concepts and practices of development and modernity take in specific communities. This type of research might be taken as a point of departure for tlse investigation of altematives from anthropological perspectives. In other words, ethnographies of the circulation of discourses and practices of modernity and development provide us, perhaps for the first time, with a view of where these communities are culturally in relation to development. This view may be taken as a basis for interrogating current practices in terms of their potential role in articulating alternatives. Notions of hybrid models and communities of modelers (chapter 3) are ways of giving form to this research strategy. Said differently, the nature of alternatives as a research question and a social practice can be most fruitfully gleaned from the specific manifestations of such alternatives in concrete local settings. The alternative is, in a sense, always there. From this perspective, there is not surplus of meaning at the local level but meanings that have to be read with new senses, tools, and theories. The deconstruction of development, coupled with the local ethnographies just mentioned, can be important elements for a new type of visibility and audibility of forms of cultural difference and hybridization that researchers have generally glossed over until now. The subaltem do in fact speak, even if the audibility of their voices in the circles where “the West” is reflected upon and theorized is tenuous at best. There is also the question of the translatability into theoretical and practical terms of what might be read, heard, smelled, felt, or intuited in Third World settings. This process of translation has to move back and forth between concrete proposals based on existing cultural differences—with the goal of strengthening those differences by inserting them into political strategies and self-defined and self . directed socioeconomic experiments—and the opening of spaces for destabilizing dominant modes of knowing, so that the need for the most violent forms of translation is diminished. In other words, the process must embrace the challenge of simultaneously seeing theory as a set of contested forms of knowledge—originating in many cultural matrices—and have that theory foster concrete interventions by the groups in question.14 <br />

<h3 id="toc139"><a name="Full Text Info-Kritiks-Chinese Exclusion Counter Narrative"></a>Chinese Exclusion Counter Narrative</h3>
 <br />
We start today with a narrative of the events surrounding the Chinese Exclusion Case. Liav Orgad and Theodore Ruthizer tell the tale:<br />
Orgad &amp; Ruthizer 10 (Liav &amp; Theodore, Spring 2010, “Race, Religion, and Nationality in Immigration Selection: 120 Years After the Chinese Exclusion Case,” 26 Const. Commentary 237, JAK)<br />
On May 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Act authorized the executive branch to exclude persons of Chinese descent. n32 Chae Chan Ping was a Chinese-born laborer who lived in California for many years. Before he departed the United States for a brief visit to his native China, he had obtained a certificate that would entitle him to return to the United States. But during his absence, Congress amended the law to ban the reentry of Chinese, including those with validly-issued certificates. When Chae Chan Ping arrived at the Port of San Francisco, he was barred from reentering. He challenged his exclusion in a case that came before the Supreme Court in May 1889 and became known as the Chinese Exclusion Case.1<br />
<br />
In the majority opinion on the Chinese Exclusion Case, Justice Field commented:<br />
Lee 05 (Anne, Winter 2005, “The Unfettered Executive: Is There an Inherent Presidential Power to Exclude Aliens?” 39 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 223, JAK)<br />
&quot;The presence of Chinese laborers had a baneful effect upon the material interests of the State, and upon public morals; that their immigration was in numbers approaching the character of an Oriental invasion, and was a menace to our civilization.&quot;2<br />
<br />
The Chinese Exclusion has been reborn in SB 1070 as Will To explains.<br />
To 5/7 - Staff Writer (Will To, May 7, 2010, “SB1070 and the Chinese Exclusion Act,” Asian Pacific Americans for Progress, online)<br />
On May 8, 1882, President Chester Arthur signed the Chinese Exclusion Act into existence. It was, without a doubt, one of the most shameful (and least-known) episodes of our nation’s history; for the next sixty-one years, Chinese immigrants were banned from entering the United States. The few who did fit the narrow entry requirements found themselves confined to a prison on San Francisco’s Angel Island and subject to stringent medical, psychological, and physical examinations before they were finally allowed to set foot in the United States. While the law was repealed in 1943, to this day, the Chinese Exclusion Act remains the only legislation which explicitly banishes immigrants by ethnicity—a dark reminder of a supposedly bygone era when a certain people were denied a fundamental human right—simply because of their appearance.<br />
Now, one hundred and twenty years later, during the “post-racial” Obama era, history is repeating itself in the form of Senate Bill 1070—a deceptively unassuming name for the most controversial immigration law since the Chinese Exclusion Act. While Senate Bill 1070 differs from the Chinese Exclusion Act in certain areas, it is certainly a spiritual descendant of the infamous legislation of 1882—born out of the same rampant bigotry, nativism, and rabble-rousing as its lesser-known ancestor. Indeed the circumstances behind SB1070 bear a frightening resemblance to the situation which spawned the Chinese Exclusion Act. <br />
<br />
At its core SB 1070 fosters racial profiling. Rick Su continues,<br />
Su 10 - Associate Professor of Law, State University of New York at Buffalo Law School (Rick, 2010, “The Overlooked Significance of Arizona’s New Immigration Law,” 108 Mich. L. Rev. First Impressions 76, JAK)<br />
The Arizona law at issue, S.B. 1070, is the state’s most recent effort to step up local immigration enforcement. Among its most controversial provisions is the requirement that all law enforcement officials take steps to verify the immigration status of any individual they encounter if there is reason to suspect that the individual is in violation of federal immigration law. Whereas immigration law enforcement has traditionally been a federal responsibility, and most local law enforcement agencies normally inquire about immigration status, if at all, only when an individual has been arrested for an unrelated criminal violation, S.B. 1070 directs law enforcement officials in Arizona to prioritize immigration enforcement in all contexts and whenever there is reasonable suspicion. With federal immigration policies as the backdrop, most of the debate surrounding S.B. 1070 has focused on the extent to which it “empowers” or “allows” state and local law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration laws. Defenders of the measure have justified it as an appropriate response given Arizona’s unique position as an immigration gateway and the lack of federal enforcement. Critics, on the other hand, have argued that such state legislation interferes with operation of federal law, and fear that this statue will ultimately lead to a patchwork of competing and inconsistent state immigration policies. In addition, critics question the expertise of state and local law enforcement officials, and are especially concerned that they may rely on abusive practices like racial profiling.<br />
<br />
SB1070 is being replicated in other state laws. Karla McKanders explains,<br />
McKanders 10 - Associate Professor at University of Tennessee College of Law (Karla Mari, Spring 2010, “Identification of Race in the Law: Sustaining Tiered Personhood: Jim Crow and Anti-Immigrant Laws,” 26 Harv. BlackLetter J. 163, Lexis, JAK)<br />
Current state and local anti-immigrant laws should be examined in relation to Jim Crow laws because, as evidenced by the federal immigration system, laws that target immigrants are not free from the taint of racial discrimination. Viewing state and local activity against this historical backdrop, there should be heightened concerns over permitting states and localities to exercise unfettered discretion in enacting laws that target Latino immigrants. n120 As state and local entities begin enacting laws targeting immigrants, even more similarities to Jim Crow laws are arising. Currently there is a tension between the federal government and state and local entities, which claim anti-immigrant statutes and ordinances are valid exercises of the states' Tenth Amendment police powers, n121 which is similar to the tension that existed during the Jim Crow era. Jim Crow laws involved state [*187] and local refusal to adhere to the Reconstruction Amendments, while anti-immigrant laws involve the relationship between the federal, state, and local governments and the states and localities defiantly enacting laws in reaction to the federal government's failure to enact comprehensive immigration reforms. n122 Some state and local legislators allege that the federal government's inaction has adversely affected their citizens. For this reason, states and localities have exploited the federal government's failure to act and have enacted their own immigration policies. A second similarity is the speed and manner in which anti-immigrant laws are being enacted. Both Jim Crow and anti-immigrant laws quickly spread across the country, as the success of each new law emboldened state and local legislators to take action. In 2008, approximately 1,700 state and local immigration-related laws were passed. n123 In 2009, the National Conference of State Legislatures found that approximately 1,500 bills on immigrants and refugees were introduced in states across the country. n124 Also, like the federal courts during the Jim Crow era, some federal judges are similarly deferential to states and localities passing laws that target Latino immigrants. n125 Recent federal court decisions are signaling to states and localities that they have the authority to enact legislation that affects immigrants under states' Tenth Amendment police [*188] powers. n126 For example, in Arizona, the federal district court and Ninth Circuit upheld the Legal Arizona Workers Act n127 that targeted undocumented workers. n128 The Legal Arizona Workers Act revokes the business license of employers who hire undocumented immigrants. n129 The proliferation of state and local anti-immigrant laws mirrors the proliferation of Jim Crow laws. In both instances, there is a fundamental disagreement amongst the federal, state, and local government regarding authority over regulation of either immigration or, in the case of Jim Crow, prohibiting state and local discriminatory action. In both cases, the failure to resolve the disagreement results in the increase of state and local laws targeting vulnerable populations.<br />

Our individual advocacy is key to breaking down racism. Deborah Kenn furthers,<br />
Kenn 1 - Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse University College of Law (Deborah, Fall 2001 “Institutionalized, Legal Racism: Housing Segregation and Beyond.” 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35. p. lexis. // WPDU-JR)<br />
Until an effort equal to the efforts to create and maintain housing segregation and its consequences is initiated, supported, and perpetuated in our country, we can expect our racist legacy to continue and intensify. The effort must start with dismantling the racist institutions of housing segregation, white privilege, school segregation, and discrimination in the criminal justice system. The systemic problem of racism must be attacked systemically. Again, Professor Williams states: With regard to all these configurations, let me just say that I am certain that the solution to racism lies in our ability to see its ubiquity but not to concede its inevitability. It lies in the collective and institutional power to make change, at least as much as with the individual will to change. It also lies in the absolute moral imperative to break the childish, deadly circularity of centuries of blindness to the shimmering brilliance of our common, ordinary humanity. n203 Above all, each individual (and I'm speaking here to white people) needs to acknowledge that they can either be part of the problem or part of the solution. Continuing merrily along, enjoying our white privilege, oblivious to the negative impact we have on our black neighbors, makes us complicit in the centuries of racism that brought us to our racist present. Doing nothing is doing everything to [*72] be a part of the problem. In the eloquent words of Professor June Jordan: We need, each of us, to begin the awesome, difficult work of love: loving ourselves so that we become able to love other people without fear so that we can become powerful enough to enlarge the circle of our trust and our common striving for a safe, sunny afternoon near to flowering trees and under a very blue sky. n204 We can continue to travel the path of hatred and distrust or we can choose to begin dismantling the institutions borne of the distrust between races. Which kind of world do we want to live in - a world of hate or a world of love? Will we choose a world that isolates, separates, and wreaks unimaginable suffering on entire communities of people, or a world that celebrates the diversity of people and welcomes differences between people for the richness it brings to our lives?<br />

Application of strict scrutiny forces a ruling against Arizona because it prevents devolution of responsibility.<br />
Hartley 7 - Professor of Law, The Catholic University of America (Roger C., 2007, “Congressional Devolution of Immigration Policymaking: A Separation of Powers Critique,” 2 Duke J. Const. Law &amp; Pub. Pol'y 93, Lexis, JAK)<br />
For roughly a decade, federal legislation has devolved to the states some of Congress’s authority to adopt immigration policies that discriminate against permanent resident aliens.1 Equal protection challenges to discriminatory state policies so authorized by Congress raise the knotty issue of the appropriate scope of judicial review. Courts remain divided.2 The source of the difficulty is that the equal protection “congruence principle” is not applicable to alienage discrimination.3 Unlike equal protection cases throughout most of constitutional law, the judiciary deploys different standards of judicial review in alienage discrimination cases depending on whether the discrimination arises under federal or state law.4 Applying a highly deferential standard of review, courts normally uphold congressionally enacted immigration policies discriminating against aliens.5 By contrast, courts normally invoke strict judicial scrutiny to find state alienage discrimination unlawful.6 Congressional devolution legislation authorizing states to adopt policies that discriminate against aliens spawn equal protection challenges that do not fit neatly into either category of judicial review: the controversies entail state alienage discrimination but the discrimination being challenged is congressionally authorized. Devolution presents the question whether Congress should be able to immunize the states from strict judicial scrutiny by authorizing the states to adopt discriminatory immigration policies that Congress could itself adopt.<br />

 <br />
A. The ideology of anti-trafficking practices makes migrants completely invisible, ignoring the root practices (trade liberalization, capitalist labor markets, war) that have led to their displacement. The solution of providing a space for trafficked women denies agency, diverts focus from safe migration practices, and condones the state’s global security agenda.<br />
Sharma, York Univ Social Science Asst Prof, 05 (Nandita, “Anti-Trafficking Rhetoric and the Making of Global Apartheid”, NWSA Journal, fall, project muse)<br />
This article examines one increasingly important, and increasingly obfuscated, aspect of the national and international security agenda—that of anti-trafficking campaigns directed, in particular, at controlling the migration of women and children. I argue that anti-trafficking practices operate as a moral panic that simultaneously obscure the vulnerability of migrant women in the nexus of state and capitalist practices while representing them as victims solely of traffickers. This moral panic serves to legitimize increasingly regressive state practices of immigration control. These controls, in turn, form the basis for the construction and maintenance of a global apartheid whereby differential legal regimes are organized within nationalized space: one for &quot;citizens&quot; and another far more regressive one for those, such as people categorized as &quot;illegal,&quot; who are denied a permanent legal status within the nation space. The ideological frame of anti-trafficking minimizes and often makes migrants as displaced people completely invisible. The ideology of anti-trafficking does not recognize that migrants have been displaced by practices that have resulted in the loss of their land and/or livelihoods through international trade liberalization policies, mega-development projects, the loss of employment in capitalist labor markets, or war. Not only does the frame of anti-trafficking lead to a suspicion of women's (and children's) migration so that it is only ever seen as crisis-producing instead of life-saving, it further renders as unseeable the reasons why migrants are forced to make clandestine movements, usually with the help of people who know how to get them across national borders undetected. Since the problem of displacement and the state-controlled process of illegalizing migrants are represented as problems of trafficking, a particular &quot;solution&quot; comes to make common sense: criminalize those who move people clandestinely and return those who have been moved by traffickers to their &quot;home&quot; societies as soon as possible. This solution fits smoothly into existing national and international security agendas, for the discourse of anti-trafficking with its law-and-order agenda of &quot;getting tough&quot; with traffickers, diverts attention from restrictive immigration practices that make it impossible for most of the world's migrants to move legally and safely or to live securely in the places they move to. By drawing attention to acts of clandestine migrations, anti-trafficking campaigns pay no real attention to how best to ensure safe migration practices for women (including exit, transit, and resettlement). This is [End Page 89] because the more influential versions of anti-trafficking campaigns do not see the victims of trafficking as women exercising agency (however much constrained) in crossing national borders. Instead, anti-trafficking campaigns view women solely as victims forced or duped into migrating for the sole benefit of the predatory trafficker.<br />
<br />
B. Anti-trafficking campaigns provide a veneer of humanism to rationalize greater migration repression, exacerbating the root causes of trafficking<br />
Sharma, York Univ Social Science Asst Prof, 05 (Nandita, “Anti-Trafficking Rhetoric and the Making of Global Apartheid”, NWSA Journal, fall, project muse)<br />
Critical reflection on the experiences of the women I worked with makes it clear that conceptualizing the process of clandestine migration as the cause of people's exploitation not only denies the agency of women migrants but creates and legitimates punitive state measures aimed at punishing traffickers (and smugglers) rather than assisting migrants in their survival strategies (Crépeau 2003). In fact, by discursively rationalizing their efforts through the &quot;relations of rescue,&quot; anti-trafficking campaigns provide what is often missing for such state repressive measures—the veneer of humanitarianism (Pascoe 1993). By portraying migration as the cause of exploitation, the notion that women are always better off at &quot;home&quot; is accepted without question. Acts of deportation are imbued with the moral authority of helping a victim. By characterizing such calls as something that caring people would naturally demand, they become depoliticized within the feminist lexicon. In this regard, Kara Gillies argues that, it is of &quot;great concern that . . . [recent] changes to immigration and refugee law make specific references to the trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes as part of the platform for why we need to tighten our borders. It seems to me a very deliberate ruse to garner support from otherwise liberal thinking people for an extremely [racialized] and regressive immigration policy&quot; (in Brock et al. 2000, 87). In this way, attempts by feminists who use the discursive frame of anti-trafficking as an attempt to garner sympathy for women migrants also gain approval for anti-immigrant practices. Predictably, most resources spent on ending trafficking have been put into border control measures aimed at uncovering clandestine movements [End Page 96]of people and prosecuting smugglers/traffickers. The main result of such practices is to make illegalized migrations much more dangerous. As people smugglers/traffickers face greater penalties if discovered, migrants are increasingly being funneled through more precarious routes leading to an unprecedented number of deaths (Fekete 2003, 2; Nevins 2002, 124).5 The increased danger of smuggling people also has led to an increase in the cost of hiring smugglers, thereby placing migrants in greater debt and creating increased financial hardships on the families and communities supporting their migration. Moreover, increased punitive measures against smuggling/trafficking have made the emergence of modern-day Harriet Tubmans even more unlikely. <br />

<h3 id="toc141"><a name="Full Text Info-Kritiks-Biometric Borders K"></a>Biometric Borders K</h3>
 <br />
Borders and geopolitical control were achieved through violence – the states’ attempt to regulate its borders and the borders of other states is marked by an attempt to remove elements of centrifugal otherness that poses threats to the tenuous hold over territories and identities. As former stabilities of the bordered world turn into instabilities, violence is proliferated within the world and will continue to proliferation unless the impetus for control is removed.<br />
<br />
Shapiro and Akler, Professor of PoliSci at Hawaii, 97 <br />
[Michael, Challenging Boundaries by Shapiro and Akler, University of Minnesota Press]<br />
<br />
The political consolidations represented by the state territorial map-the international imaginary- were achieved through violent confrontations. Moreover, although space appears innocent, &quot;the epitome of rational abstraction...because it has already been occupied and used, and has already been the focus of past processes whose traces are not always evident in the landscape,&quot; it remains contested. The violence continues as states attempt, physically and discursively, to marginalize or destroy various aspects of centrifugal otherness: ethnic solidarities, reasserted nationalisms, indigenous movements, and draft resistances, all dissonant elements proclaiming the tenuous hold of states over territories and identities. Although these affronts to the state system do not appear on standard territorial maps or within the conceptual spaces of modernity's dominant political discourses, the challenges they pose have become increasingly registered as the former stabilities of the bordered world become more fragile and states react to reassert control.<br />

Today, borders are no longer the geographic lines scribbled between sovereign entities. First, they are locatable only as the non-rights zones of security verification. <br />
<br />
Balibar, 2004 <br />
(Etienne, We ,The People of Europe: Reflections on Transnational Citizenship, (Oxford: Princeton University Press,) p. 111<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I would like to give a schematic account of what I previously called the paradox of the movement of borders from the &quot;edge&quot; to the &quot;center&quot; of public space. To begin with, this displacement takes on quite concrete and perceptible forms. They include the phenomena of reproduction of &quot;ethnic borders&quot; within the urban neighborhoods of the great &quot;world cities&quot; that accompany the migration and concentration of populations from the whole world, and whose complexity explodes the far-too-reductive idea of &quot;communitarianism&quot; or &quot;ghettos.&quot;21 We would have to accompany them with a typology of today's &quot;divided cities,&quot; each of which fundamentally represents a singular case that can only be measured by its own history: Jerusalem, Hong Kong, Berlin still and always, Frankfurt, Paris.&quot; But there is another aspect that has been forced on our attention by the problems relative to the treatment of asylum seekers and the modalities of control of so-called clandestine immigrants in Western Europe, which pose serious problems of the protection and institution of human rights: the system of identity verifications (generally occurring within the territory) allowing a triage of travelers admitted to and rejected from a given national territory. For the mass of humans today, these are the most decisive borders, but they are no longer &quot;lines&quot;: instead they are detention zones and filtering systems such as those located in the center or on the periphery of major international airports. It is well known that these transit zones are zones of &quot;non-right&quot; in which guarantees of individual freedom are suspended for a variable length of time, and where foreigners again become noncitizens and pariahs a clear illustration of what I said above regarding the nondemocratic conditions of democracy.23<br />
<br />
Second is algorithmic war. The war on terror has insidiously laid the foundation for the government to anchor its borders into all human bodies – the visa system is an artifact of biopolitical control. <br />
Amoore, L. 2006:<br />
<br />
(Deputy Department Head of Geography Department at Durham University. Biometric borders: governing mobilities in the war on terror.Political Geography 25, 336-51.)<br />
<br />
Two years on from the initial hearings, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced theSmart Border Alliance, headed up by management consultants Accenture, as the prime contractors for US VISIT,1 a $US10 billion project to restructure and manage all aspects of US air, land and sea port of entry security. The US VISIT programme, which I will use as my central point of discussion in this paper, represents one discrete example of a more prevalent phenomenon in the contemporary war on terror: the proliferation of risk management techniques as a means of governing mobilities.2 Accenture's self-styled ‘virtual border’, they promise, ‘is designed to operate far beyond US boundaries’, enabling the DHS to ‘assess the security risks of all US-bound travellers and prevent potential threats from reaching US borders’ (Accenture digital forum, 2004, p. 1). Under US VISIT, the management of the border cannot be understood simply as a matter of the geopolitical policing and disciplining of the movement of bodies across mapped space. Rather, it is more appropriately understood as a matter of biopolitics, as a mobile regulatory site through which people's everyday lives can be made amenable to intervention and management.<br />
In this paper I develop the concept of the biometric border in order to signal a dual-faced phenomenon in the contemporary war on terror: the turn to digital technologies, data integration and managerial expertise in the politics of border management; and the exercise of biopower such that the body itself is inscribed with, and demarcates, a continual crossing of multiple encoded borders – social, legal, gendered, racialized and so on. The term biometric border, now part of the lingua franca of the risk consultants and the government departments charged with fighting the war on terror, has yet to be analysed critically in terms of how it is being deployed. As a manifestation of what Walters (2002, p. 571) calls the ‘biopolitical border’, biometric borders extend the governing of mobility into domains that regulate multiple aspects of daily life. Subject to biopower, the crossing of a physical territorial border is only one border crossing in a limitless series of journeys that traverse and inscribe the boundaries of safe/dangerous, civil/uncivil, legitimate traveller/illegal migrant.<br />
<br />
Biometrics bluemap violence into the daily experience of both the citizen and non-citizen. The visa has become the war by other means – a way of managing moveable bodies so that the sovereign has reason to extend itself in an increasingly globalized world. <br />

(Louise, Deputy Department Head of Geography Department at Durham University, “Algorithmic War: Everyday Geographies of the War On Terror,” Antipode (41.1) pp. 49-69 <br />
<br />
Citing international relations scholar Michael Shapiro, Derek Gregory argues that “geography is inextricably linked to the architecture of enmity”, to the overlapping practices through which “collectivities locate themselves in the world and thus how they practice the meanings of Self and Other that provide the conditions of possibility for regarding others as threats or antagonists” (2004:20). Yet, Gregory's “spiraling networks” do not fully push the limits of Shapiro's architecture because they return the geopolitics of violence to the disciplinary norms of battlefield spaces, obscuring the subtle differential violences of the “surveillance network” of the “end-of-violence organization” that Shapiro later depicts (2004:121). In the name of homeland security (the end of violence), algorithmic war reinscribes the imaginative geography of the deviant, atypical, abnormal “other”inside the spaces of daily life. The figure of enmity to be feared and intercepted need not only dwell in a represented outside in the geographies of Iraq or Afghanistan, for the outside can be inside—in the body of the migrant worker (differentially normal in the space of the economy and abnormal in the spaces of immigration), the young Muslim student (permitted to study but observed in the college's Islamic society), the refugee (afforded the hospitality of the state but biometrically identified and risk-rated), the British Asian traveler (granted visa waiver but ascribed an automated risk score). Continued…<br />
<br />
…Continued<br />
Thus, the emergent geography of a twisted and conjoined figure of inside and outside, where “one does not know on which face of the strip one is located” (Bigo 2001:115). For Didier Bigo, this is a spatiality of the policing of multiple and variant lines between self and other, an “everyday securitization from the enemy within” (2001:112). Here the architecture of enmity becomes the means of securitization itself, such that the distinction between “real” war (with accompanying visceral violence and bloodshed) and the war by other means (legitimated by securing against future violence) becomes permeable. The network warfare depicted in accounts of a “military–industrial–media–entertainment (MIME) complex”, where “information is no longer a subsidiary of war”, extends the stealthy war-like practices “more widely and deeply into our everyday lives (Der Derian 2002; see also Dillon and Reid 2007). Consider, for example, the Oracle Corporation's software, already ubiquitous in our lives, providing IT platforms for payroll, pensions, health care, the bibliographic searches used in academic research, and so on. Their algorithmic security systems—Non-Obvious Relationship Awareness (NORA) software—developed for the entertainment industry and used in the Las Vegas casinos—are now deployed by the US Justice and federal intelligence agencies for counter-terror. According to Oracle consultants, NORA enables clients to identify “obscure relationships between customers, employees, vendors, and other internal and external data sources”. NORA searches for behaviour patterns or personal associations that hint at terrorist activity, turning data into actionable intelligence” (IDC 2004:11).<br />
<br />
The association rules of the algorithm claim precisely to identify associations, to connect together here and there, to link that location of suspicion and this embodied risk, to suture together the forces of war in one place and the possibility of threat in the spaces of everyday life. In essence, as it traverses the spheres of commerce and consumption, transportation, military strategy and state surveillance, the algorithm simultaneously conceals the architecture of enmity through which it functions. Giving the appearance of an advanced security decision based on the technical and scientific computation of norms and deviations from norm, beneath its skin the algorithm contains all of the categories, codes and measures that we see in other violent geographies—the racial profiles embedded within biometric facial measures, the ethnic or religious practices flagged as anomalous in air passenger data, the identification of risk by algorithmic screening of name or address. These are the more subtle violences of science and state that are not measured by a linear experience of harm, but instead attach themselves to daily prosaic practices, limiting the possibilities for life, of life itself (Das and Kleinman 2000).<br />
<br />
<br />
Our Alternative is to vote negative. The political call to negate the resolution ruptures the neutral veneer of the affirmative’s language and decision. By disrupting and interrogating the algorithmic logic of the 1AC, we critique the very architecture of the visa system, and reveal their securitizing impact scenarios and solvency claims as violent reiterations of sovereignty. <br />

You won't get by the booth … You look too young to be driving out of state … But there is nobody in the booth built to hold a toll-taker. Nobody. A green light flashes E-Z PASS PAID and Ahmad and the white truck are admitted to the tunnel (Updike 2006:298).<br />
<br />
In a final scene of John Updike's novel Terrorist, the protagonist Ahmad drives his truck bomb to the entrance of the Manhattan-bound Lincoln tunnel. His passenger and reluctant mentor, Jack Levy, urges him that the security guard will detain him on the grounds that he looks too young to have a state license permitting him to drive out of state. At the boundary line of the city, Levy feels sure, their fatal journey will be halted, their movement intercepted. What Levy does not anticipate is the RFID transponder on the windshield of the truck, sending a signal to the barrier reader, algorithmically calculating—is the truck licensed? Is the toll pre-paid? Has the vehicle been reported stolen? The calculation is made, a green light flashes and the truck enters the tunnel. In Updike's novel, the practices of homeland securitization are revealed in all their contingency and unpredictability (asked by his wife what the Homeland Security department's elevation of threat from yellow to orange means, Levy replies “It means they want us to feel they have a handle on this thing, but they don't”). The algorithmic technologies, so readily established at the forefront of the securitization of borders and boundaries of many kinds, are revealed in Updike's novel to be intrinsic to the feigning of securability. The point here is that we know not, in any meaningful sense, what algorithmic war will do beyond giving the impression that things/people/commodities can be secured against an imagined enemy. It could have been the case—had the association rules shown the white truck to be on a watch list database, or the E-Z Pass to be expired, or had a previous transaction flagged a risk—that the algorithm signalled a red light and the movement of the truck would have been intercepted. Yet, these are the contingencies of the relationship of the algorithmic calculation to the actual everyday geographies they seek to model and simulate. These are the unknowns, the indeterminacies of algorithmic war.<br />
<br />
The question, then, is how to open up these contingencies and ambiguities in order to politicize what would otherwise be a highly technologized set of moves. “Uncertainty and unpredictability can be unsettling”, writes Jenny Edkins, “in the rational west, we tend to seek certainty and security above all. We don't like not knowing. So we pretend that we do” (2003a:12). The algorithmic war I have described here—with its dividing geographies of us/them, safe/risky—is precisely one means by which we “pretend that we do”. Algorithmic logics appear to make it possible to translate probable associations between people and objects into actionable security decisions, or to incorporate the uncertain future into the present. The practices of this war by other means, then, are themselves productive of quite specific pre-emptive forms of war and violence. Though the everyday geographies of this “other” war on terror are partially militarizing, in the sense of drawing military practice more closely into proximity with everyday life, they are more meaningfully drawing on a militarization of thinking that is co-present in corporate calls for risk targets and the riding out of uncertainty, in state drives to target, track and trace people and objects, and in the suspicions and prejudices of an enlisted vigilant public.<br />

There are 2 types of Hospitality, Conditional and Unconditional. The affirmative is a notion of pure conditional hospitality. They place conditions on which the immigrant must accept and become accustomed to or else there is no home for them. Their conception has no adherence to unconditional hospitality. <br />
Derrida, 1990. (Jacques, “A discussion with Jacques Derrida’”, Theory and Event Issue 5.1 Pg. 16-17)<br />
<br />
That's conditional hospitality, in a colonial structure in which there is a master, there is someone who is the host. As you will recall, the word host means hospes, means the master, sometimes the husband, the male master of the house, and in that case we have conditional hospitality. To which I -- I won't say 'oppose' -- but in contrast to which I try to think pure and unconditional hospitality, the idea of a pure welcoming of the unexpected guest, the unexpected arriving one. From that point of view I would distinguish between the hospitality of the invitation and the hospitality of the visitation. In the invitation, the master remains master at home, chez soi, and the host remains the host and the guest remains the guest, the invited guest -- 'Please, come in, you're invited' -- but of course as invited guest you won't disturb too seriously the order of the house, you're going to speak our language, eat the way we eat ... et cetera et cetera. To this invitation, to this hospitality of invitation, I would oppose -- or not oppose but rather distinguish from it -- the hospitality of visitation. The visitor is not an invited guest, the visitor is the unexpected one who arrives and to whom a pure host should open his house without asking questions such as: who are you? what are you coming for? will you work with us? do you have a passport? do you have a visa? and so on and so forth -- that's unconditional hospitality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their purely political and regulated hospitality leads to tyrannical violence. The immigrant “other” is forced to becomes faceless and one with which any violence can be justified against.<br />
Derrida, 1997. (Jacques, “Adieu to Emmanuel levinas”, Stanford University Press. Pg. 96-97)<br />
<br />
The Preface of Totality and Infinity already denounces the &quot;peace of empires&quot; -about which there would still be much to say today, well beyond the pax romana: &quot;The peace of empires issued from war rests on war.&quot; This concept: of peace seems to move at once toward and away from Kant, who is himself at once Christian and a man of the Enlightenment, who thinks peace in a purely political fashion and always on the basis of the State, even if the notion of the political in this politics is always inadequate to itself. The insistent critique of the State in Totality and Infinity regularly calls into question the &quot;tyranny of the State&quot; as well as the &quot;anonymous universality of the State.&quot;I05 The becoming political of hospitality, its becoming part of the State, is no doubt a response to an aspiration; it corresponds, moreover, to the call of the third; but it &quot;deforms the I and the other&quot; and tends to introduce tyrannical violence. That is why politics must never be left &quot;to itself&quot; It would always judge &quot;in absentia,&quot; always judge only the dead or the absent, where the face is not present, where there is no one to say &quot;Here I am.&quot; This might be the place for a future meditation on what being &quot;in absentia&quot; might mean in relation to law and to politics, beyond the striking though fleeting use Levinas makes of this word or figure. Though Metaphysics, or the relation to the other, is accomplished as service and as hospitality. Insofar as the face of the Other relates us to the third, the metaphysical relation of the I to the Other moves into the form of the We, aspires to a State, institutions, laws, which are the source of universality. But politics left to itself bears a tyranny within itself; it deforms the I and the other who have given rise to it, for it judges them according to universal rules, and thus as in absentia [par contumace].The political dissimulates because it brings to light. It hides what it throws light on. Giving the face to be seen, bringing or attracting it into the space of public phenomenality, it thereby renders it invisible. Visibility renders invisible its invisibility, that is, the withdrawal of its epiphany. But exhibiting the invisibility of the face is not the only way of dissimulating it. The violence of the political mistreats the face yet again by effacing its unicity in a generality. These two violences are in the end the same, and Levinas associates them when he speaks of &quot;attention to the Other as unicity and face (which the visibleness of the political leaves invisible),which can be produced only in the unicity of an I.&quot; He then immediately adds, pointing in the direction of a certain interpretation of Kierkegaard or Rosenzweig, the clarification that we must cite and situate one more time, so as now to emphasize a certain &quot;perhaps&quot;: &quot;Subjectivity is thus rehabilitated in the work of truth, and not as an egoism refusing the system which offends it. Against this egoist protestation of the subjectivity, against this protestation in the first person, the universalism of Hegelian reality will perhaps prevail.<br />
<br />
The Alternative is to reject the affirmative –<br />
Their purely political basing behind their plan condemns death of nations everywhere. We are not advocating to let every single person come to the U.S. unquestioned. We are advocating a discussion of a priori ethics where unconditional hospitality is taken into account and is the backbone behind political decisions. <br />
Yegenoglu 2003 (Meyda, Professor at Department of Sociology at Middle East Technical University, &quot;Liberal Multiculturalism and the Ethics of Hospitality in the Age of Globalization,&quot; Postmodern Culture 13.2, project muse. Pg.39)<br />
<br />
If unconditional or pure hospitality is impossible, then what is the possibility of the politics of hospitality? Like the relation between law and justice, where it is in the name of justice that one deconstructs the law, it is in the name of unconditional hospitality that conditional hospitality can be deconstructed. To tend to unconditional hospitality one has to deconstruct and improve the laws on hospitality (such as immigration laws), but these laws will never guarantee unconditional hospitality as such. The relation between them will remain open and irreducible. As Derrida notes, the law is perfectible and there is progress to be performed on the law that will improve the conditions of hospitality. The condition of the laws on immigration has to be improved without claiming that unconditional law should become an official policy. The very desire for unconditional hospitality is what regulates the improvement of the laws of hospitality. According to Derrida, hospitality in the `Western' tradition is marked by the paternal and the phallogocentric, or by the logic of the master/host, nation, the door or the threshold. His critique calls into question the limitations of this specifically `European' history of hospitality and suggests a future beyond this history, and thus a hospitality beyond the logic of `patemity' (and its extension to the nation) or the logos. This does not mean that nation states should open their borders unconditionally to any `new' comer or that they should go beyond their national interests to `welcome' the other. In fact, Derrida's critique is a call to resist the tyranny of the state and its law making while opening up democratic institutions beyond a certain patriotic reductionism. That is what Derrida calls his `New International', a rebellion against patriotism: `compatriots of every country, translator-poets rebel against patriotism' (I 997a: 57). Hospitality lives on the paradox of presupposing a nation, a home, a door for it to happen but once one establishes a threshold, a door or a nation, hospitality ceases to happen and becomes hostility (Derrida, 2001: 6). Therefore, hospitality is marked by a double bind and its impossibility is the condition of its possibility. It stays on the threshold that keeps it alive and open to new-comers. The distinction introduced in Derrida's works between, on the one hand, unconditional hospitality or 'absolute desire for hospitality' and on the other, conditional hospitality or the rights and duties that condition hospitality ('a law, a conditional ethics, a politics') is not a distinction that `paralyses' hospitality. In fact, it aims at directing our attention to find an `intermediate schema' between the two, `a radical heterogeneity, but also indissociability' in the sense of calling for the other or prescribing the other. To keep alive the aporia between ethics (the law of hospitality) and politics (the laws of hospitality) is to keep political laws and regulations open to new changes and circumstances and to keep alive the fact that hospitality is always inhabited by hostility. It is the question of intervening in the conditional hospitality in the name of the unconditional, an intervention that, though surrounded by contradictions and aporias, recognizes the need of'perverting'the laws for the sake of `perfecting' them. Derrida stresses the aporetic relationship between the unconditional hospitality or ethics, which starts with risks, and the conditional hospitality or politics that starts with the calculation or controlling of these risks. However, if this calculation means the closure of all boundaries, not only territorial but also cultural, social and linguistic, this would mean the death of the nation. If the other by definition is incalculable, political calculations have to include a margin for the incalculable. In other words, Derrida (1997a: 13) refuses to close down hospitality to the logic of `paternity' and (its extension the nation) or the logos because hospitality is the anti-logic of the logos, that is, of closure and determinism.<br />

 <br />
The seemingly benign American influence promoted by the Affirmative the logic of New Orientalism - where American Empire is continued through other means such as troop withdraw, and humanitarian or legal assistance. This is the modus operandi of American Imperialism Lite – the attempt to justify imperialism though innocence.<br />
Jackie Assayag ‘7 CNRS, Maison Frangaise, Oxford, etnografica . maio de 2007 . 11 (I): 253-269 (East and West. Orientalism, war and the colonial present) <br />
Michael Ignatieff has described (in an uncritical manner) the North American project as an &quot;imperialism lite&quot;, a hegemony without colonies, a global sphere of influence relieved of the weight of direct administration and of the risks entailed in the day to day management of politics.^&quot; Thus the &quot;burden&quot; of Kipling would have become lighter in passing from England to the United States, for it is true that the task and the message have in the meantime changed. Today, it is a question of conducting a &quot;war against terrorism&quot;. To declare war on individuals and forces liberated from existing legal institutions, or eluding ethical control, proves to be an interminable task. The actors involved in this type of violence in fact freely determine the arms and the targets of their choice, independently of state constraint. Contrary to war according to Clausewitz, the &quot;crusade against terrorism&quot; will not be able to triumph, for it is &quot;the continuation of political absence by other means&quot;.2' Because of this lack of global politics and because of the deficiency of a world political authority, the multiplication of violent conflicts can be expected. De facto, one has fallen back on the war against &quot;rogue&quot; or &quot;delinquent&quot; states. The declared imperial will is to destroy them with a view to reforming them according to the advantages of liberal capitalism and of democracy for the benefit of the greatest number. The intention is even to impose the respect for human rights and related cosmopolitan values in the (&quot;foreign&quot; and &quot;hostile&quot;) populations, whose major concerns manifestly belong to another order. The concurrent state establishment of the market economy and democratic ideals by means of military force should make nation-building possible and to pacify the &quot;civil society&quot; by ensuring at the same time economic development and growth. Knowing, however, that the Star-Spangled Banner will wave only so long as it is necessary to introduce a free market and the reign of liberty. The hyperpower thus allows itself but a parenthetical empire. But, how to be a &quot;minimum empire&quot; when one maintains seven hundred and fifty military bases in one hundred and thirty countries, besides numerous programmes of &quot;secret intervention&quot;, &quot;silent operation&quot; and &quot;police protection&quot;, as well as plans for &quot;virtual bases&quot; that encircle the globe? The only possibility is to temporarily and flexibly implement it, or to enunciate it through disavowal manoeuvres: an empire denied or a denial of empire. Thus the United States sells the notion of empire by offering a cut-price colonization: the responsible Americans now only plan interventions that are as brief as possible, in other words, a &quot;McOccupation&quot;. However, this furtive and hardly reliable concept of imperial authority will always be perceived as an invasion and a predation by the &quot;occupied&quot;, apart from the fact that such a volatile colonization proves to be full of danger for the &quot;occupiers&quot; as well as the &quot;occupied&quot;. The idea of a &quot;lite&quot; empire also finds its bearings in the representation according to which such a regime would remove all contradictions, would abolish the distinctions between &quot;outer&quot; and &quot;inner&quot;, would efface the borders between &quot;outside&quot; and &quot;inside&quot;. &quot;There is no longer an outside&quot;, write Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri. In their view, &quot;The modern dialectic of internal and external has been replaced by an interplay of degrees ans intensities, hybridities and artifice&quot;. Similarly, the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman contends that 9/11 September has made it clear that there is no outside&quot;. Hence, the negative corollary posed by a number of observers: with European unification and the emergence of the new world &quot;governance&quot;, guided by the enlightened ideas of opening outwards and interdependence, the mutual vulnerability of all countries is growing, also on American territory Thus, we would have entered into international relations of the &quot;postmodern&quot; type. But, who does not perceive that 9/11 &quot;a deferred effect of the 'Cold War', the genealogy of which can be traced back to the support of the mujahiddin by the United States against the intervention of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan&quot; (Derrida, in Borradori 2003: 92)? And who could contest that this event experienced as a cataclysm, followed by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, apart from the interminable conflict in Palestine, has raised the veil of antagonism between the &quot;colonizer&quot; and the &quot;colonized&quot;, radicalized the political positions of each of the entrenched camps and, finally, has deepened the Manichean geography between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;? <br />

Impact – the New Orientalism necessitates war and genocide against the supposedly irrational Oriental other. Accepting this ideology sparks a new wave of Crusades – the only way to deal with a completely excluded Other is to seek its elimination. Once we have designated a group of people is inherently different – the road to their genocide is short indeed.<br />
PINAR BATUR ‘7• Vassar College (Handbook of the Sociology of Racial and Ethnic Relations, “Heart of Violence: Global Racism, War, and Genocide”)<br />
Albert Memmi argued that “We have no idea what the colonized would have been without colonization, but we certainly see what happened as a result of it”(Memmi, 1965: 114). Events surrounding Iraq and Katrina provide three critical points regarding global racism. The first one is that segregation, exclusion, and genocide are closely related and facilitated by institutions employing the white racial frame to legitimize their ideologies and actions. The second one is the continuation of violence, either sporadically or systematically, with single- minded determination from segregation, to exclusion, to genocide. The third point is that legitimization and justification of violence is embedded in the resignation that global racism will not alter its course, and there is no way to challenge global racism. Together these three points facilitate the base for war and genocide In 1993, in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Samuel P. Huntington racialized the future of global conflict by declaring that “the clash of civilizations will domi- nate global politics”(Huntington 1993: 22). He declared that the fault line will be drawn by crisis and bloodshed. Huntington’s end of ideology meant the West is now expected to confront the Confucian-Islamic “other.” Huntington intoned “Islam has bloody borders,” and he expected the West to develop cooperation among Christian brethren, while limiting the military strength of the “Confucian-Islamic” civilizations, by exploiting the conflicts within them. When the walls of communism fell, a new enemy was found in Islam, and loathing and fear of Islam exploded with September 11. The new color line means “we hate them not because of what they do, but because of who they are and what they believe in.” The vehement denial of racism, and the fervent assertion of democratic equality in the West, are matched by detestation and anger toward Muslims, who are not European, not Western, and therefore not civilized. Since the context of “different” and “inferior” has become not just a function of race or gender, but of culture and ideology, it has become another instrument of belief and the self- righteous racism of American expansionism and “new imperialism.” The assumed superiority of the West has become the new “White Man’s Burden,” to expand and to recreate the world in an American image. The rationalization of this expansion, albeit to “protect our freedoms and our way of life” or “to combat terrorism,” is fueled by racist ideology, obscured in the darkness behind the façade of inalienable rights of the West to defend civilization against enemies in global culture wars. At the turn of the 20th century, the “Terrible Turk” was the image that summarized the enemy of Europe and the antagonism toward the hegemony of the Ottoman Empire, stretch- ing from Europe to the Middle East, and across North Africa. Perpetuation of this imagery in American foreign policy exhibited how capitalism met with orientalist constructs in the white racial frame of the western mind (VanderLippe 1999). Orientalism is based on the conceptualization of the “Oriental” other—Eastern, Islamic societies as static, irrational, savage, fanatical, and inferior to the peaceful, rational, scientific “Occidental” Europe and the West (Said 1978). This is as an elastic construct, proving useful to describe whatever is considered as the latest threat to Western economic expansion, political and cultural hegemony, and global domination for exploitation and absorption. Post-Enlightenment Europe and later America used this iconography to define basic racist assumptions regarding their uncontestable right to impose political and economic dominance globally. When the Soviet Union existed as an opposing power, the orientalist vision of the 20th century shifted from the image of the “Terrible Turk” to that of the “Barbaric Russian Bear.” In this context, orientalist thought then, as now, set the terms of exclusion. It racialized exclusion to define the terms of racial privilege and superiority. By focusing on ideology, orientalism recreated the superior race, even though there was no “race.” It equated the hegemony of Western civilization with the “right ideological and cultural framework.” It segued into war and annihilation and genocide and continued to foster and aid the recreation of racial hatred of others with the collapse of the Soviet “other.” Orientalism’s global racist ideology reformed in the 1990s with Muslims and Islamic culture as to the “inferior other.” Seeing Muslims as opponents of Christian civilization is not new, going back to the Crusades, but the elasticity and reframing of this exclusion is evident in recent debates regarding Islam in the West, one raised by the Pope and the other by the President of the United States. Against the background of the latest Iraq war, attacks in the name of Islam, racist attacks on Muslims in Europe and in the United States, and detention of Muslims without trial in secret prisons, Pope Benedict XVI gave a speech in September 2006 at Regensburg University in Germany. He quoted a 14th-century Byzantine emperor who said,“show me just what Muhammad brought that was new, and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” In addition, the Pope discussed the concept of Jihad, which he defined as Islamic “holy war,” and said, “violence in the name of religion was contrary to God’s nature and to reason.” He also called for dialogue between cultures and religions (Fisher 2006b). While some Muslims found the Pope’s speech “regrettable,” it also caused a spark of angry protests against the Pope’s “ill informed and bigoted” comments, and voices raised to demand an apology (Fisher 2006a). Some argue that the Pope was ordering a new crusade, for Christian civilization to conquer terrible and savage Islam. When Benedict apologized, organizations and parliaments demanded a retraction and apology from the Pope and the Vatican (Lee 2006). Yet, when the Pope apologized, it came as a second insult, because in his apology he said,“I’m deeply sorry for the reaction in some countries to a few passages of my address at the University of Regensburg, which were considered offensive to the sensibilities of Muslims”(Reuters 2006). In other words, he is sorry that Muslims are intolerant to the point of fanaticism. In the racialized world, the Pope’s apology came as an effort to show justification for his speech—he was not apologizing for being insulting, but rather saying that he was sorry that “Muslim” violence had proved his point. Through orientalist and the white racial frame, those who are subject to racial hatred and exclusion themselves become agents of racist legitimization. Like Huntington, Bernard Lewis was looking for Armageddon in his Wall Street Journal article warning that August 22, 2006, was the 27th day of the month of Rajab in the Islamic calendar and is considered a holy day, when Muhammad was taken to heaven and returned. For Muslims this day is a day of rejoic- ing and celebration. But for Lewis, Professor Emeritus at <br />
Princeton,“this might well be deemed an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and, if necessary, of the world”(Lewis 2006). He cautions that “it is far from certain that [the President of Iran] Mr. Ahmadinejad plans any such cataclysmic events for August 22, but it would be wise to bear the possibility in mind.” Lewis argues that Muslims, unlike others, seek self-destruction in order to reach heaven faster. For Lewis, Muslims in this mindset don’t see the idea of Mutually Assured Destruction as a constraint but rather as “an inducement”(Lewis 2006). In 1993, Huntington pleaded that “in a world of different civilizations, each... will have to learn to coexist with the others”(Huntington 1993: 49). Lewis, like Pope Benedict, views Islam as the apocalyptic destroyer of civilization and claims that reactions against orientalist, racist visions such as his actually prove the validity of his position. Lewis’s assertions run parallel with George Bush’s claims. In response to the alleged plot to blow up British airliners, Bush claimed,“This nation is at war with Islamic fascists who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom, to hurt our nation” (TurkishPress. com. 2006; Beck 2006). Bush argued that “the fight against terrorism is the ide- ological struggle of the 21st century” and he compared it to the 20th century’s fight against fascism, Nazism, and communism. Even though “Islamo-fascist” has for some time been a buzzword for Bill O’Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, and Sean Hannity on the talk-show circuit, for the president of the United States it drew reactions worldwide. Muslim Americans found this phrase “contributing to the rising level of hostility to Islam and the American Muslim com- munity”(Raum 2006). Considering that since 2001, Bush has had a tendency to equate “war on terrorism” with “crusade,” this new rhetoric equates ideology with religion and reinforces the worldview of a war of civilizations. As Bush said,“... we still aren’t completely safe, because there are people that still plot and people who want to harm us for what we believe in”(CNN 2006). Exclusion in physical space is only matched by exclusion in the imagination, and racial- ized exclusion has an internal logic leading to the annihilation of the excluded. Annihilation, in this sense, is not only designed to maintain the terms of racial inequality, both ideologically and physically, but is institutionalized with the vocabulary of self-protection. Even though the terms of exclusion are never complete, genocide is the definitive point in the exclusionary racial ideology, and such is the logic of the outcome of the exclusionary process, that it can conclude only in ultimate domination. War and genocide take place with compliant efficiency to serve the global racist ideology with dizzying frequency. The 21st century opened up with genocide, in Darfur <br />

Our alternative is to reject the 1AC and its Orientalist ideas – you must use the ballot to take an oppositional stance against Orientalism. This is a necessary step towards anything resembling solvency – whether it is of the Alternative or of the Plan<br />
Edward Said ‘3 New ‘Preface’ to Orientalism. Penguin Books Edition (2003) p. xvii<br />
My idea in Orientalism is to use humanistic critique to open up the fields of struggle, to introduce a longer sequence of thought and analysis to replace the short bursts of polemical, thought-stopping fury that so imprison us in labels and antagonistic debate whose goal is a belligerent collective identity rather than understanding and intellectual exchange. I have called what I try to do &quot;humanism,&quot; a word I continue to use stubbornly despite the scornful dismissal of the term by sophisticated post-modern critics. By humanism I mean first of all attempting to dissolve Blake's mind-forg'd manacles so as to be able to use one's mind historically and rationally for the purposes of reflective understanding and genuine disclosure. More-over, humanism is sustained by a sense of community with other interpreters and other societies and periods: strictly speaking, there-fore, there is no such thing as an isolated humanist. This is to say that every domain is linked to every other one, and that nothing that goes on in our world has ever been isolated and pure of any outside influence. The disheartening part is that the more the critical study of culture shows us that this is the case, the less influence such a view seems to have, and the more territorially reductive polarizations like &quot;Islam v. the West&quot; seem to conquer. For those of us who by force of circumstance actually live the pluri-cultural life as it entails Islam and the West, I have long felt that a special intellectual and moral responsibility attaches to what we do as scholars and intellectuals. Certainly I think it is incumbent upon us to complicate and/or dismantle the reductive formulae and the abstract but potent kind of thought that leads the mind away from concrete human history and experience and into the realms of ideological fiction, metaphysical confrontation and collective passion. This is not to say that we cannot speak about issues of injustice and suffering, but that we need to do so always within a context that is amply situated in history, culture and socio-economic reality. Our role is to widen the field of discussion, not to set limits in accord with the prevailing authority. I have spent a great deal of my life during the past thirty-five years advocating the rights of the Palestinian people to national self-determination, but I have always tried to do that with full attention paid to the reality of the Jewish people and what they suffered by way of persecution and genocide. The paramount thing is that the struggle for equality in Palestine/ Israel should be directed toward a humane goal, that is, co-existence, and not further suppression and denial. Not accidentally, I indicate that Orientalism and modem anti-Semitism have common roots. Therefore it would seem to be a vital necessity for independent intellectuals always to provide alternative models to the reductively simplifying and confining ones, based on mutual hostility, that have prevailed in the Middle East and elsewhere for so long.<br />

Essentializing whiteness as oppressive obscures the positive aspects of European culture, deprives white people of the possibility for a non-racist history and subjectivity, and re-entrenches white supremacy. Promotion of a white double-consciousness is key to anti-racism.<br />
<br />
Alcoff 2006 (Linda, Visible Identities: race, gender, and the self, Oxford University Press, p. 221)<br />
<br />
In order to conceptualize a nondominating and antisupremacist identity, both the Boyarins and Gilroy avoid essentialist constructions of identity by relying heavily on a shared history, but this is precisely what is problematic for whites. And there is no long history that whites can draw from as Jewish theorists can that is prior to domination: the history of white identity, just as is the case with black identity, is coterminous with European colonialism.<br />
Perhaps white identity needs to develop its own version of ‘‘double consciousness,’’ to name as such that two-sided sense of the past and the future that can be found in aspects of the works on whiteness discussed in this chapter. A white double consciousness would not involve the move between white and black subjectivities or black and American perspectives, as Du Bois and Fanon developed the notion. Instead, for whites, double consciousness requires an ever-present acknowledgment of the historical legacy of white identity constructions in the persistent structures of inequality and exploitation, as well as a newly awakened memory of the many white traitors to white privilege who have struggled to contribute to the building of an inclusive human community. The Michelangelos stand beside the Christopher Columbuses, and Michael Moores next to the Pat Buchanans. The legacy of European-based cultures is a complicated one. It is better approached through a two-sided analysis than through an argument that obscures either its positive or negative aspects. White representations within multiculturalism must then be similarly dialectical, retrieving from obscurity the history of white antiracism even while providing a detailed account of colonialism and its many cultural effects. This, then, is the challenge: to transform the basis of collective self-respect from global, racial vanguardism to a dedicated commitment to end racism.<br />

Uniqueness and internal - South Korea FTA will pass now but no union backlash is key<br />
LA Times 11/6/10 (“The Free Trade Fight,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/06/opinion/la-ed-korea-20101106" rel="nofollow">http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/06/opinion/la-ed-korea-20101106</a>) <br />
The wide differences between Republicans and Democrats on economic policy don't leave much room for compromise over the next two years. But Tuesday's takeover of the House of Representatives by the GOP raises hopes for progress on at least one important initiative: It might help President Obama win approval of a U.S.- South Korea free-trade pact.<br />
President George W. Bush was a big proponent of the bilateral agreement with South Korea, which both governments signed in 2007, but he couldn't persuade Congress to approve it. Obama seems an unlikely champion, especially since he criticized the deal during his 2008 presidential campaign. But rather than kill the pact, he's working to renegotiate it. In June, Obama promised South Korean President Lee Myung-bak that he would revive the stalled trade talks in hopes of producing a mutually agreeable deal by Nov. 11, when Obama will travel to Seoul for the G-20 economic summit.<br />
Obama evidently hopes to appease U.S. automakers who think the existing pact does too little to open the South Korean market to American cars, and ranchers who fret about South Korean restrictions on beef imports. Tweaking the pact to accommodate them shouldn't pose an excessive challenge, but it's improbable that U.S. labor unions will ever support the deal — and where organized labor leads, the Democratic Party tends to follow. Union fears that lower trade barriers will prompt a loss of American jobs not only ignore the job growth that can be expected as South Korean consumers buy more American products, but the positive (and job-producing) economic impacts of lower prices for South Korean goods in the United States. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, the pact would boost U.S. gross domestic product by up to $12 billion a year. What's more, failing to approve the deal would put the U.S. at a serious disadvantage to the European Union, which signed its own bilateral trade pact with South Korea last month. South Korean trade also threatens to shift increasingly toward China. It's questionable whether Obama will have the political courage to upset the Democrats' political base by seriously pushing for the trade deal. Also unknown is whether the freshman class of &quot;tea party&quot;-backed Republicans will be as gung-ho for free trade as GOP stalwarts have been. But if only Richard Nixon could go to China, it may be that only Obama, with his labor credentials, could get away with opening our markets to South Korea. And a GOP-controlled House may give him a welcome opportunity to do it.<br />

Plan causes a union backlash <br />
Bhagwait ’09, Jagdish N., Senior Fellow, Int’l Economics, Council on Foreign Relations (“Stricter-Rules for Skilled-Worker Visas are a Mistake,” CFR, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/20732/stricter_rules_for_skilledworker_visas_are_a_mistake.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/20732/stricter_rules_for_skilledworker_visas_are_a_mistake.html</a> <br />
Much of the debate over U.S. immigration policy has focused on illegal immigration, but visas for skilled workers also are under attack, from Congress and from nativist and union lobbies. Recent congressional efforts to create stricter rules for skilled-worker visas are &quot;particularly inappropriate,&quot; says Jagdish N. Bhagwati, CFR's senior fellow for International Economics and a professor at Columbia University, who also recently coedited the book Skilled Immigration Today: Prospects, Problems and Policies. The current attitude, fueled in part by the recession, is based on a fallacy, says Bhagwati, because it fails to account for the quality of skilled-worker visa holders. He points out that many of these hires are from world-class technological and management institutions in India, Seoul, and China, which the United States has often helped to set up. &quot;Intel, Microsoft--they are looking for the best people they can get,&quot; Bhagwati says, and &quot;the Americans who do not get the jobs in competition with the foreign hires tend to be graduates who are at the bottom of the class.&quot; Any openness policy is going to be a tough sell for lawmakers right now, but he argues that openness benefits the country economically. Much of the debate at the end of the Bush administration was focused on illegal immigration from Mexico, though it also included the issue of expanding visas for skilled workers, such as the H-1B Visa. With a new Congress and a financial crisis, however, the politics has shifted to restricting these quotas, not increasing them. Why do you feel the United States needs to hire skilled foreign workers and why aren't there enough workers in the United States to do these jobs? The recent immigration [bill], which failed, focused for the most part on illegal immigration. U.S. legislation typically addresses refugees, legal immigrants, and illegal immigrants separately, so the issue of hiring skilled foreign workers belongs to legislation addressed to legal immigration. But it got included in the current reform legislation addressing illegal immigration, to increase lobbying support for a failing bill. The calculation was that, by adding this issue, the proponents of the bill would galvanize the support of influential firms such as Intel and Microsoft, which use a lot of the foreign skilled workers. But this strategy didn't work. In some areas of negotiations like trade, the more issues you open up, the more tradeoffs are possible and you can make progress by making concessions in one area and &quot;collecting&quot; in another. This does not work with immigration, however. Within each area of immigration, there are lobbies on both sides. Thus, adding skilled immigration to the illegal immigration bill drew in the support of Intel, Microsoft etc.; but it also drew in opposition from the lobbies representing the native engineers who opposed the use of skilled foreigners who would &quot;take jobs away from them.&quot; They said: We're not getting employed, why should we have more [visas]? So, in fact, instead of winning the war for the bill, you simply added another battle ground! I firmly believe that the native opposition to skilled foreigners coming into the United States is harmful to us.<br />

The KORUS FTA also helps bind the United States and South Korea more closely together strategically, economically, and politically.52 The economic significance of the KORUS FTA is substantial, but the oppor- tunity to bring South Korea closer to the United States as a partner— especially given that China is currently South Korea’s primary trade and investment partner—is significant. Failure to approve the agree- ment would send a negative message: that despite South Korea’s role and significance as one of the top twenty economies in the world, there are limits to U.S. economic and, by extension, strategic cooperation with South Korea. Following U.S. midterm elections and in the context of steady U.S. economic improvement, ratification of the KORUS FTA should be a top Obama administration priority for 2011.<br />

US-ROK relations key to prevent a North Korean nuclear crisis<br />
Pritchard et al, 09 – President of the Korea Economic Institute (Charles L, 6/16. With John H. Tilelli Jr., Chairman and CEO, Cypress International, and Scott A. Snyder, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Korea Studies, CFR. “A New Chapter for U.S.-South Korea Alliance.” Council on Foreign Relations. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/19635/new_chapter_for_ussouth_korea_alliance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/19635/new_chapter_for_ussouth_korea_alliance.html</a>)<br />
<br />
While all eyes have been trained on North Korea's belligerent and aggressive actions in recent weeks, it is important to note that the U.S.-South Korea alliance has emerged as a linchpin in the Obama administration's efforts to successfully manage an overcrowded global agenda, and a pivotal tool for safeguarding U.S. long-term interests in Asia. When South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak meets with President Barack Obama at the White House Tuesday, the two leaders must effectively address three main areas: policy coordination to address North Korea's nuclear threat, the development of a global security agenda that extends beyond the peninsula, and collaboration to address the global financial crisis as South Korea takes a lead on the G-20 process. By conducting a second nuclear test in May, followed by a number of missile launches, North Korea has forced its way onto the Obama administration's agenda. First and foremost, effective U.S.-South Korea alliance coordination is critical to managing both the global effects of North Korea's nuclear threat on the nonproliferation regime and the regional security challenges posed by potential regime actions that lead to further crisis in the region. North Korea's internal focus on its leadership succession, and the apparent naming of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's little-known and inexperienced youngest son as his successor, make the task of responding to North Korea's aggressive and destabilizing actions all the more challenging. Both deterrence and negotiation must be pursued on the basis of close consultations. Presidents Obama and Lee must also develop coordinated contingency plans in the event of internal instability in North Korea. Through effective U.S.-South Korea alliance coordination, it should be possible to forge a combined strategy capable of managing the nuclear, proliferation, and regional security dimensions of North Korea's threat. A coordinated position would also strengthen the administration's hand in its efforts to persuade China to put pressure on North Korea.<br />

North Korean crisis causes nuclear war and triggers every impact <br />
Hayes and Green, 10 - *Victoria University AND **Executive Director of the Nautilus Institute (Peter and Michael, “-“The Path Not Taken, the Way Still Open: Denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia”, 1/5, <br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/10001HayesHamalGreen.pdf</a>)<br />
The consequences of failing to address the proliferation threat posed by the North Korea developments, and related political and economic issues, are serious, not only for the Northeast Asian region but for the whole international community. At worst, there is the possibility of nuclear attack1, whether by intention, miscalculation, or merely accident, leading to the resumption of Korean War hostilities. On the Korean Peninsula itself, key population centres are well within short or medium range missiles. The whole of Japan is likely to come within North Korean missile range. Pyongyang has a population of over 2 million, Seoul (close to the North Korean border) 11 million, and Tokyo over 20 million. Even a limited nuclear exchange would result in a holocaust of unprecedented proportions. But the catastrophe within the region would not be the only outcome. New research indicates that even a limited nuclear war in the region would rearrange our global climate far more quickly than global warming. Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow...The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger...To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. Millions of refugees would flee the affected regions. The direct impacts, and the follow-on impacts on the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the present global financial crisis pale by comparison. How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to nuclear first-use, could make or break the global non proliferation and disarmament regimes. There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.<br />

1. Uniqueness: No increased pressure on yuan at G20 now<br />
Talley 11/1 - Dow Jones Reporter (Ian, November 1, 2010, “U.S. Manages Expectations for G-20 Talks,” Wall Street Journal, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704865104575588521121383614.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704865104575588521121383614.html</a>, JAK)<br />
The U.S. doesn't expect to resolve global tensions over China's currency policy or reach a final accord on economic imbalances at the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations leaders' summit next week, White House and U.S. Treasury officials said Monday. While President Barack Obama will press China to continue letting its currency move upward, the currency negotiations will be conducted in the context of getting the countries to agree to limit trade surpluses and deficits—which both reflect and underlie currency movements. Administration officials praised Beijing's recent pace of yuan appreciation since early September, a trend that, if continued, would imply a 20% rise in two years—the kind of gain the U.S. has been pushing for. &quot;If we continue to see progress of that nature, it would make a material difference in the significant undervaluation of Chinese currency,&quot; said U.S. Treasury Under Secretary Lael Brainard. Mr. Obama is likely to raise the issue when he meets China's President Hu Jintao in one of his bilateral sessions at the Seoul summit. Administration officials made clear that the markets shouldn't expect the G-20 summit to produce a broad currency agreement such as the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s that set the direction of the dollar. &quot;We do not expect the China currency issue, or the (trade) imbalance issue, to be solved once and for all in Seoul,&quot; said White House economics aide Michael Froman.<br />

2. Unique Link: <br />
A. India won’t support US measures due to visa fee hikes and economic ties<br />
Ganapathy 8/21 - India Correspondent (Nirmala, August 21, 2010, “India may take US visa fee hike to WTO; It says new US law, largely affecting Indian companies, is protectionist,” The Straits Times, Lexis, JAK<br />
Under the Emergency Border Security Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010, the US has doubled fees for H-1B and L1 visas by US $2,000 (S $2,710) for the next five years. This category of visas is used by Indian IT outsourcing companies such as Wipro, Infosys and Tata to deploy highly skilled workers in the US. H-1B visas issued in India till June 25 this year totalled 55,477 and the L1 visas another 35,504, according to US embassy figures. The US legislation, which targets companies with more than 50 foreign workers, seeks to raise US $550 million of the estimated US $650 million allotted for US-Mexico border security. India says that the hike will cost Indian outsourcing and IT companies alone an additional US $200 million to US $250 million every year and has called the visa hike 'WTO incompatible'. 'If the US wishes to put up its protectionist barriers to hurt itself let them do it. But where a measure is specifically targeting my commercial interest I cannot keep quiet...We are not in the business of exporting unemployment or unskilled labour,' said India's Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar. He said the Indian government would soon decide its 'next course of action'. It is understood that the government is examining whether India has a strong case and can successfully take the matter to the WTO. The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) is also trying to see if the impact could be minimised. 'We are working with stakeholders here and the US to see how we can minimise damage from the situation. It is unfortunate and it is discriminatory,' said Nasscom vice-president Ameet Nivsarkar. Following India's reaction, the US said it is examining any WTO implications and has also conceded that there could be a potential impact on Indian companies. 'I am not aware that we've reached any final judgment, but we're not sure that necessarily any WTO issues are triggered,' State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley was quoted as saying. The episode comes shortly before US President Barack Obama's November visit to India and is seen as a potential irritant in ties. Much to India's dismay, the India outsourcing industry has become an easy political explanation for America's unemployment issues. But with President Obama signing the legislation, analysts point out the deed is done. 'It's law now, nothing much can be done about it. But India can use this as leverage on some other issue,' said Mr Robinder Sachdev of US India Political Action Committee, a lobby group for Indian interests on Capitol Hill.<br />

B. India pressure forces China to revalue the yuan faster<br />
Nikkei Weekly 5/24 (May 24, 2010, “Yuan revaluation issue draws cautious response,” Nikkei Weekly (Japan), Lexis, JAK)<br />
The government of India is taking an ambivalent stance toward the issue of the Chinese yuan revaluation. There is every indication that India is increasingly frustrated with its expanding trade deficit with China, which an upward revaluation of the yuan could help decrease. But New Delhi remains hesitant about going so far as to confront Beijing and demand that the yuan be revalued. Behind India's noncommittal posture is the complex relationship between the two powerful emerging countries. On April 6 in New Delhi, Pranab Mukherjee, India's finance minister, greeted Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, his U.S. counterpart, for a one-on-one meeting. According to an earlier report in The Financial Express, an influential Indian newspaper, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, had prepared a paper expressing its endorsement of a U.S.-led initiative to persuade China to appreciate its currency. The paper was intended for Mukherjee to deliver in person to Geithner. But the plan was put on hold at the last minute before the Mukherjee-Geithner meeting, as India's External Affairs Ministry and the Prime Minister Office's voiced their opposition, fearing Beijing might consider such a gesture by New Delhi as unwelcome interference, according to The Financial Express report.<br />
<br />
3. Impact: <br />
A. Slow revaluation is comparatively better. Quick reval collapses the economy<br />
Chin &amp; Png 5/20 - Professor, NUS Business School &amp; Lim Kim San professor, NUS Business Professor (Lim Chin &amp; Ivan Png, May 20, 2010, “Best to let China revalue yuan gradually,” The Straits Times, Lexis, JAK)<br />
How would a revaluation of the yuan affect the economies of the United States and China? VARIOUS studies indicate that the yuan is undervalued by anywhere from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, depending on the assumptions of the studies. Whatever the precise figure, few would disagree that the Chinese currency is undervalued, given that China has amassed US $2.4 trillion (S $3.3 trillion) worth of official foreign reserves. The current account imbalance is a reflection of the macroeconomic imbalance or the savings-investment gap between trading nations. The exchange rate is one of many variables that determine that imbalance. If the burden of restoring the US-China current account balance were to be borne solely by the exchange rate, the yuan would probably have to be revalued by up to 40 per cent at least. It is politically expedient for US politicians to point a finger of blame at China to explain America's large current account deficit and its dismal unemployment rate. But what US politicians and Americans in general must realise is that the impact of a yuan revaluation will not be as simple as they assume. It may not significantly reduce the current account deficit or create more US jobs. The simplistic view is that an appreciation of the yuan against the US dollar would enable Americans to sell more to China and buy less from it. But how plausible is that scenario? First, a significant yuan appreciation is more likely to cause multinational corporations to relocate their production from China to other low-cost locations in East Asia rather than the US. Consider: Between 2005 and 2008, when the yuan appreciated by 18 per cent, the US current account deficit rose - from US $202 billion to US $268 billion. Second, it is also not clear how a yuan revaluation would create more US jobs. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman recently accused China of being a currency manipulator and argued that a 25 per cent revaluation would bring the current account to a reasonable balance and create up to 1.4 million new US jobs. How did he get this figure? We suspect it is from a simple back-of-the-envelope calculation that goes like this: Assume a US $1 billion current account improvement yields 6,000 more jobs; a 25 per cent yuan appreciation that reduces the current account deficit by US $240 billion per year would mean 1.44 million additional jobs. Presto! But the assumptions behind the calculation are suspect. First, it does not take into account that we live in a multilateral world where a yuan revaluation may shift Chinese jobs to other low-cost East Asian locations rather than to the US. Second, even if some jobs do return to the US, there are offsetting effects that Professor Krugman does not take into account. Using a more complete and sophisticated empirical model to estimate the effect of a yuan appreciation on the US economy, Prof Ray Fair of Yale University saw the following offsetting effects: First, a yuan appreciation would adversely affect China's output growth. This in turn would lead to a decline in Chinese imports of US goods - and hence US jobs. Second, a yuan appreciation would mean more expensive Chinese goods for Americans - and that imported inflation may raise the cost of production and dampen exports. Third, a higher inflation rate also implies a higher nominal interest rate in the US, which would adversely affect investment and jobs. Pressuring Beijing to appreciate the yuan may be politically expedient but it may not be the smartest thing to do. It may not create a significant number of US jobs and it would hurt China's growth. China allowing the yuan to gradually appreciate in a non-disruptive manner, however, may be in the best interest of the global economy in the long run as it would allow a more wealthy China to buy more American goods.<br />

B. Economic collapse causes extinction<br />
Mead 09 [Walter Russell, Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, “Only Makes You Stronger: Why the recession bolstered America.” New Republic, February 4]<br />
None of which means that we can just sit back and enjoy the recession. History may suggest that financial crises actually help capitalist great powers maintain their leads--but it has other, less reassuring messages as well. If financial crises have been a normal part of life during the 300-year rise of the liberal capitalist system under the Anglophone powers, so has war. The wars of the League of Augsburg and the Spanish Succession; the Seven Years War; the American Revolution; the Napoleonic Wars; the two World Wars; the cold war: The list of wars is almost as long as the list of financial crises. Bad economic times can breed wars. Europe was a pretty peaceful place in 1928, but the Depression poisoned German public opinion and helped bring Adolf Hitler to power. If the current crisis turns into a depression, what rough beasts might start slouching toward Moscow, Karachi, Beijing, or New Delhi to be born? The United States may not, yet, decline, but, if we can't get the world economy back on track, we may still have to fight.<br />

Can’t reduce co2 with immigration<br />
Martin 09 – Director of Special Projects for the Federation for American Immigration Reform (Jack, 2009, “Immigration, Energy, and the Environment,” Federation for American Immigration Reform, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fairus.org/site/DocServer/energy_enviro.pdf?docID=2941" rel="nofollow">http://www.fairus.org/site/DocServer/energy_enviro.pdf?docID=2941</a>)<br />
Any effort by the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must take population growth into account. The United States does not presently have an articulated population policy, but one should be developed in connection with any plan to reduce emissions. A central component of a population policy must include an effective and enforceable immigration policy that curbs immigration levels to the point that it is no longer driving U.S. population growth. Immigration is a discretionary activity of government, not mandated by international agreement or our history. Few countries accept any significant level of immigration, and our history has seen both high and low levels of immigration. Unless immigration is lowered in order to reduce U.S. population growth, emissions reduction as envisaged in the Kyoto Protocol is increasingly unattainable.<br />

That causes ocean acidification which destroys the food chain<br />
Caldeira, 5<br />
(Dr. Ken, Department of Global Ecology, Carnegie Institution of Washington; Dr. Ken Caldeira preformed this work while at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, “Oceans turning to acid from rise in CO2,” June 30, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-06/ci-ott063005.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-06/ci-ott063005.php</a>)<br />
<br />
A report issued by the Royal Society in the U.K. sounds the alarm about the world's oceans. &quot;If CO2 from human activities continues to rise, the oceans will become so acidic by 2100 it could threaten marine life in ways we can't anticipate,&quot; commented Dr. Ken Caldeira, co-author of the report and a newly appointed staff scientist at the Carnegie Institution's Department of Global Ecology in Stanford, California.* The report on ocean acidification was released today by the Royal Society. See <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/</a> Many scientists view the world's oceans as an important sink for capturing the human-induced greenhouse gas CO2 and slowing global warming. Marine plants soak up CO2 as they breathe it in and convert it to food during photosynthesis. Organisms also use it to make their skeletons and shells, which eventually form sediments. With the explosion of fossil-fuel burning over the past 200 years, it has been estimated that more than a third of the human-originated greenhouse gas has been absorbed by the oceans. While marine organisms need CO2 to survive, work by Caldeira and colleagues shows that too much CO2 in the ocean could lead to ecological disruption and extinctions in the marine environment. When CO2 gas dissolves into the ocean it produces carbonic acid, which is corrosive to shells of marine organisms and can interfere with the oxygen supply. If current trends continue, the scientists believe the acidic water could interrupt the process of shell and coral formation and adversely affect other organisms dependent upon corals and shellfish. The acidity could also negatively impact other calcifying organisms, such as phytoplankton and zooplankton, some of the most important players at the base of the planet's food chain. &quot;We can predict the magnitude of the acidification based on the evidence that has been collected from the ocean's surface, the geological and historical record, ocean circulation models, and what's known about ocean chemistry,&quot; continued Caldeira. &quot;What we can't predict is just what acidic oceans mean to ocean ecology and to Earth's climate. International and governmental bodies must focus on this area before it's too late.&quot; The pH (potential of Hydrogen) scale is from 1 to 14, with 7 being neutral. Anything that lowers pH makes the solution more acidic. The scientists calculated that over the past 200 years, the pH of the surface seawater has declined by 0.1 units, which is a 30% increase in hydrogen ions. If emissions of CO2 continue to rise as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's IS92a scenario, there will be another drop in pH by .5 units by 2100, a level that has not existed in the oceans for many millions of years. In addition, the changes in the oceans' chemistry will reduce their ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere, which in turn will accelerate the rate of global warming. &quot;This report should sound the alarm bells around the world,&quot; remarked Chris Field, director of the Carnegie Department of Global Ecology. &quot;It provides compelling evidence for the need for a thorough understanding of the implications of ocean acidification. It also strengthens the case for rapid progress on reducing CO2 emissions.&quot; <br />

Unique link – US immigration policy dries up investment in the IT sector, forcing venture capital into other sectors of the economy. Plan reverses this.  Eaton, August 26 (Kit, Fast Company, “America's Looming Tech Crunch: Blame Venture Capital, Immigration Law”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1685109/americas-looming-tech-crunch-blame-immigration-laws-venture-capital-failings" rel="nofollow">http://www.fastcompany.com/1685109/americas-looming-tech-crunch-blame-immigration-laws-venture-capital-failings</a>) <br />
The U.S. likes to think of itself as a cradle for the world's newest and cleverest tech. But Intel's CEO Paul Otellini is foretelling a looming high-tech crunch, and the nation's venture capital association is equally worried now that 10-year VC returns have turned negative for the first time in a decade.<br />
Intel's Paul Otellini has a voice that's definitely worth listening to: As the successful CEO of one of the world's most successful companies, he is a man with his finger on the pulse of the tech industry (admittedly, concentrating on the chip markets) in a way that few others have. And speaking this week at the Technology Policy Institute's Aspen Forum, Otellini had dire things to say about the state of things:<br />
&quot;Our research centers were without peer. No country was more attractive for start-up capital...We seemed a generation ahead of the rest of the world in information technology. That simply is no longer the case.&quot; <br />
The reason for this is pretty simple--the legal, tax, and financial hoops that the U.S. enforces on all industry, with a particular emphasis on startups, is to blame. Successive administrations have been blind to this problem, or have ignored it, and the situation is now so dire that from his own experience Otellini notes &quot;it costs $1 billion more per factory for me to build, equip, and operate a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the United States.&quot; Other nations have tax breaks for new companies, sometimes with a special emphasis on high-tech, and the U.S. is particularly hostile to foreign nationals who want to study and then work here. Some of the recent fiascos and political tussles over the H1B visas is a classic example of this, and demonstrates that there's little intention to change the status quo.<br />
Otellinis warning is stark: &quot;The United States a less attractive place to invest--and create jobs--than places in Europe and Asia that are &quot;clamoring&quot; for Intel's business.&quot; And Intel is just the start.<br />
On the other side of the equation, the money men who supply the raw dollars for many startups--the venture capitalists--are poised to see their industry take a serious tumble. The National Venture Capital Association's latest report reveals that 10-year returns on investment slipped into the negative at the end of last year, and the situation only worsened in the first three months of 2010. Simply put, this indicates the VC business--which was once a fairly sure-fire way to rapidly launch a business--has become a significantly less attractive way to earn money.<br />
The industry hasn't crossed the Rubicon, for sure, because as in investor there are still plenty of ways to make money. But with the long-term game looking so very unappealing, the end result is that investors are going to find alternative uses to put their cash to--ones that will earn more of a return. And this means the sources of VC funding for startups may soon start to dry up, forcing increased competition among potential candidate startups.<br />

Alt energy and IT are zero-sum. IT investment precludes clean tech.  Bandyk 2008 (Matthew, U.S. News and World Report, “A Venture Capital Crunch?”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://money.usnews.com/money/business-economy/small-business/articles/2008/07/14/a-venture-capital-crunch.html" rel="nofollow">http://money.usnews.com/money/business-economy/small-business/articles/2008/07/14/a-venture-capital-crunch.html</a>) <br />
The biggest losers in that process of elimination might be the entrepreneurs who need venture capital funding the most. It's always been hard to get. But now, the system is even more competitive. &quot;The truth of the matter is that those who do get the money are truly the gazelles of the U.S. economy,&quot; says Heesen. Those gazelles tend to be the most experienced and are not always the little guys with big ideas. &quot;There are not as many high-growth opportunities for start-up companies. The good opportunities end up going to the name-brand capitalists,&quot; says Vinit Nijhawan, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist who chairs The Indus Entrepreneurs group in Boston.<br />
Part of the reason it's going more competitive is that less confidence among VCs means more conservatism on their part. That means the more inexperienced the entrepreneur and the more the start-up is in its infancy, the less chance that entrepreneur can get funding. &quot;For early stage investing, things are very difficult. If you're a guy who has never got venture capital before, it's going to be tough,&quot; says Nijhawan.<br />
But even if venture capital activity is declining, that doesn't mean there aren't opportunities. Depending on the type of their start-ups, some entrepreneurs could find it easier to seek venture capital. &quot;The pie hasn't gotten bigger, but the size of the slicing is getting different,&quot; says Heesen. One of those slices that appears to be getting bigger is for firms that specialize in developing clean and green technology. Global venture funding for clean technology firms reached an all-time high of $2 billion from April to June, according to a July 8 study from the Cleantech Group, a San Francisco research firm. That's a 58 percent increase from the amount of funding the study had previously found in April to June of 2007.<br />
But don't expect clean technology to be an area to make a quick buck. Creating technology that works is a research-intensive process that requires years of work. That's a contrast from the information-technology start-ups that used to dominate when it came to venture capital. &quot;Clean tech is going to be a much more expensive play than IT,&quot; says Heesen. &quot;You're sometimes literally building entire factories for these things.&quot;<br />
Renewable Energies Have Great Potential to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions  Rowlands 2005 (Ian H, associate professor environment and resource studies-University of Waterloo, Canada, Switching to Renewable Power: a framework for the 21st century, ed. V. Lauber, p. 64-65)<br />
Renewable energies have great potential to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. (Note that energy-related greenhouse gas emissions still make up the vast majority of the global warming challenge, especially in northern countries, even when land-use activities are included.) The extent to which the displacement of non-renewable energy sources by renewable energy sources will reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be a function, of course, of the relative greenhouse gas-intensity of the two ‘fuels’ involved. Table 3.4 presents some data about the relative greenhouse gas-intensity of both ‘conventional’ and ‘renewable’ energy sources, from a life-cycle perspective. From this, it is clear that different displacement choices will yield different ‘gains’ in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions. But given that the average greenhouse gas-intensity of fossil fuel use in the world is just over 500 grams carbon dioxide equivalent per kWh (for electricity, at least), and that the average greenhouse gas intensity of all renewable is something of the order of 50-100 grams carbon dioxide equivalent per kWh, there is clearly scope for significant gains. The extent to which these gains are realizable is, of course, another issue.   <br />

Global warming will causes human extinction<br />
Brown, 2006 (Paul, PhD, Notes from a dying planet, 2006, p. 202-3)<br />
<br />
The evidence for global warming is all around us. Most chapters in this book mention news reports of record-breaking heat waves; melting ice caps and glaciers; droughts and famines; violent weather; die-offs, overpopulation and migrations of species; and rising ocean levels. There is no longer any doubt that the principal cause is human combustion of fossil fuels. We're producing CO2 faster than it could be removed from the atmosphere even if we had not reduced the world's photosynthetic capacity through forest destruction. Global warming is caused by a greenhouse effect, in which solar light passes through the atmosphere and that portion that is not reflected warms the surface of the globe. In the recent past, enough of that heat was radiated back into space in the form of infrared (IR) light so the Earth didn't heat up. However, CO, absorbs IR, trapping some of the heat in the atmosphere. It acts just like the glass in a greenhouse, which passes visible light but not IR. That's why CO2 is referred to as a greenhouse gas. Atmospheric CO2 has gone from 280 parts per million (ppm), a level that had remained much the same for the previous 10,000 years, to 360 ppm in 1998. Scientists project that the concentration will reach 560 ppm by 2050, and average global temperature will increase by 3-7°F. There's a very real danger that a positive feedback loop wall be (or already has been) initial in which rising temperatures will decrease reflectivity due to ice melting; atmospheric water vapor concentration will go up because warmer air can hold more water (and water's a greenhouse gas too); methane will be released from thawing tundra, swamps, and undersea deposits (yes, methane's a greenhouse gas too) because warm water can't hold as much gas as ice or cold water; and CO2 will be released from rocks, water and ice. This will cause global warming to skyrocket far faster than would be caused by our increased CO2 production alone. If that happens, drastic temperature shifts could take place in just a few years. New scientific evidence suggests that just such drastic temperature shifts have occurred in the past. If that were to happen, there would be nothing we could do, and our ecosystem would collapse. We would go with it.<br />

Comprehensive immigration reform will pass now<br />
Lawrence ’10 (The Prospects for Comprehensive Immigration Reform 1/22/2010 - Political Social - Article Ref: CP1001-4055 By: Stewart J. Lawrence Counter Punch* - Jan 21, 2010 Stewart J Lawrence is a Washington, DC-based public policy analyst and writes frequently on immigration and Latino affairs. He is also founder and managing director of Puentes &amp; Associates, Inc., a bilingual survey research and communications firm. Stewart J. Lawrence has worked as an immigration policy analyst with the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Inter-American Institute on Migration and Labor and the American Immigration Law Foundation.<br />
<br />
After months of procedural delay and understandable preoccupation with the economy and health care, the White House has quietly announced plans to introduce a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate next month. The move surprised many political observers who have watched the Obama administration constantly postpone action on immigration reform in order to address a host of other policy issues. Several White House officials, most notably Rahm Emmanuel, are known to be deeply skeptical about the wisdom of Obama tackling immigration reform during his first term in office, let alone prior to the 2010 mid-term elections. Indeed, when Obama named Sonia Sotomayor to replace David Souter on the US Supreme Court last August, some took it as a sign that Obama was seeking to placate his Latino base with an &quot;historic&quot; appointment, in part to justify postponing first-term action on immigration reform. And now, in the wake of Tuesday's shocking Democratic Party loss in the US Senate race in Massachusetts, some political observers fear that immigration reform, at least for now, is dead. But the political calculus in the White House and among pro-immigration Democrats in the Senate appears to be quite different. If anything the prospective defeat of health care reform has highlighted Obama's need for a fresh legislative victory. But three key questions remain. First, without their filibuster-proof majority, do Democrats still have the votes needed to pass immigration reform, or is a prolonged and messy congressional debate like the one that engulfed health care reform inevitable? Second is the question of time. With such a late start, and assuming that a measure of contentious debate is unavoidable, could the White House end up pulling the bill or at least suspending a final vote to make room for the mid-term election campaign? And finally, if the bill is delayed and Republicans score big in the mid-term elections, as they well might, could immigration reform, like cap-and-trade, another of Obama's promised first-year agenda items, simply wither on the vine? Despite the loss of his &quot;filibuster-proof&quot; majority, Obama still has a very good chance of passing immigration reform in the Senate, and if the Senate vote is large enough, he could probably convince skeptical House Democrats to go along. That's because immigration reform is not health care reform in at least two key respects. First, the terms of the debate are already well known to the contending parties, who fought each other to a legislative stalemate in 2006 and 2007. What's changed, in addition to Obama's election, is the composition of the Congress, which is even more Democratic than it was in 2006, when the GOP lost control of the House. That's no guarantee of victory, because immigration, unlike health care form, has never been an issue that divides neatly, with Democrats on one side and Republicans on the other. But it certainly helps. A number of US Senators, including the ailing Harry Byrd (D-WV), who was wheeled into Congress to cast his critical &quot;yea&quot; vote on health care reform, oppose granting legal status to undocumented workers. So do &quot;Blue Dog&quot; Democrats in the House, who have spent much of the past two years pushing for expanded immigration enforcement. By contrast, about a dozen GOP Senators have traditionally &quot;crossed over&quot; to support the Democrats on immigration. Thus, the good news is that pro-immigration Democrats won't have to go hat in hand to Olympia Snowe (R-ME) or Susan Collins (R-ME) to defeat a GOP filibuster. The bad news is they'll still have to convince a slew of their fellow Democrats to join the immigration reform bandwagon. For the White House to win, two steps are essential, sources say. First, the White House shouldn't defer to Congress but should drive the legislative process &quot;from above.&quot; This means Obama should take personal responsibility for the bill and should be willing to defend it to the public from the onset. He must also work closely with the two Senate immigration reform captains, Democrat Charles Schumer (NY) and Republican Lindsay Graham (R-SC), to line up his congressional ducks and forge the bipartisan deals needed to to ensure speedy passage. If instead, Obama takes the cautious, hands-off approach he did during the health care debate, and simply lets Congress lead, the likelihood grows that obstructionists, especially House Republicans, will try to take their case to the public to exploit the same &quot;nativist&quot; fears that twice sunk immigration reform in 2007. Obama met with Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle last summer to float the White House's legislative strategy. And Homeland Security director Janet Napolitano has been meeting quietly with key immigration constituencies for much of the past month to identify and address the key fault lines in the debate. All of these hopeful signs point to an aggressive and pro-active White House approach that should improve the prospects for a bill's passage, assuming that no unexpected hitches develop. <br />

Piecemeal reform destroys comprehensive reform <br />
Young ’10 (Comprehensive Immigration Reform—Dead, Dismembered, or Alive? Posted February 17, 2010 by Patrick Young, Esq.<br />
<br />
There are also calls for abandoning the comprehensive immigration reform effort and instead trying to pass sections of the bill piecemeal. Frankly, in 1999, when comprehensive reform was first proposed as the entire agenda for the immigrant rights movement, I believed that piecemeal was the way to go. I did not believe that passage of a comprehensive package was possible. In addition, my experience as an advocate told me that a piecemeal approach could accomplish much without the serious negative trade-offs that comprehensive reform would demand. But my position was not the majority position, and the broad movement adopted comprehensive immigration reform and emblazoned it on its banner. Over the next decade, the treasure and efforts of the immigrant rights community around the United States were devoted to crafting and passing far-reaching legislation that would address the United States’ immigration needs for decades. While that effort has not yet succeeded, it is too soon to declare it failed. It may also already be too late to break up the comprehensive immigration reform bill and pass smaller pieces of legislation like the DREAM Act and AgJobs separately. Many supporters of reform will melt away if the comprehensive bill is abandoned—they signed on for the whole package. And piecemeal legislation will be met with the same arguments against legalizing a portion of the undocumented that have been voiced against legislation that would enable larger earned legalization. In addition, to secure passage of the DREAM Act and AgJobs, so many concessions will have to be made that little may be left to trade if we try to revive legalization. Analysts in Washington say that there is still a slim chance for reform this year. With other prospects looking even dimmer than pressing on with our current strategy, it would seem that the immigrant rights movement’s last best hope is to press the Democrats hard with the threat that a failure to push reform will lead to Latino electoral defections and simultaneously embarrass the president into assuming the role of Reformer-in-Chief that we once thought fit him naturally. We also need to be realistic about what a reform bill will look like if one is introduced by Senator Schumer in the next 50 days. It will not be perfect, and attacks on it for its flaws will likely condemn immigration reform to the legislative graveyard. Any reform bill will need to satisfy the two to six Republicans we need for passage. Pulling out the elements of any compromise Schumer arranges will doom the bill. For those of us outside the Beltway, we need to keep the pressure on. This year there have already been more than 160 pro-reform events. More than 300,000 people have communicated with Congress and the President in support of reform. Churches, city councils, unions, and community groups have passed hundreds of resolutions in support of reform. Here on Long Island, the Workplace Project has collected more than 5,000 pro-immigrant postcards, Long Island Immigrant Alliance’s call-in day to Schumer’s office got wide support, and Long Island Wins’ e-mail campaigns have generated more than 2,500 communications with our elected officials. These efforts have won over more than half of the Senate to reform already. Since the time horizon for winning reform is limited to the next several months, we must continue to push hard in the knowledge that while victory may be difficult even with the greatest effort, defeat will be certain if we give up. <br />

Key to solve food insecurity<br />
<br />
Gaskill ’10 (Ron Gaskill is director of congressional relations for the American Farm Bureau Federation. Worker shortage urges immigration reform efforts April 9, 2010 Season Right for Meaningful Immigration Reform By Ron Gaskill<br />
Even in these times of higher-than-usual unemployment, most farmers and ranchers still struggle to find all the workers they need for a successful season. Serious concerns that not enough domestic workers will choose to work in agriculture has become a harsh reality across the countryside. About 15 million people in the United States choose non-farm jobs at wages that are actually lower than what they could earn by working alongside farmers and ranchers. The on-farm jobs and opportunities are there, but many workers choose not to take advantage of them. The issue is rapidly moving from one centered on a lack of resources, to one with food insecurity at its heart. Farmers and ranchers are the ones being squeezed; caught between a domestic labor force that doesn’t want agricultural work, government policy that fails to recognize the seriousness of the problem and an administration that consistently makes it harder to hire workers. U.S. consumers will continue to eat fresh fruits and vegetables regardless of how the labor scenario ultimately plays out. But, whether or not those fruits and vegetables are grown in the U.S. or imported from other countries where labor is more plentiful greatly concerns Farm Bureau. It’s past time for our nation’s policymakers to translate grassroots concern into meaningful action. As much as we believe in a farmer’s right to farm, Farm Bureau fully respects the right of U.S. workers to choose other lines of work. But, on the flip side, as employers, we must be able to legally employ those who do want to work, even if they’re from other countries. Comprehensive immigration reform is needed, so that America’s farmers and ranchers can continue to produce an abundant supply of safe, healthy food, as well as renewable fuels and fiber for our nation. <br />

Food insecurity sparks World War 3<br />
<br />
Calvin ’98 <br />
(William, Theoretical Neurophysiologist – U Washington, Atlantic Monthly, January, Vol 281, No. 1, p. 47-64)<br />
The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some powerful countries to try to take over their neighbors or distant lands -- if only because their armies, unpaid and lacking food, would go marauding, both at home and across the borders. The better-organized countries would attempt to use their armies, before they fell apart entirely, to take over countries with significant remaining resources, driving out or starving their inhabitants if not using modern weapons to accomplish the same end: eliminating competitors for the remaining food. This would be a worldwide problem -- and could lead to a Third World War -- but Europe's vulnerability is particularly easy to analyze. The last abrupt cooling, the Younger Dryas, drastically altered Europe's climate as far east as Ukraine. Present-day Europe has more than 650 million people. It has excellent soils, and largely grows its own food. It could no longer do so if it lost the extra warming from the North Atlantic.<br />

A. Temperature monitors, sunspot cycle, and 10 year past all suggest that we are entering an iceage<br />
EU REFERENDUM 4-24-2008<br />
Warming (if you will forgive that word) to his theme, he tells us that, &quot;disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming, the average temperature on Earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade, despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, and now the global temperature is falling precipitously.&quot; This we have recorded on this blog (for instance, here and here and Chapman tells us that all four agencies that track Earth's temperature (the Hadley Climate Research Unit in Britain, the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, the Christy group at the University of Alabama, and Remote Sensing Systems Inc in California) report that the global temperature cooled by about 0.7C in 2007. This, he reminds us, &quot;is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back where we were in 1930. If the temperature does not soon recover, we will have to conclude that global warming is over.&quot; He adds: There is also plenty of anecdotal evidence that 2007 was exceptionally cold. It snowed in Baghdad for the first time in centuries, the winter in China was simply terrible and the extent of Antarctic sea ice in the austral winter was the greatest on record since James Cook discovered the place in 1770.We could also add that Arctic ice cover this winter is over a million square kilometres more than it was last year, with Greenland ice between Canada and southwest Greenland having reached its greatest extent in 15 years. Yet still we get ill-informed propaganda puffs from the WWF in the likes of today's Daily Telegraph telling us that dwindling Arctic sea ice may have reached a &quot;tipping point&quot; relying on data from September 2005. Rightly, Chapman cautions that it is generally not possible to draw conclusions about climatic trends from events in a single year. He would normally dismiss this cold snap as transient, pending what happens in the next few years. But this is where SOHO comes in. We are thus informed: The sunspot number follows a cycle of somewhat variable length, averaging 11 years. The most recent minimum was in March last year. The new cycle, No 24, was supposed to start soon after that, with a gradual build-up in sunspot numbers. It didn't happen. The first sunspot appeared in January this year and lasted only two days. A tiny spot appeared last Monday but vanished within 24 hours. Another little spot appeared this Monday. Pray that there will be many more, and soon. The reason this matters is that there is a close correlation between variations in the sunspot cycle and Earth's climate. <br />

It is difficult to predict the advent of a new Ice Age-the time when continental glaciers will start to cover Scandinavia, Central and Northern Europe, Asia, Canada, and the United States, Chile and Argentina with a layer of ice hundreds and thousands of meters thick; when mountain glaciers in the Himalayas, Andes and Alps, in Africa and Indonesia once again will descend into the valleys. Some climatologists claim that this will happen in 50 to 150 years. What fate awaits the Baltic Sea, the lakes, the forests, animals, cities, nations, and the whole infrastructure of modern civilization? They will be swept away by the advancing ice and then covered by moraine hills. This disaster will be incomparably more calamitous than all the doomsday prophecies of the proponents of the ~-made global warming hypothesis. The current sunspot cycle is weaker than the preceding cycles, and the next two cycles will be even weaker. Bashkirtsev and Mishnich expect that the minimum of the sec- ular cycle of solar activity will occur between 2021 and 2026, which will result in the minimum global temperature of the surface air. The shift from warm to cool climate might have already started. The average annual air temperature in Irkutsk, which correlates well with the average annual global temper- ature of the surface air, reached its maximum of +2.3°C in 1997, and then began to drop to +1.2°C in 1998, to +0.7°C in 1999, and to +0.4°C in 2000. This prediction is in agreement with major changes observed currently in biota of Pacific Ocean, associated with an oscillating climate cycle of about 50 years’ periodicity. The approaching new Ice Age poses a real challenge for mankind, much greater than all the other challenges in history. Before it comes-let's enjoy the warming, this benign gift from nature, and let's vigorously investigate the physics of clouds. F. Hoyle and C. Wickramasinghe stated recently that &quot;without some artificial means of giving positive feedback to the climate ... an eventual drift into Ice Age conditions appears inevitable.&quot; These conditions &quot;would render a large fraction ofthe world's major food growing areas inoperable, and so would inevitably lead to the extinction of most of the present human population.&quot; According to Hoyle and Wickramsinghe, &quot;those who have engaged in uncritical scaremongering over an enhanced greenhouse effect raising the Earth's temperature by a degree or two should be seen as both misguided and dangerous,&quot; for the problem of the present &quot;is of a drift back into an Ice Age, not away from an Ice Age.&quot; Will mankind be able to protect the biosphere against the next returning Ice Age? It depends on how much time we still have. I do not think that in the next 50 years we would acquire the knowledge and resources sufficient for governing climate on a global scale. Surely we shall not stop climate cooling by increasing industrial CO2 emissions. Even with the doubling of CO2 atmospheric levels, the increase in global surface air tem- perature would be trifling. However, it is unlikely that perma- nent doubling of the atmospheric CO2 , even using all our car- bon resources, is attainable by human activities. Also, it does not seem possible that we will ever gain influ- ence over the Sun’s activity. However, I think that in the next centuries we shall learn to control sea currents and clouds, and this could be sufficient to govern the climate of our planet. The following &quot;thought experiment&quot; illustrates how valuable our civilization, and the very existence of man's intellect, for the terrestrial biosphere. Mikhail Budyko, the leading Russian climatologist (now deceased) predicted in 1982 a future drastic C02 deficit in the atmosphere, and claimed that one of the next Ice Age periods could result in a freezing of the entire surface of the Earth, including the oceans. The only niches of life, he said, would survive on the active volcano edges. Budyko's hypothesis is still controversial, but 10 years later it was discovered that 700 million years ago, the Earth already underwent such a disaster, changing into &quot;snowball Earth,&quot; covered in white from Pole to Pole, with an average temperature of minus 40°C. <br />

 Proliferation stops first strikes, weapons escalation and major wars <br />
Kenneth Waltz, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed, 2003, p. 36-37<br />
For a number of reasons, deterrent strategies prom¬ise less damage than war-fighting strategies. First, deter¬rent strategies induce caution all around and thus reduce the incidence of war. Second, wars fought in the face of strategic nuclear weapons must be carefully limited be¬cause a country having them may retaliate if its vital in¬terests are threatened. Third, prospective punishment need only be proportionate to an adversary’s expected gains in war after those gains are discounted for the many uncertainties of war. Fourth, should deterrence fail, a few judiciously delivered warheads are likely to produce sobriety in the leaders of all of the countries in¬volved and thus bring rapid deescalation. Finally, war-fighting strategies offer no clear place to stop short of vic¬tory for some and defeat for others. Deterrent strategies do, and that place is where one country threatens an¬other’s vital interests. Deterrent strategies lower the probability that wars will begin. If wars start neverthe¬less, deterrent strategies lower the probability that they will be carried very far. In a conventional world, to deter an attacker a status quo country must threaten alot of force. It must do so to overcome doubts about the credibility of conventional threats and uncertainty about the effectiveness of conventional blows: In a nuclear world to deter one need threaten only a little force use because so much more can easily be added. Limiting wars in a conventional world has proved difficult. In a nuclear world, only limited wars can be fought. In a convention world states are tempted to strike first to gain an initial advantage and set the course of the war. In a nuclear world, to strike first is pointless because no advantage can be gained against invulnerable forces. In a conventional world, combatants use their best i.e. their most destructive, weapons. Although over looked, this explains our use of atomic bombs in the Second World War. From Guadal canal to Iwo Jima to Okinawa to the fire-bombing of Tokyo, America applied force on an ever increasing scale. In the context of a conventional war, A-bombs looked simply like bigger and better weapons. The aim in a conventional war is to escalate to a higher level than your opponent can reach. In a nuclear world, no one can escalate to a level of force anywhere near the top without risking its own destruction. Deterrence in World War II worked where combatants shared the ability to use a horrible weapon, poison gas. All of the major combatants were capable of using it. None did. On all of the above counts, nuclear weapons reverse the logic of war that operates in conventional worlds. Nuclear weapons lessen the intensity as well as the frequency of war among their possessors. For fear of es¬calation, nuclear states do not want to fight long and hard over important interests—indeed, they do not want to fight at all. Minor nuclear states have even better reasons than major ones to accommodate one another and to avoid fighting. Worries about the intensity of war among nuclear states have to be viewed in this context and against a world in which conventional weapons have become ever costlier and more destructive.<br />

These wars escalate to biological weapons use that outweighs nuclear war<br />
Robert Johnson, Strategic Planning, “Abolishing Nuclear Weapons: The Key to Global Security?” CSIS Prospectus, Fall 1999, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csis.org/pubs/prospectus/99FallJohnson.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csis.org/pubs/prospectus/99FallJohnson.html</a>, accessed 8/11/02<br />
Conventional wars are no doubt less horrible and less destabilizing to civilization than nuclear wars may be, but they may be fought more often, with far more casualties, and environmental damage, than the world is used to today. And if nuclear weapons are the only Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) that are removed, biological and chemical weapons will still remain. Biological weapons are much more indiscriminate and can have more devastating effects on civilization than nuclear weapons can. Ridding the world of only nuclear weapons may remove us from the somewhat benign fear of war that exists today and place us in a world where the threat of war is much more imminent and the consequences equally catastrophic.<br />

Any bioweapons use risks spreading all over the planet <br />

Although human pathogens are often lumped with nuclear explosives and lethal chemicals as potential weapons of mass destruction, there is an obvious, fundamentally important difference: Pathogens are alive, weapons are not. Nuclear and chemical weapons do not reproduce themselves and do not independently engage in adaptive behavior; pathogens do both of these things. That deceptively simple observation has immense implications. The use of a manufactured weapon is a singular event. Most of the damage occurs immediately. The aftereffects, whatever they may be, decay rapidly over time and distance in a reasonably predictable manner. Even before a nuclear warhead is detonated, for instance, it is possible to estimate the extent of the subsequent damage and the likely level of radioactive fallout. Such predictability is an essential component for tactical military planning. The use of a pathogen, by contrast, is an extended process whose scope and timing cannot be precisely controlled. For most potential biological agents, the predominant drawback is that they would not act swiftly or decisively enough to be an effective weapon. But for a few pathogens - ones most likely to have a decisive effect and therefore the ones most likely to be contemplated for deliberately hostile use - the risk runs in the other direction. A lethal pathogen that could efficiently spread from one victim to another would be capable of initiating an intensifying cascade of disease that might ultimately threaten the entire world population.<br />

Nuclear war wouldn’t escalate<br />
Gray 2k [Colin, Professor ofInternational Politics at the University of Hull, &quot;To Confuse Ourselves: Nuclear Fallacies,&quot; Alternative Nuclear Futures, ed. Baylis and O'Neil, p. 17]cn<br />
A small nuclear war is an oxymoron. While most probably it is true that a nuclear war between regional powers would have the effect of encouraging extra-regional actors to keep their heads down, it is not likely that a 'small' nuclear war between regional rivals would have negligible, or world-system supporting, consequences. Scholar-theorists like Kenneth N. Waltz probably are correct when they point to the readily confinable domain of a regional nuclear conflict. In Waltz's brutally realistic words: [i]f such [relatively weak] states use nuclear weapons, the world will not end. The use of nuclear weapons by lesser powers would hardly trigger them elsewhere. No one wants to be a player (target) in other people's nuclear wars.<br />

Reliance on Biological Weapons creates an unstable arena prone to first strikes<br />

&lt;Gregory, International Security 28.3 (2003/04) 84-122 Pathogens as Weapons The International Security Implications of Biological Warfare&gt;<br />
The prerequisite for strategic deterrence is the capability of the target of a surprise attack to retaliate by inflicting unacceptable damage against its attacker. 100 During the Cold War, the possession of such forces by both superpowers gave rise to the situation of mutual deterrence described as mutual assured destruction. The nuclear revolution is a function not only of the destructiveness of nuclear weapons but also of their reliability, the lack of effective defenses, and the availability of survivable delivery systems. 101 Although biological weapons have the potential to inflict unacceptable damage against an adversary, they are unable to offer states an &quot;assured&quot; capability for doing so; this shortfall undermines their suitability as a strategic deterrent. Biological weapons differ from nuclear weapons in two important ways that raise doubts about the applicability of strategic deterrence theory to biological warfare. The first significant difference involves the level of uncertainty associated with the employment of these weapons. Based on a deep understanding of the fundamental scientific principles underlying nuclear weapons as well as extensive operational and experimental experience with them, experts have been able to document the levels of thermal radiation, nuclear radiation, and blast overpressure that cause specified effects in personnel and matériel. 102 Nuclear weapons deliver instantaneous and overwhelming destruction; the effects of biological weapons, on the other hand, are delayed, variable, and difficult to predict. There are ways to reduce this uncertainty by carefully selecting the agent, the delivery system, and the conditions under which an attack is conducted. States that plan on using their biological weapons as a strategic deterrent, however, may not have the luxury of choosing the time and place for a retaliatory strike. 103 In addition, the lack of operational experience with these weapons and the inability to realistically simulate their effects (short of massive human experimentation) impede the ability of states to substantially reduce this level of <br />
uncertainty. The second major difference between nuclear and biological weapons concerns the availability of defenses. There are no effective defenses against the effects of a nuclear attack. As discussed earlier, however, there are countermeasures that <br />
can be taken prior to or following a biological attack. This creates two problems for relying on biological weapons as a strategic deterrent. First, the availability of defenses that could significantly mitigate the consequences of a biological attack is <br />
likely to reduce the confidence of states in their ability to reliably inflict unacceptable damage against an adversary in a retaliatory strike. The full panoply of defenses need not be deployed constantly at full readiness because the very availability of these defenses <br />
may be sufficient to dissuade a state from calculating that it can inflict unacceptable damage. Although civilian populations will remain more vulnerable to biological weapons than military forces, damage limitation remains a viable option for larger, [End Page 105] more advanced states facing less sophisticated adversaries. The December 2002 initiative by the United States to vaccinate nearly 1 million soldiers, public health officials, and medical workers against smallpox in advance of the looming war with Iraq illustrates how states can adopt precautionary measures to blunt the effectiveness of an anticipated threat. 104 Second, the availability of defenses against biological weapons also places a premium on surprise. Surprise requires strict secrecy, which reduces a state's ability to issue credible threats to inflict unacceptable damage against an adversary. 105 Credible deterrent threats would entail revealing details about the nature of a state's biological weapons capabilities. These revelations could reduce the effectiveness of these weapons by compromising the element of surprise and allowing the defender to take appropriate countermeasures. North Korea in the late 1960s and Iraq in the early 1990s employed deterrent strategies based on biological weapons only to have them compromised by secrecy. 106 Regardless of whether a state adopts a strategy of biological deterrence by denial or deterrence by punishment, neither will deter potential adversaries if the intention and capabilities to implement the strategy are unknown. Secrecy may be an inexpensive and attractive way for gaining security for strategic forces, but it is also risky. 107 Forces that depend on secrecy for their protection are vulnerable to intelligence breakthroughs by an adversary. The [End Page 106] loss of secrecy could be massive and occur without warning. If a defender hasinside information about an attacker's intentions and capabilities, it could seek to develop and stockpile new vaccines and treatments, immunize the at-risk population, distribute protective masks and treatments, enhance public health surveillance, and take other precautions that could substantially mitigate theimpact of a biological weapon attack. Although such information is difficult to acquire, there have been a number of cases where high-level officials knowledgeable about their nation's biological weapons program have defected. 108 The Difficulties of Deterring Biological Attacks The accessibility of biological weapons to a diverse set of actors and the ease of covert attacks complicate efforts to deter their use. The proliferation of biological weapons to nondeterrable actors and the prospect of anonymous attacks could undermine reliance on deterrence as a security strategy and lead states to adopt preventive or preemptive strategies. ACCESSIBILITY OF BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. Because of the global diffusion of dual-use biotechnology, biological weapons can be developed by a larger and more diverse group of actors than can nuclear weapons. Even states that are incapable of effectively managing the investment of large amounts of human, financial, and physical capital over the ten years typically required to produce nuclear weapons may still be able to develop biological weapons. 109 In 1993, the Office of Technology Assessment estimated that more than 100 states had the capability to develop biological weapons. 110 This greater accessibility raises the risk that biological weapons could be acquired by an actor that is insensitive to costs, values gains more than the status quo, and grossly misperceives the interests or capabilities of others. Such actors can be difficult to deter because they &quot;do not feel the pain of punishment, or they are willing to take great [End Page 107] pains to gain their goals, or they fail to see the punishment coming.&quot; 111 The primary actors of concern in this regard are terrorists. 112 Although no terrorist group has yet succeeded in developing a mass casualty-producing biological weapon, groups such as Aum Shinrikyo and al-Qaeda have demonstrated the ability to employ sophisticated weapons, the desire to cause mass casualties, and an interest in using disease as a weapon. 113 Moreover, the possibility that a state sometime in the future might demonstrate some of these qualities cannot be excluded. 114 PROSPECT OF ANONYMOUS USE. Biological weapons are relatively easy to develop in secret, are well suited for covert delivery, and do not provide signatures that can be used to identify the attacker. Aum Shinrikyo's dissemination of biological agents in Japan on a dozen separate occasions in the early 1990s went undetected until they were revealed years later during the trial of the cult's leadership. 115 As the Federal Bureau of Investigation's inability to identify the perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax letter attacks has demonstrated, forensic capabilities in this field are limited. 116 The potential accessibility of biological weapon capabilities to large number of actors also complicates efforts to identify the perpetrator of a biological attack. If a state or terrorist group believes that it could conduct an attack anonymously and thereby escape retaliation, deterrence would be ineffective. A second potential consequence of the anonymous use of biological weapons is catalytic war: a war between two states secretly initiated by a third party. The spread of nuclear weapons in the 1960s created concern that a third party could attack either superpower and make it appear to be the work of its rival, sparking a crisis or war. 117 This worry faded in the 1970s with the signing of[End Page 108] the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which helped to forestall the spread of nuclear weapons, and the advent of advanced early warning systems that allowed the superpowers to detect and track aircraft and ballistic missiles, the primary delivery systems for nuclear weapons. No such measures exist today with regards to biological weapons, so the possibility of a catalytic war sparked by the use of these weapons remains a possibility. For example, a hostile state or terrorist group in the Middle East could stage an attack on U.S. forces in the region that points to another state as the culprit. PREVENTION AND PREEMPTION. States may adopt preventive or preemptive strategies to neutralize perceived threats posed by the prospect of anonymous biological attacks or the acquisition of biological weapons by nondeterrable actors. 118 After the September 11 terrorist attacks, preventive and preemptive strategies became central to U.S. national security planning. 119 These strategies, however, first emerged during President Bill Clinton's administration in response to the threat of mass casualty terrorism. In 1995, the White House issued a presidential decision directive stating that the acquisition of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons by terrorists was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; According to the directive, &quot;There is no higher priority than preventing the acquisition of this capability or removing this capability from terrorist groups potentially opposed to the U.S.&quot; 120 This policy was first implemented on August 20, 1998, when the United States launched cruise missiles at the al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, which officials believed was linked to the development of chemical weapons for al-Qaeda. 121 Despite concerns within the administration about the legal and intelligence justifications for the attack, &quot;the perception of imminent danger was powerful enough to overcome these concerns. At the Principals meeting, [National Security Adviser] Sandy Berger asked, 'What if we do not hit it [al-Shifa] and then, after an attack, nerve gas is released in the New York City subway? What will we say then?'&quot; 122Although this incident involved terrorist acquisition of chemical (not biological) weapons, it indicates [End Page 109] how states may respond to the specter of terrorist acquisition of even more lethal weapons. Preventive and preemptive attacks against suspected biological weapons facilities present significant intelligence, military, and diplomatic challenges. The potential consequences of a biological attack and the limitations of defensive and deterrent strategies, however, may influence a decisionmaker's calculation that the risks of inaction outweigh the costs of action.<br />

Two major considerations are behind the CCP leadership’s ultra-ambitious expansion of digital warfare capability. The first is to narrow the gap with the United States, which is seen as having a comfortable lead in the virtual battlefield of the 21st century. Professor Fang Binxing, president of the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and one of China’s top Net experts, noted, “the U.S. is without question the world’s foremost power in Cyber-based attacks and defense.” “The U.S. holds absolute superiority in [combat ability relating to] conventional and outer space as well as Cyberspace,” said Professor Fang, who added that Chinese capacity in this area remained “very backward” (China Daily.com, July 3, 2009; Tujian.org [Beijing], July 16, 2009).<br />

But is dissuading China from augmenting or enhancing its nuclear missile force a good dissuasion objective in the first place? The generic question is whether, if we closed off one path, &quot;dissuadees&quot; would pursue other paths that could be of greater concern to us. If the U.S. tried to deploy sufficient missile defenses (when combined with U.S. offenses) to deny China confidence that it can hold the U.S. at risk with its nuclear forces, would China simply redirect its efforts away from these areas, and into other areas which the U.S. may find more worrisome—such as threats to our use of space, or offensive information operations (IO) such as computer network attacks? If it were a trade off, and the U.S. could choose its area of military competition with China, it might prefer a competition in the well-understood and arguably manageable areas of nuclear missiles and missile defenses rather than in the areas of space or information operations. But that is not necessarily the case; the Chinese could be determined to go down the path of space and IO capability in any event (some would argue that horse is already out of the barn). However, there may be ways to make it harder for them—to raise the costs, deny the benefits, and maintain our advantages.<br />

After the attacks, computer security experts from Nato, the EU, US and Israel arrived in the capital, Tallinn, to study its effects. <br />
Sami Saydjari, who has been working on cyber defence systems for the Pentagon since the 1980s, told Congress in testimony on April 25 that a mass cyber attack could leave 70 per cent of the US without electrical power for six months. He told The Times that all major nations – including China – were scrambling to defend against, and working out ways to cause, “maximum strategic damage” by taking out banking systems, power grids and communications networks. He said that there were at least a thousand attempted attacks every hour on American computers. “China is aggressive in this,” he said. <br />

As a matter of domestic U.S. politics, McConnell argues that we now suffer from a conspiracy of secrecy about the scale of cyber risks. No credit-card company wants to admit how often or how easily it is cheated. No bank or investment house wants to admit how close it has come to being electronically robbed. As a result, the changes in law, regulation, concept, or habit that could make online life safer don’t get discussed. Sooner or later, the cyber equivalent of 9/11 will occur—and, if the real 9/11 is a model, we will understandably, but destructively, overreact.<br />

China’s nuclear modernization is focused on improving the ability of its forces to survive an adversary's first strike and making its nuclear deterrence posture more credible, tasks that have taken on increased urgency as a result of growing concerns regarding U.S. nuclear preeminence, missile defense plans and conventional precision strike capabilities [17]. China is moving toward a much more survivable and thus more credible, strategic nuclear posture with the development of the road-mobile DF-31 and DF-31A ICBMs and the JL-2 SLBM. Beijing is also expanding its conventional missile capabilities,to include not only an increasingly potent SRBM force but also medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) that could threaten U.S. aircraft carriers. Accordingto General Jing Zhiyuan and General Peng Xiaofeng, Commander and Political Commissar of the SAC, the SAC has “achieved the great leap in development from a single core unitto a nuclear and conventional entity which gives equal attention to both” [18]. Further improvements are still required, according to General Jing and General Peng, but as a result of the advances that have already been made, China’s &quot;strategic deterrence and actual combat capabilities have been vastly improved&quot; [19]. Indeed, the introduction of road-mobile strategic missiles and SSBNs will allow China to achieve a posture of “effective deterrence.” The modernization of Chinese nuclear forces and the transition from silo-based to road-mobile nuclear missiles and SSBNs might thus enhance strategic deterrence stability. Indeed, deterrence theory suggests that a more secure second-strike capability should enhance stability by causing both the United States and China to behave much more cautiously.<br />

Uniqueness – American preponderance makes multipolarity inevitable.<br />
<br />
Michael Lind, Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation, 1-25, 2005 (How America Became the World’s Dispensable Nation. Financial Times. Page 17. Lexis | Junior)<br />
<br />
In a second inaugural address tinged with evangelical zeal, George W. Bush declared: &quot;Today, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world.&quot; The peoples of the world, however, do not seem to be listening. A new world order is indeed emerging - but its architecture is being drafted in Asia and Europe, at meetings to which Americans have not been invited. Consider Asean Plus Three (APT), which unites the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with China, Japan and South Korea. This group could become the world's largest trade bloc, dwarfing the European Union and North American Free Trade Association. The deepening ties of the APT member states are a big diplomatic defeat for the US, which hoped to use the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum to limit the growth of Asian economic regionalism at American expense. In the same way, recent moves by South American countries to bolster an economic community represent a clear rejection of US aims to dominate a western-hemisphere free-trade zone. Consider, as well, the EU's rapid progress towards military independence. American protests failed to prevent the EU establishing its own military planning agency, independent of the Nato alliance (and thus of Washington). Europe is building up its own rapid reaction force. And, despite US resistance, the EU is developing Galileo, its own satellite network, which will break the monopoly of the US global positioning satellite system. The participation of China in Europe's Galileo project has alarmed the US military. But China shares an interest with other aspiring space powers in preventing American control of space for military and commercial uses. Even while collaborating with Europe on Galileo, China is partnering Brazil to launch satellites. And in an unprecedented move, China recently agreed to host Russian forces for joint Russo-Chinese military exercises. The US is being sidelined even in the area that Mr Bush identified in last week's address as America's mission: the promotion of democracy and human rights. The EU has devoted far more resources to consolidating democracy in post-communist Europe than has the US. By contrast, under Mr Bush the US hypocritically uses the promotion of democracy as the rationale for campaigns against states it opposes for strategic reasons. Washington denounces tyranny in Iran but tolerates it in Pakistan. In Iraq, the goal of democratisation was invoked only after the invasion, which was justified earlier by claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was collaborating with al-Qaeda. Nor is American democracy a shining example to mankind. The present one-party rule in the US has been produced in part by the artificial redrawing of political districts to favour Republicans. The role of money in American politics continues to grow. America's judges – many of whom will be appointed by Mr Bush - increasingly behave as partisan political activists in black robes. America's antiquated winner-take-all electoral system has been abandoned by many other democracies for more inclusive versions of proportional representation. In other areas of global moral and institutional reform, the US today is a follower rather than a leader. Human rights? Europe has banned the death penalty and torture. The US is a leading practitioner of execution. Under Mr Bush, the US has constructed an international military gulag in which the torture of suspects has frequently occurred. The international rule of law? For generations, promoting international law in collaboration with other nations was a US goal. But the neoconservatives who dominate Washington today mock the very idea of international law. The next US attorney general will be the White House counsel who scorned the Geneva Conventions as obsolete. A decade ago, American triumphalists mocked those who argued that the world was becoming multipolar rather than unipolar. Where was the evidence of balancing against the US? they asked. Today the evidence of foreign co-operation to reduce American primacy is everywhere – from the increasing importance of regional trade blocs that exclude the US to international space projects and military exercises in which the US is conspicuous by its absence. It is true that the US remains the only country capable of projecting military power throughout the world. But unipolarity in the military sphere, narrowly defined, is not preventing the rapid development of multipolarity in the geopolitical and economic arenas - far from it. And the other great powers, with the exception of the UK, are content to let the US waste blood and treasure on its doomed attempt at hegemony in the Middle East. That the rest of the world is building institutions and alliances that shut out the US should come as no surprise. The view that American leaders can be trusted to use a monopoly of military and economic power for the good of humanity has never been widely shared outside the US. The trend toward multipolarity has probably been accelerated by the truculent unilateralism of the Bush administration, whose motto seems to be that of the Hollywood mogul Samuel Goldwyn: &quot;Include me out.&quot; In recent memory, nothing could be done without the US. But today, most international institution-building of any long-term importance in global diplomacy and trade occurs without American participation. In 1998 Madeleine Albright, then US secretary of state, said of the US: &quot;We are the indispensable nation.&quot; By backfiring, the unilateralism of Mr Bush has proved her wrong. The US, it turns out, is a dispensable nation. Europe, China, Russia, Latin America and other regions and nations are quietly taking measures whose effect, if not sole purpose, will be to cut America down to size.<br />

1. Balancing – attempts to maintain global deployment prevents a strategy of offshore balancing. This solves the benefits of global leadership while avoiding backlash from extremists, regional power wars, and the destruction of legitimacy.<br />
<br />
Stephen Walt, Academic Dean at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, 3-10, 2005 (In the National Interest; A New Grand Strategy for American Foreign Policy. Boston Review. Lexis | Junior)<br />
<br />
The final option is offshore balancing, which has been America's traditional grand strategy. In this strategy, the United States deploys its power abroad only when there are direct threats to vital American interests. Offshore balancing assumes that only a few areas of the globe are of strategic importance to the United States (that is, worth fighting and dying for). Specifically, the vital areas are the regions where there are substantial concentrations of power and wealth or critical natural resources: Europe, industrialized Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Offshore balancing further recognizes that the United States does not need to control these areas directly; it merely needs to ensure that they do not fall under the control of a hostile great power and especially not under the control of a so-called peer competitor. To prevent rival great powers from doing this, offshore balancing prefers to rely primarily on local actors to uphold the regional balance of power. Under this strategy, the United States would intervene with its own forces only when regional powers are unable to uphold the balance of power on their own. Most importantly, offshore balancing is not isolationist. The United States would still be actively engaged around the world, through multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and the WTO and through close ties with specific regional allies. But it would no longer keep large numbers of troops overseas solely for the purpose of &quot;maintaining stability,&quot; and it would not try to use American military power to impose democracy on other countries or disarm potential proliferators. Offshore balancing does not preclude using power for humanitarian ends--to halt or prevent genocide or mass murder--but the United States would do so only when it was confident it could prevent these horrors at an acceptable cost. (By limiting military commitments overseas, however, an offshore-balancing strategy would make it easier for the United States to intervene in cases of mass murder or genocide.) The United States would still be prepared to use force when it was directly threatened--as it was when the Taliban allowed al Qaeda a safe haven in Afghanistan--and would be prepared to help other governments deal with terrorists that also threaten the United States. Over time, a strategy of offshore balancing would make it less likely that the United States would face the hatred of radicals like bin Laden, and would thus make it less likely that the United States would have to intervene in far-flung places where it is not welcome. Offshore balancing is the ideal grand strategy for an era of American primacy. It husbands the power upon which this primacy rests and minimizes the fear that this power provokes. By setting clear priorities and emphasizing reliance on regional allies, it reduces the danger of being drawn into unnecessary conflicts and encourages other states to do more for us. Equally important, it takes advantage of America's favorable geopolitical position and exploits the tendency for regional powers to worry more about each other than about the United States. But it is not a passive strategy and does not preclude using the full range of America's power to advance its core interests.<br />

That results in a nuclear world war.<br />

Mohamed Sid-Ahmed, Egyptian Political Analyst, Al-Ahram Newspaper, 8-26, 2004 (Al-Abram Online. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm</a> | Junior)<br />

What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack by terrorists? Even if it fails, it would further exacerbate the negative features of the new and frightening world in which we are now living. Societies would close in on themselves, police measures would be stepped up at the expense of human rights, tensions between civilisations and religions would rise and ethnic conflicts would proliferate. It would also speed up the arms race and develop the awareness that a different type of world order is imperative if humankind is to survive. But the still more critical scenario is if the attack succeeds. This could lead to a third world war, from which no one will emerge victorious. Unlike a conventional war which ends when one side triumphs over another, this war will be without winners and losers. When nuclear pollution infects the whole planet, we will all be losers.<br />

2. Overstretch – grand strategy causes the United States to become overstretched. Regional powers would protect regional wars from escalation.<br />
<br />
Christopher Layne, Associate Professor in the School of International Studies at the University of Miami, Spring, 2002 (Offshore Balancing Revisited. The Washington Quarterly. Lexis | Junior)<br />
<br />
In the longer term, regardless of future developments in the war on terrorism, the paradox of U.S. power will not disappear. Looking beyond the war, the big question confronting U.S. strategists in coming years is how to reduce the risks of U.S. hegemony. To lower the risk, the United States must change its grand strategy. One grand strategic alternative to primacy is offshore balancing. n18 Like primacy, offshore balancing is a strategy firmly rooted in the Realist tradition. Primacy adherents regard multipolarity -- an international system comprised of three or more great powers -- as a strategic threat to the United States, while offshore balancers see it as a strategic opportunity for the United States. Offshore balancing is predicated on the assumption that attempting to maintain U.S. hegemony is self-defeating because it will provoke other states to combine in opposition to the United States and result in the futile depletion of the United States' relative power, thereby leaving it worse off than if it accommodated multipolarity. Offshore balancing accepts that the United States cannot prevent the rise of new great powers either within (the EU, Germany, and Japan) or outside (China, a resurgent Russia) its sphere of influence. Offshore balancing would also relieve the United States of its burden of managing the security affairs of turbulent regions such as the Persian Gulf/Middle East and Southeast Europe. Offshore balancing is a grand strategy based on burden shifting, not burden sharing. It would transfer to others the task of maintaining regional power balances; checking the rise of potential global and regional hegemons; and stabilizing Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf/Middle East. In other words, other states would have to become responsible for providing their own security and for the security of the regions in which they live (and contiguous ones), rather than looking to the United States to do it for them.<br />

That undermines the effectiveness of leadership and makes a terrorist attack more likely.<br />

Michael Ignatieff, Director of the Carr Center, Harvard University, 1/5/2003 (The New York Times) p. lexis<br />
<br />
At the beginning of the first volume of &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,&quot; published in 1776, Edward Gibbon remarked that empires endure only so long as their rulers take care not to overextend their borders. Augustus bequeathed his successors an empire &quot;within those limits which nature seemed to have placed as its permanent bulwarks and boundaries: on the west the Atlantic Ocean; the Rhine and Danube on the north; the Euphrates on the east; and towards the south the sandy deserts of Arabia and Africa.&quot; Beyond these boundaries lay the barbarians. But the &quot;vanity or ignorance&quot; of the Romans, Gibbon went on, led them to &quot;despise and sometimes to forget the outlying countries that had been left in the enjoyment of a barbarous independence.&quot; As a result, the proud Romans were lulled into making the fatal mistake of &quot;confounding the Roman monarchy with the globe of the earth.&quot; This characteristic delusion of imperial power is to confuse global power with global domination. The Americans may have the former, but they do not have the latter. They cannot rebuild each failed state or appease each anti-American hatred, and the more they try, the more they expose themselves to the overreach that eventually undermined the classical empires of old. The secretary of defense may be right when he warns the North Koreans that America is capable of fighting on two fronts -- in Korea and Iraq -- simultaneously, but Americans at home cannot be overjoyed at such a prospect, and if two fronts are possible at once, a much larger number of fronts is not. If conflict in Iraq, North Korea or both becomes a possibility, Al Qaeda can be counted on to seek to strike a busy and overextended empire in the back. What this suggests is not just that overwhelming power never confers the security it promises but also that even the overwhelmingly powerful need friends and allies. In the cold war, the road to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, led through Moscow and Beijing. Now America needs its old cold war adversaries more than ever to control the breakaway, bankrupt Communist rogue that is threatening America and her clients from Tokyo to Seoul. Empires survive when they understand that diplomacy, backed by force, is always to be preferred to force alone. Looking into the still more distant future, say a generation ahead, resurgent Russia and China will demand recognition both as world powers and as regional hegemons. As the North Korean case shows, America needs to share the policing of nonproliferation and other threats with these powers, and if it tries, as the current National Security Strategy suggests, to prevent the emergence of any competitor to American global dominance, it risks everything that Gibbon predicted: overextension followed by defeat. <br />

(C) Impact – failing to curtail American global leadership will result in an inevitable nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Michael M. May, senior fellow at the Institute for International Studies , March, 2000 (The U.S. Enlargement Strategy and Nuclear Weapons, Page 4, iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/11892/enlargementstrategy.pdf | Junior)<br />
<br />
These two policies, military enlargement and reliance on nuclear stability and arms control, are not compatible. Continued enlargement backed or led by military force will not support de-emphasis of nuclear weapons, let alone nuclear disarmament. It may not support nuclear nonproliferation even among allies, depending on whether the United States is seen to become overextended or overcommitted at home or abroad. Military enlargement weakens support for several of the arms-control measures on the U.S. agenda. Enlargement is also likely to lead to crises that will test the stability of nuclear deterrence more seriously than it has been tested since the early years of the Cold War. The alternative to military enlargement would require the United States and the other principal military powers in the world to accept geographic restraints on the unilateral use of their power. Such acceptance would minimize nuclear-weapons-related risks. It would also, perhaps paradoxically, better serve continued U.S. power and influence than continued attempts at military enlargement. It might even be popularly acceptable. But it would represent such a change from the present U.S. strategic patterns that it is not likely to be acceptable today. Nevertheless, welcome or not, limits will have to be accepted someday. Continued expansion, if not checked voluntarily, must lead to nuclear confrontation where the adversary is a nuclear power. Nuclear confrontation will lead either to nuclear war or to a mutual acceptance of lines of demarcation. Nuclear war is unacceptable and will not be accepted so long as rational decision-making prevails. Unfortunately, if not planned in advance, acceptance of limits will be reached through a succession of dangerous crises, some of which may sap U.S. power and influence.<br />

1. Hydrogen Power<br />
A. Hydrogen production will destroy the environment through palladium mining<br />
Baard 03 – Personal Tech columnist for the Boston Globe and Boston magazine as well as contributor to Wired, the Times of London, the Village Voice and The Scientist (Mark, The Village Voice, “Hydrogen's Dirty Details,” 12-30-2003, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.villagevoice.com/content/printVersion/180234" rel="nofollow">http://www.villagevoice.com/content/printVersion/180234</a>)<br />
<br />
Hard-rock mineral miners will also have a big role in Bush's version of the hydrogen economy. The most promising hydrogen fuel cell designs depend on expensive platinum group metals, or PGMs, which catalyze hydrogen with oxygen to release energy while resisting corrosion. Most PGMs, particularly platinum and palladium, are produced as by-products of nickel and copper hard-rock mining and smelting, practices that scar landscapes and spew sulfur dioxide and heavy metals into the air and surrounding waterways.<br />
<br />
B. Palladium mining pollutes the air<br />

<br />
Norilsk, which was taken private by the oligarch in a controversial move after the Soviet empire collapsed, produces palladium as a by-product of its mining operations in Norilsk, an industrial nightmare city in northern Siberia. The company's smelts have been releasing 2 million tons of sulfur dioxide each year for over 50 years, damaging or destroying 2 million acres of forest. By this measure, Norilsk is the worst polluter on the planet. Satellite images from a NASA study of Norilsk show 100-mile-long plumes of sulfur dioxide and other noxious exhaust over the city.<br />
<br />
C. Air pollution risks extinction <br />
Driesen 03 (David, Associate Professor, Syracuse University College of Law. J.D. Yale Law School, 1989, Fall/Spring, 10 Buff. Envt'l. L.J. 25, p. 26-30<br />
<br />
Air pollution can make life unsustainable by harming the ecosystem upon which all life depends and harming the health of both future and present generations. The Rio Declaration articulates six key principles that are relevant to air pollution. These principles can also be understood as goals, because they describe a state of affairs that is worth achieving. Agenda 21, in turn, states a program of action for realizing those goals. Between them, they aid understanding of sustainable development’s meaning for air quality. The first principle is that &quot;human beings. . . are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature&quot;, because they are &quot;at the center of concerns for sustainable development.&quot; While the Rio Declaration refers to human health, its reference to life &quot;in harmony with nature&quot; also reflects a concern about the natural environment. 4 Since air pollution damages both human health and the environment, air quality implicates both of these concerns. Lead, carbon monoxide, particulate, tropospheric ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides have historically threatened urban air quality in the United States. This review will focus upon tropospheric ozone, particulate, and carbon monoxide, because these pollutants present the most widespread of the remaining urban air problems, and did so at the time of the earth summit. 6 Tropospheric ozone refers to ozone fairly near to the ground, as opposed to stratospheric ozone high in the atmosphere. The stratospheric ozone layer protects human health and the environment from ultraviolet radiation, and its depletion causes problems. By contrast, tropospheric ozone damages human health and the environment. 8 In the United States, the pollutants causing &quot;urban&quot; air quality problems also affect human health and the environment well beyond urban boundaries. Yet, the health problems these pollutants present remain most acute in urban and suburban areas. Ozone, carbon monoxide, and particulate cause very serious public health problems that have been well recognized for a long time. Ozone forms in the atmosphere from a reaction between volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and sunlight. 10 Volatile organic compounds include a large number of hazardous air pollutants. Nitrogen oxides, as discussed below, also play a role in acidifying ecosystems. Ozone damages lung tissue. It plays a role in triggering asthma attacks, sending thousands to the hospital every summer. It effects young children and people engaged in heavy exercise especially severely. Particulate pollution, or soot, consists of combinations of a wide variety of pollutants. Nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide contribute to formation of fine particulate, which is associated with the most serious health problems. 13 Studies link particulate to tens of thousands of annual premature deaths in the United States. Like ozone it contributes to respiratory illness, but it also seems to play a [*29] role in triggering heart attacks among the elderly. The data suggest that fine particulate, which EPA did not regulate explicitly until recently, plays a major role in these problems. 16 Health researchers have associated carbon monoxide with various types of neurological symptoms, such as visual impairment, reduced work capacity, reduced manual dexterity, poor learning ability, and difficulty in performing complex tasks. The same pollution problems causing current urban health problems also contribute to long lasting ecological problems. Ozone harms crops and trees. These harms affect ecosystems and future generations. Similarly, particulate precursors, including nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, contribute to acid rain, which is not easily reversible. To address these problems, Agenda 21 recommends the adoption of national programs to reduce health risks from air pollution, including urban air pollution. 19 These programs are to include development of &quot;appropriate pollution control technology . . . for the introduction of environmentally sound production processes.&quot; 20 It calls for this development &quot;on the basis of risk assessment and epidemiological research.&quot; It also recommends development of &quot;air pollution control capacities in large cities emphasizing enforcement programs using monitoring networks as appropriate.&quot; A second principle, the precautionary principle, provides support for the first. As stated in the Rio Declaration, the precautionary principle means that &quot;lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation&quot; when &quot;there are threats of serious or irreversible damage.&quot; Thus, lack of complete certainty about the adverse environmental and human health effects of air pollutants does not, by itself, provide a reason for tolerating them. Put differently, governments need to address air pollution on a precautionary basis to ensure that humans can life a healthy and productive life.<br />

Cold Fusion<br />
A. Fusion leads to ultra-powerful lasers <br />
ANS 08, American nuclear society (“Fusion Energy” June 2008 , <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps12-bi.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps12-bi.pdf</a>. Background for Position Statement 12)<br />
There is broad international interest in fast ignition, where a superintense laser beam is used to trigger ignition. If successful, fast ignition promises improved target performance and power plant economics. Duplicating the conditions of stars on Earth in order to realize controlled fusion energy will require complex and expensive machinery. The fusion energy program supports progress in advanced structural and high-heat-flux materials, superconducting magnets, powerful laser and particle beams, power-conversion apparatus, advanced computers, robotics, and other applications. It is important to develop power plant design concepts that minimize the construction, operating, maintenance, and decommissioning costs to ensure that electricity generation by fusion will be economically competitive. The present studies of magnetic and inertial fusion power plants show that with continued success in improving the physics performance of fusion experiments and developing the required technologies, fusion has the potential to provide mankind with a very long-term energy source that is both economically competitive with other long-term options and has many safety and environmental advantages. <br />
<br />
B. Powerful lasers end humanity <br />
Marshal 05 - Professor and internationally recognized expert on laser and light bio-effects in the field of ophthalmology (John l “A Horrifying New Laser Weapon That the World Should Ban Now” APRIL 12, 1995. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/1995/04/12/edmar.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/1995/04/12/edmar.php</a>. Herald Tribune.)<br />
GENEVA: In the next few years a new and horrifying weapon could begin appearing on the world's battlefields: blinding laser weapons. In the United States, more than 1,100 small laser rifles are said to have been field tested. The Pentagon reportedly considered, but fortunately ruled out, the deployment of anti-personnel lasers among the new &quot;nonlethal&quot; weapons it recently sent to Somalia to cover the withdrawal of United Nations forces. Once these small laser weapons are produced on a large scale, they will probably cost less than an ordinary rifle, and their proliferation among terrorists and other criminals is to be expected. Until now most applications of laser technology have served humanity. Lasers are used in communication, civil engineering, home entertainment and commerce. Their use in medical diagnosis and surgery have enabled treatments that would previously have been unthinkable. It could be argued that even in the military arena their introduction has had a beneficial effect by making some weapons, such as &quot;smart bombs,&quot; more discriminatory. However, the very properties that make lasers so useful in eye surgery are exploitable as offensive anti-personnel weapons. Because it concentrates light falling on its surface, the human eye is extremely vulnerable to damage from high intensity lights. It is sad and repugnant that some would consider turning the scientific advances created by lasers into a device to be used to blind human beings. Portable laser rifles, or even small lasers clipped onto normal rifles, could emit invisible and silent beams of pulsed optical radiation.L Victims would not realize they were under attack until it was too late; they could be permanently blinded in less than two-millionths of a second. Potential victims would not have to look directly into such laser beams; blindness could be caused by hemorrhages created by a beam entering the eye obliquely. Although there are goggles that protect against any laser emitting a single wavelength, it is relatively simple to design an anti-personnel laser that can fire a variety of wavelengths. Goggles that protect against several wavelengths would be extremely dense and those that protect against all wavelengths would be opaque.L Goggles that protect against all laser wavelengths have proved impossible to design. Some claim that the laser rifles can be used to inflict only temporary blindness. But it is impossible to design a laser that can only temporarily blind or dazzle. A laser that could dazzle toward the end of its range would inevitably cause permanent blindness nearer the source. Aiming for temporary blindness under battlefield conditions appears impossible. Such blindness, particularly at a young age, is not just another injury. There is no prosthesis for a destroyed retina. The instantaneous blinding of young people inevitably results in severe depression and frequently in suicidal tendencies. Rehabilitation for the blind is always a slow, demanding and extremely costly process. Based on extensive consultations with military, medical and technical experts, the International Committee of the Red Cross has concluded that blinding in warfare should be outlawed under international humanitarian law, and it is heading a campaign to achieve this. Its appeal has been supported by 25 countries that favor the adoption of a prohibition on the use of lasers intentionally to blind when governments meet in Vienna in September to review the 1980 UN Conference on Excessively Injurious Conventional Weapons. The assembly of the World Health Organization, which convenes in Geneva in May, should also call for a ban on blinding weapons on the basis that they abuse medical knowledge for an inhumane purpose and, if used, will divert scarce health resources. For once, the international community has the opportunity to outlaw the use and prevent the proliferation of an abhorrent form of warfare before the genie is out of the bottle. If, on the other hand, governments are unwilling or unable to deal with the threat of blinding weapons now, the chances of humanity surviving the challenges of the next century are slim.<br />

3. Wave Power<br />
A. Water power devices are only useful in water closer than 2 km and will hurt whale habitat. <br />
Global Energy Partners 04 (LLC, Offshore Wave Power in the US: Environmental Issues, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://oceanenergy.epri.com/attachments/wave/reports/007_Wave_Envr_Issues_Rpt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://oceanenergy.epri.com/attachments/wave/reports/007_Wave_Envr_Issues_Rpt.pdf</a>)<br />
Any wave power ant that can be sited more than 4 kin offshore will have virtually no impact on gray whale migration, provided that construction activities which cross their path (seafloor surveys, laying of submarine power cables) are carried out at times of the year when whales are not migrating. Such activities would almost certainly be carried out in calm-weather months (July through September), so interference should not occur. As mentioned earlier, caisson-based plants are only economical in water depths less than 20 in, which generally lie within 2 km of shore along PG&amp;E's service area. Installation of such devices may involve destruction of the kelp forest refuge for northbound mother calf pairs. Furthermore, if the noise emissions from wave energy conversion machinery are perceived as threatening, the whales may give the ant a wide berth. Gray whales have readily acclimated to the noise of offshore oil production platforms, however, which are often used by human observers to watch the migrations &quot;'.<br />
<br />
B. Whales key to world’s ecosystem. <br />
Burns 97 (William C., North American Chapter of Green Life Society, Colorado Journal of International Law and Policy, Volume 8, Winter, 82-3)<br />
The preservation of whales benefits the world community in a number of ways. Recent research indicates that whales are an important component of the world's ecosystem. For example, in the North Pacific, squid consume large quantities of commercially exploitable species of fish. The prodigious consumption of large quantities of squid by sperm whales lowers the squid population, thus releasing more fish for commercial exploitation. The feces of cetaceans may also play an important role in the promotion of nutrient cycling in the diphotic zones of oceans. Additionally, several other marine species engage in what may constitute a mutualistic or commensal relationship with cetaceans. The decline or extinction of certain cetacean species may disturb the delicate balance that helps these other species survive. Finally, long-term monitoring of whale populations may aid ocean researchers in detecting significant changes in marine ecosystems produced by human activities. To give just two examples: 1) radio tags which are mounted on a highly migratory whale species and which telemeter to a satellite may constitute a relatively cheap means of collecting basic oceanographic data from remote ocean areas; 2) sperm whales . . . constitute virtually our only means of monitoring such major abyssal taxa as the squid species on which they feed. The protection of whales also helps us to promote what one author has termed &quot;biophyllic values,&quot; defined as an abiding respect for life and a recognition of the need for responsible social action.<br />

C. Loss of marine biodiversity causes extinction<br />
Agardy 1 [Tundi, internationally renowned expert on marine conservation, specializing in marine protected areas and coastal planning and previous senior director for the Global Marine Program at Conservation International a global environmental organization; Copyright 2001 WGBH Educational Foundation and Clear Blue Sky Productions Inc., <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/extinction/massext/statement_01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/extinction/massext/statement_01.html</a>] <br />
<br />
Many marine ecologists would agree we are indeed facing an extinction crisis. This may surprise those who view the seas as vast and immutable -- the one great constant in an ever-changing world. But while there are remote ocean areas that remain relatively pristine, most coastal areas have undergone a radical human-induced transformation in the last 100 years. The marine extinction crisis is not as widely grasped as the crises in tropical forests and other terrestrial biomes. Though the number of marine extinctions is small, this is due to our state of knowledge. First, the bulk of marine species are undiscovered -- we are losing species before we even know of them. Second, the species label itself does not work well for marine organisms -- here unique populations are at risk, not entire species (the U.S. placing certain runs of salmon on the endangered species list exemplifies this). As with species extinction, the devastation of genetically unique populations is an irreversible biodiversity loss. Marine biodiversity is reduced by both over-exploitation of living resources and the much more insidious and dangerous loss of habitat. Nearly three-quarters of the world's commercially fished stocks are overharvested and at risk. At the same time, habitat loss is a chronic and much more acute problem, with grave consequences for marine life and the entire biosphere. The most ecologically essential habitats -- estuaries, wetlands, shallow water seagrasses, and coral reefs -- are most threatened. Thirty percent of the world's mangrove forests and nearly half the world's coral reefs have been lost due to direct habitat destruction. Many of the remaining critical marine habitats are indirectly degraded by pollution, freshwater diversion, and climate change. As human population pressures grow, essential ecological services and species are affected, leading to conditions in which the planet's vital organs can serve neither nature nor us.<br />

4. Solar Power <br />
A. Scientists will use solar power to develop satellites and try to control the weather.<br />
Hoffman 04, principal scientist Atmospheric and Environmental Research<br />
&lt;Ross 10/1/2004, Scientific America, Controlling Hurricanes Can hurricanes and other severe tropical storms be moderated or deflected?&gt;<br />
Our team plans to conduct experiments in which we will calculate the precise pattern and strength of atmospheric heating needed to moderate hurricane intensity or alter its track. Undoubtedly, the energy required to do so would be huge, but an array of earth-orbiting solar power stations could eventually be used to supply sufficient energy. These power-generating satellites might use giant mirrors to focus sunlight on solar cells and then beam the collected energy down to microwave receivers on the ground. Current designs for space solar power stations would radiate microwaves at frequencies that pass through the atmosphere without heating it, so as to not waste energy. For weather control, however, tuning the microwave downlink to frequencies better absorbed by water vapor could heat different levels in the atmosphere as desired. Because raindrops strongly absorb microwaves, parts of the hurricane inside and beneath rain clouds would be shielded and so could not be heated in this way. <br />
<br />
B. These experiments will destroy the planet<br />
Begich 96, editor of Earthpulse Flashpoints, Doctor<br />

Voices expressing various levels of concern are being heard in many countries. For example, in contrast with the cautiously-worded comment of Dr. Bertell, a Germany-based researcher in the field of quantum electrodynamics, Al Zielinski, paints an apocalyptic word-picture. (He says HAARP technology could trigger a disaster with a global impact - electromagnetic waves causing destruction &quot;when interacting with protective layers of the earth and its gravitational field&quot;.) The ionosphere seems very far away, but even when undisturbed by humans it affects our everyday lives. For example, radio broadcasts are bounced off this electrically charged layer which lies between forty and six hundred miles above the surface of the earth, just above the ozone layer. The ionosphere is alive with electrical activity, so much so that its processes are &quot;non-linear&quot;. This means that the ionosphere is dynamic, and its reactions to experiments are unpredictable. The concept of non-linear is important in understanding the concerns of independent scientists who are knowledgeable about advanced physics and who warn against brash high-energy experiments on the ionosphere. Non-linear processes can change suddenly and unexpectedly, or they can increase in power dramatically. Some theorists such as Zielinski say that a non-linear process can under certain conditions tap into the background energy of space, which is also called &quot;zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum&quot;.<br />

Middle Eastern Conflict won’t escalate<br />
<br />
A. No regional spillover <br />

<br />
Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in which they are not directly involved. The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq. The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars. But given its experience with ambiguous conflicts, the region has also developed an intuitive ability to contain its civil strife and prevent local conflicts from enveloping the entire Middle East.<br />
<br />
B. No global spillover <br />
Dr. Gwynne Dyer (lecturer on international affairs) October 21 2001 “The World Turned Upside Down?”, International Affairs, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://peernet.lbpc.ca/thelink/102502/04IntAffDyer.html" rel="nofollow">http://peernet.lbpc.ca/thelink/102502/04IntAffDyer.html</a><br />
<br />
How bad could it get? Very bad.&quot; Yet Dyer concluded by pointing out a number of significantly positive indications: that the terrorists are probably not going to succeed in stampeding the Americans into any truly stupid reaction; that direct physical threat from terrorism was statistically less of a threat than smoking (though over-reaction to terrorism could pose a threat to civil liberties); and that the conflict in the Middle East is likely to stay confined to the region because the connections outward have been dismantled. Most significantly, he explained, the larger trends are promising in that &quot;there are no enemies among the Great Powers. World War III has been cancelled.&quot; The number of democratic countries has doubled in the lifetime of our Pearson College students, and &quot;democratic countries don’t fight wars with each other.&quot; A kind of global culture of values has been emerging. Things are actually changing for the better.<br />

Middle eastern instability promotes global nuclear power use<br />
Marvin Cetron (President of Forecasting International) and Owen Daniels (Former Senior Editor of Omni Magazine) 2007 “Worst-Case Scenario: the Middle East,” The Futurist<br />
<br />
That leaves the matter of oil. The Middle East produces nearly 31 percent of the world’s oil and consumes only one-fifth of its own output. About two-thirds of the petroleum used in the United States is imported. Perhaps one-fourth of that—around one-sixth of total consumption—comes from the Middle East. Japan imports all its oil, most of from the Middle East. Europe, India, and China all depend, to greater or lesser degrees, on Middle Eastern oil. If something disrupts the flow of almost one-third of the world’s oil, as a major war in the Middle East inevitably would, the cost of energy in the throughout the world will soar. This is a recipe for prolonged recession, and perhaps even depression, in the United States and most of its trading partners. In the short run, healing the American economy would mean accepting measures that many Americans would prefer to avoid. The United States could wind up competing with China for oil in totalitarian states that Washington currently shuns. It also might use its intelligence agencies to promote more favorable policies in Venezuela. Tapping the oil reserves beneath the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve becomes a given in this scenario. To prevent needless environmental damage, drilling would be limited to the winter, when the ground is rock-hard. In addition, the oil would be transported through double-walled pipelines to prevent spills. The pristine Alaskan environment still would suffer, but this concern would no longer prevent drilling. The West Coast also would be opened to drilling, though at distances beyond 20 miles from the beaches, not 10, as the law currently requires. The risk of environmental damage here too would be considered an acceptable price for economic survival. Less controversially, the U.S. surely would buy still more oil from Canada, where a significant new field has recently been discovered, and would develop the deep-water deposits under the Gulf of Mexico much faster than anyone now plans. The United States also needs at least seven new atomic power plants to meet its current and future demand for electricity. An energy crisis finally would break the country’s de facto ban on new reactors, allowing the construction of at least those seven. These first generating stations would use safe hot- water reactors. Even safer technologies lie further in the future, and they are likely to be adopted once they become available. Expanding the use of atomic energy of course means finding somewhere to put still more nuclear waste. This is not a technological problem, so much as a political one. The ideal hiding place for atomic waste was recognized almost as soon as anyone considered the problem. The salt domes of Louisiana have been geologically stable and free of water for hundreds of millions of years; if they had not been, water would long since have washed the salt away. Nuclear waste could safely be stored in one of them until it decayed to the level of background radiation. However, thanks to Louisiana’s political power decades ago, the law forbids consideration of any depository other than the Yucca Mountain site now being developed by the Atomic Energy Agency. In an energy emergency, that law is likely to be rescinded and the country will finally do the obvious. Nuclear waste will be buried in salt domes and forgotten. We can expect a much stronger push for alternative energy as well. Given the proper incentives—and a world oil shortage seems likely to qualify—solar, wind, and other renewable power technologies already have proved useful. Germany, where cloudy days are common, is home to 15 of the world’s largest photovoltaic power plants. The American Southwest would be a much more cost-efficient place to collect solar power. Add in expanded use of wind power where it is most available, perhaps some wave energy on the coasts, and a much stronger effort to develop biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol, and alternative energy stands a good chance of helping out if Middle Eastern oil suddenly becomes unavailable. Yet it will not be available immediately, and it will replace all the energy now coming from the Middle East. <br />
<br />
That solves proliferation<br />
Shaun Waterman (UPI Homeland and National Security Editor) 7/8/2008 “Report urges U.S. to embrace nuclear power growth, despite risks”, UPI<br />
<br />
WASHINGTON, July 8 (UPI) -- A report from a State Department advisory panel says a coming large expansion in global nuclear power generation poses proliferation risks, but the United States must embrace it to ensure that nuclear supplier nations build safeguards into the growing market. The report highlights division among experts about the future of civil nuclear power across the globe, the risks it poses, and the degree to which U.S. policy should support its spread. Some critics of the report say the expansion of nuclear power is not inevitable and should be resisted. A task force of the International Security Advisory Board -- chaired by former Pentagon and World Bank official Paul Wolfowitz -- produced the report, titled &quot;Proliferation Implications of the Global Expansion of Civil Nuclear Power,&quot; in response to a request from Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Robert Joseph. The task force, led by former Reagan and Bush I arms negotiator and government scientist C. Paul Robinson, produced their relatively brief (10 pages, with about twice that in appendices and introductory material) report in just two months earlier this year. A copy was posted recently on the State Department Web site. The report says global demand for power is likely to rise by 100 percent by 2030. &quot;Nuclear energy is likely to be in great demand because of the large price increases for oil and natural gas and the fact that nuclear power produces no carbon (or other) emissions.&quot; Robinson bluntly says the expansion of civil nuclear energy generation is not just inevitable, it is already under way. &quot;You just have to read the newspapers to see that this is the case,&quot; he told United Press International. The report cites a list prepared by the State Department in 2007 of a dozen countries planning to join the nuclear power club, or &quot;giving serious consideration&quot; to it, within the next 10 years -- including the former Soviet Central Asian nations of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan; Islamic giants Indonesia, Egypt and Turkey; and Poland and the Baltic states. Fifteen other nations -- including Algeria, Ghana, Libya, Malaysia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen -- have &quot;longer-term plans or studies under way,&quot; according to the State Department list. While wealthier countries &quot;can try to buy their way out&quot; of the looming energy crunch, &quot;the Third World does not have that option,&quot; and there are few real alternatives to nuclear power for many countries. &quot;There has proved to be no silver bullet in renewable or other alternative energy sources.&quot; The report says there are currently 435 nuclear reactors operating around the world, with 28 new ones currently under construction. It says 222 more are being planned. &quot;It's a pretty depressing prospect,&quot; Robinson concluded. One of the key concerns is the two principal ways of making nuclear fuel -- the enrichment of uranium, for instance, in huge installations of centrifuges; and the reprocessing of spent fuel into plutonium -- can too easily be used to make weapons-grade material for nuclear bombs. So the panel recommends the United States -- in partnership with other countries that already have the capacity to make fuel, the &quot;supplier nations&quot; -- volunteer to &quot;provide reliable, economical supplies of fuel to nations undertaking new or additional nuclear energy plants&quot; with tough safeguards to prevent them developing their own capacities. But critics challenge their premise, saying the idea that the growth of nuclear power generation is inevitable is a canard. Many of those 435 reactors currently operating are due to be retired in the next 20 to 30 years, points out Henry Sokolski, a proliferation expert who worked for Wolfowitz in the Bush I administration and now sits on the congressionally mandated blue-ribbon panel examining the threat of terrorist attacks using nuclear material or other weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear energy is too expensive and too risky to be a commercially viable venture without government support, he told UPI. &quot;There's a reason no one in the private sector wants to do this with their own money,&quot; Sokolski said. &quot;Nuclear power is a hard sell, literally. ... What the (U.S.) nuclear industry is doing is asking for government handouts, in the form of tax credits, loan guarantees and insurance caps.&quot; Reprocessing is also not economically feasible without government financial support. &quot;Working with plutonium requires special safety measures which are very expensive,&quot; Sokolski said. The idea that new technologies could help make generation or reprocessing economical is &quot;atomic pie in the sky. The advances required are as far off as making fusion-generation practical, in terms of technology.&quot; Expansion is &quot;not inevitable, it is contingent&quot; on U.S. policy changes. &quot;Maybe nuclear power won't expand. It shrank by 2 percent last year,&quot; he said. Sokolski called the report &quot;disappointing.&quot; He said its authors &quot;seem to be in the business of promoting the expansion of nuclear power, rather than examining the risks associated with its expansion. ... They should have explained in more detail why we should be concerned.&quot; But the report does make a bald statement, that the expansion of civil nuclear generating capacity &quot;particularly within Third World nations, inevitably increases the risks of proliferation. What the United States must do,&quot; it concludes, &quot;is find ways to mitigate those risks.&quot; &quot;Something is afoot, and we can't put on blinkers and pretend it's not happening,&quot; said Robinson.<br />

Extinction<br />

First, the dynamics of getting to a highly proliferated world could be very dangerous. Proliferating states will feel great pressures to obtain nuclear weapons and delivery systems before any potential opponent does. Those who succeed in outracing an opponent may consider preemptive nuclear war before the opponent becomes capable of nuclear retaliation. Those who lag behind might try to preempt their opponent's nuclear programme or defeat the opponent using conventional forces. And those who feel threatened but are incapable of building nuclear weapons may still be able to join in this arms race by building other types of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological weapons. Second, as the world approaches complete proliferation, the hazards posed by nuclear weapons today will be magnified many times over. Fifty or more nations capable of launching nuclear weapons means that the risk of nuclear accidents that could cause serious damage not only to their own populations and environments, but those of others, is hugely increased. The chances of such weapons falling into the hands of renegade military units or terrorists is far greater, as is the number of nations carrying out hazardous manufacturing and storage activities. Increased prospects for the occasional nuclear shootout Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be more frequent opportunities for the use of nuclear weapons. And more frequent opportunities means shorter expected times between conflicts in which nuclear weapons get used, unless the probability of use at any opportunity is actually zero. To be sure, some theorists on nuclear deterrence appear to think that in any confrontation between two states known to have reliable nuclear capabilities, the probability of nuclear weapons being used is zero.' These theorists think that such states will be so fearful of escalation to nuclear war that they would always avoid or terminate confrontations between them, short of even conventional war. They believe this to be true even if the two states have different cultures or leaders with very eccentric personalities. History and human nature, however, suggest that they are almost surely wrong. History includes instances in which states known to possess nuclear weapons did engage in direct conventional conflict. China and Russia fought battles along their common border even after both had nuclear weapons. Moreover, logic suggests that if states with nuclear weapons always avoided conflict with one another, surely states without nuclear weapons would avoid conflict with states that had them. Again, history provides counter-examples. Egypt attacked Israel in 1973 even though it saw Israel as a nuclear power at the time. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and fought Britain's efforts to take them back, even though Britain had nuclear weapons. Those who claim that two states with reliable nuclear capabilities to devastate each other will not engage in conventional conflict risking nuclear war also assume that any leader from any culture would not choose suicide for his nation. But history provides unhappy examples of states whose leaders were ready to choose suicide for themselves and their fellow citizens. Hitler tried to impose a 'victory or destruction' policy on his people as Nazi Germany was going down to defeat.' And Japan's war minister, during debates on how to respond to the American atomic bombing, suggested 'Would it not be wondrous for the whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful flower?&quot; If leaders are willing to engage in conflict with nuclear-armed nations, use of nuclear weapons in any particular instance may not be likely, but its probability would still be dangerously significant. In particular, human nature suggests that the threat of retaliation with nuclear weapons is not a reliable guarantee against a disastrous first use of these weapons. While national leaders and their advisors everywhere are usually talented and experienced people, even their most important decisions cannot be counted on to be the product of well-informed and thorough assessments of all options from all relevant points of view. This is especially so when the stakes are so large as to defy assessment and there are substantial pressures to act quickly, as could be expected in intense and fast-moving crises between nuclear-armed states .6 Instead, like other human beings, national leaders can be seduced by wishful thinking. They can misinterpret the words or actions of opposing leaders. Their advisors may produce answers that they think the leader wants to hear, or coalesce around what they know is an inferior decision because the group urgently needs the confidence or the sharing of responsibility that results from settling on something. Moreover, leaders may not recognise clearly where their personal or party interests diverge from those of their citizens. Under great stress, human beings can lose their ability to think carefully. They can refuse to believe that the worst could really happen, oversimplify the problem at hand, think in terms of simplistic analogies and play hunches. The intuitive rules for how individuals should respond to insults or signs of weakness in an opponent may too readily suggest a rash course of action. Anger, fear, greed, ambition and pride can all lead to bad decisions. The desire for a decisive solution to the problem at hand may lead to an unnecessarily extreme course of action. We can almost hear the kinds of words that could flow from discussions in nuclear crises or war. 'These people are not willing to die for this interest'. 'No sane person would actually use such weapons'. 'Perhaps the opponent will back down if we show him we mean business by demonstrating a willingness to use nuclear weapons'. 'If I don't hit them back really hard, I am going to be driven from office, if not killed'. Whether right or wrong, in the stressful atmosphere of a nuclear crisis or war, such words from others, or silently from within, might resonate too readily with a harried leader. Thus, both history and human nature suggest that nuclear deterrence can be expected to fail from time to time, and we are fortunate it has not happened yet. But the threat of nuclear war is not just a matter of a few weapons being used. It could get much worse. Once a conflict reaches the point where nuclear weapons are employed, the stresses felt by the leaderships would rise enormously. These stresses can be expected to further degrade their decision-making. The pressures to force the enemy to stop fighting or to surrender could argue for more forceful and decisive military action, which might be the right thing to do in the circumstances, but maybe not. And the horrors of the carnage already suffered may be seen as justification for visiting the most devastating punishment possible on the enemy.' Again, history demonstrates how intense conflict can lead the combatants to escalate violence to the maximum possible levels. In the Second World War, early promises not to bomb cities soon gave way to essentially indiscriminate bombing of civilians. The war between Iran and Iraq during the 1980s led to the use of chemical weapons on both sides and exchanges of missiles against each other's cities. And more recently, violence in the Middle East escalated in a few months from rocks and small arms to heavy weapons on one side, and from police actions to air strikes and armoured attacks on the other. Escalation of violence is also basic human nature. Once the violence starts, retaliatory exchanges of violent acts can escalate to levels unimagined by the participants beforehand.' Intense and blinding anger is a common response to fear or humiliation or abuse. And such anger can lead us t0 impose on our opponents whatever levels of violence are readily accessible. In sum, widespread proliferation is likely to lead to an occasional shoot-out with nuclear weapons, and that such shoot-outs will have a substantial probability of escalating to the maximum destruction possible with the weapons at hand. Unless nuclear proliferation is stopped, we are headed toward a world that will mirror the American Wild West of the late 1800s. With most, if not all, nations wearing nuclear 'six-shooters' on their hips, the world may even be a more polite place than it is today, but every once in a while we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations.<br />

B. Warming – Middle East instability leads to renewable energy incentives<br />

<br />
Moreover, I agree with you that we must find alternatives to oil by investing in new technologies to produce safe, clean, reliable, efficient and inexpensive fuels here at home. The recent high cost of oil and the instability in the Middle East should provide the political will and financial incentive to do just that. In fact, just this week, I sent my policy director Vince Haley on a bio-renewable fuels fact-finding mission in the Midwest.<br />

And oil prices spur the transition – solves warming<br />
Steve Yetiv (professor of political science and international studies at Old Dominion University) February 6 2006 “America benefits from high oil prices,” San Diego Union-Tribune, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060206/news_mz1e6yetiv.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060206/news_mz1e6yetiv.html</a><br />
<br />
In particular, what can high oil prices do that America's energy policy fails to do? First, sooner or later, high oil prices spur the development of alternative energy resources because they make it more profitable to produce them. The higher prices go, the more entrepreneurs and companies around the world work to move us beyond the hazardous petroleum era. Second, the higher oil prices go, the more likely automakers will mass-produce more efficient, less pricey vehicles. That is precisely what we need to shift the current oil-guzzling paradigm. A joint report by the Transportation Research Institute's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan and the Natural Resources Defense Council shows that higher oil prices will hurt America's top automakers by decreasing sales of SUVs and pickup trucks. The report calls on them to make fuel efficient vehicles their top priority to better the country and their bottom line. Most automakers are experimenting with fuel cell vehicles that run on hydrogen rather than oil. They are also selling 2005 hybrid vehicles that run on an internal combustion engine, as do conventional cars, plus an electric motor. Depending on the car, they yield between 10 percent and 50 percent better gas mileage than regular vehicles, and far better mileage than the ubiquitous SUV. But hybrids represent a drop in the market bucket, because automakers have so far made their profits by mass-producing less efficient, money-making vehicles. And fuel cell vehicles aren't expected to reach the market until 2010. High oil prices are an incentive for making efficient vehicles on a mass, affordable scale, and sooner rather than later. Third, high oil prices make consumers less likely to waste gas and more likely to buy hybrids. In Europe, high gas prices – roughly double that in the United States – have led to mass adoption of hybrids. Investment banking firm Goldman Sachs predicts that gas prices would have to hit $4.30 a gallon in the United States to change the gas-guzzling culture. But it is better to see the impact as relative to price. Fourth, high oil prices benefit the environment. Indeed, one study has shown that a broad energy tax on carbon content in fuels would reduce oil use and carbon emissions by over 10 percent. For that matter, vehicles that run on fuel cells emit only water and heat as waste, and hybrids emit more limited emissions than conventional vehicles. Since carbon emissions cause global warming – a scientific fact rather than science fiction – we should tip our hats to high oil prices, in this respect. Fifth, high oil prices are raising consciousness about the hazards of the oil era. Ninety-three percent of Americans believe that oil dependence is a serious problem. Although they still act like oil is an entitlement, pricey oil may lead them eventually to put pressure on politicians to move toward greater oil independence, as reflected perhaps in President Bush's speech. Of course, higher oil prices are painful. But, over time they can serve the environment, decrease our dependence on Middle East oil, especially from countries like Iran which uses oil money to build nuclear capability and force us to take actions that make us less vulnerable when oil starts to dwindle in the future.<br />

Extnction<br />
Oliver Tickell (Climate Researcher) August 11 2008 “On a planet 4C hotter, all we can prepare for is extinction”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/climatechange</a>)<br />

We need to get prepared for four degrees of global warming, Bob Watson told the Guardian last week. At first sight this looks like wise counsel from the climate science adviser to Defra. But the idea that we could adapt to a 4C rise is absurd and dangerous. Global warming on this scale would be a catastrophe that would mean, in the immortal words that Chief Seattle probably never spoke, &quot;the end of living and the beginning of survival&quot; for humankind. Or perhaps the beginning of our extinction. The collapse of the polar ice caps would become inevitable, bringing long-term sea level rises of 70-80 metres. All the world's coastal plains would be lost, complete with ports, cities, transport and industrial infrastructure, and much of the world's most productive farmland. The world's geography would be transformed much as it was at the end of the last ice age, when sea levels rose by about 120 metres to create the Channel, the North Sea and Cardigan Bay out of dry land. Weather would become extreme and unpredictable, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods and hurricanes. The Earth's carrying capacity would be hugely reduced. Billions would undoubtedly die. Watson's call was supported by the government's former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, who warned that &quot;if we get to a four-degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase&quot;. This is a remarkable understatement. The climate system is already experiencing significant feedbacks, notably the summer melting of the Arctic sea ice. The more the ice melts, the more sunshine is absorbed by the sea, and the more the Arctic warms. And as the Arctic warms, the release of billions of tonnes of methane – a greenhouse gas 70 times stronger than carbon dioxide over 20 years – captured under melting permafrost is already under way. To see how far this process could go, look 55.5m years to the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, when a global temperature increase of 6C coincided with the release of about 5,000 gigatonnes of carbon into the atmosphere, both as CO2 and as methane from bogs and seabed sediments. Lush subtropical forests grew in polar regions, and sea levels rose to 100m higher than today. It appears that an initial warming pulse triggered other warming processes. Many scientists warn that this historical event may be analogous to the present: the warming caused by human emissions could propel us towards a similar hothouse Earth.
