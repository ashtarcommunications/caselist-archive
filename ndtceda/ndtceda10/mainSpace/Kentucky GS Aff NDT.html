<strong>Plan: the United States federal government should no longer consider terror grounds in determining eligibility for employment-based visas, temporary worker visas, family based visas, and trafficking-based visas.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Terror and security related grounds make aliens ineligible to receive visas</strong><br />

(“Immigration: Terrorist Grounds for Exclusion and Removal of Aliens,” Congressional Research Service, January 22, 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P4306.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P4306.pdf</a>)<br />

<strong>The visa regime exists to rein in the threat the mobile migrant represents – the process creates categories of migrants and eligibility for immigration is determined by the exclusion of risky migrants - the ultimate outcome renders ALL applicants as potential risks to be managed</strong><br />
Mark B. <strong>Salter</strong>, Professor of in the School of Political Studies @ the University of Ottawa, <strong>2006</strong> (“The Global Visa Regime and the Political Technologies of the International Self: Borders, Bodies, Biopolitics,” Alternatives, 31, 167-189)<br />
The visa is a necessary supplement AND norm of regularly occurring fraud.4<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Moreover, the threshold to deny visas is constantly lowered because of security and terror grounds</strong><br />
Ruth Ellen <strong>Wasem</strong>, Specialist in Immigration Policy, <strong>2010</strong> “Immigration Visa Issuances and Grounds for Exclusion: Policy and Trends,” March 10, 2010, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?bc=1016" rel="nofollow">http://www.aila.org/content/default.aspx?bc=1016</a>|6730|16872|31687]<br />

<strong>Advantage 1: Interest Convergence</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The debate surrounding immigration is never complete- they are merely snap-shots controlled by risk managers to describe an always incomplete picture of reality based on the anticipation of future threats; however, this coupling of security and immigration highlights the exact moment where security interest converge with immigrants bartering for ground are constantly taken back to justify never-ending violence</strong><br />
<strong>Bigo 2002 /</strong>Didier, Visiting professor of War Studies @ King’s College, “Security and immigration: Toward a critique of the governmentality of unease,” Alternatives, January-March/<br />
Securitization of immigration is the result AND one of chaos and urban insecurity.<br />
<br />
<strong>The ability to control the flow of information and situation of immigrants forces the same the same rigged bargain as the postwar Civil Right Compromise: The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of action is accepting the current terms of debate which means that the official solutions elites and reformists advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.</strong><br />

In 1946, the Luce-AND the post-Civil Rights era.<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus—those moments of victory are taken back—coopted in exchange for minority support of elite policy demands that cannot last. The most resistant elements of movements will either be bought off or brutally suppressed</strong><br />
<strong>Delgado</strong> – Law Professor @ University of Colorado-Boulder – <strong>2002</strong><br />
(Richard, “Explaining the Rise and Fall of African American Fortunes: Interest Convergence and Civil Rights Gains,” Review of Mary L. Dudziak, Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy, Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, Volume 37 [37 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 369], pp. 369-387 at 376-7) jfs<br />
Dudziak impressively demonstrates that Brown AND Civil Rights movement was largely lost.<br />
<br />
<strong>Scenarios surrounding immigration are always lodged in the framing of worst-case-scenarios because it is trapped in a way that always makes them the objects of violence-- risk NECESSARILY fixes their position as scientifically and objectively always already the targets of bombs</strong><br />
Rey <strong>Chow</strong>, Humanities and Modern Culture &amp; Media Studies at Brown University, <strong>2006</strong> (The Age of the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative Work, 40-1)<br />
Often under the modest apparently innocuous AND the problem of the vanishing object.”<br />
<br />
<strong>This process of securitization then becomes a perpetual fear that needs to be managed and solved--New dangers are always lurking around the corner and new threats can manifest themselves in any person</strong><br />
Marieke <strong>De Goede</strong>, April <strong>2008</strong> (Department of European Studies, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. “Beyond Risk: Premediation and the Post-9/11 Security Imagination” Security Dialogue Vol. 39, no. 2-3)<br />
Premediation is a promising term to AND can only speculate’ (emphasis added).<br />
<br />
<strong>Solvency</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>So, we step back. We must problematize security’s hold on immigration to challenge the risk managers AND the bleeding heart’s solution to a problem that maybe doesn’t exist. The 1AC is new discursive understanding of migration that opens up new ways of for challenging the project of security.</strong><br />
