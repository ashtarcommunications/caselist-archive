<span class="Underline">One of the central tents of critical….ironies are apparent here, as I will illustrate. </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Interest convergence accounts for the material context of the 1960’s civil rights gains---only our framework consistently excplains the ups and downs of minority empowerment by identifying the implicit bargain between concessions from government elites and the ideological support of black communities </span></strong></span><br />

<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our political economy examines the ballot as a moment of interest convergence—First between the 1ac and the structures of white supremacy and Second between the aff team and the judge </span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"> </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">First. The 1ac makes the same bargain as the post war Civil Right compromise:</span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For the structure s of white supremacy, racial equity is not an end in and of itself—The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of the plan is accepting the current terms of American nationalism which means that tehe official antiracism they advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital. </span></strong></span><br />

<span class="Underline">It is important to note that…blind to global capitalism as a race issue </span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And interest convergence acts as a safety valve for white elites to defuse the possibility of black revolutoion</span></strong></span><br />

<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The ballot is also a moment of interest convergence between the Affirmative and the judge—this rhetorical alliance with alterity is a technology of political demand that repeats the strategic attitude of the system it seeks to overturn—the guilty solidarity of the 1ac masks the privilege that prevents the aff projectform directly changing the lives of the people they invoke to warrant a ballot</span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Chow 93</span></strong> (Rey, Writing Disapora: Tactic of Intervention in Contemporary Culutral Studies, p 16-17)</span><br />
<span class="Underline">Why are “tactics” useful at this…no less than in the academic sense?</span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">And within the aff project, the ballot functions as a politics of self-subalternization, where the judges are encouraged to found a vacuous solidarity with the aff other by valorizing the material deprivation portrayed in the 1ac</span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">C. interest divergence: </span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The interest convergence represented by the ballot is temporary at best—empiricallythe implicit bargain that grants empowerment in exchange for minority support of elite policy demands cannot last—the most resistant elements of movements will either be bought off or brutally suppressed, turning the case either way </span></strong></span><br />
<span class="Underline"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Delgado 02</span></strong> (Richard, “Explaining the Rise and Fall of African American Fortunes: Interest convergence and Civil Rights Gains” Review of Mary L.

Dudziak, <em>Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American Democracy,</em> Harvard Civil Rights—Civil Liberties Law Review, Volume 37 p. 369-387)</span><br />
“The Black Panther Party was…they were murdered while in their beds ”<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This logic repeats itself at the level of the judge: </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The aff’s chunky identity politics of the ballot collapse the real material difference between the positioning of the judge and the Aff team—their deployment of an undifferentiated posture of victimization is a technique for spotlighting the judge’s righteousness at the cost of robbing the terms of prtests of the complex oppositionality critical to rightful demands </span></strong><br />

 The moment of interest convergence engendered by the ballot produces a sort of compromise which places multiculturalism in the service of the dominant neoliberal order. Even if their advocacy arrives like a blot from the blue, it does not operate in a vacuum – multiculturalism naturalizes global inequality solidifies American neolib – the aff sutures official anti-racism to the raced history of citizenship in a way that silences challenges to the neoliberal order and reproduces fractured hierarchies of stigma and privilege in new and innovative ways<br />

Visa K 2NC cards<br />
<br />
The affirmative fundamentally misunderstands the problem of exclusion in relation to visas – the question and answer does not lie in terms quantifiable caps and exemptions for particular visas – it lies with the deeper question of using visas to maintain security both within the confines of the US and throughout the globe – certain groups of migrants become the targets and risky immigrants –the conflation within the 1AC between visas decisions and security considerations further the logic of risk management that leads to the extermination of risky migrant populations – populations that profiled along ethnic lines – instead of taking an approach like the 1AC, we should unpack the necessitate of the visa as in managing risk and the ways in which it justifies the exclusion of certain groups that are constructed as dangerous – only then can students mobility be reclaim as a positive expression of subjectivity <br />

<br />
Discourse of sex trafficking can be seen as an instance of the foundational crisis in modern state sovereignty. The plan is an opportunity for race and gender to be deployed as the authorization for state action to eliminate the symptoms of the larger critique without an engagement with the structural failures of these state institutions. The net result is to recuperate state legitimacy and defuse the larger symbolic threat. <br />

<br />
One of the central tenets of AND here, as I will illustrate.<br />
<br />
The 1AC makes the same bargain as the postwar Civil Right Compromise: For the structures of white supremacy, racial equity is not an end in and of itself ? The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of the plan is accepting the current terms of American nationalism which means that the official antiracism they advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.<br />

It is important to note that AND global capitalism as a race issue.<br />
<br />
B. Interest Divergence:<br />
<br />
The interest convergence represented by the ballot is temporary at best ? Empirically, the implicit bargain that grants empowerment in exchange for minority support of elite policy demands cannot last ? The most resistant elements of movements will either be bought off or brutally suppressed, turning the case either way.<br />

Salter 6 “The global Visa Regime” Alternatives 31<br />
The visa is a necessary supplement to the…regularly occurring fraud. <br />
<br />
Securitization of the migrant is about the discourse of security and the equation of the migrant with insurgencies – result is ethnic profiling <br />
Ibrahim 5 “The Securitization of Migration: A Racial Discourse”, International Migration 43.5<br />
The securitization of migration discourse has been…netlike exercise of power. <br />

Puar and Rai 4, The Remaking of a Model Minority, Social Text 22.3<br />
But perhaps most crucial is the very grammar involved…must exterminate the brutes. <br />
<br />
The alternative: Endorse the 1NC as a challenge to the global visa regime that justifies the securitization of the migrant. Only a total rejection of the exclusionary discourse of borders can address that make visas necessary in the first place. The middle ground the visa regime occupies in the global system of borders must be unpacked – scholars must investigate the way it organizes decisions over life and death <br />

The field of migration studies has been hamstrung…naked and hidden from view. <br />

<span class="underline">2NC OV</span><br />
The aff misunderstands the problem of exclusion in relation to visas – it’s not caps, it’s using visas to maintain security – certain groups get valued and others get devalued – instead of taking a risk management approach like the 1AC we should unpack the necessity of the visa in managing risk and its exclusions – only then can mobility be reclaimed as a positive expression of subjectivity <br />
