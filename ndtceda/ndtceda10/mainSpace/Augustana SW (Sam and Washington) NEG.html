The second piece...from prior years </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Exclude 'Citizens' CP</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The United States federal government should exempt non-nationals from the employment-visa quota and preference category system if they hold an advanced degree in science or technology from an accredited school in the United States. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The term ‘citizen’ is a dangerous attempt to define the boundaries of political communities – we should use the word ‘nationals’ instead in order to recognize the violent forms of exclusion that can come from definitions of ‘citizenship’.</span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Low or even...profits before people.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Placing the United States as the global hegemon allows us to assert genocidal rule across the globe in the drive to produce and exchange capital. The question is not one of abandoning growth – it is only a question of what type we use to replace capitalism</span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">‘A reprise in...mass of people.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">All of the Affirmative’s harms can be traced back to capitalism. Failure to reverse the current course towards endless production ensures the earth we become uninhabitable. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Rejecting capitalism is key to opening up new alternatives. Only daily acts of resistance are capable of moving us away from inevitable slavery and extinction imposed by endless reforms.</span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It is time...even to extinction.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Reform is an illusion – only unified class based resistance can challenge the role of capitalism as the root of immigration – backlash from elites only serves to intensify the capacity for solidarity.</span><br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Reformist groups...own class interests.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Even if the alternative doesn’t completely solve, you should still err on the side of the negative. Profit seeking will never make the world a better place, but every small act of refusal increases the chances that for radical transformation to succeed</span><br />
