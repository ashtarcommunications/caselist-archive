 They impact turn death by saying death isn't real / it's good. They say death renounces the Ego and lets us transcend from a physical life into a metaphysical form. They read a lot of Robert Lanza evidence to support the claim that organic life is but one form of consciousness, and the death of the body isn't the end of being.<br />

We should stop trying to put the world back together again. The inherent absurdity of our human condition—living towards our certain death—cannot be repaired or avoided. Attempts to rectify this inherent void at the center of all existence fail because complete absurdity is central to human being and thus accepting this absurdity must be your starting point for engaging in anything authentic.<br />
Park 06 (James, Philosophy Professor at the University of Minnesota, “Our Existential Predicament: Loneliness Depression Anxiety and Death”)<br />
But our inward, existential absurdity…is colored absurd <br />
<br />
We are condemned to jouissance. Our fate is to desire the fictional rectification of our inadequate condition of unhappiness. We strive for a fantastical perfection that is not existent. Thus we should carryout the Death Drive-The paradoxical call to accept desire as unassuageable- to accept our imprisonment as the only path of freedom.<br />
Zizek 99 (Slavoj, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, The Ticklish Subject, page 293- 297, gjm)<br />
The lesson of drive is that …repeatedly missing one’s goal. 65<br />
<br />
We exist as vulnerable beings that lay slave to securing immortality for our own egos. In other words: we try to dent the terrifying inevitability of our own oblivion. This pursuit is fundamentally life-denying—to live only to secure your own survival is to already be dead. Only once we accept the fundamental insecurity and fragility of life can we ever affirm it and truly said to BE ALIVE. Any other pursuit is a pointless fantasy.<br />
Park 06 (James, Philosophy Professor at the University of Minnesota, “Our Existential Predicament: Loneliness Depression Anxiety and Death”)<br />
Our fundamental absurdity is disclosed…surprising hope and joy.<br />
<br />
By affirming the death drive, we release the world and ourselves from all life-negating fantasies such as security or the ego. Our act of rebellion is to absolutely refuse all illusions of escaping the fundamental absurdity of our existence. <br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1989  (Slavoj, The Sublime Object of Ideology, p. xv-xvi, mrl)<br />
So, what about the obvious counter-argument…version of Gelassenheit? <br />
<br />
The final movement must be a total surrender of the will and life. We must surrender to the Death Drive even if it means accepting suicide. Only then can we live a life that is non-illusionary and meaningful.<br />
Park 06 (James, Philosophy Professor at the University of Minnesota, “Our Existential Predicament: Loneliness Depression Anxiety and Death”) <br />
Only when we experience…possesses us entirely.<br />
<br />
We should give up the fantasy of deflecting this drive. This allows us to untie the ideological knot that tethers together the entire international order <br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1999<br />
(Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 175-176, gjm)<br />
Ridiculous as this notion of the 'typical' … cure by addressing the sinthome. . . .<br />
The alt is a prior condition to true social change and a world without exploitation<br />
Skrimshire 06 (Stefan, Colorado state U, “A Political Theology of the Absurd?” Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 20 no 3. Pg 286-300) <br />
Rebellion is therefore … ‘Je me re´volte, donc nous sommes’.16<br />
<br />
Recognition of the death drive abolishes the source of totalitarian temptations – our attempt to articulate a new way of living is the only hope to break away from our violent international order.<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1999<br />
(Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 390-391, gjm)<br />
On the other hand, against this stupid …profoundly misleading.<br />
<br />
We create meaning out of an absurd reality – this is key to overcoming the devaluation of life<br />
LeBlanc 99 (assoc prof pol sci @ U texas tyler 1999, John Randolph, “ART AND POLITICS IN ALBERT CAMUS: BEAUTY AS DEFIANCE AND ART AS A SPIRITUAL QUEST” Literature &amp; Theology, Vol 13 no 2)<br />
The artist so engaged … upon the creative act <br />
<br />
FINALLY—the status quo is an ongoing GENOCIDE justified by the state in order to postpone an inevitable catastrophe and maintain the fantasy of deterrence. Imagining a post-catastrophic world where we have looked the Real of death in the eye retroactively enables us to think differently about the present and our relation to the current international system and the violence of geopolitics in international capitalism. Only ONCE WE’VE DONE THIS can we ever retain our value to life or ability to act ethically.<br />
Zizek 03 (Slavoj, Puppet and the Dwarf, MIT Press p. 159-66)<br />
This, perhaps, is also the most important ethics … life as one long emergency. <br />
<br />
Predictions are made by egotistical narcissists that are more interested in making outlandish predictions than actually being right. Studies show that professional predictors and experts are worse at guessing than chance. Experts start from intuitive truth and work backwards to wrong conceptions of the world, this means that the more qualified their author the less accurate they probably are.<br />
Menand 05 (Louis, “Everybody’s an Expert,” The New Yorker, December 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1?currentPage=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/05/051205crbo_books1?currentPage=1</a>)<br />
It is the somewhat gratifying lesson … but the long run irons them out.<br />
<br />
Predictions destroy that which makes life valuable, meaningful and authentic existence means accepting the uncertainty of the world and accepting anxiety as an essential condition. Trying to control and predict the future is an impossible task that does nothing but destroy us <br />
Gordan 03 (Kerry PhD psychology of philosophy/ director of research center on chaos/uncertainty, “The Impermanence of Being: Toward A Psychology Of Uncertainty” Journal of Humanistic Psychology 2003; 43; 96) <br />
Once entertained, the concept of scientific … our resistance to it that pathologizes (May, 1977).<br />

 Desert Islands 1AC Disclosure<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 1: Puff the Magic Dragon</strong><br />
<br />
We as the affirmative team recognize the fact that a debate is all about story-telling—telling a story about the world, telling stories comparing imaginary worlds, telling stories about suffering and about life.<br />
<br />
We will be telling you a few stories in this debate—stories that stick in your mind—these short aphorisms are like little decoding machines that sit in your mind and become lines of flight out of repression and into freedom and joy. We call the collection of these stories a nomadic war machine, but you might call it a 1AC: using the Resolution to tell a story about why all of life is joyous and should be affirmed.<br />
<br />
Deleuze '4<br />
(Gilles. Desert Islands and other texts. p. 252-260 mrl)<br />
<br />
We are familiar with the great instruments of encoding....who are today's nomads, who are today's Nietzscheans?<br />
<br />
<br />
Think of this speech as a story about an imaginary journey to deserted islands within our own mind—a porous territory where we are all immigrants and we create the world anew. Every time you think about DESERT ISLANDS I want you to think about moving towards freedom and unrelenting joy. The truth is that DESERT ISLANDS are everywhere and nowhere—we never really get to them, but the point is the imaginary journey towards them.<br />
<br />
Deleuze '4<br />
(Gilles. Desert Islands and other texts. p. 9-11 mrl)<br />
Geographers say there are two kinds of islands. ... what is most profound in it, i.e. rites and mythology.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe it’s impossible for our story-telling and imagination to change anything. There will still exist suffering and destruction after our Aff, but we open ourselves and the usfg up to the resonating force of simply being creative, and happy. Exploring the nomad DESERT ISLANDS in the virtual world of myth takes the mind on an imaginary journey to affirm life, a journey where we create everything new again... and again and again..<br />
.<br />
Deleuze '4<br />
(Gilles. Desert Islands and other texts. p. 12-14 mrl)<br />
<br />
This is to state once again that the essence of the deserted island is imaginary … The desert island is the material of this something immemorial, this something most profound.<br />
<br />
TEXT: The United States Federal Government should eliminate all restrictions on family visas for nomads searching for the mythical-imaginary DESERT ISLANDS.<br />
<br />
We can clarify. This playful experiment is a line of flight, a part of the rhizomatic escape from fascism, Oedipus, and nihilism.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 2: Liquid Solutions Derived</strong><br />
<br />
In each debate round in the interim between when the timer starts and the judge signs the ballot, thought is unleashed because of the radical possibilities of what can take place in that space. The act of casting the ballot affirmative is an act of closure insofar as it demarcates and draws out a ‘result’ from free space but this is only an after effect of the refrain in which the affirmation participates. Our contentions above all participate in and are aspects of a Refrain. (ATP 312) This refrain is the little rhythms of thought that contribute to the coming revolution of thought, of knowledge, of politics and the possibility of all three. To think of it one way: at the end of each round, the judge votes, in the same sense that the bird sings, the wolf shits, the human being communicates and/or moves. The bird’s song is essential to its ‘birdiness’ just as the wolf shits to mark its territory is essential to its ‘wolfiness’. Thus, voting is essential to ‘debatyness’ A refrain is aspects of an event or experience that create a territory- the bird sings, the wolf shits, the human communicates.<br />
<br />
However, our speech is of a particular type; in that, instead of finding it’s power in fascist life negation, the act of casting the ballot affirmative throws us into becoming revolutionary life affirmation.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari ‘80<br />
(A Thousand Plateaus. p292.)<br />
<br />
A woman has to become-woman, ... &quot;how to win the majority&quot; is a totally secondary problem in relation to the advances of the imperceptible.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND—We are the United States federal government—our agency is permeable and simulated through FIAT—simulation is good because it breaks down these barriers of identity and allows desire to be an active force in mutual actions.<br />
<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in ’72<br />
(Anti-Oedipus, 87-88)<br />
<br />
But simulation must be understood in the same way as we spoke of identification.... a self from its oscillations on the circle.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Aff is a refrain of existence, one of creativity and chaos, one that affirms joy and understanding. What we do necessarily sets up demarcations about whom and what we are. Demarkations are necessarily artificial and can be positive or negative, they can close off lines of escape and freedom or instead they can open us up to the fluctuating forces of the universe. More and more every day we are captured by exclusionary ideas, models, and ways of being. Our only goal is to escape from this black hole of existential contraction.<br />
Pindar and Sutton ‘2k (Ian and Paul, Introduction to The Three Ecologies, p. 8-13 mrl)<br />
<br />
There are many refrains in our own lives as well, … 'l always think of myself not so much as a painter but as a medium for accident and chance.'15<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We know that there is no calculated or rational reason why our search for imaginary nomadic territory is a good idea. But we also know that we should open ourselves to the many outcomes of our actions and abandon our desire for mastery over the world. Vote affirmative to throw the dice and accept the infinite possibilities of the eternal return.<br />
<br />
Deleuze 83 (Gilles, Prof of Philosophy @ U of Lyon, Paris, and Lycees, Nietzsche and Philosophy, p. 25-27)<br />
<br />
The game has two moments which are those of a dicethrow.... but the repetition of a dicethrow by the nature of the fatally obtained number. 23<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Attempts for control only accelerate the inherent violence of the world and breed micro-fascism, appropriating war and peace as the theatre of conflict in an endless cycle. Only a nomadic war-machine of language can use open multiplicity to replace the fascist form of order and control. We must affirm Nietzsche's Eternal Return—this rhizomatic process of affirming ALL of life might be painful but its the only way to really EVER BE ALIVE.<br />
Aima 2K9<br />
(Rahel, Columbia University, in the beginning was the language, and the language was gravity, April 13, 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://killingdenouement.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/in-the-beginning-was-the-language-and-the-language-was-gravity" rel="nofollow">http://killingdenouement.wordpress.com/2009/04/13/in-the-beginning-was-the-language-and-the-language-was-gravity</a>)<br />

<br />
Last but not least, the major enemy, the strategic adversary is ... which I would summarize as follows if I were to make this great book into a manual or guide to everyday life.<br />
Desert Islands 1AC 16/<br />
The transcendent promise for order hollows out our reality and makes us mortified zombies—we must not fear the death of our bodies, rather we should fear a world where we can't even give visas to people who want to go on an imaginary vacation. We should fear the death of joy—the death of space for creation and life itself. If the Aff can't be done then I don't want to be alive.<br />
<br />
Deleuze and Guattari ‘80 (Gilles and Felix, A Thousand Plateaus, p. 106-108)<br />
<br />
The major and minor mode are two different treatments of language... and without the formation of new activists, which assumes the elimination of the first generation).<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention 3: Household Supplies</strong><br />
<br />
Life exists in the margins; there is no key core to our life, only relations in between various desiring machines—we should affirm ALL productive desire, and live out death with joy. By releasing oneself from the ego, co-existence with the forces of life is possible. Our nomadic search for imaginary islands asks you to de-code your typical identity—to become schizo—in order to find beauty everywhere.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari ’72 (Anti-Oedipus, 330-39)<br />
<br />
But it seems that things are becoming very obscure, for what is this distinction between the experience of death … swallowed up-a question of regime.<br />
<br />
<br />
FINALLY—The radical political ramifications of micro-currents in thought supercharge our arguments.<br />

<br />
<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 2; text-align: left; widows: 2;">The parent-child image of the family is the dominant master signifier of our patriarchal-capitalist social structure—restricts, distorts, and deforms access to the commons. It is a core institution of bourgeois subjectivity that must be destroyed.</span><br />

<span style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0in; orphans: 2; text-align: left; widows: 2;">Life exists in the margins; there is no key core to our life, only relations in between various desiring machines—by releasing oneself from the Oedipal family and the Ego, co-existence with the forces of life is possible. Our affirmative asks you to destroy the western notion of the family in order to de-code our everyday identities—to become Schizo so that we might find beauty everywhere. </span><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Life is slow dying. Attempts for control only accelerate the inherent violence of the world and breed micro-fascism, appropriating war and peace as the theatre of conflict in an endless cycle. However a nomadic war-machine of language can use open multiplicity to replace the fascist form of order and control. We must affirm Nietzsche's Eternal Return—this rhizomatic process of affirming ALL of life might be painful but its the only way to really EVER BE ALIVE. <br />

<br />
Vote affirmative to embrace the Dicethrow: affirming a singular throw of the dice and accepting the infinite possibilities of its outcome in the eternal return is necessary to affirm life.<br />

<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Scenario 3 is Borderlands</strong></span><br />
<br />
We must move beyond the stranglehold of the family and borders. We affirm instead a politics of continuation – of constantly seeking new subjectivities and investigating their potential. We are against restriction—and call endlessly for its elimination, facilitating the withering away of all borders. That makes affirming this year's resolution an easy yes. Affirm the resolution to break the border around the nation and break the border around the family and take hold of a rhizomatic connection to affirming life itself. <br />
