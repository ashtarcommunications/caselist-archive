Queer Theory K<br />
<br />
The calculated management of migrant populations relies on a gendered and sexualized notion of citizenship. Even as they make progressive steps, there is always a violent underside to immigration policy that is steeped in heteronormativity. Luibhéid 2008. Eithne; director of the Institute for LGBT Studies and associate professor of women's studies at the University of Arizona. “Queer/Migration: An Unruly Body of Scholarship” GLQVolume 14, Number 2-3, 2008. AJM<br />
<br />
The modern world is dominated and controlled through a master logic of heteronormative whiteness. This privileges white, masculine, heterosexual men and maintains itself through war and imperialist domination. Winnubst 06, philosophy PhD, Penn State University Shannon, Queering Freedom 2006. p 5-6 AJM GoogleBooks<br />
<br />
Refuse to participate in the production and promotion of citizenship and its democratic foundations. Queerness is the anticitizen. There can be no compromise or reform, queerness must undermine the foundations of the oppressive nation-state.Brandzel 05 PhD candidate at the U of Minnesota. Amy L.“Queering Citizenship”. GLQ: Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 11.2 AJM.<br />

<br />
Terror Talk K (Reps Criticism)<br />
Borders K (Support/Use of the visa system props up the idea of a sovereign nation-state, etc)<br />
<br />
Also, just to note, my partner and I label most of our Ks (except for TT or Cap) as a &quot;Visa Kritik&quot;, so do not assume we are running the Agamben one. (I do not know why you would not be able to tell the K based off of the shell cards... but we got asked in CX about agamben while running Borders)<br />
