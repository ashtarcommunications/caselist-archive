<span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Framework of this debate is productive paraxial engagement and the Role of the Ballot is to reject instances of Eurocentric privilege. </span><br />
Jeanette will explain the framework in the 1NR but for now, <br />
Eurocentricity is our biggest concern because it controls the violence of the immigration system. Nunn explains that Eurocentricity through the law has <span style="color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";"> been used since the conquest and enslavement of Africans and other Native peoples to regulate, manage and control</span> bodies .<br />
Genocide! <br />
EB visas are directed only toward those that fit the mold<br />
In this debate, we will win 2 major disadvantages to the affirmative plan. <br />
1. Visas are privileged: Mark Salter explains, there are a number of costly and exclusive requirements for visas including: a fee for processing, return tickets, statements of qualifications, funds for stay, background checks, and health certificates. Mobility becomes a luxury for the rich and an encumbrance of the poor. Those who attain a visa are merely open to apply for a chance at being allowed in as long as they meet material privilege; <br />
<u> Visas make this privilege worse. The plan doesn’t change the entrance standards…<br />

2. Visas create binaries of dehumanization: <br />
The plan’s distinctions between what kinds of people are acceptable and not acceptable creates impossible standards for other people in their communities to meet. They make distinctions between good migrants who mimic white norms, vs those who do not fit white norms.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">[T]he courts defined ‘white’ through a process of negation, systematically identifying who was non-White. Thus, from <em>Ah Yup</em> to <em>Thind</em>, the courts established not so much the parameters of Whiteness as the non-Whiteness of Chinese, South Asians, and so on. . . . In this relational system, the prerequisite cases show that <em>Whites are those not constructed as non-White</em>. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">If whiteness is that which is not non-white, then </span><strong></u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">immigrants racialized as non-white, seduced by the promise of a falsely inclusive and color-blind America, must assimilate through processes of self-negation—becoming non-Mexican Mexicans, non-Indian Indians, non-Korean Koreans, and so on.

(1AC characteristics of those people) <br />
People are rendered invisible because they don’t fit this anglo mold. <br />
Europeans came to this land, exterminated indigenous populations, pushed them out and stole their land. They didn’t come to America, America came to them. These same indigenous populations filled in areas we now call Canada and Mexico. The North American Free Trade Agreement expanded free market enterprises and thus demanded Mexican labor while simultaneously demonizing entire populations with prop 187 to rob indigenous migrants from chances at citizenship. The plans systematic exclusion of undocumented migrants is symptomatic and a recreation of, racist colonial genocide. Stannard explains that genocide incluedes <span style="color: black;"> non lethal acts that undermine the liberty, dignity, and personal security</span> and viability of entire groups.<br />
