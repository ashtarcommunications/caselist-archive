Text: The United States National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform should include in its recommendation that the United States federal government should exempt graduates from accredited universities in the United States from the employment-visa quota and preference category system if they hold an advanced degree in science or technology.<br />
<br />
The Commission should not vote to include any recommendations that lower current levels of legal immigration or restrict beneficiary eligibility for current visas.<br />
<br />
The Executive Branch of the United States federal government should provide the commission with all necessary resources to promote its recommendations. <br />
<br />
The counterplan competes through the net benefits – any permutation severs the immediacy and certainty of the plan, or links to the politics DA.<br />
<br />
The counterplan solves the case and avoids politics – the structure of the commission guarantees congressional support <br />
