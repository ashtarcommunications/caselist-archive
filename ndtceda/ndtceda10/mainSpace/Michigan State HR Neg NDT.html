<strong>Decision: 3-0 for Towson CK Matheson, Richey, Lauzon</strong> <br />
<strong>Advocacy: Fernando and I advocate the topic as a site to avow the middle passage as America’s first immigration policy</strong> <br />
<strong>1NC: Anti-politics, T, tie to the topic</strong> <br />
<strong>2nr: T, solvency argument: flawed epistemologically because it’s not tied to the topic, boggs- cede to the right</strong> <br />

<span style="font-weight: normal;">There are neo-cons out there, they run many institutions in the world, and they create genuine problems. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">We need a curriculum that prioritizes <u>fiated and concrete political action</u> – this is <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><u>not only</u></span></em> a reason to prefer our T interpretation, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><u>but also</u></span></em> a disad to the curriculum they create. </span><br />

<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">A story frames our point --  </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">In 1999, student activism culminated in a meeting between protestors and the Greek Ministry of Education. That meeting was an incredible opportunity for radical reform – but the students failed because Greek curriculum had never taught them how confront systems of domination by using specific clash and line-by-line refutation.  </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">This contextualizes why we think our model of debate is so important. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">We’ll pre-empt their accessibility arg. That arg assumes that people have “fixed” preferences and static skill sets. It is tough to make a sweeping claim about how our model is inaccessible to a group of students without being essentializing. </span><br />

Upon submission of a recommendation, Congress will have 90 days to reject the commission’s recommendations by passing legislation maintaining existing legislative baselines. The Standing Commission should recommend to Congress that the United States Federal Government should remove current numerical limits on T-visas and remove the requirement for co-operation with law enforcement and the requirement that an individual have undergone force, fraud or coercion in order to be eligible for a T-visa.<br />

Effects- changing the petitioner process might result in more people being able to get the visa- but that doesn’t mean what THEY had to do to get the visa changed- forcing us to evaluate the effects of the plan eliminates any restriction on what the plan can do<br />
Legal precision- the actual immigration process treats “beneficiaries” and “petitioners” differently- enforcing that distinction is key to predictable and useful education on the subject<br />

 The United States Supreme Court should issue a narrow ruling that the “social group” standard for asylum, as per Matter of Acosta, should include all persons who have the shared experience of human trafficking and that those who would otherwise be ineligible for a T visa due to the cooperation and/or force, fraud and coercion eligibility requirements should be eligible for asylum under this standard of shared experience of human trafficking. <br />

They will say “but this means there are no trafficking affs”- we’ll centralize that limits discussion here <br />
First, there <em>are</em> such things as “T-visas:” the family members of T-1 status recipients currently living abroad- you can change who is eligible for those- you just can’t have an aff about the trafficked person because they’re already in the US—this is the T version <br />

Legal precision should come first- <br />
It IS topic-specific education- investigating the particulars of the process is a prerequisite to intelligent real-world engagement with the issue <br />
It’s a prerequisite to predictability- they can generally be right that we should default to constructions which give the aff more core literature, but we wrote the resolution with terms that are EXPLICITLY DEFINED IN A DEFINITE, IMMUTABLE WAY- if we give them T-1 status affs, we’ll also need to do things like give them admissibility affs based off of misconceptions about what “eligibility” is, and any number of affs about green cards unrelated to employment and family visas- legal precision is literally the only limit we have <br />
