<strong>Provisional visa cp:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Text: The United States federal government should lower the cap on H-2 visas to zero.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should offer provisional visas to individuals without regularized immigration status currently residing in the United States who meet earned requirements and who otherwise aren’t considered inadmissible under section 212(a) of the I.N.A. and the U.S.C.I.S. regulations. The number of provisional visas should be at least 466,000. Provisional visas should admit workers to the United States for three years, with one-time renewal permitted by demonstrating payment of all direct and indirect taxes; the maintenance of a clean criminal record; and acquisition of English language ability during the initial visa period. At the end of the second period the worker should have the option to transition to permanent status by applying for an available freen card, without employer sponsorship. Twelve months after the worker initially took up employment, the visa should be portable, allowing him or her to change employers without applying for a new visa. <br />

Solves the case --- provisional visa system could effectively replace the H2B program and allow for unauthorized immigrants to be eligible<br />

The military final EIS on the Guam relocation calls for limiting the inflow of workers to environmentally sustainable levels- the military hasnt decided if itll implement the results of the EIS- the plans permanent cap exemption guarantees a massive inflow of workers far above EIS-compliant levels, while the CP bans the plan and ensures future workflows are EIS-compliant<br />
