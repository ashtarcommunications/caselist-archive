CONTENTION I: Inherency<br />
<br />
<u>_. Presently, marriage to an American citizen or permanent resident serves provides a benefit for heterosexual couples seeking to immigrate to the United States. Yet at least 63 thousand LGBTQ individuals have their relationships ignored by the family visa process.<br />

The campaign to have … The United States has not.<br />
<br />
</u>. No other visa process is as secure as the family visa.<br />

Supporters argue that this … high individual and relationship costs.<br />
<br />
<u>_. As the immigration and naturalization process allows for the production of citizens without reproduction, it becomes the critical starting point for an interrogation of heteronormativity. No other state apparatus is better suited to break through.<br />
<br />

Studies Program at the University of Illinois). “Notes Toward a Queer History of Naturalization.” American Quarterly. 57.3 (2005). Project Muse. ZDS<br />
<br />
Unlike birthright citizenship, … to sexual reproduction or ancestry.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION II: Inclusion/Exclusion<br />
<br />
</u>_. Illegality is not simply an adjective describing a person, but a status that is affirmatively constructed and maintained by institutionalized racism, sexism, classism and heterosexism. Same-sex immigration provides a lens for understanding these intersections.<br />
<br />

Migration and the Shifting Line between Legal and Illegal Status.” GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies. 14.2-3 (2008). Project MUSE. ZDS<br />
<br />
Contrary to the idea … these dynamics of il/legalization.<br />
<br />
<u>_. By the restrictive nature of the visa regime, the biopolitical state uses the threat of illegality to discipline immigrant and citizen bodies to conform with heteronormative restrictions on identity.<br />
<br />

<br />
Subjects who act in this manner … a basis for legal immigration.<br />
<br />
</u>_. This threat of the legal/illegal creates a fear of state’s authority. This fear ensures that subjects conform to the state’s heteronormative prescription for identity. Creating docile bodies and erasing the value to life.<br />

<br />
Heteronormative family preferences in … own governance in an approved manner.44<br />
<u>_. The impact is that these docile bodies, afraid of exclusion, carry out unlimited violence on behalf of the state.<br />

at York University and Co-Director of the Global Change Institute). “Intimate Investments: Heteronomrativity: Global Lockdown, and the Seductions of Empire.” Radical History Review.

ZDS<br />
<br />
To (re)consolidate itself, … merit mention or attention.17<br />
<br />
</u>_. Furthermore, the ability to include and exclude immigrants from the biopolitical order places values on all life and the construction of bare life.<br />

<br />
It has been widely claimed … in a permanent state of exception.<br />
<br />
<u>_. We control the internal link to violence. The biopolical construction of identity is critical to the state’s ability to engage in genocide, war and nuclear conflict. The state cannot commit atrocity without a population willing to do its bidding.<br />
<br />

Pg. 136-137. ZDS<br />
<br />
Since the classical age … the large-scale phenomena of population.<br />
<br />
</u>_. Independent of biopower, heteronormative sexual regulation systematically eliminates abnormal ways of life.<br />

Heteronormativity in Communication Studies.” Journal of Homosexuality. 45: 2, (2003). InformaWorld. ZDS<br />
<br />
I see hatred … practice or to institutions. (p. 309, my emphasis)<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should extend to American citizens and lawful permanent residents eligibility to nominate permanent partners for family-based immigrant visas. The United States should define permanent partner as:<br />
a. In a committed, intimate relationship with an individual 18 years of age or older in which both parties intend a lifelong commitment;<br />
b. Is not married to or in a permanent partnership with anyone other than that other individual;<br />
c. Is not a first, second, or third degree blood relation to that other individual.<br />
<br />
<u>_. Same-sex immigration is an important starting point for an intersectional analysis of race, class, sex and gender.<br />

<br />
Controlling unauthorized (“illegal”) immigration … which it is anchored.<br />
<br />
</u>_. Framing the movement as a starting point, allows for a more broad resistance to heteronormativity.<br />
<br />

One way to begin reframing …, racially, heterosexually, or gender privileged?<br />
<br />
___. The some smaller-scale resistance is possible but because the state policy constructs the subjects of the bios; successful change has to begin at the top.<br />
<br />
