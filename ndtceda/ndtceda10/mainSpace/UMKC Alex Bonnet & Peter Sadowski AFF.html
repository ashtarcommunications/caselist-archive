<strong>The cooperation, severe forms of trafficking, and extreme hardship requirements are executed to produce the image of a passive iconic victim in need of US rescue</strong><br />

<strong>Implementation of the TVPA, for purposes of obtaining a T-Visa, has focused on an extremely narrow interpretation of who constitutes a victim – the requirement for cooperation with law enforcement has given prosecutors the dual power of identifying who constitutes an ‘iconic’ victim and assessing whether or not they have adequately cooperated with an investigation – in short, if one does not construct their political identity in alignment with the elements of a prosecutors ‘iconic victim’ then they will not receive a visa</strong><br />

<strong><u>In contemporary discourses...</u></strong> <strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">capitalism</span>.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It is no accident that two hundred years of resistance to “sex trafficking” and “prostitution” has failed – the government impulse to label certain practices prostitution and characterize them as either deviants worthy of moral retribution or victims without agency has unreasonably located itself around femininity which perpetuates the worst forms of patriarchy and creates a template for feminine subjectivity and the subjectivity of the rescuer that demands conformity to bourgeois heterosexual monogamous sexuality.</strong><br />

<strong>And, the linkage with colonialism is not tenuous—No where is this more true than in representations of non-western women and sexual propriety.

<strong>Contention Two: Biopolitics</strong><br />
<br />
Disease control and response is framed around ideas of containment and risk management against an invisible agent that threatens the health of the body politic. The foreign Other gets characterized as a foreign contagion attached to certain tropes of race, sex, and national origin in an effort to render disease visible. <br />

<br />
Immigrant health examinations serve as a filter for risk management against a threatening foreign other. This creates an idealized citizen of pure economic productivity as the template for the political subject. Our immigration policy uses these standards to ensure that the implicit condition for political subjectivity is purely economic. <br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Biopolitical control depends upon the production and dissemination of knowledge about threat and risk – the pursuit of positivist certainty is deployed as a management technique that organizes populations based on differential categories of risky behavior, but these calculations are not objective truth, rather they are generated by the particular goals and interests of the ruling body </span></strong><br />
