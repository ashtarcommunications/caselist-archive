Plan:<br />
The United States federal government should substantially increase the numbers of its visas by removing the numerical limitations on the “advanced degree” exemption for the H-1B visa.<br />
<br />
Contention One is Competitiveness<br />
<br />
The US is falling behind in competitiveness – competitors are making massive gains while the US suffers S&amp;T human capital shortages<br />

Among the dominant challenges …..countries in the developing world.<br />
<br />
And, the lack of skilled immigration is driving the U.S. leadership decline while simultaneously fueling the growth of hegemonic challengers<br />

<br />
Engineering science is critical to every aspect of competitiveness and innovation-it gives new technologies applicable form and function<br />

<br />
Fortunately, the plan solves-increased flows of foreign nationals into advanced programs is critical to engineering competitiveness and innovation<br />

Up to now, foreign … American universities and industry.<br />
<br />
<br />
U.S. conventional weapons development and hegemony are at risk due to restrictions on foreign S&amp;T talent-the impact is loss of primacy and war<br />
Robert Paarlberg, Professor of Political Science at Wellesley College, and Associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University, Summer ’04 (Knowledge as Power, International Security, 29:1, pp. 122-151)<br />
Military primacy … the air for biological attack.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan solves-access to foreign S&amp;T talent address structural weaknesses in U.S. conventional weapons development, while simultaneously buttressing relative gains versus challengers<br />
Robert Paarlberg, Professor of Political Science at Wellesley College, and Associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs at Harvard University, Summer ’04 (Knowledge as Power, International Security, 29:1, pp. 122-151)<br />
The key to this revolution … to foreign science talent.<br />
<br />
And, knowledge dominance is the key to hegemonic superiority-funding alone is not enough to make necessary weapons advances<br />

Can the United States maintain … science- intensive capabilities.<br />

<br />
Next the impacts:<br />
<br />
Competitiveness is the key internal link to U.S. primacy-gains in S&amp;T leadership are necessary to stave off rising hegemonic challenges<br />

Nationalism in all its forms …competition among nations and nationalist movements.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two is Science Diplomacy<br />
<br />
First-status quo efforts to buttress U.S. science diplomacy are growing but largely ineffective; reforming H-1B visa policy is the key internal link to actualizing the benefits of science diplomacy<br />
Thomas Pickering and Peter Agre, served as undersecretary of state from 1997-2000 and chairs the advisory council of the Civilian Research and Development Foundation; a Nobel laureate, is a physician and director of the Malaria Research Institute at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 20 February ’10 (Science Diplomacy Aids Conflict Reduction)<br />

Science by its nature … were foreign-born.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan solves science diplomacy—the impact is soft power, competitiveness, poverty, famine, disease, environmental destruction, terrorism, and war<br />
Federoff ’08 (Nina, Administrator at USAID, “International Science and Technology Cooperation,” Testimony before the House Committee on House Science and Technology Subcommittee on Research and Science Education, CQ Congressional Testimony, April 2)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three is Solvency<br />
<br />
Exempting graduate students from the H-1B cap attracts the best S&amp;T talent, solving competitiveness<br />
Ante ’04 (Spencer, computers editor for Business Week, Business Week, March 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2004/nf2004032_4623_PG2_db047.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/mar2004/nf2004032_4623_PG2_db047.htm</a>)<br />
KEEPING THE BEST. One of the strongest arguments …not counted against the cap.<br />
<br />
Moreover the plan sends a signal to prospective H-1B beneficiaries, attracting foreign S&amp;T youth to U.S. universities, buttressing overall research systems<br />
Ed Frauenheim, Staff Writer CNET News, 6 August ’04 (Brain drain in tech's future?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.cnet.com/Brain-drain-in-techs-future/2100-1008_3-5299249.html?tag=mncol;txt" rel="nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/Brain-drain-in-techs-future/2100-1008_3-5299249.html?tag=mncol;txt</a>)<br />
Discussion about … exempt from the program's annual cap.<br />
<br />
And, even if current H-1B caps aren’t being met now is a critical time to send this signal to current and prospective foreign advanced degree candidates in the U.S.<br />
Takao Kato and Chad Sparber, W.S. Schupf Professor of Economics and Far Eastern Studies, Colgate University; W.S. Schupf Professor of Economics and Far Eastern Studies, Colgate University, May ’10 (Quotas and Quality: The Eﬀect of H-1B Visa Restrictions on the Pool of Prospective Undergraduate Students from Abroad)<br />
The H-1B visa oﬀers many … distribution has changed in response to policy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, the plan sends a signal to businesses necessary to S&amp;T innovation to continue basing in the U.S.-the alternative is rampant offshoring risking competitiveness decline<br />
Lewin et al. ’09, Arie Lewin, Silvia Massini, and Carine Peeters, The Fuauq School of Business @ Duke University, Manchester Business Schools, and Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management (Why are companies offshoring innovation? The emergine global race for talent; Journal of International Business Studies 40)<br />
However, in this paper we argue that talent is a … advanced and complex PD projects.<br />
<br />
Finally, even massively expanding the H-1B cap won’t solve-eliminating the advanced degree cap is necessary to avoid cumbersome stop-gap measures that only further delay gains in S&amp;T competitiveness<br />
Jung S. Hahm, Associate @ Rothstein &amp; Ebenstein LLP, September 2K, “AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS AND WORKFORCE IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1998: BALANCING ECONOMIC AND LABOR INTERESTS UNDER THE NEW H-1B VISA PROGRAM,” Cornell Law Review, 85 Cornell L. Rev. 1673, Lexis<br />
This Note proposes the liberalization … of potential adverse consequences.<br />
<br />
<br />
These foreign-born U.S. educated workers are comparatively more innovative and critical to competitiveness than U.S. born students; expanding the H-1B cap is key<br />
Takao Kato and Chad Sparber, W.S. Schupf Professor of Economics and Far Eastern Studies, Colgate University; W.S. Schupf Professor of Economics and Far Eastern Studies, Colgate University, May ’10 (Quotas and Quality: The Eﬀect of H-1B Visa Restrictions on the Pool of Prospective Undergraduate Students from Abroad)<br />
More sanguine views of highly-… most were educated in the US.8<br />
<br />
Empirically studies demonstrate the plan is necessary to attract highly capable S&amp;T talent to U.S. industry-signaling to U.S. trained students is key<br />
Takao Kato and Chad Sparber, W.S. Schupf Professor of Economics and Far Eastern Studies, Colgate University; W.S. Schupf Professor of Economics and Far Eastern Studies, Colgate University, May ’10 (Quotas and Quality: The Eﬀect of H-1B Visa Restrictions on the Pool of Prospective Undergraduate Students from Abroad)<br />
