Las Vegas is known as America’s premier adult vacation land. Popular culture has promoted the idea that What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas. You can come to Las Vegas, gamble with abandon, drink until you can’t see, and have crazy sex with any number of people that you can order to be delivered to your casino hotel room. Movies and advertisements routinely portray the sex industry in Las Vegas as glamorous, exciting, care-free, consequence-free, and victim-free. Everything from the truck-mounted billboards that constantly circle the strip advertising “HOT BABES DIRECT TO YOU” to the brothel advertisements where you can order “services” off of a menu of sex positions, different nationalities, and various fetishes promote these ideas. For example, the LasVegasXXXscorts.com website advertises-<br />
