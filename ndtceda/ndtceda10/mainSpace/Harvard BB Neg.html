terrorism aff<br />
1nc: capitalism k<br />
<br />
new cap cards:<br />
(tags may not be the same as those read in the debate)<br />
terrorism is inevitable under capitalism- the expansion imperative makes hegemoni force necessary, which causes terrorist backlash<br />
boggs in 2<br />
carl, professor of social science at national university, <em>democracy and nature</em> 8.2<br />
the terrorist attacks of 11 september... will be more and more difficult to imagine<br />
<br />
violence of modern statehood draws power from dividing existence into distinct worlds. visas regulate on a prior ontological level and our politics must first answer: what world are we acting upon? the imperative of one world must be the prior axiom for politics<br />
badiou in 9<br />
alain, prof @ european graduate school, former chair of philosophy @ ecole normale superieure, <em>the meaning of sarkozy</em>, pgs 57-60<br />
why has what the politicians and the... let us greet the forgiveness of tomorrow.<br />
<br />
aff is an empty gesture towards egalitarianism- they ask you to &quot;choose&quot; the market instead- this sustains capitalism's hold on the symbolic order, colonizing our minds<br />
zizek in 7<br />
slavoj, <em>how to read lacan</em> ch 2 empty gestures and performatives<br />
this brings us to the dense passage... which is meant to be rejected.<br />
<br />
alt solves- being terrorized by embracing, the round is already lost. the only way to make it be better is to politicize it<br />
zizek in 8 <br />
slavoj <em>in defense of lost causes</em> p 433<br />
do we not, today, once again... has always-already been lost<br />

Texas CM aff vs Harvard BB Neg <br />
Roberts, Massey, Grandpre <br />
<br />
Aff – it’s the same affect aff that’s on the wiki <br />
Neg – 1 off cap bad<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Cap Bad 1NC cards New</u></strong><br />
The following are the new 1NC cards for Harvard BB’s Cap Bad Shell – the rest can be found in the scouting from the round prior. <br />
<br />
Aff attempts to snatch surplus enjoyment from the master – keeps economies of power intact <br />
Zizek The Plague of Fantasies 32-34 <br />
Desire emerges when drive gets caught…the underlying conflict might emerge. <br />
<br />
Debate is a frontline for anti-capitalist engagement – the 1AC choice not to be political is not neutral<br />
<br />
Louis Althusser “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses” in <em>Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays</em> p. 87-106<br />
<br />
As a first moment, it is clear…threatened in its existence by the world class struggle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wonder = paralysis <br />
Unger 9 <br />
Self Awakened p 147<br />
We may be tempted to view…wasting away – imposes upon us. <br />
<br />
Ethics is founded on narcissism – privileges so called ethical actors insulates them from responsibility <br />
Zizek in 2k6 <br />
“Smashing the Neighbor’s Face” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizsmash.htm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizsmash.htm/</a><br />

Round 1 v. Michigan LZ<br />
<br />
(Tags here were not necessarily the tags that were read in the debate)<br />
1NC<br />
Cap collapse inevitable – ecology, digital property, biogenetics, slums are antagonisms that cannot be overcome. 1AC extends market logic to immigration, hastening violent suicidal collapse<br />
Zizek ‘8 [In Defense of Lost Causes pp. 420-249]<br />
The underlying problem is…incessant subjective productivity.<br />
Aff’s response to suicidal revolts is to hold imm policy responsible. If only we loosened restrictions the system would self correct and we could do free market business as usual<br />
This measures violence as subjective against a backdrop of zero violence, ignoring systemic objective violence that sustains capitalism and makes aff possible<br />
Language comes first. Aff’s choice to ask for ballot on subjective violence groundes is most violent act possible and makes resistance impossible<br />
Zizek ‘8 [Violence, pp. 64-67]<br />
There is the elementary…creates its mirage<br />
Increasing immigration fuels globalized process of commodictation – integrates population directly into capitalist labor markets while locking up regional markets for exploitation<br />
Overbeek ‘2 [Henk, “Neoliberalism and the regulation of global labor mobility”, American Academy of Political Social Science, Vol. 581, May]<br />
Globalization involves the…regulation of migration<br />
Visas are tools of oppression, and entrench global apartheid<br />
Nandita Sharma ‘8 (En)gendering the war on terror “White Nationalism, Illegality and Imperialism: Border Controls as Ideology” p.124 ff<br />
In this chapter…all its citizens<br />
Irony link - Aff is not ironic but inserting ironic distance between them and ideology – not effective criticism, but exactly what ideology needs to function<br />
Zizek ’98 [“Why does the law need an obscene supplement”? In Law And the Postmodern Mind, pp.83-85]<br />
The aff’s parliamentary politics are morally irresponsible and manipulates social solidarity to enforce economic ineuqlity and disenfranchisement – using the state is unacceptable and traps the aff within reformism<br />
Boucher and Sharpe ’10 (Geoff, and Matthew, International Journal of Zizek Studies Vol. 4 No.2)<br />
-AFF=FALSE SUBVERSION, MULTICULTURALIST DENATURALIZATION OF SOCIAL/SEX, BUT NOT CHALLENGE UNDERLYING SOCIOECONOMIC<br />
-ALTERNATIVE REQUIRES SUBTRACTING YOURSELF FROM IT<br />
DALY 2010 (&quot;CAUSES FOR CONCERN: ZIZEK'S POLITICS OF LOVING TERROR,&quot; IJZS VOL. 4 NO. 2)<br />
ONE OF THE EDITORS HAS RAISED AN IMPORTANT QUESTION...GROUND RULES AND ACCEPTED GRAMMAR OF SUBVERSIVE ENGAGEMENT.<br />
THE AFF IS SIMPLY AN ATTEMPT TO SATIATE THE LACK INHERENT TO BEING - THE SUBJECT IS AN EMPTY SUBJECT BUILT ON A VOID, IT REACTS AGAINST THE MADNESS OF REALITY'S NEGATIVITY BY BECOMING A SUBJECT, HOWEVER THIS REACTION CREATES A LACK IT ENDLESSLY TRIES TO FILL BY CONSUMING AND ENJOYING MORE. THIS LOCKS THE 1AC INTO A FRAMEWORK OF JOUISSANCE THAT ENDELESSLY REPLICATES ITSELF AND DISPLACES LIFE - INSTEAD VOTE NEGATIVE TO AFFIRM THE RADICAL NEGATIVITY OF THE DEATH DRIVE AND OPEN UP NEW WAYS OF SUBJECTIVATION.<br />
DALY 2004 (GLYN, &quot;SLAVOJ ZIZEK: A PRIMER,&quot; HTTP://WWW.LACAN.COM/ZIZEK-DALY.HTM)<br />
THE ZIZEKIAN PARADIGM - IF WE CAN SPEAK OF IT IN THOSE TERMS...IN TERMS OF A CERTAIN BEING-TOWARDS-MADNESS.<br />
THE INEVITABLE RESULT OF THE COMING REVOLT WILL BE A SUICIDAL REVOLUTION THAT BATHES THE WORLD IN RIVERS OF BLOOD<br />
DELEUZE AND GUATTARI 87 (A THOUSAND PLATEAUS, P 230-231)<br />
WE CANNOT SAY THAT ONE OF THESE THREE LINES IS BAD...ALL THE DANGERS OF OTHER LINES PALE BY COMPARISON.<br />
AND CAPITALISM MAKES EXTINCTION INEVITABLE<br />
MESZAROS 2007 (ISTVAN, &quot;BOLIVAR AND CHAVEZ: THE SPIRIT OF RADICAL DETERMINATION,&quot; MONTHLY REVIEW, JUL/AUG 2007, VOL. 59, ISS. 3)<br />
THIS IS SO BECAUSE CAPITAL'S INCORRIGIBLE DESTRUCTIVENESS...DETERMINATION OF HUMAN INTERCHANGE.<br />
THE ALTERNATIVE: VOTE NEGATIVE TO EMBRACE COMMUNISM. ONLY AN AUTHENTIC ENCOUNTER WITH THE REAL OF CAPITALISM FREES OUR SUBJECTIVITY FROM ITS HOLD.<br />
ZIZEK 2008 (IN DEFENSE OF LOST CAUSES, P 452-461)<br />
WHAT IS TO BE DONE? WHAT TRIGGERS....PLANNED AND EXECUTED IT<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE'S LOCATION OF THEMSELVES AS THE ACTING SUBJECTS ABLE TO IMPOSE ORDER ON THE WORLD IS AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL SOCIETY, PRODUCING AN EXCESSIVE ATTEMPT TO FIXATE THE WORLD<br />
ZIZEK 97 (THE PLAGUE OF FANTASIES, 93-96)<br />
IN THE STANDARD NOTION OF THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN SUBJECT...GROUNDED IN AN EXCESSIVE FIXATION.<br />
Some 2NC/1NR<br />
Rejecting any totality closes off understanding of how production orders society. This prevents any coherent understanding of cap or resistance, allowing system expansion<br />
Zarvazadeh ’95 (Mas’ud, post-ality: Marxism and postmodernism, posta-ality the (dis)simulations of cybercapitalism) pp. 5-8<br />
Situated between the conservative…technology) and “consumption.”<br />
Robinson is nihilistic and conservative because he assumes no political can occur outside our current boundaries<br />
Thomassen ‘4 [Lasse, Lacanian Political Theory: A Reply to Robinson, The British jouirnal of Politics and International Relations 6 (4), 558-561)<br />
The first issue…Lacanian) political theory.
