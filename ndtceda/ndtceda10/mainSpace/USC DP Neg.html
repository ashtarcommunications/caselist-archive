A group of President Barack <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama's <span style="text-decoration: none;">fellow</span> Democrat<span style="text-decoration: none;">s</span> on Wednesday vowed to fight him on a <span style="text-decoration: none;">proposed</span> trade deal with South Korea <span style="text-decoration: none;">the White House wants passed by July 1. &quot;</span>The</span> war on the middle class continues. It's <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">greatest battle of 2011 will be the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Korea free trade</span> agreement</span>,&quot; said Representative Brad Sherman at an event with eight other House of Representatives Democrats. The trade deal with South Korea would be the biggest for the United States in more than 15 years. The White House says it would help create tens of thousand of new jobs, but opponents wave their own study saying it would cost 159,000 jobs. Most <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Republicans</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">who now control the House<span style="text-decoration: none;"> and</span> have made significant gains in the Senate, support the deal <span style="text-decoration: none;">as a way</span> to boost exports</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The</span> Obama a<span style="text-decoration: none;">dministration </span>can <span style="text-decoration: none;">also </span>count on votes from a substantial number of Democrats after negotiating changes</span> to address U.S. auto industry concerns about the pact. Sherman and the group including Representative George Miller, a close ally of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, charged that &quot;rules-of-origin&quot; provisions in the agreement open the door to South Korean goods containing as much 65-percent Chinese content to enter the United States duty-free. In addition, those goods could potentially be assembled by low-wage Chinese workers in South Korea under that country's &quot;guest worker&quot; program, Sherman said. He also complained that an annex of the pact created the possibility that goods produced in a North Korean industrial park near the border with South Korea could eventually be eligible for duty-free treatment. &quot;The agreement is not what you think it is. It is not an agreement just to allow South Korean-made products into the United States. It is an agreement that will allow North Korean-made products and Chinese labor and Chinese products into the United States duty-free,&quot; Sherman said. A U.S. trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity, took issue with Sherman's description of the agreement. While the rules-of-origin do allow for some non-South Korean content, &quot;they do not allow a product with 65 percent of its value from Chinese materials to be eligible for preferential treatment,&quot; the official said. In addition, South Korean labor laws, including minimum wage standards, apply to all workers in South Korea regardless of nationality, the official said. Congressional approval would also be needed to extend tariff benefits of the agreement to products made in the Kaesong industrial zone in North Korea, the official said. Representative Mike Michaud, chairman of the House Trade Working Group, said he did not have a hard estimate of how many House lawmakers were opposed to the Korea deal. However<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, opponents plan an education effort to build opposition <span style="text-decoration: none;">to the pact</span>, he said</span><br />

Immigration opponents’</span> unfavorable media narratives, often widely publicized, have a discernible impact on public opinion and affect policymaking.<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"> The economic, social, and cultural benefits of immigration are rarely reported. The State of Public Opinion Immigration does not rank high on Americans’ lists of the country’s most important problems. In 2008, only four percent of Americans (mostly people from Southwestern border states concerned about illegal entry) thought immigration was the country’s most important problem. Even during 2007’s acrimonious national debate about comprehensive reform, 60 percent of Americans believed new arrivals benefit the country. But public opinion can shift quickly, which makes politicians wary. Fifty-seven percent of voters in the November 2010 mid-term election considered immigration a &quot;very important&quot; issue, ranking it 7th and on a par with taxes and national security/war on terror, according to the Rasmussen report. The Need for Reform Follow-Through Administration and enforcement of immigration laws and visa programs are complex, in part because federal, state and local officials are involved in various aspects and are overseen by multiple federal agencies. Aligning the goals of these different entities to put an emphasis on the brain gain can help build support for policy improvements. As the report of a 2009 Brookings Forum on Growth Through Innovation pointed out with regard to promoting innovation more broadly, &quot;while the actions we need to take are clear and reasonably simple to outline, our political culture erects insurmountable barriers to long-term planning, funding and implementation.&quot; Achieving an Improved Immigration Policy </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">It will be difficult to achieve</span><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"> comprehensive, coherent policy </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">reform in the face of many competing goals and interest groups and in the <span style="text-decoration: none;">current</span> polarized political environment. The task is made more difficult by the divided authority over immigration <span style="text-decoration: none;">matters</span> within Congress</span>, involving several committees and subcommittees with competing interests and different political dynamics.

What a long, strange trip it's been for <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the South Korea</span>-U.S. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">free trade agreement.</span> The two sides announced this weekend that they've reached a deal on revisions to the draft that was signed in 2007 but never ratified. It <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">comes not a moment too soon, given the boost <span style="text-decoration: none;">this will give</span> to a U.S. economy <span style="text-decoration: none;">stumbling its way to recovery</span> and with tensions<span style="text-decoration: none;"> rising</span> on the <span style="text-decoration: none;">Korean</span> peninsula</span>. The saga is also a lesson to future U.S. Presidents on the importance of trade leadership. Having campaigned against the pact in 2008, President Obama rediscovered its benefits once in office. Yet by then he was forced to re-open negotiations to justify his earlier opposition. The result is a deal that is slightly better than the excellent 2007 text in some ways, but slightly worse in others. And this after a delay that has cost the U.S. global credibility on economic issues, not to mention the cost to U.S. growth. The good news is that the 2007 agreement stays mostly in place. South Korea still offers significant opening of its sheltered economy to American manufactured goods, agriculture and services. Within five years of ratification the deal will eliminate tariffs on 95% of the countries' trade in goods, and it also clears the way for greater trade in services by, for instance, opening Korea's banking industry. Meanwhile, some of the changes to that 2007 text are helpful. The trade in cars was the main sticking point, especially as Detroit worried about Korea's longstanding use of technical barriers like onerous safety standards to limit imports. Negotiators have added a provision that ensures new environmental standards proposed by Seoul over the past three years won't become de facto trade barriers. Yet some of the new auto provisions are worse than what Detroit had before. Conspicuously, Korea's current 8% tariff on imported U.S. cars—which would have been eliminated immediately upon ratification under the 2007 deal—now will be cut in half immediately but eliminated only after five years. Compare that to the European Union's agreement with Korea, which is signed and due to take effect next July. That deal gradually phases out Korea's 8% car tariff over four years. That means that over the next few years Detroit will miss what would have been the advantage of zero tariffs compared to rates of 2% to 6% on EU cars, and toward the end of the five-year period tariffs on EU cars will be lower than on American cars. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The biggest mistake</span> Mr. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama </span>and Democrats <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">made was allowing</span> one vocal lobby—Detroit and its <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unions—to hijack debate <span style="text-decoration: none;">on a comprehensive deal covering almost all trade</span></span>. Consider the main &quot;victory&quot; for Detroit: Korea has agreed to let America phase out its 25% tariff on pickup trucks more slowly. That will come at a stiff price to American buyers of those trucks, including many small businesses that delayed purchases during the recession. Some farmers have also become collateral damage. Seoul couldn't walk away from re-opened talks empty-handed, and one concession it extracted is a two-year delay, to 2016, in eliminating tariffs on some U.S. pork. American pork producers are excited about any deal, but they still would have been better off under the 2007 text. Chilean pork already enjoys lower tariffs thanks to the Chile-Korea FTA and has been gaining market share. The new tariff-elimination date also falls only six months before Korea's tariffs on EU pork will end under that deal, leaving Americans far less than the two-and-a-half years they would have had under the earlier text to get a marketing jump on their competitors. These caveats should not deter Congress from ratifying what is still an excellent deal. Mr. Obama has asked GOP House Speaker-designate John Boehner to assist in getting the pact approved, and we're told Mr. Boehner has suggested grouping this deal together with pending agreements with Colombia and Panama in a single House vote. This would make it easier for pro-trade forces in Congress to concentrate their political capital. Mr. Boehner will bring a majority or more of his GOP Members along, but Mr. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama will have to spend his own political capital to rebuild American public support <span style="text-decoration: none;">for free trade</span> and gain Democratic support. </span>The President would have made more progress toward his goal of doubling American exports if he had supported this deal in 2008 and pressed it through Congress in 2009. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The failure <span style="text-decoration: none;">in leadership </span>was to side with</span> the United Auto Workers and other <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">unions against the national interest</span>. Those who think they'll lose from trade always have the strongest motivation to lobby, while the consumers and businesses that benefit (such as American pickup truck buyers) are harder to organize. Every American President since Hoover in the 1920s has taken the broad view, speaking up for the many trade beneficiaries. U<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">.S. public support for freer trade has eroded amid <span style="text-decoration: none;">the recession and</span> the lack of Presidential leadership. It is crucial for U.S. competitiveness <span style="text-decoration: none;">in particular</span>, and the world economy <span style="text-decoration: none;">more broadly</span>, that</span> Mr. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama</span> and his allies <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">make a strong <span style="text-decoration: none;">and unapologetic</span> case that trade is in the best interests of America<span style="text-decoration: none;">n businesses and workers</span></span><br />

Westberg draws attention to new studies modelling the effects of even a limited nuclear exchange involving approximately 100 Hiroshima-sized 15 kt bombs2 (by comparison it should be noted that the United States currently deploys warheads in the range 100 to 477 kt, that is, individual warheads equivalent in yield to a range of 6 to 32 Hiroshimas).The studies indicate that the soot from the fires produced would lead to a decrease in global temperature by 1.25 degrees Celsius for a period of 6-8 years.3 In Westberg’s view: That is not global winter, but the nuclear darkness will cause a deeper drop in temperature than at any time during the last 1000 years. The temperature over the continents would decrease substantially more than the global average. A decrease in rainfall over the continents would also follow...The period of nuclear darkness will cause much greater decrease in grain production than 5% and it will continue for many years...hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger...To make matters even worse, such amounts of smoke injected into the stratosphere would cause a huge reduction in the Earth’s protective ozone.4 These, of course, are not the only consequences. Reactors might also be targeted, causing further mayhem and downwind radiation effects, superimposed on a smoking, radiating ruin left by nuclear next-use. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Millions of</span> refugees would flee <span style="text-decoration: none;">the affected regions</span>. The direct impacts</span>, and the follow-on impacts on <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the global economy via ecological and food insecurity, could make the <span style="text-decoration: none;">present </span>global financial crisis pale by comparison.</span> How the great powers, especially the nuclear weapons states respond to such a crisis, and in particular, whether nuclear weapons are used in response to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nuclear first-use, could <span style="text-decoration: none;">make or</span> break the <span style="text-decoration: none;">global</span> non proliferation </span>and disarmament <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">regimes.</span> There could be many unanticipated impacts on regional and global security relationships5, with subsequent nuclear breakout and geopolitical turbulence, including possible loss-of-control over fissile material or warheads in the chaos of nuclear war, and aftermath chain-reaction affects involving other potential proliferant states. The Korean nuclear proliferation issue is not just a regional threat but a global one that warrants priority consideration from the international community.<br />

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Obama can’t support more work visas without following through with more border policing, internal raids and more deportations of criminal immigrants </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">OLSON 2-15-11 </span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> Eric, Immigration Policy Center, 2/15</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Amid this enormous build up in border security, President <u>Obama is under i</u>ntense <u>pressure from both sides of the immigration debate</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">Comprehensive immigration reform advocates despise the current border-control strategy not only because of its ineffectiveness and outrageous financial cost, but because it leads many undocumented immigrants to entrust their lives to unscrupulous criminals, resulting in increased cases of robbery, rape, kidnapping, and even death along the southwest border. Many immigrant advocates therefore find it difficult to understand why President Obama would continue such an ineffective and dangerous policy. Yet, Obama has taken a tough stance on the border for an obvious reason: vocal grassroots movements—like the Minutemen—who support “sealing the border” have mounted an aggressive political campaign in many areas of the country. For their part,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>administration officials see securing the border as the first part of a “grand bargain” to negotiate with anti-immigration forces</u>, </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">which—they hope—will ultimately allow a major overhaul of the U.S. immigration system. Ultimately, policymakers need to seriously reconsider the merits and effectiveness of current policies designed to secure the border. While a fraction of undocumented immigrants entering the United States may be involved in drug smuggling or other criminal activities, U.S. authorities last year identified 200 felons out of more than a million people they apprehended at the border. Rather than focus all our efforts on patrolling the border, security might be enhanced by redeploying U.S. resources and personnel on intelligence-based law-enforcement efforts. For example, rather than increasing outbound inspections to disrupt the trafficking of bulk cash, the U.S. should focus law-enforcement efforts on hub cities where traffickers gather and package cash to bring back to Mexico. Likewise, collaborative law-enforcement efforts that focus on illegal gun sales in high traffic areas near the border have resulted in more cases being referred for prosecution, and are more effective than costly and disruptive attempts to monitor border crossings. Another thing that must be done is to bring immigrants who are otherwise law-abiding out of the shadows and provide them with legal avenues to enter the country.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>Widening the gates—with more elastic quotas for work visas</u> (especially for our Mexican and Central American neighbors)<u>—would allow U.S. Border Patrol agents to <strong>turn their fullest attention to organized criminal groups</strong> and would-be terrorists without</u> </span>the<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> distraction </span></u>of hunting down would-be gardeners and dish-washers. This grand bargain—better security through wider gates—may seem counter-intuitive, but may be more effective<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> In order to accomplish such an objective, a radical overhaul of the labyrinthine U.S. immigration system is needed. </span>It would also require more effective tracking of immigrants to the U.S. to ensure compliance with domestic labor regulations and visa expiration dates.<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> In the end, creating a legal path to enter the United States could result in a net economic benefit: higher wages for low-wage workers in the United States (no longer undercut by black-market migrant labor), increased tax revenues from migrant workers (who already pay at least some taxes indirectly), and a return to the pattern of cyclical migration. </span><br />

<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">The current strategy, dreamed up by restrictionists and embraced by Republicans and some Democrats, is to <strong>force millions into fear and poverty</strong></span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">. There are few national figures standing firm against restrictionism. Senator Edward Kennedy has bravely done so for four decades, but his Senate colleagues who are running for president seem by comparison to be in hiding. John McCain supported sensible reform, but whenever he mentions it, his party starts braying and he leaves the room. Hillary Rodham Clinton has lost her voice on this issue more than once. Barack Obama, gliding above the ugliness, might someday test his vision of a new politics against restrictionist hatred, but he has not yet done so. The American public’s moderation on immigration reform, confirmed in poll after poll, begs the candidates to confront the issue with courage and a plan. But they have been vague and discreet when they should be forceful and unflinching. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>The restrictionist message is brutally simple — that illegal immigrants <strong>deserve no rights, mercy or hope</strong>. It refuses to recognize that illegality is not an identity</u>; it is a status that can be mended by making reparations and resuming a lawful life. <u>Unless the nation contains its enforcement compulsion, illegal immigrants will remain <strong>forever Them and never Us</strong>, subject to whatever abusive regimes the powers of the moment may devise.</u>  </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">Every time this country has singled out a group of newly arrived immigrants for unjust punishment, the shame has echoed through history. Think of the Chinese and Irish, Catholics and Americans of Japanese ancestry.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>Children someday will study the Great Immigration Panic of the early 2000s, which harmed countless lives, wasted billions of dollars and mocked the nation’s most deeply held values.</u> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Needless to say, <u>the cost of sealing the perimeter of the United States</u> </span>against unauthorized entry <u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">would be astronomical, especially when one considers that the security measures needed to do so would <strong>slow legitimate trade</strong> and travel to a crawl, thereby inflicting <strong>massive damage on the entire U.S. economy</strong>.</span></u><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Legalization as the Most Effective (and Humane) Option for Unauthorized Immigrants Already in the United States. The Brookings-Duke report recognizes that <u>trying to remove all unauthorized immigrants from the United States “would be a catastrophic choice—<strong>enormously expensive, diplomatically disastrous, and hugely costly</strong> in human terms</u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">(Brookings-Duke Immigration Policy Roundtable 2009, p. 9).” At a time when the budgets of federal, state, and local governments contain more red ink than revenue, in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression, it is fair to ask what the U.S. government realistically can afford to do with the 6.3 million men, 4.1 million women, and 1.5 million children who now live in the United States without authorization—plus the 4.0 million U.S.-born, U.S.-citizen children who have an unauthorized-immigrant parent (Passel and Cohn 2009, pp. 4, 7). There are three possible strategies for dealing with the currently unauthorized population: the “deport them all” approach still advocated by fringe anti-immigrant groups; the “attrition through enforcement” approach now advocated by mainstream anti-immigrant groups; and the creation of a program under which unauthorized immigrants could apply for legal status—an approach advocated by a wide array of groups on pragmatic, economic, and humanitarian grounds (Ewing 2009). In contrast to the first two options, the legalization approach represents an acknowledgment that enforcement measures alone cannot fix a problem that was caused in large part by a decades-long mismatch between legal limits on immigration and the actual labor demands of the U.S. economy. Just as importantly, though, legalization also acknowledges the fact that,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>since the U.S. economy is now in recession, incorporating currently unauthorized immigrants into our strategy for economic recovery makes far more fiscal sense than spending untold billions of dollars</u>, in the middle of multiple budget crises, in a quixotic quest to force them all out of the country.</span><br />

The US <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Congress has found adapting the work visa</span> system to the new competitive realities in other than marginal ways (typically focusing on numerical ceilings<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">) politically </span><em>extremely contentious</em> and difficult to do. As failed legislative efforts in 2006 and 2007 illustrate, efforts to revise America's immigrant-selection system produce tensions rooted in sharp differences over values and competing views and priorities with regard to our national interests. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Disagreements typically </span><em>spill over</em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> into larger questions </span>about whether our immigration traditions continue to contribute to the building of a 21s t-century economy; clashing social and cultural visions about the nation's future; and concerns about the costs of the immigration status quo for certain groups and for the public sector. As a result, finding the right political balance between family reunification and labor-market immigration while holding firm to our proud humanitarian traditions and obligations has become increasingly difficult and the effort to redesign the work visa system ends up in repeated policy stalemates. To be sure, managing immigration well and with an eye to maximizing economic benefits must also involve highly technical questions about the effects of immigration on job opportunities for some Americans, wages, labor markets, growth, and long-term economic competitiveness. Too few admissions or a broken selection system (in terms of both timeliness and requirements) for immigrants with needed skills and qualifications inhibit America's growth and competitiveness; too much immigration, almost regardless of skills, can create disincentives for our own young people to enter certain fields of study and work and can sidetrack or even derail education and training priorities; and too much low-skilled immigration can impede innovation, slow productivity gains, and undermine wages and working conditions for similarly situated US workers. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Rapid economic restructuring and</span> slower but equally crucial demographic <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">change place a premium on a </span><em>flexible, responsive</em> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">immigration system</span>. The need for more nimble immigration policy is particularly compelling today as the global recession raises the stakes about getting immigration levels and needs right and focus them both on America's strategic economic renewal. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The</span> proposed Standing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Commission</span> on Labor Markets, Economic Competitiveness, and Immigration <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would provide </span><em>timely, evidence-based, and impartial</em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> analysis a</span>nd recommendations to the president and Congress <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">on changes to immigration levels and composition of</span> both temporary and permanent employment <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">visas</span>.3 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The U</span>nited <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">S</span>tates <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has confronted similar problems in other highly politicized areas</span> — policy issues that require impartiality, timeliness, sophisticated technical expertise, and a steady hand — and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it has</span> occasionally <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">turned to independent bodies for </span>professional advice and to streamline the policymaking response. Indeed, Congress took a similar step for determining annual refugeeadmissions levels when it established the refugee consultation process in the 1980 Refugee Act. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The Standing Commission</span>, which would be a permanent body, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">would</span> have the following tasks: • <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Analyze</span> existing <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">data </span>on immigrants in the US economy, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and manage the collection of </span>new longitudinal<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> data </span>as needed. The proposed new and ongoing data collection project would be similar to the New Immigrant Survey4 but with a larger sample size, multiple cohorts, and more of an explicit focus on labor markets. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Create and implement a policy-focused research agenda on the labor market roles,</span> integration trajectories, and economic impacts of all types of immigration3 , both at the national level but most importantly at the state, regional, industrial sector, and occupational levels. The objective would be to address policy-relevant issues and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">thus obviate the need for Congress to rely on the unpredictable and arbitrary interests</span> of the academy and the political and ideological agendas of most nonprofit research organizations. Perhaps more importantly, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">such ongoing and systematic research would allow the Commission to treat congressional changes</span> in policy <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">as &quot;natural experiments&quot; whose analysis would inform and shape additional policy adjustments</span>. • <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Provide annual recommendations </span>for adjustments to employment-based immigration levels<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> that would take effect unless Congress voted to change them within a specified time frame</span>. • <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Publish research reports and make datasets publicly available </span>so as to create the foundation for ongoing academic research and better informed public debate. Together, these functions would enable Congress to revisit the allocation of employment visas regularly and base immigration policy on a better and much more reliable understanding of the evidence about evolving needs and impacts than the current system provides. Over time, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the accumulated knowledge and experience the Standing Commission would amass would make Congress' responsibilities on immigration easier to manage and its decisions better informed</span> and much better aligned with the country's broader interests. To this end, the proposed Standing Commission should be seen as a key element of comprehensive immigration reform or, should legislation stall, a first step toward better policy solutions<br />

The U.S. post-secondary education system remains the finest in the world. Science and engineering programs have greatly expanded over time and continue to attract students, at all levels, from every other country in the world. In fact, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in science and engineering in particular, there are disproportionate numbers of foreign students enrolled in U.S. degree program</span>s, and by and large U.S. students are not seeking education in these areas outside the U.S. So, it would seem that the quality of our educational system is not a problem. But, is it producing enough talented workers to supply the needs of the aerospace and defense industry? At present, the absolute number of engineers is not the problem. Recent, significant<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> job cuts have meant that, if anything, there are likely more engineers being trained in the U.S. than there are jobs available.</span> Indeed<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, the trends in the number of graduates reflect the</span> trends in manufacturing industries in general and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">trends in the aerospace industry in particular. These industries have become increasingly automated</span>, both in design and manufacturing. This has meant that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fewer workers are </span>required to produce a given level of output. These industries have also become increasingly globalized, which has meant that fewer workers are required in the U.S. as more and more design and production capacity has moved overseas. <br />
<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Increasing enrolments, the economy and retention solves any potential shortage </span></span><br />

Yet, even though 49% of all American engineers are employed by organizations that specialize in one of these four disciplines, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">more engineering students have</span> either <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">enrolled in </span>the following five programs, or have attained degrees in one of these niche disciplines, than in the “Big Four” occupational specialties, in the last five years: • <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Aerospace:</span> 30% increase in the number of graduates • Biomedical: 50% increase in the number of graduates • Chemical: 50% increase in undergraduate enrollment • Environmental: 100% increase in undergraduate enrollment • Petroleum: 100% increase in undergraduate enrollment and in the number of students graduating. In the meantime, although the manufacturing sector continues to employ the largest percentage of American engineers, many service-based industries, including professional, scientific, and technical, have begun to hire an increasing number of engineers as well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook for 2010, about 30% of all engineering professionals currently work in one of these industries. If engineers are not employed within the manufacturing sector or in service-based industries, they generally work for federal, state, or local governments, within a variety of capacities, including the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Transportation, or U.S. Department of Energy; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA); or highway and public works departments. U.S. engineers approach retirement as college enrollment rates increase U.S. engineers approach retirement as college enrollment rates increase<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> Many U.S. engineers are approaching the traditional retirement age of 55 or older. As a result,</span> some well-experienced engineers are no longer working full-time, thus creating a nationwide engineering talent shortage that will lead <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">many organizations</span> to <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">generate more flexible work options </span>for their employees to retain them for longer durations of time. During the coming years, the future U.S. engineering workforce will be increasingly comprised of multiple generations of workers, including Baby Boomers and Generation X and Y employees. As engineers continue to retire and organizations search for future top talent, recent engineering graduates and current students should certainly maintain positive attitudes as they will likely find high-paying, meaningful positions, even in the midst of the ongoing national economic recession. Meanwhile, according to the American Society for Engineering Education, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">undergraduate engineering program enrollment rates essentially increased by 7%</span> between the years of 2000 and 2005. Such an increase had originally led some organizations to believe that an engineering “youth movement” had begun. However, although a large number of students had enrolled into programs, enrollment increases did not translate into a higher number of graduates from 2005 to 2009. Nevertheless<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, the recent economic recession has truly created a spike in undergraduate engineering enrollment</span>. In fall 2009, more than 427,000 students enrolled for collegiate engineering classes, a 6% increase over a one year period and a 16% increase since 2005. As the recession forced many unemployed workers to upgrade their current skills and to pursue new career opportunities, it <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">appears a high number of individuals will begin their new careers within the next couple years—a sign that the current engineering labor shortage may slowly start to decrease throughout the upcoming decade</span>.<br />

As depicted in the illustration that appears as an Appendix to this paper, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the aerospace</span> and defense <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">industry</span> has long been a source of great innovation and <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">continues today to produce cutting edge technologies </span>that push the envelope of human achievement.

Some, such as high profile program failures and an aging workforce, would suggest a looming crisis of innovation in the industry. Still others, concerning how innovators secure the necessary financial and human resources and then organize those resources for optimum results, underscore that the rules of the innovation game in aerospace and defense are changing. Together, these indicators are upsetting conventional attitudes toward innovation, and the natural friction and travail associated with the process of adapting to change are stoking anxieties. But upon closer examination one finds that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">there are at least as many encouraging indicators of risk-taking, innovative achievement, and successful adaptation to cast doubt on the reflexive conclusion that aerospace </span>and defense today <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is experiencing a crisis in its propensity to innovate</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The state of innovation in aerospace and defense is not in crisis; it is being transforme</span>d To explore the changing nature of innovation from the 20th to 21st centuries, from the ColdWar to a post-9/11 world, Charles River Associates undertook a comprehensive study to assess the state of innovation in the aerospace and defense industry today.

It draws on expertise from both academia and industry and includes the findings from recent interviews conducted with top executives at more than a dozen top tier firms<br />

U.S. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">government regulation of the aircraft industry is a challenge to </span><em>the entire market</em>, and can be broadly classified into two categories — <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">export controls</span> that seek to protect critical technologies and promote national security <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and protectionist policies</span> over items such as specialty metals that seek to ensure the health of the U.S. industrial base.

Since the time preceding its formal establishment, the US Air Force has been the best in the world. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">As a counterfactual piece of alarmism,</span> King notes the relative absence of leading-edge fighter technology at the outset of both world wars, arguing that the United States’ reliance on European aircraft in World War I and the technological inferiority of its fighter aircraft at the outset of World War II have modern relevance. It seems curious to note these historical oddities in constructing an argument that supports demand-side intervention on the defense industrial base since in both instances that base is largely credited with providing war-winning technology and materiel.1 Further, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">little evidence exists that during the Cold War our Air Force chose substantially better aircraft-</span>design <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">characteristics than those of our leading enemy.

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Dr. Jaworowski also reports: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;Since the 1960s, (hormetic) effects have been ignored in radiation protection practice, while research on stimulating and adaptive effects of radiation, the radiation hormesis, has continued over several decades. The results of more than 1200 published papers on hormesis were recently reviewed by Luckey (1990) - many of them in an excellent book by Kondo (1993). The studies on hormesis were also presented at four international conferences (Oakland CA 1985, Frankfurt Germany 1987, Kyoto Japan 1992, and Changchun China, 1993). It is astonishing, however, that even recently the obvious hormetic effects appearing in the epidemiological studies were often not noticed, not only by the readers, but by the authors themselves.’ [Ed. note: See for example Section 3.4, Pollycove 1994, Figure 4].</span><br />
&quot;Radiation hormesis goes beyond the notion that <u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">radiation has no deleterious effects</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> at small doses; at </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">small doses new stimulatory effects occur that</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> are not observed at high doses and these new effects </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">may be beneficial to the organisms</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">&quot;Recognition of the existence of hormesis opens up an important new field of research. &quot;In mammals, radiation hormesis enhances defense reactions against neoplastic and infectious diseases, increases longevity and improves fertility . . . </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">in an experiment with mice the incidence of leukemia, cancers, and sarcomas was lower in animals irradiated</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> with cesium-137 gamma radiation doses of 2.5 to 20 mSv </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">than</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> it was </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">in non-irradiated</span></u> <u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">controls</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. The number of all malignant neoplasms in animals exposed to a single dose of 10 mSv was more than 30% lower than in non-irradiated controls. </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">In several experiments, small initial radiation doses have been shown to improve the survival of animals subsequently irradiated with large, near lethal doses</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. In other experiments, an increased life span was found in animals irradiated with doses between 250 and 3000 mSv. . . . a group of French studies started in the early 1960’s, indicate that </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">protozoa and bacteria exposed to artificially lowered levels of natural radiation demonstrate deficiency symptoms</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> expressed as dramatically decreased proliferations. </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">This indicates that ionizing radiation may be <strong>essential for life.&quot;</strong></span></u><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">10. Nutrition and health</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Drs. Luckey, Planel and others have produced research data that find that </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">background radiation deficiency adversely effects microbes, plants and invertebrates as a dose deficiency of essential vitamins and minerals</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Such data is consistent with dose-response</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> for such </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">nutrients that affects all orders of biota, including humans</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. Confirmatory research on the role of radiation in health and nutrition, and on mammals, has not been supported by the radiation science establishment, even though: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">1. substantial results would be produced at the appropriate doses for radiation protection; </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">2. such preliminary research would require much less than 1% of the funding of current &quot;radiation research&quot;, much of which is without merit except to promulgate public fear; and</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">3. the potential benefits to human health are very great, along with the potential for eliminating large and unwarranted public costs for unnecessary radiation protection, and reduce the unfounded public fear of radiation.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Dr. Luckey states: &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">If ionizing radiation is an essential agent, most populations live in a partial radiation deficiency</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">. Radiation hormesis would then be the alleviation of a partial radiation deficiency. This would make the dose-response curve for ionizing radiation comparable with that of several essential nutrients. Examples include vitamin A, thiamin, vitamin B6, calcium, iron and selenium. </span>Individuals and populations who receive insufficient amounts of these essential nutrients are routinely supplemented with those nutrients. Supplementation with an essential agent present in insufficient amounts would explain the dramatic results following small increments in whole body exposures to chronic, low dose irradiation.&quot; <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Dr. Luckey further states: &quot;</span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">The cumulative knowledge indicates exposures to the general population should be raised</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> to a &quot;minimum yearly recommended allowance&quot; (MYRA) of about 10 cGy/y (Luckey 1991). A public health evaluation should be undertaken to establish the bases and methods of providing radiation supplementation as a public health service.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Drs. Sadao Hattori and Kiyohiko Sakamoto report that radiation hormesis is being used clinically to successfully treat and to suppress the reappearance of cancer in the hospital of Tohoku University. This clinical program was founded on research that confirms the stimulation of the immune system and the reduction and successful treatment of tumors in animals. Successful clinical practice has been implemented using x-ray of about 15 fractions of 10 cGy each, delivered 3 times per week for 5 weeks, with standard high-dose radiation treatments.</span><br />

However, State Department representatives provided some verbal statistics on 214(b) denials to representatives of some of the societies that had issued a Joint Statement on visas (see footnote 16, below).

An editorial in last week's issue of Science argues that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">US visa requirements are damaging scientific exchange between China and the United Sta</span>tes. The authors of the editorial, Ya-Ping Zhang and Shigang He, respectively vice-director of the Kunming Institute of Zoology and professor at the Institute of Biophysics in Beijing, based their claim on a quick opinion poll of Chinese colleagues. They sent <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">an email survey to 400 professors and graduate students</span> at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the universities of Peking, Fudan, Yunnan and Wuhan. Seventy-six scientists responded<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Of these, 91 per cent said they were &quot;seriously rethinking their collaborations with US scientists and intend to work with scientists in countries where obtaining a visa is not a problem</span>&quot;. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Seventy-one per cent said they would avoid going to the United States and 95 per cent thought current US visa requirements were damaging scientific exchange between China and the United States</span>. &quot;Much of what you are seeing [in this poll] is a reflection of the past,&quot; says Dennis Murphy, spokesperson for the US Department of Homeland Security. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Heightened security measures since the 11 September</span> 2001 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">attacks </span>on the World Trade Centre in New York, United States, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">are said to have increased red tape and delays to visa applications. These include face-to-face interviews and background checks on visa applicants</span>. &quot;Over the last few years, we have been working very hard with the US State Department to improve the entire process,&quot; Murphy told SciDev.Net. He said visa applications were now &quot;much easier, much quicker, and less onerous&quot;. Murphy said the department was continuing to look &quot;aggressively&quot; at the regulations to see where they can be further simplified. &quot;We would urge people to continue to view [the United States] as a welcoming place,&quot; he said. While the visa application process has evolved since the initial surge of heightened security after September 2001, many believe it can still be improved on. Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the US Council on Education, is among them. &quot;There is no doubt that the Department of Homeland Security has tried to address problems in the process,&quot; he told SciDev.Net. &quot;There is also no doubt that the process is far more complicated than before [11 September 2001].&quot; However, Hartle agrees with Murphy that the procedural obstacles are only part of the problem; he fears that complicated procedures have made the US seem &quot;less welcoming to would-be international students and scholars than we would want it to be&quot;. &quot;What we want more than anything else is a process that is simple, predictable and transparent,&quot; says Hartle. &quot;We haven't yet got there.&quot; According to a survey by the US Council of Graduate Schools in September, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">fewer foreign students are going to the United States for their graduate studies</span> (see <span class="MsoHyperlink">Foreign students staying away from United States</span>). <em>The largest decrease in admissions is among Chinese students</em> — the largest group of foreign students in the United States. Between 2003 and 2004, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">admissions of Chinese students dropped by one-third</span> (see <span class="MsoHyperlink">US security measures deter foreign graduate students</span>). <br />

Finally, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the newly created agency must be required to set visa numbers by a certain date each fiscal year to avoid delay and to ensure predictability </span>for employers and those who intend to immigrate. As <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">a recent empirical study of the use of deadlines</span> in administrative law <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">reveals, deadlines provide Congress with an easy mechanism to ensure compliance</span>, but deadlines might also result in “reductions in quality along the substantive dimension.”140 To be sure, the creation of a deadline would reduce the rigor of the consultation processes discussed above, but <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">over time the agency and relevant committees will become more efficient at the process of review</span> (admittedly raising the possibility that it will become pro forma). In addition<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, because visas must issue every year</span>, regardless of which branch is responsible for setting the visa numbers, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the responsible branch must make decisions quickly, which calls for mechanisms that minimize delay, and the ongoing nature of the visa-setting process provides the agency with opportunity for correction each year if its decisionmaking turns out to be faulty</span>. Alternatives include the statutory default rules discussed at the outset of this Part, or a default rule that the previous year’s numbers set by the agency will control, if the agency fails to act by its deadline. But whereas the former diminishes the agency’s incentives to act, the latter might serve as a useful safeguard to ensure that agency inaction does not bring the labor immigration system to a halt<br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Creating a flexible system equipped to respond to changing circumstances will help promote efficiency</span> and economic growth and create capacity for preventing illegal immigration through nonenforcement-oriented means, thereby helping to mitigate the negative effects of such immigration on U.S. workers and secure ongoing public confidence in the regime.15 To be flexible, the system must be capable of responding to facts on the ground. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The system should be able to adapt to fluctuations in the U.S. labor market,</span>16 as well as to changes in the economic and demographic circumstances outside the United States that help shape migratory flows, particularly in the American hemisphere.17 Determining the number and types of immigrants to admit does depend upon value judgments concerning who should become part of the polity, on what terms, and with what effects on existing residents—the so-called “membership decision.”18 But <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the process also has a technical dimension that requires databased projections about market dynamics and future economic and social needs</span>. Regulating immigration effectively, therefore, demands a system equipped to evolve in response to the sociology and economy of migration. Predictability, on the other hand, requires avoiding dramatic fluctuations in rules. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A predictable system will be somewhat </span><em>insulated from day-to-day political pressures</em>, whether in <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the form of interest group lobbying or the anti-immigrant, restrictionist shocks</span> that occasionally arise from the electorate. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Predictability not only allows employers and workers to manage their expectations, but also helps facilitate a stable and orderly flow of migration</span>, which in turn helps secure public acceptance of immigration.19 <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Predictability and responsiveness need not be mutually exclusive. A regime that adjusts in response to changed circumstances </span><em>can also be predictable</em><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, if interested parties understand how the government anticipates and then adjusts to fluctuating conditions, or if clear standards, set out in advance of the actual decisionmaking, guide changes to the numbers of visas available from year to year.</span> A goal of the decisionmaking structure, therefore, should be to determine how much predictability affected parties require to make decisions about their futures, and to be transparent about the mechanisms used to identify changed circumstances.20<br />

He said <strong><u>there are strict laws, regulations, and technical standards which govern site selection, design, construction, testing, operation, and retirement of nuclear power plants</u></strong> in China. He added that <strong><u>these codes are stringently enforced by the Chinese government. China drew up these codes by taking developed countries' nuclear standards and the safety recommendations of the</u></strong> <strong><u>I</u></strong>nternational <strong><u>A</u></strong>tomic <strong><u>E</u></strong>nergy <strong><u>A</u></strong>gency into full account, he said. <strong><u>China</u></strong> <strong><u>took lessons from previous</u></strong> nuclear power <strong><u>accidents</u></strong> <strong><u>and adopted time-tested technology in designing and building its</u></strong> nuclear power <strong><u>plants</u></strong>, he added. According to Tian, <strong><u>no notable defects have been found in China's</u></strong> seven operational <strong><u>nuclear power plants, and the safety statistics for most of these plants are higher than the global average.</u></strong> In addition, <strong><u>China has an emergency-response mechanism in place</u></strong> for its nuclear power plants, he said.<br />

<br />
BEIJING - The foreign ministers of <span class="ecxterm"><strong><u>China</u></strong></span><strong><u>, Japan and the</u></strong> Republic of Korea(<strong><u>ROK</u></strong>) on Saturday <strong><u>agreed to boost <span class="ecxterm">cooperation</span> on <span class="ecxterm">nuclear power</span> safety and disaster preparedness</u></strong>, a week after Japan's magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami, which has left over 20,000 dead or missing. Prior to the meeting in Kyoto, officials from three countries stood in silent tribute to the victims of the disaster. Newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Takeaki Matsumoto briefed his Chinese and ROK counterparts Yang Jiechi and Kim Sung-hwan on how Tokyo is handling the aftermath of the disaster as well as the ongoing efforts to avoid the radiation leaking at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Matsumoto also expressed gratitude for the dispatch of relief teams and supplies by China and the ROK. He emphasized that although the disaster has had a short-term effect on Japan's economy, its foundations have not been shaken. Both the Chinese and ROK foreign ministers offered condolences to Japan, saying that they are willing to extend maximum support to the nation in relief operations and reconstruction work. <strong><u>Disaster management and the safety of nuclear power were high on the agenda</u></strong> at the meeting. <strong><u>The three ministers agreed to enhance trilateral cooperation to better respond to major disasters and ensure the safety of <span class="ecxterm">nuclear power</span>.</u></strong> The trio also exchanged views on the situation in the Korean Peninsula and started to lay the groundwork for the Fourth <span class="ecxterm">China</span>-Japan-ROK Trilateral Summit Meeting, according to Xinhua News Agency. Foreign Minister Yang said during the meeting that China-Japan-ROK <span class="ecxterm">cooperation</span> is an important part of East Asian cooperation, and promoting friendly relations among the three is in line with the common interests of the three countries.<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;">Radiobiologist Dr. Gunnar Walinder of Sweden and others in biology state that carcinogenesis is a complex, iterative progression that precludes the biological plausibility of the LNTH as a postulated stochastic &quot;hit&quot; to DNA that can progress to a cancer. </span><u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">Biological evidence has established that ‘whole’ cell colonies and organisms have adaptive responses to radiation, for cells in which complex intracellular communications and responses are enabled, and for organisms in which immune responses are functional.</span></u><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 8pt;"> Some of the limited research that is claimed to &quot;support&quot; the linear model comes from organisms and cell colonies with deficient biological response capability. </span><br />

Ecologists have long maintained that diversity is one of nature's greatest strengths, but new research suggests that diversity alone does not guarantee strong ecosystems. In findings that could intensify the debate over endangered species and habitat conservation, three <span class="underline">new studies suggest a greater abundance of plant and animal varieties doesn't always translate to better ecological health</span><u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At least equally important, the research found, are the types of species and how they function together. &quot;Having a long list of Latin names isn't always better than a shorter list of Latin names,&quot; said Stanford University biologist Peter Vitousek, co-author of one of the studies published in the journal Science. </span><span class="underline">Separate experiments in California, Minnesota and Sweden, found that diversity often had little bearing on the performance of ecosystems </span>-- at least as measured by the growth and health of native plants. In fact, the <u><span class="underline">communities with the greatest biological richness were often the poorest when it came to productivity and the cycling of nutrients</span>.</u> One <span style="font-size: 8pt;">study compared plant life on 50 remote islands in northern Sweden that are prone to frequent wildfires from lightning strikes. Scientist David Wardle of Landcare Research in Lincoln, New Zealand, and colleagues at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, found that islands dominated by a few species of plants recovered more quickly than nearby islands with greater biological diversity. Similar findings were reported by University of Minnesota researchers who studied savannah grasses, and by Stanford's Vitousek and colleague David Hooper, who concluded that functional characteristics of plant species were more important than the number of varieties in determining how ecosystems performed</span><u>. <span class="underline">British plant ecologist </span></u>J.P<span class="underline">. Grime</span><u>, in</u> a commentary summarizing the research, <u><span class="underline">said there is</span></u> as yet <span class="underline">no &quot;convincing evidence that species diversity and ecosystem function are consistently and causally related</span>.&quot; &quot;It could be argued,&quot; he added, &quot;that <span class="underline">the tide is turning against the notion of</span> high <u><span class="underline">biodiversity as</span></u> a controller of ecosystem function and <span class="underline">insurance against ecological collapse</span><u>.&quot;</u><br />
Deep sea fishing, oil and gas drilling, and waste dumping kill deep ocean biodiversity<br />

<span style="margin-right: 4.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">The world's fisheries are now in decline. <u>Deep sea fishing decimates bottom-dwelling creatures. Trawling can reduce the diversity of an area by 50% and it can take centuries for the region to recover. Oil and gas drilling is increasingly taking place in the deep sea which, apart from the risk of blow-outs, is polluting.</u> Drilling brings up fossil water from deep within the Earth's crust; the water is often radioactive and highly salty, toxic to organisms adapted to today's oceans. Another worrying area of exploitation is bioprospecting for minerals. For instance, mining manganese nodules could be carried out by a robotic device that would trawl the surface, churning out sediment that can asphyxiate slow-growing organisms. The minerals themselves are a further problem: a lump of manganese as big as a fist was produced by bacterial excretions and grew at the rate of a millimetre a century for a thousand years. It is hardly a sustainable harvest. <u>Dumping at sea is sanctioned for &quot;off-shore processing of seabed mineral resources&quot;, and &quot;wastes derived from normal operations in the ocean&quot;, which is practically carte blanche for anyone with an imagination.</u></span></span><br />

In fact, </span><u>there were 58,000 protests in 2003, 74,000 in 2004, and 87,000 last year according to official statistics.</u> <u>These protests are getting larger.

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">CCP won’t collapse – unrest is fragmented and CCP is successfully containing any dissidents</span><br />
<strong>Pei 9</strong> – senior associate in the China Program at the Carnegie Endownment for International Peace (Minxin, “Will the Chinese Communist Party Survive the Crisis?” Foreign Affairs, 3/12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64862/minxin-pei/will-the-chinese-communist-party-survive-the-crisis" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64862/minxin-pei/will-the-chinese-communist-party-survive-the-crisis</a>)<br />
With no end to the global crisis in sight, many are wondering how long China's economic doldrums will last and what the political impact of stagnation will be. <span class="underline">The conventional wisdom is that low growth will erode the party's political legitimacy and fuel social unrest </span>as jobless migrants and college graduates vent their frustrations through riots and protests. Although <span class="underline">this forecast</span> is not necessarily wrong, it <span class="Emphasis2">is incomplete</span>. Strong economic performance has been the single most important source of legitimacy for the CCP, so prolonged economic stagnation carries the danger of disenchanting a growing middle class that was lulled into political apathy by the prosperity of the post-Tiananmen years. And economic policies that favor the rich have already alienated industrial workers and rural peasants, formerly the social base of the party. Even in recent boom years<span class="underline">, grass-roots unrest has been high</span>, with close to 90,000 riots, strikes, demonstrations, and collective protests reported annually. Such frustrations will only intensify in hard times<span class="underline">. It might seem reasonable to expect that challenges from the disaffected</span> urban middle class, frustrated college graduates, and unemployed migrants will constitute the principal threat to the party's rule. <span class="underline">If those groups were </span>in fact <span class="underline">to band together</span> in a powerful coalition, <span class="underline">then the world's longest-ruling party would</span> indeed <span class="underline">be in</span> deep <span class="underline">trouble.</span> <span class="Emphasis2">But that is not going to happen.</span> <span class="underline">Such a revolutionary scenario overlooks two critical forces blocking political change in China</span> and similar authoritarian political systems: <span class="underline">the regime's capacity for repression and the unity among the elite. Economic crisis and social unrest may make it tougher for the CCP to govern, but they will not loosen the party's hold on power</span>. A glance at countries such as Zimbabwe, <span class="underline">North Korea, Cuba, and Burma shows that </span>a relatively <span class="underline">unified elite</span> in control of the military and police <span class="underline">can cling to power through brutal force, even in the face of abysmal economic failure</span>. Disunity within the ruling elite, on the other hand, weakens the regime's repressive capacity and usually spells the rulers' doom. <span class="underline">The CCP has already demonstrated its </span><span class="Emphasis2">remarkable ability</span><span class="underline"> to contain and suppress chronic social protest and </span>small-scale<span class="underline"> dissident movements</span>. The regime maintains the People's Armed Police, a well-trained and well-equipped anti-riot force of 250,000. In addition, China's secret police are among the most capable in the world and are augmented by a vast network of informers. And although the Internet may have made control of information more difficult, Chinese censors can still react quickly and thoroughly to end the dissemination of dangerous news. Since the Tiananmen crackdown, the Chinese government has greatly refined its repressive capabilities. Responding to tens of thousands of riots each year has made Chinese law enforcement the most experienced in the world at crowd control and dispersion. Chinese state security services have applied the tactic of &quot;political decapitation&quot; to great effect, quickly arresting protest leaders and leaving their followers disorganized, demoralized, and impotent. If worsening economic conditions lead to a potentially explosive political situation, the party will stick to these tried-and-true practices to ward off any organized movement against the regime. If popular unrest is not a true threat to the party's continued rule, then what is? The answer could likely be disunity among the country's elite. <span class="underline">Those who talk of China's &quot;authoritarian resilience&quot; consider elite unity to be one of the CCP's most significant achievements in recent decades</span>, citing as evidence technocratic dominance, a lack of ideological disputes, the creation of standardized procedures for the promotion and retirement of high officials, and the relatively smooth leadership succession from Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;">CCP won’t collapse – unrest is fragmented and CCP is successfully containing any dissidents</span><br />
<strong>Pei 9</strong> – senior associate in the China Program at the Carnegie Endownment for International Peace (Minxin, “Will the Chinese Communist Party Survive the Crisis?” Foreign Affairs, 3/12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64862/minxin-pei/will-the-chinese-communist-party-survive-the-crisis" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64862/minxin-pei/will-the-chinese-communist-party-survive-the-crisis</a>)<br />
With no end to the global crisis in sight, many are wondering how long China's economic doldrums will last and what the political impact of stagnation will be. <span class="underline">The conventional wisdom is that low growth will erode the party's political legitimacy and fuel social unrest </span>as jobless migrants and college graduates vent their frustrations through riots and protests. Although <span class="underline">this forecast</span> is not necessarily wrong, it <span class="Emphasis2">is incomplete</span>. Strong economic performance has been the single most important source of legitimacy for the CCP, so prolonged economic stagnation carries the danger of disenchanting a growing middle class that was lulled into political apathy by the prosperity of the post-Tiananmen years. And economic policies that favor the rich have already alienated industrial workers and rural peasants, formerly the social base of the party. Even in recent boom years<span class="underline">, grass-roots unrest has been high</span>, with close to 90,000 riots, strikes, demonstrations, and collective protests reported annually. Such frustrations will only intensify in hard times<span class="underline">. It might seem reasonable to expect that challenges from the disaffected</span> urban middle class, frustrated college graduates, and unemployed migrants will constitute the principal threat to the party's rule. <span class="underline">If those groups were </span>in fact <span class="underline">to band together</span> in a powerful coalition, <span class="underline">then the world's longest-ruling party would</span> indeed <span class="underline">be in</span> deep <span class="underline">trouble.</span> <span class="Emphasis2">But that is not going to happen.</span> <span class="underline">Such a revolutionary scenario overlooks two critical forces blocking political change in China</span> and similar authoritarian political systems: <span class="underline">the regime's capacity for repression and the unity among the elite. Economic crisis and social unrest may make it tougher for the CCP to govern, but they will not loosen the party's hold on power</span>. A glance at countries such as Zimbabwe, <span class="underline">North Korea, Cuba, and Burma shows that </span>a relatively <span class="underline">unified elite</span> in control of the military and police <span class="underline">can cling to power through brutal force, even in the face of abysmal economic failure</span>. Disunity within the ruling elite, on the other hand, weakens the regime's repressive capacity and usually spells the rulers' doom. <span class="underline">The CCP has already demonstrated its </span><span class="Emphasis2">remarkable ability</span><span class="underline"> to contain and suppress chronic social protest and </span>small-scale<span class="underline"> dissident movements</span>. The regime maintains the People's Armed Police, a well-trained and well-equipped anti-riot force of 250,000. In addition, China's secret police are among the most capable in the world and are augmented by a vast network of informers. And although the Internet may have made control of information more difficult, Chinese censors can still react quickly and thoroughly to end the dissemination of dangerous news. Since the Tiananmen crackdown, the Chinese government has greatly refined its repressive capabilities. Responding to tens of thousands of riots each year has made Chinese law enforcement the most experienced in the world at crowd control and dispersion. Chinese state security services have applied the tactic of &quot;political decapitation&quot; to great effect, quickly arresting protest leaders and leaving their followers disorganized, demoralized, and impotent. If worsening economic conditions lead to a potentially explosive political situation, the party will stick to these tried-and-true practices to ward off any organized movement against the regime. If popular unrest is not a true threat to the party's continued rule, then what is? The answer could likely be disunity among the country's elite. <span class="underline">Those who talk of China's &quot;authoritarian resilience&quot; consider elite unity to be one of the CCP's most significant achievements in recent decades</span>, citing as evidence technocratic dominance, a lack of ideological disputes, the creation of standardized procedures for the promotion and retirement of high officials, and the relatively smooth leadership succession from Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao.<br />

Regarding green cards, he says, &quot;though the law says that an employer must attempt to find an American to fill a given job before resorting to sponsoring a foreign worker for a green card, the law is so full of loopholes that it is easy to circumvent -- fully legally.&quot; He refers to a damning 2007 video to prove his point. The video, which was written about in <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jun2007/db20070621_912042.htm" rel="nofollow">Business Week</a>, shows immigration attorneys explaining how they help employers hire permanent foreign workers by disqualifying American workers.

He <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">says that in a true labor shortage, wages should rise in keeping with the simple rules of supply and demand. </span>&quot;If we had a shortage of soybeans, the price would go up. If we had a surplus of oil, the price would go down,&quot; Sorscher said. &quot;And eventually we'd buy less soybeans and consume more oil.&quot; <a name="#extended"></a>He points out that in 1999, a labor shortage driven by the high-tech boom led to a bidding war for workers, affording such employees free concierge service, ping pong tables, permission to bring one's dog to work and so on. High wages would drive more students into those skilled fields. &quot;If instead you bring in 150,000 foreign workers and you're only graduating 120,000 new students annually, you've short-circuited the labor market,&quot; Sorscher said. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">&quot;Our policy to bring in the foreign workers has the effect of short-circuiting the labor market and preventing us from ever producing enough domestic workers.&quot;</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The centrality of these mutual processes of assurance and deference means that the stability of a hierarchical order is fundamentally related to a collective sense of certainty about the leadership and order of the hierarchy. This certainty is rooted in a combination of material calculations – smaller states' assurance that the expected costs of the dominant state conquering them would be higher than the benefits – and ideational convictions – the sense of legitimacy, derived from shared values and norms that accompanies the super-ordinate state's authority in the social order. The empirical analysis in the next section shows that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">regional stability in East Asia</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the post-Second World War years </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">can be correlated to the degree of collective certainty about the US-led regional hierarchy. East Asian stability and instability has been determined by U.S. assurances, self-confidence, and commitment to maintaining its primary position in the regional hierarchy; the perceptions and confidence of regional states about US commitment</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">; and the reactions of subordinate states in the region to the varied challengers to the regional hierarchical order. 4. Hierarchy and the East Asian security order Currently, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the regional hierarchy in East Asia is still dominated by the United States</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Since the 1970s, China has increasingly claimed the position of second-ranked great power, a claim that is today legitimized by the hierarchical deference shown by smaller subordinate powers such as South Korea and Southeast Asia. Japan and South Korea can, by virtue of their alliance with the United States, be seen to occupy positions in a third layer of regional major powers, while India is ranked next on the strength of its new strategic relationship with Washington. North Korea sits outside the hierarchic order but affects it due to its military prowess and nuclear weapons capability. Apart from making greater sense of recent history, conceiving of the US' role in East Asia as the dominant state in the regional hierarchy helps to clarify three critical puzzles in the contemporary international and East Asian security landscape. First, it contributes to explaining the lack of sustained challenges to American global preponderance after the end of the Cold War. </span><span class="underline">Three of the key potential global challengers to US unipolarity originate in Asia (China, India, and Japan), and their support for or acquiescence to, US dominance have helped to stabilize its global leadership. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Through its dominance of the Asian regional hierarchy, the United States has been able to neutralize the potential threats to its position</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">from Japan via an alliance, from India by gradually identifying and pursuing mutual commercial and strategic interests, and from China by encircling and deterring it with allied and friendly states that support American preponderance. Secondly, </span><span class="underline">recognizing US hierarchical preponderance further explains contemporary under-balancing in Asia, both against a rising China, and against incumbent American power.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> I have argued that one defining characteristic of a hierarchical system is voluntary subordination of lesser states to the dominant state, and that this goes beyond rationalistic bandwagoning because it is manifested in a social contract that comprises the related processes of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference. Critically, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">successful and sustainable hierarchical assurance and deference helps to explain why Japan is not yet</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a ‘normal’ country. Japan has experienced significant impetus to revise and expand the remit of its security forces in the last 15 years. Yet, these pressures continue to be insufficient to prompt a wholesale revision of its constitution and its remilitarization. The reason is that the United States extends its security umbrella over Japan through their alliance, which has led Tokyo not only to perceive no threat from US dominance, but has in fact helped to forge a security community between them (Nau, 2003). Adjustments in burden sharing in this alliance since the 1990s have arisen not from greater independent Japanese strategic activism, but rather from periods of strategic uncertainty and crises for Japan when it appeared that American hierarchical assurance, along with US' position at the top of the regional hierarchy, was in question. Thus, the Japanese priority in taking on more responsibility for regional security has been to improve its ability to facilitate the US' central position, rather than to challenge it.13 In the face of the security threats from North Korea and China, Tokyo's continued reliance on the security pact with the United States is rational. While there remains debate about Japan's re-militarization and the growing clout of nationalist ‘hawks’ in Tokyo, for regional and domestic political reasons, a sustained ‘normalization’ process cannot take place outside of the restraining framework of the United States–Japan alliance (Samuels, 2007; Pyle, 2007). Abandoning the alliance will entail Japan making a conscience choice not only to remove itself from the US-led hierarchy, but also to challenge the United States dominance directly. The United States–ROK alliance may be understood in a similar way, although South Korea faces different sets of constraints because of its strategic priorities related to North Korea. As J.J. Suh argues, in spite of diminishing North Korean capabilities, which render the US security umbrella less critical, the alliance endures because of mutual identification – in South Korea, the image of the US as ‘the only conceivable protector against aggression from the North,’ and in the United States, an image of itself as protector of an allied nation now vulnerable to an ‘evil’ state suspected of transferring weapons of mass destruction to terrorist networks (Suh, 2004). Kang, in contrast, emphasizes how South Korea has become less enthusiastic about its ties with the United States – as indicated by domestic protests and the rejection of TMD – and points out that Seoul is not arming against a potential land invasion from China but rather maritime threats (Kang, 2003, pp.79–80). These observations are valid, but they can be explained by hierarchical deference toward the United States, rather than China. The ROK's military orientation reflects its identification with and dependence on the United States and its adoption of US' strategic aims. In spite of its primary concern with the North Korean threat, Seoul's formal strategic orientation is toward maritime threats, in line with Washington's regional strategy. Furthermore, recent South Korean Defense White Papers habitually cited a remilitarized Japan as a key threat. The best means of coping with such a threat would be continued reliance on the US security umbrella and on Washington's ability to restrain Japanese remilitarization (Eberstadt et al., 2007). Thus, while the United States–ROK bilateral relationship is not always easy, its durability is based on South Korea's fundamental acceptance of the United States as the region's primary state and reliance on it to defend and keep regional order. It also does not rule out Seoul and other US allies conducting business and engaging diplomatically with China. India has increasingly adopted a similar strategy vis-à-vis China in recent years. Given its history of territorial and political disputes with China and its contemporary economic resurgence, India is seen as the key potential power balancer to a growing China. Yet, India has sought to negotiate settlements about border disputes with China, and has moved significantly toward developing closer strategic relations with the United States. Apart from invigorated defense cooperation in the form of military exchange programs and joint exercises, the key breakthrough was the agreement signed in July 2005 which facilitates renewed bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation (Mohan, 2007). Once again, this is a key regional power that could have balanced more directly and independently against China, but has rather chosen to align itself or bandwagon with the primary power, the United States, partly because of significant bilateral gains, but fundamentally in order to support the latter's regional order-managing function. Recognizing a regional hierarchy and seeing that the lower layers of this hierarchy have become more active since the mid-1970s also allows us to understand why there has been no outright balancing of China by regional states since the 1990s. On the one hand, the US position at the top of the hierarchy has been revived since the mid-1990s, meaning that deterrence against potential Chinese aggression is reliable and in place.14 On the other hand, the aim of regional states is to try to consolidate China's inclusion in the regional hierarchy at the level below that of the United States, not to keep it down or to exclude it. East Asian states recognize that they cannot, without great cost to themselves, contain Chinese growth. But they hope to socialize China by enmeshing it in peaceful regional norms and economic and security institutions. They also know that they can also help to ensure that the capabilities gap between China and the United States remains wide enough to deter a power transition. Because this strategy requires persuading China about the appropriateness of its position in the hierarchy and of the legitimacy of the US position, all East Asian states engage significantly with China, with the small Southeast Asian states refusing openly to ‘choose sides’ between the United States and China. Yet, hierarchical deference continues to explain why regional institutions such as the ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN + 3, and East Asian Summit have made limited progress. While the United State has made room for regional multilateral institutions after the end of the Cold War, its hierarchical preponderance also constitutes the regional order to the extent that it cannot comfortably be excluded from any substantive strategic developments. On the part of some lesser states (particularly Japan and Singapore), hierarchical deference is manifested in inclusionary impulses (or at least impulses not to exclude the United States or US proxies) in regional institutions, such as the East Asia Summit in December 2005. Disagreement on this issue with others, including China and Malaysia, has stymied potential progress in these regional institutions (Malik, 2006). Finally, conceiving of a US-led East Asian hierarchy amplifies our understanding of how and why the United States–China relationship is now the key to regional order. The vital nature of the Sino-American relationship stems from these two states' structural positions. As discussed earlier, China is the primary second-tier power in the regional hierarchy. However, as Chinese power grows and Chinese activism spreads beyond Asia, the United States is less and less able to see China as merely a regional power – witness the growing concerns about Chinese investment and aid in certain African countries. This causes a disjuncture between US global interests and US regional interests. Regional attempts to engage and socialize China are aimed at mediating its intentions. This process, however, cannot stem Chinese growth, which forms the material basis of US threat perceptions. Apprehensions about the growth of China's power culminates in US fears about the region being ‘lost’ to China, echoing Cold War concerns that transcribed regional defeats into systemic setbacks.15 On the other hand, the US security strategy post-Cold War and post-9/11 have regional manifestations that disadvantage China. The strengthening of US alliances with Japan and Australia; and the deployment of US troops to Central, South, and Southeast Asia all cause China to fear a consolidation of US global hegemony that will first threaten Chinese national security in the regional context and then stymie China's global reach. Thus, the key determinants of the East Asian security order relate to two core questions: (i) Can the US be persuaded that China can act as a reliable ‘regional stakeholder’ that will help to buttress regional stability and US global security aims;16 and (ii) can China be convinced that the United States has neither territorial ambitions in Asia nor the desire to encircle China, but will help to promote Chinese development and stability as part of its global security strategy? (Wang, 2005). But, these questions cannot be asked in the abstract, outside the context of negotiation about their relative positions in the regional and global hierarchies. One urgent question for further investigation is how the process of assurance and deference operate at the topmost levels of a hierarchy? When we have two great powers of unequal strength but contesting claims and a closing capabilities gap in the same regional hierarchy, how much scope for negotiation is there, before a reversion to balancing dynamics? This is the main structural dilemma: as long as the United States does not give up its primary position in the Asian regional hierarchy, China is very unlikely to act in a way that will provide comforting answers to the two questions. Yet, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the East Asian regional order</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> has been and still </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is constituted by US hegemony, and to change that could be extremely disruptive and may lead to regional actors acting in highly destabilizing ways. Rapid Japanese remilitarization, armed conflict across the Taiwan Straits, Indian nuclear brinksmanship directed toward Pakistan, or a highly destabilized Korean peninsula are all illustrative of potential regional disruptions</span><span class="underline">. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5. Conclusion To construct a coherent account of East Asia's evolving security order, I have suggested that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the United States is the central force in constituting regional stability and order</span><span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The major patterns of equilibrium and turbulence in the region since 1945 can be explained by the relative stability of the US position at the top of the regional hierarchy, with </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">periods of greatest insecurity being correlated with greatest uncertainty over the American commitment to managing regional order</span><span class="underline">.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Furthermore, relationships of hierarchical assurance and hierarchical deference explain the unusual character of regional order in the post-Cold War era. However, the greatest contemporary challenge to East Asian order is the potential conflict between China and the United States over rank ordering in the regional hierarchy, a contest made more potent because of the inter-twining of regional and global security concerns. Ultimately, though, investigating such questions of positionality requires conceptual lenses that go beyond basic material factors because it entails social and normative questions. How can China be brought more into a leadership position, while being persuaded to buy into shared strategic interests and constrain its own in ways that its vision of regional and global security may eventually be reconciled with that of the United States and other regional players? How can Washington be persuaded that its central position in the hierarchy must be ultimately shared in ways yet to be determined? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The future of the East Asian security order is tightly bound up with the durability of the United States' global leadership and regional domination. At the regional level, the main scenarios of disruption are an outright Chinese challenge to US leadership, or the defection of key US allies, particularly Japan.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Recent history suggests, and the preceding analysis has shown, that challenges to or </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">defections from US leadership will come at junctures where it appears that the US commitment to the region is in doubt, which in turn destabilizes the hierarchical</span><span class="underline"> order.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> At the global level, American geopolitical over-extension will be the key cause of change. This is the one factor that could lead to both greater regional and global turbulence, if only by the attendant strategic uncertainly triggering off regional challenges or defections. However, it is notoriously difficult to gauge thresholds of over-extension. More positively, East Asia is a region that has adjusted to previous periods of uncertainty about US primacy. Arguably, the regional consensus over the United States as primary state in a system of benign hierarchy could accommodate a shifting of the strategic burden to US allies like Japan and Australia as a means of systemic preservation. The alternatives that could surface as a result of not doing so would appear to be much worse. </span><br />

While all eyes have been trained on North Korea's belligerent and aggressive actions in recent weeks, it is important to note that <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the U.S.-South Korea alliance</span> has <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">emerged as a </span>linchpin in the Obama administration's efforts to successfully manage an overcrowded global agenda, and a <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">pivotal tool for safeguarding</span> U.S. long-term interests in <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Asia</span>. When South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak meets with President Barack Obama at the White House Tuesday, the two leaders must effectively address three main areas: policy coordination to address North Korea's nuclear threat, the development of a global security agenda that extends beyond the peninsula, and collaboration to address the global financial crisis as South Korea takes a lead on the G-20 process. By conducting a second nuclear test in May, followed by a number of missile launches, North Korea has forced its way onto the Obama administration's agenda. First and foremost, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">effective</span> U.S.-South Korea <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">alliance coordination is critical to managing</span> both <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the global effects of North Korea's nuclear threat on</span> the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">nonproliferation</span> regime <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and</span> the <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">regional security challenges posed by</span> potential regime actions that lead to further <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">crisis in the region</span>. North Korea's internal focus on its leadership succession, and the apparent naming of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il's little-known and inexperienced youngest son as his successor, make the task of responding to North Korea's aggressive and destabilizing actions all the more challenging. Both <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">deterrence and negotiation must be pursued on the basis of close consultations</span>. Presidents <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Obama and Lee must</span> also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">develop coordinated</span> contingency <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">plans in the event of internal instability in North Korea</span>. Through effective U.S.-South Korea alliance coordination, it should be possible to forge a combined strategy capable of managing the nuclear, proliferation, and regional security dimensions of North Korea's threat. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A coordinated position would</span> also <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">strengthen the administration's hand</span> in its efforts <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to persuade China to put pressure on North Korea</span>.<br />
Key to prevent nuclear lashout <br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Kaplan 06</span></span> (Robert, When North Korea Falls&quot; October, a correspondent for The Atlantic, “When North Korea Falls” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200610/kaplan-korea" rel="nofollow">http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200610/kaplan-korea</a>)</span><br />
The threat from north of the DMZ is formidable. North Korea boasts 100,000 well-trained special-operations forces and one of the world’s largest biological and chemical arsenals. It has stockpiles of anthrax, cholera, and plague, as well as eight industrial facilities for producing chemical agents—any of which could be launched at Seoul by the army’s conventional artillery<span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. </span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">If the governing infrastructure in Pyongyang were to unravel, the result could be widespread lawlessness (compounded by the guerrilla mentality of the Kim Family Regime’s armed forces</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">),</span></span> as well as mass migration out of and within North Korea. In short, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">North Korea’s potential for anarchy is equal to that of Iraq, and the potential for the deployment of weapons of mass destruction—either during or after pre-collapse fighting—is far greater</span>. For a harbinger of the kind of chaos that looms on the peninsula consider Albania, which was for some years the most anarchic country in post-Communist Eastern Europe, save for war-torn Yugoslavia. On a visit to Albania before the Stalinist regime there finally collapsed, I saw vicious gangs of boys as young as eight harassing people. North Korea is reportedly plagued by the same phenomenon outside of its showcase capital. That may be an indication of what lies ahead. In fact, what terrifies South Koreans more than North Korean missiles is North Korean refugees pouring south. The Chinese, for their part, have nightmare visions of millions of North Korean refugees heading north over the Yalu River into Manchuria. Obviously<span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span></span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">it would be reckless not to worry about North Korea’s missile and WMD technologies. </span>In August, there were reports yet again that Kim Jong Il was preparing an underground nuclear test. And the North test fired seven missiles in July. According to U.S. data, three of the missiles were Scud-Cs, and three were No-dong-As with ranges of 300 to 1,000 miles; <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">all were capable of carrying a nuclear warhead</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span></span> (Whether North Korea has such warheads is not definitively known, but it is widely believed to have in the neighborhood of ten—and the KFR certainly has the materials and technological know-how to build them.) The third type of missile, a Taep’o-dong-2, has a range of 2,300 to 9,300 miles, which means it <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">could conceivably hit the continental United States</span>. Though the Taep’o-dong-2 failed after takeoff during the recent testing, it did so at the point of maximum dynamic pressure—the same point where the space shuttle Challenger exploded, and the moment when things are most likely to go wrong. So this is likely not an insoluble problem for the KFR.<br />

At first glance, it seems that trade deals would stand a better chance of ratification following the Republican Party<span style="font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";">’</span>s victory in securing control of the lower house of Congress. Republican lawmakers have tended to be more free-trade oriented than many of their Democratic counterparts. The South Korea, Colombia and Panama deals were all negotiated by a Republican administration. A number of Democrats oppose the pacts, in part on the grounds that labour and human rights are not sufficiently protected (in the case of Colombia), and in part because they believe that such agreements result in the export of US jobs. In Panama<span style="font-family: "Arial Unicode MS";">’</span>s case, the lack of a bilateral tax treaty was the main obstacle. The Democrats dominance in the outgoing Congress limited the prospect of ratification for these accords. Yet <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">even with a Republican House</span> of Representatives <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">and a larger Republican bench in the Senate, passage of free-trade deals is not assured. The South Korea accord, which got top priority in th</span>e Obama <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">White House</span>, was revised in recent talks with the South Korean government that concluded in early December. It might therefore stand the best chance of being submitted to Congress first. If ratified, it will be the biggest trade deal for the US since the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force in 1994. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">President needs to push hard It is unclear how much political capital Mr Obama is willing, o</span>r able, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">to expend on the other</span> two a<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">greements</span>, with Panama and Colombia, where the stakes are lower. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">While in theory he should be able to forge agreement with the Republican leadership, both sides will still have to convince elements within their camps.</span> On <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Democratic side, opponents to free-trade pacts include </span>the AFL-CIO and other <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">organised labour groups and the more liberal members </span>of the party, including outgoing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">On the Republican side</span>, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">several leaders have strong pro-trade credentials</span>, including the next Speaker of the House John Boehner and current party whip Eric Cantor. Pro-traders are in line for leadership roles on the key House Ways and Means Committee. A boost in the Senate will come from the election of Rob Portman, who served as US Trade Representative under President Bush and who describes himself as the quarterback of the successful drive to ratify another accord, the Central American Free-Trade Agreement (CAFTA), in 2005.<br />

Why is the pact important? South Korea is a crucial ally to the United States in Asia, serving as a counterpoint to both North Korea and China. The leadership of the country is pro-U.S. and deserving of support. President Lee Myung-bak has long put his political capital behind securing the agreement, but had promised early on not to alter the terms of the original deal inked in 2007. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Now that the provisions have been tweaked in response to U.S. interests, Lee could face opposition.</span> The floor leader of the opposing Democratic Party has described the changes as “humiliating” and renounced the deal. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Lee’s party holds a majority of 171 seats in the 299- seat legislature, and is pushing for a quick vote.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Much of the debate over the past decade has been about whether legalization would be an unjust reward for &quot;lawbreakers.&quot; The status quo, however, rewards everyone who has ever benefited from the cheap, disposable labor provided by illegal workers. To start to fix the situation, everyone - undocumented workers, employers, consumers, lawmakers - has to admit their errors and make amends.</span><br />
<u>The lost decade produced big, bold plans for social engineering. It was a 10-year quest for a grand bargain that would repair the entire system at once, through enforcement, ID cards, legalization, a temporary worker program and more. <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Fierce cloakroom battles</span> were also fought</strong> over the shape and size of legal immigration. <strong><span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">Visa categories</span> became a venue for <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">ideological competition</span> between business</strong>, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and elements of labor, led by the AFL-CIO, over regulation of the labor market: whether to keep it tight to boost wages or keep it loose to boost growth.</u><br />
<strong>Immigration is a wedge issue – causes divisiveness, not consensus</strong><br />
<strong>Suro, 12/26</strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (Roberto, 12/26/10, Washington Post, “A lost decade for immigration reform,” Factiva, JMP)</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Perhaps 10 years ago, someone like George W. </span><u>Bush might reasonably have imagined that immigration policy was a good place to resolve some very basic social and economic issues. Since then, however, <strong>the rhetoric around the issue has become so swollen and angry that it <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">inflames everything it touches.</span></strong> Keeping the battles small might increase the chance that each side will win some. But, as we learned with the Dream Act, even taking small steps at this point will require rebooting the discourse.</u><br />
<u>Not long ago</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, certainly a decade ago, </span><u>immigration was often described as an issue of strange bedfellows because it did not divide people neatly along partisan or ideological lines.</u><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">That world is gone now. Instead, </span><strong><u>elements of both parties are <span style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 0in;">using immigration as a wedge issue</span>. The intended result is cleaving, not consensus.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> This year, many Republicans campaigned on vows, sometimes harshly stated, to crack down on illegal immigration. Meanwhile, many Democrats tried to rally Hispanic voters by demonizing restrictionists on the other side.</span><br />

Today <span class="underline">the political clouds of nativism are swirling in </span>Washington,<span class="underline"> DC</span>. President <span class="underline">Obama and the</span> US <span class="underline">Congress,</span> reacting to the ongoing political backlash against financial institutions, have <span class="underline">passed a bill restricting US financial companies from</span> hiring foreign nationals on <span class="underline">H-1B visas</span>. These visas are the most common type of employment permits for foreigners and have traditionally been a pathway to full citizenship. Before the ink on the bill had dried, the country's largest financial institution, Bank of America, announced it would rescind job offers from foreign MBA students. <span class="underline">The nativist logic is clear</span>: with US unemployment heading towards 10 percent and perhaps beyond, nativists question why US companies hire foreigners to perform jobs that out-of-work Americans could perform. I personally have experienced the building xenophobia. Articles that I have published explaining the economic benefits of <span class="underline">open doors immigration policies have created enormous backlash</span>. I have received overtly threatening emails and hundreds of unpleasant messages telling me, in no uncertain terms, that skilled immigrants are no longer welcome here. I have received arguments that are familiar derivations of the nativist logic. Xenophobes claim that immigrants on H-1B visas are paid less than comparable American workers and depress wages. Others argue that immigrants crowd out Americans in similar positions, causing US-born students to lose interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (&quot;STEM&quot;) fields and to stop seeking education and employment in those critical areas. They add that immigrants filing for patents are displacing Americans who might have filed for patents but could not get good science-related jobs.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">While the midterm elections didn't result in the kind of political upheaval that had been forecast before they took place, November 2nd did deliver Republican control to the House of Representatives</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. Now that Congress is split between a Democratic Senate and a Republican House</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, what will become of comprehensive immigration reform? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Will the next two years bring substantive change to the system of United States immigration? Not likely. </span>It has been twenty-five years since the last significant changes were made to the U.S. immigration laws.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> It would be heartening if the wave of newly-elected Republicans picked up where one of their &quot;founding fathers,&quot; Ronald Reagan, left off in the 1980s but </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the Republican platform on immigration differs so dramatically from the Democrats' that it would be nearly impossible with the slim margins that each party holds over the other</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Comprehensive immigration reform may be out of the question: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">any legislation that makes it through the House will be squashed in the Senate and vice versa. The Obama administration</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> for its part </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has carried on with business-as-usual</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Bush-era </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">tactics </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of local and business-based immigration enforcement, without </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">pushing real federal reform through the legislature in Congress</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Our government's reliance on costly deportations and ICE enforcement wastes countless man-hours, stymies economic growth and continues to drain public resources. The longer this wait goes on, the more money our government loses: both in hefty administrative costs as well as lost tax revenue. If comprehensive immigration reform is off the table, then </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">perhaps we should set our sights lower and hope for smaller pieces of legislation</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, like the DREAM Act. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The DREAM Act</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, which has come before the Senate as recently as September 21, 2010, would provide the opportunity to earn conditional permanent residency to certain inadmissible or deportable alien students who graduate from US high schools, are of good moral character, arrived in the U.S. as minors, and have been in the country continuously for at least five years prior to the bill's enactment. Said students would be required to complete two years in the military or two years at a four year institution of higher learning. Most recently the bill </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">failed to gain cloture </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">with a vote of 56-43, only 4 votes short of overcoming a filibuster by senators opposed to the bill. Without the pressure of the midterm elections, perhaps this bill would receive more support a second time around, but </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">the 2012 elections are not so far away themselves</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. In case you're not familiar with the auspicious trajectory of the DREAM act, a similar version of the bill made it to Congress in 2001 and failed. It was later incorporated into the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 and failed then too. Then yet again in the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. Later it was added as an amendment to the 2008 Department of Defense Authorization Bill where it ultimately failed again. In 2009, again, the DREAM Act was introduced to Congress and, once again, failed to gain the support it needed. That brings us back to the 2010 incarnation of the bill, which-as mentioned before-failed to gain cloture. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Each incarnation of the DREAM Act has been revised and rebranded to earn it the support it needs to finally pass but to no avail</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Will moderate Democrats who lost their seats in the November election finally lend their support before their replacements are sworn in in January? Only time will tell. Certainly this has not been an easy piece of legislation to push through and the difficulties it has met are representative of the general forces at play that inhibit immigration reform in general. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Immigration is an incendiary topic and one of biggest wedge issues still at play on the national stage. The abortion debate</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for example, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">has grown largely qu</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">iet over the last several years. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The flames that fuel the immigration debate</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, on the other hand</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, have been stoked</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> by measures like Arizona's SB 1070 law, which criminalizes a civil matter and deputizes police officers to practice federal law. Other similar laws are in the pipeline in states like Nebraska, Utah and Texas. These controversial actions are a direct response to the public's frustration with the broken immigration system and with Washington's seeming refusal to address them</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">. The history of the DREAM Act is itself a metaphor for immigration reform in this country. Everyone seems to have an opinion about it but not one voice has been able to rise above the discord</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Nearly every year a piece of immigration reform legislation comes before Congress,</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> much as the DREAM Act has, and </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">meets insurmountable barriers</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. If the past has anything to teach us, it's that </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">these measures stand as little a chance of passing</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> this year as they ever have, and yet we'll keep hoping and trying until one day it finally does</span><br />

<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">The cumbersome process of enacting legislation interferes with the President's ability to get his legislative agenda through Congress</span> much as it hinders direct congressional control of agency policy-setting. <span class="MsoHyperlink">196</span> <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">A President has a limited amount of political capital he can use to press for a legislative agenda, and precious little time to get his agenda enacted</span>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">197</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> These constraints prevent the President from marshalling through Congress all but a handful of statutory provisions</span> reflecting his policy [*39] vision. Although such provisions, if carefully crafted, can significantly alter the perspectives with which agencies and courts view regulation, such judicial and administrative reaction is not likely to occur quickly. Even after such reaction occurs, a substantial legacy of existing regulatory policy will still be intact.

<span class="StyleStyleBold"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Light 99</span></span> (Paul C., Senior Fellow at the Center for Public Service , the President’s Agenda: Domestic Policy Choice from Kennedy to Clinton, 3rd Edition p. 34)<br />
In the final chapter, I will take a deeper look at recent changes which have altered the domestic agenda process. The Presidency of the 1980s is quite different from the Presidency of the 1960s. <span class="underline">The political </span>and economic<span class="underline"> costs of domestic programs have escalated, with no corresponding increase in the President's ability to </span><em>absorb the &quot;inflation</em><span class="underline">.&quot; At least five explanations arise. First, Congress has become more competitive in the search for </span><em>scarce agenda space</em><span class="underline">—</span>whether because of changes in congressional membership and norms or because of a steady growth in the institutional resources for program initiation.<span class="underline"> Second, Congress has become more complex</span>. The evolution of subcommittee government during the late 1960s increased the sheer number of actors who wield influence in the domestic policy process and tangled the legislative road map. Though there are fewer single obstacles to passage of the President's program, <span class="underline">there are many more potential dead ends and delays. Third, as </span>Congress has become more competitive and complex<span class="underline">, the congressional parties have weakened. The dispersion of congressional power has, </span>in turn<span class="underline">, reduced the President's potential influence over domestic legislation. </span>As we shall see, party is no longer the &quot;gold standard&quot; of presidential influence. Unfortunately<span class="underline">, Presidents must still cling to their party as the source of their political capital. Fourth, Presidents must now conduct domestic policy under increasing congressional and media surveillance.</span> I will suggest that this atmosphere of suspicion has reduced the opportunities for effective presidential leadership in domestic policy. Finally, and perhaps most important, the basic issues that fuel the domestic policy process have changed since 1960.<span class="underline"> We have witnessed the rise of a new group of &quot;constituentless&quot; issues, issues that generate remarkably little congressional support and considerable single-interest-group opposition</span>. Energy, social-security financing, welfare reform, and hospital-cost control are all examples of a new generation of constituentless issues<u>. <span class="underline">Separately these five trends have created difficult problems for the President's agenda. Together they have contributed to the rise of a </span></u><em>No Win Presidency</em><span class="underline"> in domestic affairs</span>. We will return to the concept of a No Win Presidency in chapter 9. For now, it is important to note that the domestic policy process continues to shift. In the few short years since Kennedy and Johnson occupied the Oval Office the Presidency has undergone a dramatic era of change. As one Johnson aide remarked, &quot;This office is nothing like it used to be. It might look similar, but the relationships have all changed. Lyndon wouldn't like it one bit.&quot;<br />

To that end, Light says, Obama has made a mistake in making Pelosi his &quot;broker,&quot; spending his political capital but not always to his benefit.<br />

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">ONE, HOSTILITY TO LIFE. Talking about others is just what many people do. Telling people to stop talking about others is akin to telling them to stop talking. Describing it as “charity cannibalism” or a “victim economy” is hostile to the way people live, teaching people to hate themselves. </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">MILLER 1</span></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> (David, Rescuing media power, Sept, Vol 4) </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> But in the real world, as E.P. Thompson argued, <u>experience</u>: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> &quot;... <u>walks in without knocking at the door, and announces deaths, crises of subsistence, trench warfare, unemployment, inflation, genocide. People starve: their survivors think in new ways about the market. People are imprisoned:</u> in prison they meditate in new ways about the law&quot; (Thompson, 1981: 406). </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">By contrast the approaches to identity we have been discussing do not explain the process by which people accept ideas or reject them, they do not explain how ideas change or the way in which changing material circumstances occasion changes in thought. The proponents of discursive theory would object to this division between material circumstances and ideas. One such theorist is Joan Scott (1991) who has explicitly challenged the &quot;evidence of experience&quot;. According to her, &quot;we need to attend to the historical processes that, through discourse, position subjects and produce their experiences. It is not individuals who have experience but subjects who are constituted through experience&quot; (Scott, 1991: 779). Later she writes of the need &quot;to refuse a separation between &quot;experience&quot; and language and to insist instead on the productive quality of discourse&quot; (Scott, 1991: 793). </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;"> But language does not create new experiences, and new experience does not only occur if the subject has an appropriate language category with which to name it — this is perhaps why people so frequently say things such as: &quot;I can't make sense of this,&quot; &quot;I can't quite express what I mean.&quot; Scott attempts to address this point in her discussion of agency. She writes: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;"> &quot;Subjects are constituted discursively and experience is a linguistic event — it doesn't happen outside established meanings — but neither is it confined to a fixed order of meaning. Since discourse is by definition shared, experience is collective as well as individual. Experience can both confirm what is already known — we see what we have learned to see — and upset what has been taken for granted — when different meanings are in conflict we read just our vision to take account of the conflict or to resolve it; that is what is meant by 'learning from experience' though not everyone learns the same lesson or learns it at the same time or in the same way&quot; (Scott, 1991: 793) </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;"> But this is not what is meant by learning from experience. This is especially the case when the &quot;established meanings&quot; do not match up to our experiences of the material world. It is precisely for this reason that new words are coined and new meanings born. Look again at the passage above — &quot;when different meanings are in conflict we read just our vision.&quot; The key problem for this account is that it cannot explain how the meanings we now have came into existence and how meanings might change. In the absence of either the flow of material events or human agency meanings could not be created and nor would they have to change. To follow this theory we would have to accept that the meanings which are found in the work of Joan Scott — and other post-structuralists — emerged fully formed with the evolution of the first human and have circulated without change throughout all of human history. Australopithicus as the first postmodernist. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;"> Our point is that language is adapted and developed in the ceaseless flow of human activity. These activities create new relationships and possibilities which can be conceptualised and named. New concepts and their description can develop with new relationships. For example, the phrase &quot;living beyond your means&quot; necessarily presupposes a society with the capacity to develop a surplus, a method of trading it and a system of credit. Without these, in a subsistence economy, people would have their means of surviving and would consume them. It would be inconceivable to &quot;live beyond&quot; them. This raises the interesting question of how new words and definitions develop and how they are &quot;worked upon&quot; to be appropriate for specific purposes. This is crucial because our view is that language is purposive and is used by active cognizing subjects. The level of reflection in use and &quot;work&quot; will certainly vary according to circumstance. But we do not accept the radical de-centering of the subject in contemporary post-modern accounts and the view that subjects merely &quot;hail&quot; passing discourses and are &quot;positioned&quot; by them. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>In practice people actively make sense of and give meaning to their world and in doing so they use different resources, such as the media or new information from peer groups</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">Our colleague Jenny Kitzinger has shown, how women engage in collective sense making on issues such as male violence. She illustrates how a group of women can re-define and name what they already &quot;felt&quot; about past experience — but which had in a sense been inappropriately named and defined. She describes a focus group discussion in which women comment upon a poster which had been produced for a campaign against male violence. The poster included the statement that fifty percent of girls would encounter some form of abuse. At first the women in the group dissented from this but as they discussed the issue they came to the conclusion that they had in fact all experienced some form of sexual contact which was at the very least, &quot;unwanted&quot; if not outrightly abusive. The discussion ended with these comments from three women (Kitzinger, 1999: 16-17): The women in this group are not simply &quot;hailing&quot; another discourse at random, nor is their sense of what happened determined by a new (feminist) discourse. They work on the possibility of explaining and giving expression to what they have already felt and experienced. The attempt to force someone off is a real and profoundly felt response but what had happened had not been thought through or clearly defined as an assault. As Thompson suggested the effect of grim experience is to create the possibility of meditating on new ways of explaining it. It may first be named in a way which is inappropriate or be met with incomprehension. It is not uncommon for people to &quot;feel&quot; that an existing explanation or definition is not right. They may then have to struggle to adapt words and find new ways of explaining what was only partly identified or understood. This can involve them in making new meanings rather than just being spoken through by the ventriloquism of discourse. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">Our final objections to</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>the discursive approach</u> are then its idealism and its consequent inability to relate to material process. It <u>is just <strong>so implausibly neat</strong> in its portrayal of the well ordered conceptual structures which allegedly organise what can be seen and known. It is not surprising that its <strong>theorists rarely attempt to measure or account for public consciousness through empirical work.</strong> Such consciousness in practise is very messy — a mass of sometimes half understood concepts and ideas, bits of information</u> </span>from the media and peer groups, jokes, fears, memories of childhood, school, home and work experiences,<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> judgements about what is true, fair, legitimate, desirable, and what is necessary and what is possible, responses from social and political cultures which often contain quite contradictory beliefs</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Within such consciousness it is possible to discern ways of understanding, perspectives and responses</span></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">which relate to factors such as class, ethnicity or gender and which are formed in relation to social interests. Such ideologies do function to limit what can be understood, but our point is that they are potentially unstable in the flow of material circumstances, they are contradictory and are contested. The manner in which all these different elements of social consciousness develop and change over time can only be established through empirical work. In contrast, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">the theories of identity</span></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">— as an effect of discourse — </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">which we have discussed here, are simply speculative and are constructed independently of any account of how people think and act in the world</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">. </span><br />

<span style="margin-right: -6.3pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">Ironically, the Foucauldian paradigm, which postmodernists often evoke to buttress their claims, itself helps make visible the reason why</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">making</span> women’s <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">psyche the site of the analysis</span></strong> of rape or of rape prevention <span style="background-color: yellow;">is <strong>a depoliticizing gesture</strong></span> for feminist politics</u>. As Foucault’s work has shown, <u>the history of the modern subject has been one of depoliticization carried out mostly through the construction of a psychologized and ahistorical subject</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">In the nineteenth century, medical, legal, religious, and social discourses came together to construct the now naturalized idea of sex as the secret of the individual’s being, thus concealing the “power/ knowledge” involved in creating the notion of sex as essence.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>Turning the “minor chronicle of sex”</u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">and “inconsequential bucolic pleasures”</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>into the prediscursive core of the individual was <strong>a successful “ruse” of power</strong> <span style="background-color: yellow;">that would <strong>keep the subject focused on changing the inner self rather than on addressing power relations. A whole system</strong> of institutional, cultural, and economic practices and social inequities was <strong>obscured</strong> when inner transformation was established as the only genuine means of achieving social change</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">. <u>The psychological and inner realm—that is, the individual’s “center”—<strong>overrode</strong> material considerations</u></span>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">Similarly, Nancy Armstrong’s Foucauldian reading of the history of the novel reveals the domestic novel to have been instrumental in producing the ideal of the modern individual as psychological reality. Written representations of the self replaced the aristocratic ideal of “the family name” with “moral value” and of attractive and opulent surface with psychological and emotional depth. Armstrong (1987) explains that, with its presumptions of naturalness, this new female ideal (which would become the prototype of the modern individual) removed subjectivity and sexuality from their place in political history. Indeed, </span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">“<span style="background-color: yellow;">to define political resistance in such psychological terms was to remove it from the snarl of competing social and economic interests</span> in which every individual was entangled</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">” (1987, 252). <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">In emphasizing inner life as the source of being and happiness, the middle class could <strong>justify social hierarchies</strong> in moral rather than economic terms</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> <u>When postmodern analyses locate rape prevention inside women’s psyches, <span style="background-color: yellow;">they ironically <strong>replicate modern techniques of power</strong> even as they seek to challenge them</span></u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">Nineteenth-century hegemonic culture has left an indelible mark on our own times. Although postmodern feminism problematizes nineteenth-century assumptions by replacing naturalizing premises with social constructionist ones, it too runs the risk of displacing the subject’s locatedness in history and culture when it advocates an inner revolution as the more efficient site, for instance, of rape prevention. As Wendy Brown points out in her critique of identity politics, “The question here is not whether denaturalizing political strategies subvert the subjugating force of naturalized identity formation, but what kind of politicization, produced out of and inserted into what kind of political context, might perform such subversion” (1995, 55<u>).</u></span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> In the current political context, locating rape prevention in women’s <span style="background-color: yellow;">self-reflexivity</span></span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> vis-a`-vis their own imbrication in wider cultural dynamics <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">runs the risk of becoming <strong>a new form of panopticism</strong>, an interiorized and individualized system of surveillance</span> by which every woman becomes her own overseer</u>. <u>It is as if</u>, </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">having noted the failure of the panopcon project to reform criminals individually</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">, <u>we now applied it to their victims by gradually asking women to police their own behavioral and mental maps. Rather than question the principle of self-surveillance itself, <span style="background-color: yellow;">we thus merely change its object</span></u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">The focus on power over one’s social and discursive conditioning vacates the conflict between power relations and the autonomy of the self. It makes women’s lack of reflexive examination the new grounds for explaining male domination and for holding them responsible for their subordination</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">The “technologies of the self”</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> (to use Foucault’s later terminology) <u>thus overcome the materiality of the body insofar as such a focus locates the source of male violence in the female subject’s failure to reinvent the self</u>.14 <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Its <strong>individualistic mode</strong> <strong>conflates social contestation and self-constitution and undermines the social and political solidarity</strong> necessary to combat relations of domination</span></u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">such as rape. Representing women as the peacekeepers of rape culture will only result in making them responsible for the war they could not prevent. Although it highlights the constructedness of identity,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>such process of self-scrutiny is no more liberating than the Christian tradition of inwardness</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">Grounding rape prevention in the reinvention of the female self implies that the fight against sexual violence depends on and has to be preceded by the individualized questioning of normalized female subjectivity.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Such critical hermeneutics of the self <strong>will not only fail</strong></span> <strong>to diffuse male violence</strong>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">but it will also corroborate the</span></u> metaleptic <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">cultural narrative of victims as the source of their own problems</span></u>. <u>Hegemonic culture typically represents women as dominated by inner and complicated compulsions that require personalized self-help rather than political transformation. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Advocating the microlevel cultivation of</span> female <span style="background-color: yellow;">self-knowledge and inwardness</span> as deterrent to rape <span style="background-color: yellow;">is bound to <strong>compound this slide into therapeutic discourse</strong>.</span></u> </span> </span><br />

On the other hand, <span style="background-color: yellow;">to the degree that immigration categories have become naturalized</span> and that judging individuals' legal identities have become common social practices, <span style="background-color: yellow;">the ways that immigration law shapes individuals' lives may be hidden</span></u>. 533 <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">The result of the concealment of social forces</span></u> that Coutin recognizes <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">has been the essentialization of immigrants, through which social problems are characterized as individual</span></u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">and innate. 534 In this sense, Menjivar offers an admirable model in her own project of examining the experiences of Salvadoran immigrants in the context of the political, social, and legal setting in which they were received. 535 She concludes that the ability of immigrant social networks to distribute material resources is deeply connected to &quot;extrapersonal factors such as immigration laws and the labor market&quot; that &quot;shape the structure of opportunities for immigrants.&quot; 536 Her main contribution to this analysis is her argument that her subjects</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">' <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">experiences cannot be understood <strong>without serious attention</strong> to the &quot;mighty influence&quot; of &quot;the broader context of [their] reception</span></u>.&quot; </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">537 Following Menjivar's lead allows for a more context-specific approach to theorizing individuals that acknowledges the power of the law both to create categories of human identity and entitlement, and to naturalize those categories.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Acknowledging contextual realities and the way they shape individual decisions and behaviors <strong>combats the tendency of theoretical and public discourses to essentialize immigrants</strong></span><strong>.</strong> <span style="background-color: yellow;">Recognizing social problems as such, <strong>rather than individualizing them, also opens the door for a more realistic and feasible response to the problems in immigrants' lives</strong></span><strong>.</strong></u> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">As Warner notes, <u>feelings of shame and marginalization are difficult (if not impossible) to overcome in isolation: “Visceral private meaning is not easy to alter by oneself,</u> by a free act of will. <u>It can only be altered through exchanges that <strong>go beyond self-expression</strong></u> to the making of a collective scene of disclosure.”76 The demonstrations can be thought of as such a moment of disclosure—as a space in which participants publicly celebrated and legitimated the presence of the undocumented in American society. According to Warner, such scenes of association and identity transform the private lives they mediate: “Homosexuals can exist in isolation; but gay people or queers exist by virtue of the world they elaborate together, and gay or queer identity is always fundamentally inflected by the nature of that world.”77 Similarly, <u>one is “illegal” in isolation, but in elaborating <strong>a common world,</strong> marchers challenged the state’s ability to define the parameters of membership</u>. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Richard Viguerie, a key figure of the New Right, has located the political success of the conservatives in their turn to &quot;gut-level issues.&quot;'' But it is perhaps more accurate to say that <u>the conservative strategy transforms political struggles into &quot;gut&quot; issues.</u> After all, <u>no issue is intrinsically a gut issue; it is produced as such only by reducing the complexity of the debates,</u> </span>the various interpretations and contradictions that surround it, to a matter of affective investment.<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>The conservative strategy depends upon a logic in which the fact of the &quot;gut commitment&quot; becomes more important than the content of the commitment itself</u>. It is a strategy which seeks political power by tactically dissociating itself from politics. </span>In the end,<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> political realities seem to matter less than political commitments.

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Moreover, <u>the privileging of the self,</u> personal experiences, and individual perspectives of reality intrinsic in the conversational paradigm <strong><u>mirrors justifications once used by dominant groups</u></strong> <u>who used their own lives, beliefs, and interests as templates for hegemonic social premises to oppress women, the lower class, and people of color.</u> Paradigms infused with the therapeutic language of emotional healing and coping likewise flirt with the type of psychological diagnoses once ascribed to disaffected women. But as Betty Friedan's landmark 1963 The Feminist Mystique argued, the cure for female alienation was neither tranquilizers nor attitude adjustments fostered through psychotherapy but, rather, unrestricted opportunities.102 <u>The price exacted by promoting approaches to complex public issues</u>—models that cast conventional deliberative processes, <strong><u>including the marshaling of evidence beyond individual subjectivity, as &quot;elitist&quot;</u></strong> or &quot;monologic&quot;—<u>can be steep</u>. <u>Consider comments of an aide to</u> President <u>George W.

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Who is Baudrillard to say things like “all ev is dissuasive”? The acceleration of evidence can mean a lot of things and none of what they said is really applicable to what’s happening in this debate </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">There are major flaws with their arguments: </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">A. Evidence. Little of your arguments about evidence being dissuasive have any evidence or warrant behind them. We’re not saying believe in hard science or anything but at least require some ev that people think the way you do. Remember that nothing that Baudrillard has written is based on any ethnography or even some kind of attempt to demonstrate that his thinking is correct. It’s not like he interviews anyone or demonstrates the ways in which people are not persuaded by ideas even if they accumulate. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">B. Not us. His examples are largely based on the media. The media is his major concern -- not debate. They have to win that everything we’ve said is similar to the hyper-reality that’s created by the media. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">C. It’s non-verifiable. Arguments like theirs depend on a paradox: I have no ev that ev is bad but ev is bad. They just assert that that it objectifies the world and causes us be filled with inertia. Well maybe Baudrillard was filled with intertia but maybe he could’ve probably laid off the sauce. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">D. It’s too one-sided. Evidence, even it accumulation, means a lot of things. Your ev is one-dimensional in its understanding of effect. Sure, some people eat up what certain media outlets pump out. But people resist what they hear in the media and some people champion it. Even we do: We are persuaded by evidence all the time? You probably cut cards that make args that are persuasive to you. Persuasion in debate does exist. Even if all of your ev is correct we should hold out the hope that communication can influence people. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">E. The reverse can be just as likely. The accumulation of evidence gives meaning to life. We are constantly bombarded by ideas but the way we pick through them is part of what gives meaning to life. </span><br />
<br />

<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Once one understands Baudrillard’s</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> simulacrum <u>thesis</u>—not only have media-generated appearances become more important than reality, they have essentially replaced reality—<u>one can anticipate his take on any number of subjects. <span style="background-color: yellow;">His responses are</span></u> algorithmic, <strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">virtually preprogrammed</span></u></strong>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">This is certainly true for his short book on America, which has also been one of his most successful to judge by the amount of media attention it has received. After all, what other criteria are there in a postmodern universe where, according to Baudrillard, “there are no definitions possible. . . . It has all been done. . . . It has destroyed itself. It has deconstructed its entire universe. So all that are left are the pieces. Playing with the pieces—that is postmodern”?54 As a postmodernist, much of Baudrillard’s theorizing is ironic. Yet once one penetrates the veneer of rhetorical playfulness, one finds a recycled, francophone version of the idea of America as degeneration incarnate—the same image proffered by Spengler and Heidegger, now outfitted with a French accent. Baudrillard’s analyses and observations thereby intersect with another pivotal Counter-Enlightenment thematic: the idea of the “end of history” or posthistoire.55</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">According to this notion, democratic attempts</span></u> to transcend the political culture of the ancien régime <strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">are predestined to failure</span></u></strong>. <u>Such efforts will not merely founder, for although they consider themselves to be “progressive,” in reality they will result in unprecedented misery and chaos</u>— </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">ultimately, in the advent of a new barbarism or “dark ages.” Here, too, the fashionable assault on modernity proffered by postmodernism dovetails with the standpoint of earlier Counter-Enlightenment thinkers. For Baudrillard America represents a negative utopia, the apogee of postmodern cultural suicide. From an historical and cultural point of view, America is a kind of tabula rasa: America “exorcises the question of origins, she does not cultivate the origins or mythical authenticity, she has neither a past nor a founding truth.” At times Baudrillard almost seems envious of American superficiality and glibness. Americans embody a lack of self-consciousness and depth to which Europeans could never aspire no matter how hard they might try. The watchword of this shallow American character type seems to be “Smile if you have nothing to say, and don’t hide above all that you have nothing to say. Show spontaneously the void, the profound indifference of your smile. . . . Illustrate the zero-degree of joy and pleasure, smile, smile!”56 Baudrillard is obsessed with American obesity—that is, those Americans who are not anorexic. As one observer has aptly quipped, “The fact that Baudrillard calls Americans fat, dumb, and uncultured is surely no reason to think that he is anti-American.”57 In America life no longer imitates art; instead, life and art—above all, cinematic art—have essentially exchanged places. Life itself now appears as an inferior incarnation of cinematic “hyperreality.” As Baudrillard observes, “In America the cinema is true because . . . the whole mode of life is cinemagraphic: life is cinema.” The same confusion of illusion and reality is true of America’s gargantuan theme parks like Disneyland. According to Baudrillard, “Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation.”58 In America qua Mecca of hyperreality, the relationship between image and reality has simply reversed itself. Unlike Nietzsche and Heidegger,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Baudrillard presumably did actually travel to the land he was describing</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> Yet one of the strange features of his narrative is that although he describes a myriad of tourist sites, <strong><u>he <span style="background-color: yellow;">reproduces not a single conversation with a “real” American</span></u></strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;"> But since Baudrillard’s theoretical perspective on American life was fully worked out before he departed, perhaps such a conversation would have been in any event superfluous. For all Baudrillard’s predictability, there is no denying that, on occasion, he expresses a clever formulation or witty insight. But, ultimately, how seriously should we take a social philosopher who recommends that his books be treated like science fiction novels or Borgesesque ficciones? Very much so, insofar as Baudrillard’s clichéridden view of American society has become standard issue among academic postmodernists. Like his precursors on the European right,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Baudrillard believes that human actors are powerless to implement meaningful social change.</span></u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">The die has been cast. “Hyperrealilty”—the reign of the “simulacrum”—confronts us as an ineluctable fate, an inexorable, postmodern condition humaine. The amor fati celebrated by Germany’s conservative revolutionaries has been updated and recycled, only to reemerge as one of the commonplaces of ivory tower radical chic. Yet as Baudrillard’s critics have observed, his peculiar combination of epistemological skepticism and political nihilism accord with “a postmodern mood of widespread cynical acquiescence,” resulting in a form of theory that is “ill-equipped to mount any kind of effective critical resistance.” 59 There is no point in trying to combat today’s “captains of consciousness,” since all criticism and contestation end up recycled by the culture industry’s vast semio-technological maw. In the epitome of postmodern political fatalism, the only strategy Baudrillard has to recommend is “death”: solely by aping the information society’s own lifelessness and inertia—a practice he refers to as “crystal revenge”—does one stand a chance, argues Baudrillard, of escaping its enervating clutches.60 Thus, according to Baudrillard, the implosions of media society portend the collapse of the emancipatory project in general.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">His verdict on the <strong>impossibility</strong> of progressive historical change reiterates one of the commonplaces of <strong>reactionary rhetoric</strong>: the so-called futility thesis, according to which attempts to transform society are <strong>condemned a priori</strong> to failure</span></u>.61 </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Even if I make the move of turning courage into an existential entity by claiming that any direct understanding of our demise is impossible, it would still make little sense to directly import Aristotle’s notion of courage, because doing so would seem to imply that facing the fear of one’s own existential death is somehow related to the ultimate terminus of the warrior’s situation: <u>either I die or the other dies. However, this is exactly not the attitude required in dialogue</u>. <u>Instead, the attitude required in dialogue is one that preserves both parties. In dialogue, the participants are boldly withstanding fear, but not for the aim of destroying an enemy other</u></span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">. </span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">To address this problem, I first turn to Paul Tillich, who examines the courage to be as the ability to affirm one’s self in the face of non-being.11 Tillich claims that courage and anxiety are interdependent, that anxiety is the state in which being is aware of its possible non-being:12 Courage does not remove anxiety. Since anxiety is existential, it cannot be removed. But courage takes the anxiety of nonbeing into itself. Courage is the self-affirmation “in spite of,” namely in spite of non-being. He who acts courageously takes, in his self-affirmation, the anxiety of non-being upon himself.… Anxiety turns us towards courage, because the other alternative is despair. Courage resists despair by taking anxiety unto itself.13 When anxiety strikes, we might choose suicide and affirm our ontic, physical non- being, or we might affirm meaninglessness by giving up on the possibility of meaning, or we might refuse to act in order to avoid the feeling of guilt. For Tillich, courage is what allows us to move in the opposite direction from these various affirmations. Courage does not deny anxiety. Courage takes anxiety into itself. Tillich’s work is helpful in bringing courage from the conceptual framework of the fear of one’s physical demise to that of existential anxiety. In the case of dialogue, the person who faces the uncanniness, the pervasive fear of nothingness, the prospect that I can become “not-I” and emerge as an “I” that I cannot anticipate, is someone who takes anxiety upon himself and affirms himself in spite of it. In the space of facing the meaninglessness of that anxiety, one would return to the task of living in meaning. However, this conceptualization of courage does not entirely speak to our situation. The courage I speak of is one in which anxiety is withstood, but its exercise would not be only self-affirmation.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>Learning only the exercise of self-affirmation does not take into account the other dialogical partner. An excess of self-affirmation could be the denial of the existence of the other,</u> and this is not the courage about which I speak. Although it seems that Tillich offers us an idea of the person who does not act “in spite of non-being” as the one who cowers from anxiety, he does not offer us an idea of the person who rashly or recklessly faces anxiety. Such a conceptualization fails to reinterpret courage in such a way as to maintain its original dimensions — of having excess as well as deficiency. <u>The courage of dialogue is the courage to face anxiety, but it is the courage to face anxiety in order to maintain the integrity of both dialogical participants. In the case of dialogue, self-affirmation does not destroy the other. Rather, it maintains space for others to also affirm themselves.</u> As Tillich suggests, <u>to act “in spite of” allows the self-affirmation of the other at the same time as one affirms oneself</u>. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">In retrospect, Baudrillard’s philosophical play with the subject/object distinction, his abandonment of the subject, and <u>going over to the side of the object is a key aspect of his thought. He identifies this dichotomy with the duality of good and evil</u> in which the cultivation of the subject and its domination of the object is taken as the good within Western thought, while the sovereignty and side of the object is interwoven with the principle of evil. <u>Baudrillard’s thought is radically dualistic</u> and he takes the side of the pole within a series of dichotomies of Western thought that has generally been derided as inferior, such as <u>siding with appearance against reality, illusion over truth, evil over good, and woman over man</u>. In The Perfect Crime, Baudrillard has declared that reality has been destroyed and henceforth that we live in a world of mere appearance, a situation that Baudrillard affirms and positively valorizes. In this universe, <u>certainty and truth are impossible and Baudrillard takes the side of illusion</u>, <u>arguing</u> in Impossible Exchange <strong><u>that: “Illusion is the fundamental rule</u></strong>”.55 </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">Baudrillard also argues that the world is without meaning and that affirming meaninglessness is liberating: “If we could accept this meaninglessness of the world, then we could play with forms, appearances and our impulses, without worrying about their ultimate destination… As Cioran says, we are not failures until we believe life has a meaning – and from that point on we are failures, because it hasn’t”.56 Most controversially, Baudrillard also identifies with the principle of evil defined as that which is opposed to and against the good. There is an admittedly Manichean and Gnostic dimension to Baudrillard’s thought, as well as deep cynicism and nihilism.57 Deconstruction, however, takes apart the subject/object dichotomy indicating the impossibly of taking the side of subject or object, or of good and evil as both are interconnected with each other and there can be no pure object without subject and vice versa, an argument Adorno has made.58</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>Baudrillard’s thought is intrinsically dualistic and not dialectical</u>. His thought is self-avowedly agonistic with the duel presented in tandem with his dualism, taking on and attacking rival theories and positions. Contradictions do not bother Baudrillard, for indeed he affirms them. <u>It is thus tricky to argue with Baudrillard on strictly philosophical grounds and one needs to grasp his mode of writing, his notion of theory fictions, and <strong>to engage their saliency and effects.</strong></u> </span><br />

<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Symbolic exchange is</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> for Baudrillard <u>a revolutionary project that can transgress and deconstruct the hegemonic discourse of the code</u> because it is external to the collapsing of the signifier and signified which excludes the possibility of judgement and criticism (the code is in this respect analogous to Lefebvre’ s ‘ signal’ ). For me, however, <u>this is at best quixotic and at worst <strong>utopian</strong>.</u> Baudrillard’ s <u>anti-semiology is a <strong>hollow gesture</strong> that <strong>falls all too easily into a utopia of the peaceful surrender</strong> of the means of (re)production by capitalists.</u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">In For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign (1981), before developing a full-blown theory of symbolic exchange in Symbolic Exchange and Death (1993), Baudrillard notes, in my view correctly, that the structural relation between commodity-form and sign-form is a system in the framework of political economy and so “ is susceptible to a critique in the same way as classical political economy … because their form is the same, not their content: sign form and commodity form” (Baudrillard, 1981: 126).

<strong><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Baudrillard believes that human actors are powerless to implement meaningful social change. </span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">The die has been cast. “Hyperrealilty”—the reign of the “simulacrum”—confronts us as an ineluctable fate, an inexorable, postmodern condition humaine. The amor fati celebrated by Germany’s conservative revolutionaries has been updated and recycled, only to reemerge as one of the commonplaces of ivory tower radical chic. Yet as Baudrillard’s critics have observed, his peculiar combination of</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>epistemological skepticism and political nihilism accord with “a</u> postmodern <u>mood of widespread <strong>cynical acquiescence</strong>,” resulting in a form of theory that is “<strong>ill-equipped to mount any kind of effective critical resistance.”</strong></u> 59 <u>There is no point in trying to combat today’s “captains of consciousness,” since all criticism and contestation end up recycled</u> by the culture industry’s vast semio-technological maw. In the epitome of postmodern political fatalism, <u>the only strategy Baudrillard has to recommend is “death</u>”: solely by aping the information society’s own lifelessness and inertia—a practice he refers to as “crystal revenge”—does one stand a chance, argues Baudrillard, of escaping its enervating clutches.60 Thus, according to Baudrillard, the implosions of media society portend the collapse of the emancipatory project in general. <u>His verdict on the <strong>impossibility</strong> of progressive historical change reiterates one of the commonplaces of <strong>reactionary rhetoric</strong>: the so-called futility thesis, according to which attempts to transform society are <strong>condemned a priori</strong> to failure</u>.61 </span><br />

<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">A well functioning democracy calls for a vibrant clash of democratic political positions. If this is missing there is the danger that this <strong>democratic confrontation will be replaced by a confrontation among other forms of collective identification</strong>, as it is the case with identity politics. Too much emphasis on consensus and the <strong>refusal of confrontation lead to apathy and disaffection with political participation</strong>.</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> Worse still, <u>the result can be the crystallization of collective passions around issues, which cannot be managed by the democratic process and an <strong>explosion of antagonisms</strong> that can tear up the very basis of civility</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">It is for that reason that the ideal of a pluralist democracy cannot be to reach a rational consensus in the public sphere. Such a consensus cannot exist.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>We have to accept that every consensus exists as a temporary result of a provisional hegemony, as a stabilization of power, and that it <strong>always entails some form of exclusion</strong>.</u> <u>The idea that power could be dissolved through a rational debate and that legitimacy could be based on pure rationality are <strong>illusions</strong>, which can endanger democratic institutions.</u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">What the deliberative democracy model is denying is the dimension of undecidability and the ineradicability of antagonism, which are constitutive of the political</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">. <u>By postulating the availability of a non exclusive public sphere of deliberation where a rational consensus could be obtained, they <strong>negate the inherently conflictual nature of modern pluralism</strong>.</u> <u>They are unable to recognize that <strong>bringing a deliberation to a close always</strong> results from a decision which <strong>excludes</strong> other possibilities and for which one should never refuse to bear responsibility by invoking the commands of general rules or principles</u>. <u>This is why a perspective like “agonistic pluralism” which reveals the impossibility of establishing a consensus without exclusion is of fundamental importance for democratic politics.</u> By warning us again of the illusion that a fully achieved democracy could ever be instantiated, <u>it forces us to keep the democratic contestation alive</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">To make room for dissent and to foster the institutions in which it can be manifested is vital for a pluralist democracy and one should abandon the very idea that there could ever be a time in which it would cease to be necessary because the society is now “well ordered”.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>An “agonistic” approach acknowledges the real nature of its frontiers and the forms of exclusion that they entail, instead of trying to disguise them</u> under the veil of rationality or morality. <u>Asserting the hegemonic nature of social relations and identities, can contribute to subverting the ever-present temptation existing in democratic societies to naturalize its frontiers and essentialize its identities.</u> For this reason <u>it is much more receptive than the deliberative model to the multiplicity of voices that contemporary pluralist societies encompass and to the complexity of their power structure.</u> </span><br />

<span style="margin-right: -6.3pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">Ironically, the Foucauldian paradigm, which postmodernists often evoke to buttress their claims, itself helps make visible the reason why</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">making</span> women’s <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">psyche the site of the analysis</span></strong> of rape or of rape prevention <span style="background-color: yellow;">is <strong>a depoliticizing gesture</strong></span> for feminist politics</u>. As Foucault’s work has shown, <u>the history of the modern subject has been one of depoliticization carried out mostly through the construction of a psychologized and ahistorical subject</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">In the nineteenth century, medical, legal, religious, and social discourses came together to construct the now naturalized idea of sex as the secret of the individual’s being, thus concealing the “power/ knowledge” involved in creating the notion of sex as essence.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>Turning the “minor chronicle of sex”</u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">and “inconsequential bucolic pleasures”</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>into the prediscursive core of the individual was <strong>a successful “ruse” of power</strong> <span style="background-color: yellow;">that would <strong>keep the subject focused on changing the inner self rather than on addressing power relations. A whole system</strong> of institutional, cultural, and economic practices and social inequities was <strong>obscured</strong> when inner transformation was established as the only genuine means of achieving social change</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">. <u>The psychological and inner realm—that is, the individual’s “center”—<strong>overrode</strong> material considerations</u></span>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">Similarly, Nancy Armstrong’s Foucauldian reading of the history of the novel reveals the domestic novel to have been instrumental in producing the ideal of the modern individual as psychological reality. Written representations of the self replaced the aristocratic ideal of “the family name” with “moral value” and of attractive and opulent surface with psychological and emotional depth. Armstrong (1987) explains that, with its presumptions of naturalness, this new female ideal (which would become the prototype of the modern individual) removed subjectivity and sexuality from their place in political history. Indeed, </span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">“<span style="background-color: yellow;">to define political resistance in such psychological terms was to remove it from the snarl of competing social and economic interests</span> in which every individual was entangled</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">” (1987, 252). <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">In emphasizing inner life as the source of being and happiness, the middle class could <strong>justify social hierarchies</strong> in moral rather than economic terms</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> <u>When postmodern analyses locate rape prevention inside women’s psyches, <span style="background-color: yellow;">they ironically <strong>replicate modern techniques of power</strong> even as they seek to challenge them</span></u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">Nineteenth-century hegemonic culture has left an indelible mark on our own times. Although postmodern feminism problematizes nineteenth-century assumptions by replacing naturalizing premises with social constructionist ones, it too runs the risk of displacing the subject’s locatedness in history and culture when it advocates an inner revolution as the more efficient site, for instance, of rape prevention. As Wendy Brown points out in her critique of identity politics, “The question here is not whether denaturalizing political strategies subvert the subjugating force of naturalized identity formation, but what kind of politicization, produced out of and inserted into what kind of political context, might perform such subversion” (1995, 55<u>).</u></span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> In the current political context, locating rape prevention in women’s <span style="background-color: yellow;">self-reflexivity</span></span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> vis-a`-vis their own imbrication in wider cultural dynamics <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">runs the risk of becoming <strong>a new form of panopticism</strong>, an interiorized and individualized system of surveillance</span> by which every woman becomes her own overseer</u>. <u>It is as if</u>, </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">having noted the failure of the panopcon project to reform criminals individually</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">, <u>we now applied it to their victims by gradually asking women to police their own behavioral and mental maps. Rather than question the principle of self-surveillance itself, <span style="background-color: yellow;">we thus merely change its object</span></u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">The focus on power over one’s social and discursive conditioning vacates the conflict between power relations and the autonomy of the self. It makes women’s lack of reflexive examination the new grounds for explaining male domination and for holding them responsible for their subordination</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">The “technologies of the self”</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> (to use Foucault’s later terminology) <u>thus overcome the materiality of the body insofar as such a focus locates the source of male violence in the female subject’s failure to reinvent the self</u>.14 <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Its <strong>individualistic mode</strong> <strong>conflates social contestation and self-constitution and undermines the social and political solidarity</strong> necessary to combat relations of domination</span></u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">such as rape. Representing women as the peacekeepers of rape culture will only result in making them responsible for the war they could not prevent. Although it highlights the constructedness of identity,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>such process of self-scrutiny is no more liberating than the Christian tradition of inwardness</u>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 7pt;">Grounding rape prevention in the reinvention of the female self implies that the fight against sexual violence depends on and has to be preceded by the individualized questioning of normalized female subjectivity.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Such critical hermeneutics of the self <strong>will not only fail</strong></span> <strong>to diffuse male violence</strong>, <span style="background-color: yellow;">but it will also corroborate the</span></u> metaleptic <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">cultural narrative of victims as the source of their own problems</span></u>. <u>Hegemonic culture typically represents women as dominated by inner and complicated compulsions that require personalized self-help rather than political transformation. <span style="background-color: yellow;">Advocating the microlevel cultivation of</span> female <span style="background-color: yellow;">self-knowledge and inwardness</span> as deterrent to rape <span style="background-color: yellow;">is bound to <strong>compound this slide into therapeutic discourse</strong>.</span></u> </span></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">However, in view of his exaggeration of the alleged break with modernity, discerning whether Baudrillard's last two decades of work is best read as science fiction or theory, is undecidable. <u>Baudrillard obviously wants to have it both ways</u>77 with social theorists thinking that he provides salient perspectives on contemporary social realities, <u>that Baudrillard reveals what is really happening, that he tells it like it is</u>. And yet more cynical anti-sociologists are encouraged to enjoy Baudrillard's fictions, his experimental discourse, his games, and play. Likewise, <u>he sometimes encourages cultural metaphysicians to read his work as serious reflections on the realities of our time,</u> while winking a pataphysical aside at those skeptical of such undertakings. And Baudrillard’s philosophical writings provoke philosophers to defend their positions against his and to rethink certain tradition questions in the light of contemporary realities. Thus, <u>it is undecidable whether Baudrillard is best read as science fiction</u> and pataphysics, or as philosophy, social theory, and cultural metaphysics, and <u>whether his post-1970s work should be read under the sign of truth or fiction.</u> In retrospect, Baudrillard's early critical explorations of the system of objects and consumer society contain some of his most important contributions to contemporary social theory. His mid-1970s analysis of a dramatic mutation occurring within contemporary societies and rise of a new mode of simulation, which sketched out the effects of media and information on society as a whole, is also original and important. But at this stage of his work, <u>Baudrillard falls prey to a technological determinism</u> and semiological idealism which posits an autonomous technology and play of signs generating a society of simulation which creates a postmodern break and the proliferation of signs, spectacles, and simulacra.78 <u>Baudrillard <strong>erases autonomous and differentiated spheres</strong> of the economy, polity, society, and culture</u> posited by classical social theory in favor of an implosive theory that also crosses disciplinary boundaries, thus <u>dissolving philosophy and social theory into a broader form of social diagnosis and philosophical play</u>. In the final analysis, <u>Baudrillard is perhaps more useful as a provocateur</u> who challenges and puts in question the tradition of classical philosophy and social theory <u>than as someone who provides concepts and methods <strong>that can be applied</strong> in philosophical, social or cultural analysis</u>. He claims that the object of classical social theory – modernity – has been surpassed by a new postmodernity and that therefore alternative theoretical strategies, modes of writing, and forms of theory are necessary. While his work on simulation and the postmodern break from the mid-1970s into the 1980s provides a paradigmatic postmodern theory and analysis of postmodernity that has been highly influential, and that despite its exaggerations continues to be of use in interpreting present social trends, his later work is arguably more literary and philosophical than sociological. <u>Baudrillard</u> thus ultimately goes beyond social theory altogether into a new sphere and mode of writing that provides insights into contemporary social phenomena and provocative critiques of contemporary and classical philosophy and social theory, but <u>does not provide an adequate theory of the present age and philosophy for our time</u>.79 </span><br />

<u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">A recurrent problem with most progressive utopian frameworks involves their level of generality. Objectives are often framed in terms of vague, seemingly universal aspirations</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> -- such as Roberto Unger's appeal to a world free &quot;from deprivation and drudgery, from the choice between isolation from other people and submission to them.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=926a4ee352856240637a4d6bab45a9b7&amp;docnum=26&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkAB&amp;_md5=f8a1f61fa4e1832f8f8755b5063572bc&amp;focBudTerms=right%20w/5%20selfhood&amp;focBudSel=all#n67" rel="nofollow">67</a> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Such formulations <strong>leave most of the interesting questions unanswered</strong></span>. How are such ideals to be interpreted and implemented under specific circumstances, how are interpretive disputes to be resolved, and how are gender relations to be reconstructed?</u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 8pt;">In response to such questions, a standard critical strategy is to specify conditions under which answers would be generated. Habermas' ideal speech situation has been perhaps the most influential example. Under his theory, beliefs would be accepted as legitimate only if they could have been acquired through full uncoerced discussion in which all members of society participate. Some critical feminists, including Drucilla Cornell and Seyla Benhabib, draw on similar conversational constructs. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=926a4ee352856240637a4d6bab45a9b7&amp;docnum=26&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkAB&amp;_md5=f8a1f61fa4e1832f8f8755b5063572bc&amp;focBudTerms=right%20w/5%20selfhood&amp;focBudSel=all#n68" rel="nofollow">68</a></span> <u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Such strategies are, however, problematic on several levels. One difficulty <strong>involves the level of abstraction at which the ideals are formulated</strong></span></u><strong><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">.</span></strong><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>It is not self-evident how individuals with diverse experiences, interests, and resources will reach consensus or how their agreements can be predicted with enough specificity to provide adequate heuristic frameworks</u></span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">.</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> Strategies emphasizing uncoerced dialogue have often assumed away the problems of disparate resources and capacities that parties bring to the conversation. <u>Given the historical silencing of women's voices, many critical feminists have been unsatisfied by approaches that are themselves silent about how to prevent that pattern from recurring</u>. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Your arguments are not empirical. The ev that baudrillard uses to make his arguments is rarely empirical in a way that’s applicable to debate or all political representations. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Consciousness is more messy than your arguments. People gain meaning from bits of information from the media and peer groups, jokes, fears, memories of childhood, school, home and work experiences, judgements about what is true, fair, legitimate, desirable, and what is necessary and what is possible. Proving communication is not dissuasive. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">In today's postmodern culture, the idea of the impossible is one that tends to feed into a language of &quot;provisionality&quot;, &quot;partiality&quot;, &quot;precariousness&quot; and so on. Every gesture is in a way already disavowed through a sense of irony, ersatz and supersession. <u>The problem</u>, therefore, <u>is that the</u> postmodern <u>enthusiasm for impossibility is one that lends itself too readily to a type of politics that itself becomes overly partial and provisional; where political ambition is already limited</u> by its own sense of limitation as such. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizek-daly.htm#5" rel="nofollow">5</a> In other words, <u>the potential danger is that we are left with a politics that stops at the level of impossibility without ever seeking to, as it were, <strong>possibilize the impossible.</strong></u>   The political consequences of this type of perspective are already clear. </span><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Communication is not simply dissuasive</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">. There are tons of examples where messages communicate and persuade: </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Walter Cronkike’s news broadcast that the ‘Vietnam war was not winnable’ influenced protestors and the LBJ government not to escalate the war in Vietnam; </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">documentaries influence people, the documentary ‘Thin Blue Line’ caused a man to be released from death row; </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Obama’s slogan of ‘Change We Can Believe In’ influenced activism; </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">and on the flip side Colin Powell’s presentation of ev that Iraq has WMD was able to influence some countries into supporting US intervention in Iraq. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">2006 demonstrations caused millions of immigrants and supporters to rally in cities around the country that helped defeat the worst parts of anti-immigration legislation </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">When we look at the success of citizen initiatives from a performative perspective, we look precisely at those moments of defiance and disruption that bring the invisible and unimaginable into view. <u>Although citizens were minimally successful in influencing or controlling the outcome of the policy debate</u> and experienced a considerable lack of autonomy in their coercion into the technical debate, <u>the goal-oriented debate</u> within the energy commissions <u>could be seen as a defiant moment of performative politics</u>. <u>The existence of a goal-oriented debate within a technically dominated arena defied the normalizing separation between expert policymakers and consuming citizens. <strong>Citizens momentarily recreated themselves as policymakers</strong> in a system that defined citizens out of the policy process, thereby refusing their construction as passive clients</u>. The disruptive potential of the energy commissions continues to defy technical bureaucracy even while their decisions are non-binding. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">This is where the second kind of service comes in. The claim on behalf of academics' value to the world at large is that <u>in enhancing the moral reasoning of students, we indirectly contribute to ending injustice and</u> </span><u><span style="color: #c00000; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">suffering</span></u><u><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">, </span></u><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">as well. <u><strong>We ourselves may not minister to the starving or rescue the tortured, lobby Congress</strong>, or protest in the street. But in sustaining the life of higher education, we are preparing (as it were) moral armies to go and do those things themselves, or at least to live in ways that may eventually make other kinds of activism less necessary. <strong>The intellectual's contribution to global welfare, then, is indirect and yet potentially immense.</strong></u> </span><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Empirical work supports this optimistic assessment of higher education's value, noting the role it can play in moral development.</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> Eamonn Callan, for example, notes the importance of <u>exposing students to different modes of moral understanding and thus</u> </span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;">cultivating &quot;imaginative sympathy for alien ways of life</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;">.&quot;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(8) Others observe that liberal arts <u>education provides a natural setting for &quot;the</u> </span><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: normal;">discomfiture that comes with experiences that do not fit one's earlier conceptions,&quot;</span></u><u><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> which seems essential for growth in moral judgment</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana;">.(9) The central purpose of many colleges of &quot;bringing students into contact with a highly diverse range of facts and views about the world&quot;(10) thus helps to explain studies that find strong improvement in skills of moral reasoning over the course of a college career. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">As Warner notes, <u>feelings of shame and marginalization are difficult (if not impossible) to overcome in isolation: “Visceral private meaning is not easy to alter by oneself,</u> by a free act of will. <u>It can only be altered through exchanges that <strong>go beyond self-expression</strong></u> to the making of a collective scene of disclosure.”76 The demonstrations can be thought of as such a moment of disclosure—as a space in which participants publicly celebrated and legitimated the presence of the undocumented in American society. According to Warner, such scenes of association and identity transform the private lives they mediate: “Homosexuals can exist in isolation; but gay people or queers exist by virtue of the world they elaborate together, and gay or queer identity is always fundamentally inflected by the nature of that world.”77 Similarly, <u>one is “illegal” in isolation, but in elaborating <strong>a common world,</strong> marchers challenged the state’s ability to define the parameters of membership</u>. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Richard Viguerie, a key figure of the New Right, has located the political success of the conservatives in their turn to &quot;gut-level issues.&quot;'' But it is perhaps more accurate to say that <u>the conservative strategy transforms political struggles into &quot;gut&quot; issues.</u> After all, <u>no issue is intrinsically a gut issue; it is produced as such only by reducing the complexity of the debates, the various interpretations and contradictions that surround it, to a matter of affective investment.</u> <u>The conservative strategy depends upon a logic in which the fact of the &quot;gut commitment&quot; becomes more important than the content of the commitment itself</u>. It is a strategy which seeks political power by tactically dissociating itself from politics. <u>In the end, political realities seem to matter less than political commitments. Politics itself is depoliticized <strong>even as it is given an increasing affective power.</strong></u> Appeals to charity, for example, displace any consideration of the scale of the problem, or of the actual commitment that is made, even while it poses as a real solution. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">According to Grossberg, the major consequence of this is that <u>politics in present-day America has become curiously depoliticized</u><span style="background-color: yellow;">. <u>Strictly economic or ideological arguments in favour of the conservative agenda have been replaced by <strong>appeals to mood, passion, sentimentality</strong></u></span><u>, and so on. Ronald <span style="background-color: yellow;">Reagan was of course the master of this &quot;mood politics</span>,&quot;</u> an archetypal example of the postmodern triumph of style over substance </span><strong><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12pt;">(&quot;<u>facts are boring</u>,&quot; </span></strong><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">as the Gipper once reminded us</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">). <u>Yet, at the same time, daily life is repoliticized<span style="background-color: yellow;">: the new conservatism seeks to take over the spaces and places within everyday life</span></u> formerly occupied by youth culture (the body, pleasure/fun, youth) and invest them with new values and meanings. The overarching goal is to submit the practices of daily life to an apparatus of power that is more congenial to the requirements of the emerging post-Fordist economic order. One result is that <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">politics has become largely personalized, just another &quot;lifestyle choice,&quot; <strong>rather than a site of collective struggle</strong></span></u> in which popular culture used to play a crucial role: <u>The collapse of all political space, civil society and everyday life and the transformation of everyday life in disciplined mobilization not only depoliticizes large segments of the population, it also eviscerates the recognition of popular culture as a terrain and weapon of struggle.</u> (308) </span><br />

The Sensenbrenner bill was passed on Dec. 16th, 2005 – rushed through right before the holidays as congress was about to recess. The holiday break and <u>the <strong>general lack of attention</strong> that most immigrants (not to mention US born workers) <strong>pay to the activities of Congress</strong> meant that the eventual surge of opposition to HR4437 began as a trickle</u>. </span><br />

<br />
<u><span style="background-color: yellow; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Last year's mass Chicago march inspired millions of immigrants and supporters to rally in cities around the country that helped defeat the worst parts of anti-immigration legislation</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> mostly crafted in the racist House Sensenbrenner bill now a dead letter. <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Since then, however, no progress for reform has been made and pending action from the compromise House-Senate bill and most recent new House proposal will continue an ongoing war on immigrants <strong>only mass opposition street protests have a chance to stop</strong></span></u> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">the way last year's actions achieved modest success now stalled and slipping. That's how things are now in a nation dedicated to permanent war, a bipartisan criminal class in Washington beholden to capital, and workers everywhere losing out in a race to the bottom. Poor Latinos (and all Muslims) face some of the worst of it, and those in Mexico and Central America face a Hobson's choice. Wither at home under NAFTA and CAFTA or try making it north to suffer abuse and neglect in an uncaring state dedicated to keeping its tired and poor and huddled masses permanently that way. That's the message from Congress in the kind of &quot;immigration reform&quot; being crafted, but Latinos and others on the streets have other ideas. At over 45 million strong, Latinos are now the largest ethnic group in the country and fastest growing with its Mexican component rising fastest of all. Nowhere is this more apparent than in California where about one-third of all Latinos live and make up over one-third of the state's population of 36 million. It's even more pronounced in Los Angeles where Latinos are now a majority providing a future glimpse of America with this group becoming more dominant than ever but still marginalized, demeaned and denied real equity and justice in</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">a country clinging to its Christian white supremacist roots</span>.</u> That <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">can only change with mass civil disobedience</span> street protests, employer boycotts and a campaign <strong><span style="background-color: yellow;">targeting Congress for justice</span></strong> long delayed and denied and now demanded in the current legislative session.

<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Baudrillard’s arguments are huge generalizations </span><br />

<br />
<u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;">Once one understands Baudrillard’s</span></u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> simulacrum <u>thesis</u>—not only have media-generated appearances become more important than reality, they have essentially replaced reality—<u>one can anticipate his take on any number of subjects. <span style="background-color: yellow;">His responses are</span></u> algorithmic, <strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">virtually preprogrammed</span></u></strong>. </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">This is certainly true for his short book on America, which has also been one of his most successful to judge by the amount of media attention it has received. After all, what other criteria are there in a postmodern universe where, according to Baudrillard, “there are no definitions possible. . . . It has all been done. . . . It has destroyed itself. It has deconstructed its entire universe. So all that are left are the pieces. Playing with the pieces—that is postmodern”?54 As a postmodernist, much of Baudrillard’s theorizing is ironic. Yet once one penetrates the veneer of rhetorical playfulness, one finds a recycled, francophone version of the idea of America as degeneration incarnate—the same image proffered by Spengler and Heidegger, now outfitted with a French accent. Baudrillard’s analyses and observations thereby intersect with another pivotal Counter-Enlightenment thematic: the idea of the “end of history” or posthistoire.55</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">According to this notion, democratic attempts</span></u> to transcend the political culture of the ancien régime <strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">are predestined to failure</span></u></strong>. <u>Such efforts will not merely founder, for although they consider themselves to be “progressive,” in reality they will result in unprecedented misery and chaos</u>— </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">ultimately, in the advent of a new barbarism or “dark ages.” Here, too, the fashionable assault on modernity proffered by postmodernism dovetails with the standpoint of earlier Counter-Enlightenment thinkers. For Baudrillard America represents a negative utopia, the apogee of postmodern cultural suicide. From an historical and cultural point of view, America is a kind of tabula rasa: America “exorcises the question of origins, she does not cultivate the origins or mythical authenticity, she has neither a past nor a founding truth.” At times Baudrillard almost seems envious of American superficiality and glibness. Americans embody a lack of self-consciousness and depth to which Europeans could never aspire no matter how hard they might try. The watchword of this shallow American character type seems to be “Smile if you have nothing to say, and don’t hide above all that you have nothing to say. Show spontaneously the void, the profound indifference of your smile. . . . Illustrate the zero-degree of joy and pleasure, smile, smile!”56 Baudrillard is obsessed with American obesity—that is, those Americans who are not anorexic. As one observer has aptly quipped, “The fact that Baudrillard calls Americans fat, dumb, and uncultured is surely no reason to think that he is anti-American.”57 In America life no longer imitates art; instead, life and art—above all, cinematic art—have essentially exchanged places. Life itself now appears as an inferior incarnation of cinematic “hyperreality.” As Baudrillard observes, “In America the cinema is true because . . . the whole mode of life is cinemagraphic: life is cinema.” The same confusion of illusion and reality is true of America’s gargantuan theme parks like Disneyland. According to Baudrillard, “Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation.”58 In America qua Mecca of hyperreality, the relationship between image and reality has simply reversed itself. Unlike Nietzsche and Heidegger,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Baudrillard presumably did actually travel to the land he was describing</span></u><span style="background-color: yellow;">.</span> Yet one of the strange features of his narrative is that although he describes a myriad of tourist sites, <strong><u>he <span style="background-color: yellow;">reproduces not a single conversation with a “real” American</span></u></strong></span><strong><u><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">.</span></u></strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;"> But since Baudrillard’s theoretical perspective on American life was fully worked out before he departed, perhaps such a conversation would have been in any event superfluous. For all Baudrillard’s predictability, there is no denying that, on occasion, he expresses a clever formulation or witty insight. But, ultimately, how seriously should we take a social philosopher who recommends that his books be treated like science fiction novels or Borgesesque ficciones? Very much so, insofar as Baudrillard’s clichéridden view of American society has become standard issue among academic postmodernists. Like his precursors on the European right,</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <strong><u><span style="background-color: yellow;">Baudrillard believes that human actors are powerless to implement meaningful social change.</span></u></strong> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 6pt;">The die has been cast. “Hyperrealilty”—the reign of the “simulacrum”—confronts us as an ineluctable fate, an inexorable, postmodern condition humaine. The amor fati celebrated by Germany’s conservative revolutionaries has been updated and recycled, only to reemerge as one of the commonplaces of ivory tower radical chic. Yet as Baudrillard’s critics have observed, his peculiar combination of epistemological skepticism and political nihilism accord with “a postmodern mood of widespread cynical acquiescence,” resulting in a form of theory that is “ill-equipped to mount any kind of effective critical resistance.” 59 There is no point in trying to combat today’s “captains of consciousness,” since all criticism and contestation end up recycled by the culture industry’s vast semio-technological maw. In the epitome of postmodern political fatalism, the only strategy Baudrillard has to recommend is “death”: solely by aping the information society’s own lifelessness and inertia—a practice he refers to as “crystal revenge”—does one stand a chance, argues Baudrillard, of escaping its enervating clutches.60 Thus, according to Baudrillard, the implosions of media society portend the collapse of the emancipatory project in general.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u><span style="background-color: yellow;">His verdict on the <strong>impossibility</strong> of progressive historical change reiterates one of the commonplaces of <strong>reactionary rhetoric</strong>: the so-called futility thesis, according to which attempts to transform society are <strong>condemned a priori</strong> to failure</span></u>.61 </span><br />

 <br />
Focus on agency draws us too much into ourselves – it ignores that immigrants risk their lives to cross the border for minimum wage. The aff’s approach to politics of SOLELY focus on agency of the self ignores the realities of these people. It focuses on the self, rather than structuring our poiltics towards helping these peoples’ lives. Their politics si a selfish one that aims only to keep themselves insulated. <br />
<br />
Some of hthe linsk to this include: rejecting objective reality because the subject self never really knows that it exists. Not talking about it because we fear that we will colonize it. They hate engagement of “legal politics” that engages in fact finding, information, and the discovery of truth. They hate the idea that other things outside themselves might cause the problesm that they describe. <br />
<br />
Couple of impacts: <br />
First, their poltiics backfires and creates contempt and self-blame. The location of the problem as ONLY in the self and WHOLEY lcoated in agency gets the problem wrong and prescribes the wrong approach. They ignores all of the material things that have influenced hwo they determine their agency – econmics, law, the neoliberal policies that cause migrants to want to – have to migrate. <br />
Second, It also means that it locates ths olutino in just therapeutically changing ourselves, elminating our attachments to the world that has also had a relationship of creation with us, and rejecting fact for affect in tehs ame way that the GOP has done. <br />
Third, Their politics is a fly trap it becomes addictive – the fact that they make value to life claims proves that this si the ONLY way for them to find value to life, which makes everything else irrelevant. This erases the strategies of immigrant protests that successfully got the repeal of HR 4437 <br />

This will depend on the strategies deployed by irregular migrants and the modes of belonging they invoke as they struggle for political recognition. It will also depend on the reactions they encounter from a range of citizens increasingly overwhelmed by the fragility of borders and the loss of stable identities. In the face of this crisis of citizenship, governments around the world appear ever more willing to assert their sovereign power in demonstrations of territorial control. In one of the most blatant examples, the Sarkozy Government in France has introduced deportation quotas as statistical measures of its border policing success. Yet at the same time, some 22,000 people have organised in networks to hide irregular migrants targeted by authorities for deportation.46 While a change of government in Australia in 2007 has seen some softening of the more brutal aspects of border policing (including the closure of offshore detention centres and the conversion of temporary protection visas to permanent status), asylum policy continues to be framed within a logic of deterrence.47 The largest detention centre for “unauthorised arrivals” remains “excised” from Australian territory. In the US context, the militarisation of borders continues unabated amidst a burgeoning social movement for migrant rights. Everywhere, it seems, the fault lines of citizenship are very much unsettled. Under these conditions, it is unclear whether border policing can continue to act as a credible performance of territorial closure. For as long as the push and pull factors of irregular migration remain tied to global market forces, the contradictions of the neoliberal state will be brought into sharper relief.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt;"> <u>Uncertainties generated by the simultaneous opening and closing of borders may well contribute to an intensified backlash and the worst forms of racialised violence.
