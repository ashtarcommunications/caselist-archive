Capitalism comodifies everything creating surplus values, repressing the death instinct to stay in power. This creates power binaries and destroys the planet. Kritiking is necessary to bring capitalism down. This is Holland in 99. <br />

Strategies rooted within the state result in the same form of fascism that led to the aff impacts in the first place.

The focus on state power builds the paradox within fascism. The aff proposes the plan to propose an egalitarian method of combating death, however within this promise there exists the suicidal form of this politics which desires the repression of the same people they want to protect. This molar politics plays to the Nazi doctrine that brought “wedding bells and death”. The aim is a suicidal state where the people desire death. This outweighs all of their other impacts.

Impact: Death Drive – The individual fantasy of the 1AC which adheres to the law and ordered structure of society is tied to the ego.

<strong>The affirmative is emblematic of everything that has fractured the left and allowed the unrelenting expansion of global capitalism. Their focus on language games prefers the discursive to the material. Everything is radically localized. They actively refuse to focus on state policy and its material consequences. All of these facets of the affirmative are welcomed by capital with open arms-they teach a politics devoid of an understanding of the material conditions of capital. Effective resistance and strategizing is not possible in the world of the affirmative.</strong><br />

<strong><span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As a child I dreamed at dusk – schitzo-maniacal fucked up flows of intensities… oozing, spewing, spinning… - around me – the world – I never grasped, always went, never stopping at swampland to build… for it was unheard of on my block, thus I had none to lay…</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This problem disappeared as I grew older, or possibly dreams themselves began… yet intercom vibrations of mr. green and stranger danger birthed hearty organs within me, as they pounded against my ears as if a tub I bathe.

<strong>In 1934, Hannah Arendt fled Germany as a Jew under the Nazi regime. From here, she spent 15 years as a refuge in Europe, turned away by every state, robbed of any political protection, literally unhomed. She lived through the experience of constant migrant in her 15 years without a home, and yet the inclusion the various states of Europe and the US offered to her was a sham; she was rightless, as a stranger in a strange land. Finally, in 1959 she was welcomed back to Germany – to the free city of Hamburg, to receive the Lessing prize for Humanism. Yet this gesture of the state to the displaced migrant was a sham, an attempt at purifying the country's cultural memory. Lisa Disch explains:</strong><br />

<strong>This critique of modernity ....</strong><br />
<strong>Hitlerism&quot; in its own way (MDT 18).</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This act of welcoming the migrant, which we can see mirrored in the 1AC, fit well within Germany's totalitarian history. Yet Hamburg of 1959 was not the Hamburg of 1934, and the US is not Nazi Germany. As Arendt says: fascism has its roots in liberalism, yet liberalism is not fascism. Yet in the case of worker's visas this is precisely what liberalism becomes. Migrants are valued solely for their labor, they are defined as laborers excluded from politics, preventing any expression of their selves.</strong><br />

<strong>We would thus take up the gesture of Arendt upon receiving the Lessing Prize for Humanism.

<strong>In the beginning, there was the void. Not even nothing, because for there to be nothing there must be a something. Then, God said “Let there be light,” and there was. And he separated the light from the dark, the heavens from the earth, and the land from the sea. This was the originary act, the ungrounded ground for all life – which sprung from the void – perpetrated by the unmoved-first-mover. According to the Torah, when God had separated land from sea, when God had created all the plants and the animals and the stars in the sky, God looked down on them and saw that it was good. Yet from where did the inspiration for this miraculous whole, which is at every moment becoming something new and phenomenal, from where did it spring? God was in the void, with neither light nor dark, heaven nor earth, sea nor land, beyond all forms and influence. So from where did this order spring?</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Leonardo De Vinci used to tell his students to stare at a blank, white wall until the lines in the paint, cracks, and caulking formed into an image, and then to paint that image. Andre Breton advised students to gaze at clouds until landscapes and portraits, forms and monsters appeared, as a source of inspiration. WELL- I prefer the beaches, that boundary between land and sea, and the forms inscribed upon them. Lines and circles in the sand.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I like to build castles, complete with castle walls, borders, and boundary stones. Yet every night the tide comes in and erases it, forcing me to begin again, to refound a new order on the blank, limitless expanse of sand.</strong><br />

<strong>In 1948, Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Guggenheim museum of art in New York City, and its design is unique. From the outside, it looks like a giant “white ribbon curled into a cylindrical stack.”[[#sdfootnote1sym|1]] On the inside, it's a spiral slope, going five stories high. With each circumscription of the tower, you follow the history of an artistic movement, from the transgressive rupture that founds the new style, through it's growth, sustenance, decline, and death. Following this spiral from bottom to top, with each circle you follow the same story told differently, repeated for impressionism, post-impressionism, futurism, and on – each path beginning at inception and continuing to death. This is opposed to most art museums, which are designed in one of two ways: With big open spaces and small walls – nothing more than spots to hang paintings, where you wander around aimlessly, unsure of where you've been or where you're going. Or else with long corridors, where you follow a linear path from room to room, hallway to hallway, never swerving from the prescribed way.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I've always wondered what would happen if they placed an elevator in the Guggenheim, so that you could climb on, press a button, and move from one style to another. I would board the elevator, close my eyes, and push a button at random, allowing it to take me to a new style, a new movement, a new way of viewing the world.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>In the medieval period, the European state system expanded, bringing more and more land under their control, until they reached the ocean, which resisted all appropriation. Here, they encountered the Leviathan:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“1 Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</strong><br />
<strong>2 Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? 3 Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words? 4 Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life? 5 Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls? 6 Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? 7 Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? 8 If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again! 9 Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering. 10 No-one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me? 11 Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me. 12 I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form. 13 Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle? 14 Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth? 15 His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together; 16 each is so close to the next that no air can pass between. 17 They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted. 18 His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn. 19 Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out. 20 Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. 21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth. 22 Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him. 23 The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable. 24 His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone. 25 When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing. 26 The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin. 27 Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood. 28 Arrows do not make him flee, slingstones are like chaff to him. 29 A club seems to him but a piece of straw, he laughs at the rattling of the lance. 30 His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing-sledge. 31 He makes the depths churn like a boiling cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment. 32 Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair. 33 Nothing on earth is his equal— a creature without fear. 34 He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud.”[[#sdfootnote2sym|2]]</strong><br />
<strong>Until the 15th century, sailors never strayed far from land, fearing that if they deviated from land too far, away from the coastal shelf or thoroughly mapped currents, they would be lost to the Leviathan forever. Hence the ambivalent attitude towards the seas.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In Homer's Odyssey, Ulysses is constantly asked whether he is a pirate or a merchant – and he would always answer pirate. Merchants were the despised foreigners who exploited workers for their riches. They were an affront to traditional values, thieves and robbers. Pirates weren't thieves. “[P]iracy was a crime with extenuating circumstances”[[#sdfootnote3sym|3]] They risked the Leviathan, targeting merchants, for honor and glory. They went beyond where anyone else could or would follow. Then returned to ports of harbor to give their riches to the poor in exchange for booze, drugs, in sex – certainly a hero in my book.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>All this changed with the astrolabe.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The astrolabe allowed navigators to determine latitude by the position of the sun and the North Star. The chronometer allowed them to determine longitude by their speed and the true time. Now, deep sea voyage was possible, now the nations of the world could chase those damn pirate thieves to their ports of asylum and hunt them down. Now, “The sovereign decides whether these figures will be killed, introduced as famuli, or ignored on the sea.”[[#sdfootnote4sym|4]] Now the great sea empires could colonize North America, South America, Africa, and the world. All you needed was a map and an astrolab and chronometer to find your location on it, and the government could exert their reach universally, anywhere on earth.</strong><br />

<strong>Mikkel Thorup explains:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“What makes this work interesting is that it can serve us as a way to understand Schmitt’s simultaneous critique and fascination of liberal internationalism, in particular the American ‘new imperialism’. European international law was, according to Schmitt, based, inscribed or grounded in earth, territory, boundaries drawn on the land and, ultimately, on the division into states. From this, as we have already seen, derives the real, the contained, the most peaceful available kind of law, war and enmity. The Europe of land-based law is the classical epoch, the era of the jus publicum Europaeum, where Europe writes the law. This state of (idyllized) international relations is disrupted, when Britain turns to the sea. We get what we could call the maritime borderland, which is incomparably stronger to repress, codify and fill with statehood than the continental land mass. A split is introduced in Europe. Law based on land develops, according to Schmitt, a codified war, a contained enmity, where state confronts state, each with a regularized army. Only the fighting armies are in principle enemies and the civilian population is considered beyond the fightings. This is the scene of the conventional enmity. But once a dominant power turns to the sea, all this changes, because the sea is a stateless space, which renders the interstate containment of enmity impossible (2003b: 382). Britain initiates a ‘space revolution’ in its choice of the sea (1981: 54-7). Out of Britain’s maritime dominance (in the hunt to fill the non-European borderland with colonial dominance, which shows that the non-European world beyond the line was both precondition and destroyer of the Eurocentric order), the absolute enmity re-emerges. The sea is a natural borderland. It isn’t owned by anyone, it defies proper institutionalization or demarcation and it evades being filled with infrastructural power. The sea resists the state. The sea, then, offers another law, another organizational, political and juridical modus operandi, which stands in direct opposition to the state or land based order. In the years 1588-1688 the island of England detaches itself from mainland Europe and becomes the metropolis of an overseas world empire and the creator of the industrial revolution, all this without attaining the continental state characteristics (1985: 66-7). Free trade, industry and safe passage became catchwords of a new universalist-liberal world order, which breaks down the line separating Europe from the rest of the world. A line which used to be defined, according to what Schmitt considered substantial notions of similarity and equality, rather than the new functionalist and internationalist notions of a one world (market).</strong><br />
<strong>The paradigmatic war of the state/land order is the clash on the battlefield. The paradigmatic war of the maritime order is the sea war. Inherent in the two are, according to Schmitt, completely different concepts and realities of both war and enmity. In the sea war the war effort is also directed against the trade and economics of the enemy. This makes civilians and neutrals direct participants in the war (1981: 87-8; 1995c-e; 1995f: 253-9): “The British sea war is total in its capacity for a total enmity. It knows, like only one of the great world historical arts of war, how to mobilize religious, ideological, psychological and moral force” (1994k: 271). The war is not won through a decisive battle but by starving and exhausting the enemy: Blockade, economic pressure, sanctions. Sea war is, according to Schmitt, the first liberal war and its implicit logic is a ‘space-abolishing universalism’ (1995d: 390),34 which, in Schmitt’s understanding, is the first reappearance of the borderland in Europe. The British are, according to Schmitt, not even principally against exodus, against moving their nation elsewhere, which shows the same kind of lack of attachment to the land, as he thought to discover in Protestants who could erect their industry anywhere (1995c: 421). Schmitt’s narrative is based on the presumption of benign limitation, that is, of the moderating effects of being embedded in a particular, limited context and the dangers of universalist disembedding; and on a very selective reading of the history of warfare, which dramatizes the difference between land and sea warfare. This is important to bear in mind, as much of the strength of Schmitt’s argument is preconditioned upon this difference, but I’ll argue that his critique can be uphold and developed without this questionable real-historical foundation.</strong><br />
<strong>The return of absolute enmity threatens to destroy European interstate law and thereby the containment of war inherent in the paradigm. The enemy is no longer the concrete other on the battlefield but is on the contrary being portrayed as the enemy of humanity. As the battlefield shifts to the sea, the constraints of enmity are abolished. The sea war reintroduces the private contractor of violence, which the nation state had incorporated and conquered as a precondition for its sovereign status. Privateers, freebooters and pirates with semi-public authorization enter the war, blurring the boundary between combatant and civilian on the side of both perpetrator and victim. It is also highly significant that the turn to the sea wasn’t a state decision but a move initiated by whalers, privateers, adventurers and trade companies (1981: 29-44; 1995c: 412-4). The former divide between enemy and criminal, combatant and civilian/neutral, war and policing, ultimately between war and peace dissolves. The enemy is criminalized, which again leads to interventions described as police actions or punitive expeditions. The legitimization of war goes from being described in terms of state interest to that of morality. This is no sign of progress in Schmitt’s theory. The new sea- based warfare (which is, of course, also conducted on land, it’s a general mode of war) requires a new concept of enmity to justify its means of combat: The concept of ‘enemy of humanity’ is, according to Schmitt, utterly meaningless, as humanity as such cannot have an enemy, as he/she/they would then be effectively non-human. But the concept is still very useful politically- ideologically: “’Humanity’ is an especially useful ideological instrument for imperial expansions” (1996a: 55). One side is prosecutor, judge and executioner, whereas the other side is ‘enemy and criminal, vermin and criminal’ (1991b: 76). A new discriminatory concept of war emerges. The concept of enemy is lifted from the concrete confrontation; the aim of the war is no longer just the defeat of a present and actual enemy; the interested parties in the conflict are no longer two or a few more states; the battlefield is no longer geographically contained and the duration of the war is no longer temporally contained; the war is now a just war, the enemy a global criminal and the war aim suddenly “concerns the whole world and is of global significance: It is about naming the political opponent as a criminal who acts against the interest of the whole world and who is the last barrier before world peace” (2005c: 664). To invoke humanity is to occupy a universal concept and thereby immunize one’s own position and defame that of the other. Schmitt is fond of quoting Proudhon, who allegedly said: “Whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat” (1996a: 55). This change in operative enmities makes war more not less likely. It provides new possibilities for ‘international hostis-declarations’ and it “legitimates and sanctions some kinds of wars” (1996a: 52 &amp; 57) As Schmitt says in the closing lines of Der Begriff des Politischen, we have seen the introduction of:</strong><br />
<strong>... a new, essentially pacifist vocabulary, which no longer knows war but now only executions, sanctions, punitive expeditions, pacifications, protection of treaties, international police, arrangements to secure the peace. The adversary is no longer called the enemy but instead breaker or disturber of the peace, hors-la-loi and hors l’humanité, and a war waged to protect and expand positions of economic power must, through the use of propaganda, be turned into a ‘crusade’ and to ‘the last war of humankind’. This is required in the astonishingly systematic and consequent polarity of ethics and economics. But this apparently unpolitical and even anti-political system too serves either existing or newly emerging friend/enemy groupings and cannot escape the logic of the political. (1996a: 77-8)”[[#sdfootnote5sym|5]]</strong><br />

<strong>Draw a circle bisected by a line.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In Le Mort d'Arthur, Arthur was granted the position of King, because he could pull a sword from a stone. This new order is what made the lord into God-Kings, what allowed a king to change holy writ through an act of law. They ruled the land, they drew the borders, not out of truth or morality, but out of freedom and lightness, like a child making sand-castles on the beaches. Sergei Prozorov states:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“Secondly, the political is argued to be independent of ethical, economic and aesthetic content. If the enemy is ultimately not the bad, the ugly or the economic competitor, if the friend does not stand for the good, the beautiful and the economically useful, one may observe that the distinction lacks any substance at all.18 “The political can derive its energy from the most varied human endeavours, from the religious, economic, moral and other antitheses. It does not describe its own substance, but only the intensity of an association or dissociation of human beings [...]”19 Once a certain level of intensity is reached, the moral, the economic or the religious acquire a political dimension: “the point of the political may be reached from the economic as well as from any other domain.”</strong><br />
<strong>Schmitt takes care to note that no such level of intensity can be theoretically prescribed and may only be decided by actual participants in a concrete situation: the enemy is “the other, the stranger; and it is sufficient for his nature that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible. These can neither be decided by a previously determined general norm nor by the judgment of a disinterested and therefore neutral third party.”21 Contrary to many interpretations,22 Schmitt not merely refuses to ‘legitimise’ war as a ‘social ideal’23 but in fact denies the very possibility of normatively justifying any recourse to ‘physical killing of human beings’, including the ‘wars to end all wars’ and ‘wars for peace’ practiced by the pacifist militants of liberalism. In contrast to the enormous hypocrisy that we observe in the attempts to legitimise liberal aggression, the Schmittian position manifests an admirable sincerity:</strong><br />
<strong>It is a manifest fraud to condemn war as homicide and then demand of men that they wage war, kill and be killed, so that there will never again be war. War, the readiness of combatants to die, the physical killing of human beings who belong on the side of the enemy – all this has no normative meaning, but an existential meaning only, particularly in a real combat situation with a real enemy. There exists no rational purpose, no norm, no matter how true, no program no matter how exemplary, no social ideal no matter how beautiful, no legitimacy nor legality which could justify men in killing each other. If such physical destruction of human life is not motivated by an existential threat to one’s own way of life, then it cannot be justified. Just as little can war be justified by ethical and juristic norms.</strong><br />
<strong>Deprived of normative substance, the political becomes elusive by definition, its entire definition contained in its undefinability. The political act can not be defined, simply because it is itself that which defines, defines the positivity of order while eluding subsumption under its definition. The friend-enemy distinction is an act of existential decision, a constitutive practice that is not grounded in truth or morality and is rather made possible by this very ungroundedness: “The decision frees itself from all normative ties and becomes in the true sense absolute”. The political decision does not draw on the categories of the moral or the economic to justify itself, it does not make a reference to the pre-existing, but rather brings into existence in what may be read as a “free act of artistic genius”. The Schmittian enemy, ‘existentially different and alien’, is neither different from or alien to a pre-existing self, nor antecedent to that self in its existential strangeness. Both the friend and the enemy, the self and the other, owe their existence to the decisionist act of distinction that brings them into being simultaneously. The concept of the political therefore consists entirely in a constitutive decision, or, more precisely, in the decision that is always constitutive: “There can never be absolutely declaratory decisions.”27 Divorced from substantive content, the political is to be isolated in the acts that possess an intense force of constitution, acts that are ontogenetic28 in relation to the social order, acts that give it form by escaping from it: “The constitutive, specific element of the decision is from the perspective of the content of the norm new and alien.”29 In Derrida’s terms, “this founding [...] moment of law is, in law, an instance of non-law [...] It is the moment in which the foundation of law becomes suspended in the void or over the abyss, suspended by a pure performative act that would not have to answer to or before anyone.”30 Thus, the political is also an undeconstructible element within order, since it is rather the function of the concept to deconstruct its assertion of self-immanence. The ontological status of the supplement is not substantive (or identitarian) but existential: the political isn’t anything in a strict sense, it simply is.”[[#sdfootnote6sym|6]]</strong><br />

<strong>In 1950, Carl Schmitt prophesied that the US would win the Cold War and extend liberalism around the world. Today, we find ourselves in the interregnum, a time which Spanos defines as “a realm of in-between – the no more of the gods that have fled and the not-yet of the gods that are coming.” The USSR has fallen, yet the US has yet to win out. Like the time between the death of a king and succession of their heir, we find ourselves suspended in the void, waiting for the inscription of a new ruler and a new order.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Now the nation-state order extends through the world – and the US wants to draw a new, international order of globalized, democratic states, working together in democratic peace and harmony. Yet who remains the enemy? Baudrillard explains that:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“'We may assume', wrote Victor Segalen, 'that fundamental differences will never resolve themselves into a truly seamless and unpatched fabric; increasing unity, falling barriers and great reductions in real distance must of themselves compensate somewhere by means of new partitions and unanticipated gaps.'”[[#sdfootnote7sym|7]]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our new partitions are arrayed against the undemocratic, the nationalistic, the sectarian, the evil – that is, every state that insists on sovereignty against the imposed order of the United States and the West. This new order ensures that:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“Over recent centuries all forms of violent otherness have been incorporated, willingly or under threat of force, into a discourse of difference which simultaneously implies inclusion and exclusion, recognition and discrimination. Childhood, lunacy, death, primitive societies all have been categorized, integrated and absorbed as parts of a universal harmony. Madness, once its exclusionary status had been revoked, was caught up in the far subtler toils of psychology. The dead, as soon as they were recognized in their identity as such, were banished to outlying cemeteries kept at such a distance that the face of death itself was lost. As for Indians, their right to exist was no sooner accorded them than they were confined to reservations. These are the vicissitudes of a logic of difference.”[[#sdfootnote8sym|8]]</strong><br />

<strong>Draw the course of history.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Euripedes stages his play – Hecuba – after the end of the Trojan war. Hecuba, deposed queen of Troy, laments her loses at the hands of Greece: her brother, her son, her husband, her country, her own freedom, and finally her daughter. Troy had stolen Helen, and so Greece came, with God on their side, with justice and virtue and honor on their side, and they had visited their law upon Troy, they had brought justice and vengeance to make Troy pay. And at the end, among the legions of Troy only Hecuba was left to learn this Brutal lesson.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Two thousand years later, Shakespeare restages Hecuba in his play Hamlet. Hamlet watches the actor, weeping over Hebuca's suffering, and asks:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wan'd; Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba? What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her?&quot;[[#sdfootnote9sym|9]]</strong><br />
<strong>Hecuba is repeated time and again, every night broken down to nothing, to be rebuilt on a new, blank stage. Yet while Hamlet feels nothing for the death of his father, the betrayal of his mother, this actor weeps for Hecuba.</strong><br />

<strong>Today, we have lost all fronteers – no more oceans to erase the traces of the night before – we have learned to write upon the land and the sea, the skies and even outer-space. We've extended our reach to the heavens themselves. And yet God is missing:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly: &quot;I seek God! I seek God!&quot;---As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. Has he got lost? asked one. Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?---Thus they yelled and laughed.</strong><br />
<strong>The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. &quot;Whither is God?&quot; he cried; &quot;I will tell you. We have killed him---you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.</strong><br />
<strong>&quot;How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us---for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.&quot;</strong><br />
<strong>Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern on the ground, and it broke into pieces and went out. &quot;I have come too early,&quot; he said then; &quot;my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light of the stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than most distant stars---and yet they have done it themselves.</strong><br />
<strong>It has been related further that on the same day the madman forced his way into several churches and there struck up his requiem aeternam deo. Led out and called to account, he is said always to have replied nothing but: &quot;What after all are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of God?&quot;”[[#sdfootnote10sym|10]]</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>So draw a line. A line in the sand. A line to separate friend from enemy, negative from affirmative, winner from loser. Like God separating light from dark, it is this act which is the ungrounded ground of history, of politics, of order, of meaning, and of life.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Hannah Arendt. “Humanity In Dark Times: Thoughts about Lessing.” Address on Accepting the Lessing Prize of the Free City of Hamburg. 1959. Republished in: Hannah Arendt. Men In Dark Times. 1983. Translated by Clara and Richard Winston.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The distinction conferred by a free city, and a prize that bears the name of Lessing, are a great honor. I admit that I do not know how I have come to receive it, and also that it has not been altogether easy for me to come to terms with it. In saying this I can ignore entirely the delicate question of merit. In this very respect an honor gives us a forcible lesson in modesty; for it implies that it is not for us to judge our own merits as we judge the merits and accomplishments of others. In awards, the world speaks out, and if we accept the award and express our gratitude for it, we can do so only by ignoring ourselves and acting entirely within the framework of our attitude toward the world, toward a world and public to which we owe the space into which we speak and in which we are heard. […]</strong><br />
<strong>When we thus consider the real meaning of public honors and prizes under present conditions, it may occur to us that the Hamburg Senate found a solution to the problem rather like that of Columbus' egg when it decided to link to city's prize with the name of Lessing. For Lessing never felt at home in the world as it then existed and probably never wanted to, and still after his own fashion he always remained committed to it. […] His attitude toward the world was neither positive nor negative, but radically critical and, in respect to the public realm of his time, completely revolutionary. But it was also an attitude that remained indebted to the world, never left the solid ground of the world, and never went to the extreme of sentimental utopianism. […]</strong><br />
<strong>Lessing never made his peace with the world in which he lived. He enjoyed “challenging prejudices” and “telling the truth to the court minions.” Dearly though he paid for these pleasures, they were literally pleasures. Once when he was attempting to explain to himself the source of “tragic pleasure,” he said that “all passions, even the most unpleasant, are as passions pleasant” because “they make us … more conscious of our existence, they make us feel more real.” This sentence strikingly recalls the Greek doctrine of passions, which counted anger, for example, among the pleasant emotions but reckoned hope along with fear among the evils. This evaluation rests on differences in reality, exactly as in Lessing; not, however, in the sense that reality is measured by the force with which the passion affects the soul but rather by the amount of reality the passion transmits to it. In hope, the soul overleaps reality, as in fear it shrinks back from it. But anger, and above all Lessing's kind of anger, reveals and exposes the world just as Lessing's kind of laughter in Minna von Barnhelm seeks to bring about reconciliation with the world. Such laughter helps one to find a place in the world, but ironically, which is to say, without selling one's soul to it. Pleasure, which is fundamentally the intensified awareness of reality, springs from a passionate openness to the world and love of it. Not even the knowledge that man may be destroyed by the world detracts from the “tragic pleasure.” […]</strong><br />
<strong>He not only wanted no one to coerce him, but he also wanted to coerce no one, either by force or by proofs. He regarded the tyranny of those who attempt to dominate thinking by reasoning and sophistries, by compelling argumentation, as more dangerous to freedom than orthodoxy. Above all he never coerced himself, and instead of fixing his identity in history with a perfectly consistent system, he scattered into the world, as he himself know, “nothing but fermenta cognitionis.” […]</strong><br />
<strong>To be sure, the very humanity of man loses its vitality to the extent that he abstains from thinking and puts his confidence into old verities or even new truths, throwing them down as if they were coins with which to balance all experiences. And yet, if this is true for man, it is not true for the world. The world becomes inhuman, inhospitable to human needs – which are the needs of mortals – when it is violently wrenched into a movement in which there is no longer any sort of permanence. That is why ever since the great failure of the French revolution people have repeatedly re-erected the old pillars which were then overthrown, only again and again to see them first quivering, then collapsing anew. The most frightful errors have replaced the “best-known truths,” and the error of these doctrines constitutes no proof, no new pillar for the old truths. In the political realm restoration is never a substitute for a new foundation but will be at best an emergency measure that becomes inevitable when the act of foundation, which is called revolution, has failed. But it is likewise inevitable that in such a constellation, especially when it extends over such long spans of time, people's mistrust of the world and all aspects of the public realm should grow steadily. For the fragility of these repeatedly restored props of the public order is bound to become more apparent after every collapse, so that ultimately the public order is based on people's holding as self-evident precisely those “best-known truths” which secretly scarcely anyone still believes in. [...]</strong><br />
<strong>These and similar questions of the proper attitude in “dark times” are of course especially familiar to the generation and the group to which I belong. If concern with the world, which is part and parcel of receiving honors, has never been an easy matter in our times and in the circumstances of our world, it is even less so for us. Certainly honors were no part of our birthright, and it would not be surprising if we were no longer capable of the openness and trustfulness that are needed simply to accept gratefully what the world offers in good faith. Even those among us who by speaking and writing have ventured into public life have not done so out of any original pleasure in the public scene, and have hardly expected or aspired to receive the stamp of public approval. Even in public they tended to address only their friends or to speak to those unknown, scattered readers and listeners with whom everyone who speaks and writes at all cannot help feeling joined in some rather obscure brotherhood. I am afraid that in their efforts they felt very little responsibility toward the world; these efforts were, rather, guided by their hope of preserving some minimum of humanity in a world grown inhuman while at the same time as far as possible resisting the weird irreality of this worldlessness – each after his own fashion and some few by seeking to the limits of their ability to understand even inhumanity and the intellectual and political monstrosities of a time out of joint.</strong><br />
<strong>I so explicitly stress my membership in the group of Jews expelled from Germany at a relatively early age because I wish to anticipate certain misunderstandings which can arise only too easily when one speaks of humanity. In this connection I cannot gloss over the fact that for many years I considered the only adequate reply to the question, Who are you? To be: A Jew. That answer alone took into account the reality of persecution. […]</strong><br />
<strong>In saying, “A Jew,” I did not even refer to a reality burdened or marked out for distinction by history. Rather, I was only acknowledging a political fact through which my being a member of this group outweighed all other questions of personal identity or rather had decided them in favor of anonymity, of namelessness. Nowadays, such an attitude would seem like a pose. Nowadays, therefore, it is easy to remark that those who reacted in this way had never got very far in the school of “humanity,” had fallen into the trap set by Hitler, and thus had succumbed to the spirit of Hitlerism in their own way. Unfortunately, the basically simple principle in question here is one that is particularly hard to understand in times of defamation and persecution: the principle that one can resist only in terms of the identity that is under attack. Those who reject such identification on the part of a hostile world may feel wonderfully superior to the world, but their superiority is then truly no longer of this world: it is the superiority of a more or less well-equipped cloud-cuckoo-land.</strong><br />
<strong>When I thus bluntly reveal the personal background of my reflections, it may easily sound to those who know the fate of the Jews only from Hearsay as if I am talking out of school, a school they have not attended and whose lessons do not concern them. But as it happens, during that selfsame period in Germany there existed the phenomenon known as the “inner emigration,” and those who know anything about that experience may well recognize certain questions and conflicts akin to the problems I have mentioned in more than a mere formal and structural sense. As its very name suggests, the “inner emigration” was a curiously ambiguous phenomenon. It signified on the one hand that there were persons inside Germany who behaved as if they no longer belonged to the country, who felt like emigrants; and on the other hand it indicated that they had not in reality emigrated, but had withdrawn to an interior realm, into the invisibility of thinking and feeling. It would be a mistake to imagine that this form of exile, a withdrawal from the world into an interior realm, existed only in Germany, just as it would be a mistake to imagine that such emigration came to an end with the end of the Third Reich. But in that darkest of times, inside and outside Germany the temptation was particularly strong, in the face of a seemingly unendurable reality, to shift from the world and its public space to an interior life, or else simply to ignore that world in favor of an imaginary world “as it ought to be” or as it once upon a time had been.</strong><br />
<strong>There has been much discussion of the widespread tendency in Germany to act as though the years from 1933 to 1945 never existed; as though this part of German and European and thus world history could be expunged from the textbooks; as though everything depended on forgetting the “negative” aspect of the past and reducing horror to sentimentality. It was a grotesque state of affairs when German young people were not allowed to learn the facts that every schoolchild a few miles away could not help knowing. Behind all this there was, of course, genuine perplexity. And this very incapacity to face the reality of the past might possibly have been a direct heritage of the inner emigration, as it was undoubtedly to a considerable extent, and even more directly, a consequence of the Hitler regime – that is to say, a consequence of the organized guilt in which the Nazis had involved all inhabitants of the German lands, the inner exiles no less than the stalwart Party members and the vacillating fellow travelers. It was the fact of this guilt which the Allies simply incorporated into the fateful hypothesis of collective guilt. Herein lies the reason for the Germans' profound awkwardness, which strikes every outsider, in any discussion of questions of the past. How difficult it must be to find a reasonable attitude is perhaps more clearly expressed by the cliché that the past is still “unmastered” and in the conviction held particularly by men of good will that the first thing to be done is to set about “mastering” it. Perhaps that cannot be done with any past, but certainly not with the past of Hitler Germany. The best that can be achieved is to know precisely what it was, and to ensure this knowledge, and then to wait and see what comes of knowing and enduring.</strong><br />
<strong>Perhaps I can best explain this by a less painful example. After the First World War we experienced the “mastering of the past” in a spate of descriptions of the war that varied enormously in kind and quality; naturally, this happened not only in Germany, but in all the affected countries. Nevertheless, nearly thirty years were to pass before a work of art appeared which so transparently displayed the inner truth of the event that it became possible to say: Yes, this is how it was. And in this novel, William Faulkner's A Fable, very little is described, still less explained, and nothing at all “mastered”; its end is tears, which the reader also weeps, and what remains beyond that is the “tragic effect” or the “tragic pleasure,” the shattering emotion which makes one able to accept the fact that something like this war could have happened at all. I deliberately mention tragedy because it more than the other literary forms represents a process of recognition. The tragic hero becomes knowledgeable by re-experiencing what has been done in the way of suffering, and in this pathos, in resuffering the past, the network of individual acts is transformed into an event, a significant whole. The dramatic climax of tragedy occurs when the actor turns into a sufferer; therein lies its peripeteia, the disclosure of the denouement. But even non-tragic plots become genuine events only when they are experienced a second time in the form of suffering by memory operating retrospectively and perceptively. Such memory can speak only when indignation and just anger, which impel us to action, have been silenced – and that needs time. We can no more master the past than we can undo it. But we can reconcile ourselves to it. The form for this is the lament, which arises out of all recollection. It is, as Goethe has said:</strong><br />
<strong>Pain arises anew, lament repeats</strong><br />
<strong>Life's labyrinthine, erring course. […]</strong><br />
<strong>At the same time we cannot fail to see the limited political relevance of such an existence, even if it is sustained in purity. Its limits are inherent in the fact that strength and power are not the same; that power arises only where people act together, but not where people grow stronger as individuals. No strength is ever great enough to replace power; wherever strength is confronted by power, strength will always succumb. But even the sheer strength to escape and to resist while fleeing cannot materialize where reality is bypassed or forgotten – as when an individual thinks himself too good and noble to pit himself against such a world, or when he fails to face up to the absolute “negativeness” or prevailing world conditions at a given time. How tempting it was, for example, simply to ignore the intolerably stupid blabber of the Nazis. But seductive though it may be to yield to such temptations and to hole up in the refuge of one's own psyche, the result will always be a loss of humanness along with the forsaking of reality.</strong><br />
<strong>Thus, in the case of a friendship between a German and a Jew under the conditions of the Third Reich it would scarcely have been a sign of humanness for the friends to have said: Are we not both human beings? It would have been mere evasion of reality and of the world common to both at that time; they would not have been resisting the world as it was. A law that prohibited the intercourse of Jews and Germans could be evaded but could not be defied by people who denied the reality of the distinction. In keeping with a humanness that had not lost the solid ground of reality, a humanness in the midst of the reality of persecution, they would have had to say to each other: A German and a Jew, and friends. But wherever such a friendship succeeded at that time (of course the situation is completely changed, nowadays) and was maintained in purity, that is to say without false guilt complexes on the one side and false complexes of superiority or inferiority on the other, a bit of humanness in a world become inhuman had been achieved. […]</strong><br />
<strong>Lessing, however, rejoiced in the very thing that has ever – or at least since Parmenides and Plato – distressed philosophers: that the truth, as soon as it is uttered, is immediately transformed into one opinion among many, is contested, reformulated, reduced to one subject of discourse among others. Lessing's greatness does not merely consist in a theoretical insight that there cannot be one single truth within the human world but in his gladness that it does not exist and that, therefore, the unending discourse among men will never cease so long as there are men at all. A single absolute truth, could there have been one, would have been the death of all those disputes in which this ancestor and master of all polemicism in the German language was so much at home and always took sides with the utmost clarity and definiteness. And this would have spelled the end of humanity. […]</strong><br />
<strong>In spite of the difference between the notions of possessing the truth and being right, these two points of view have one thing in common: those who take one or the other are generally not prepared to sacrifice their view to humanity or friendship in case a conflict should arise. They actually believe that to do so would be to violate a higher duty, the duty of “objectivity”; so that even if they occasionally make such a sacrifice they do not feel they are acting out of conscience but are even ashamed of their humanity and often feel distinctly guilty about it. In terms of the age in which we live, and in terms of the many dogmatic opinions that dominate our thinking, we can translate Lessing's conflict into one closer to our experience, by showing its application to the twelve years and the dominant ideology of the Third Reich. Let us for the moment set aside the fact that Nazi racial doctrine is in principle unprovable because it contradicts man's “nature.” But let us assume for the moment that the racial theories could have been convincingly proved. For it cannot be gainsaid that the practical political conclusions the Nazis drew from these theories were perfectly logical. Suppose that a race could indeed be shown by indubitable scientific evidence, to be inferior; would that fact justify its extermination? But the answer to this question is still too easy, because we can invoke the “Thou shalt not kill” which in fact has become the fundamental commandment governing legal and moral thinking of the Occident ever since the victory of Christianity over antiquity. But in terms of a way of thinking governed by neither legal nor moral nor religious strictures – and Lessing's thought was an untrammeled, as “live and changing” as that – the question would have to be posed thus: Would any such doctrine, however convincingly proved, be worth the sacrifice of so much as a single friendship between two men?</strong><br />

<strong>I am convinced that the maps we’ve been shown since grade school – of a vast United States and diverse world, with 5 oceans and 7 continents – is a lie. Instead, the world is confined to an area the size of the supposed New Hampshire. The world is only series of hotels, universities, and airports, surrounded by water. We take off from Chicago O’Hare and circle in a plane for 3 hours before landing 20 miles away at New York JFK. As proof of this I offer debate tournaments. Every tournament I go to sleep in Edmond, only to find myself waking up in Atlanta, San Francisco, Spokane … the location doesn’t matter, everything remains the same.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The world is a few cities, with no space in between, and life a series of hotel rooms. Pack up your suite in Austin: one toothbrush, one toothpaste, travel shampoo and conditioner, two pairs pants, three pairs socks, three shirts, one jacket. Then wake up Dallas to unpack.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>No longer do we ride across the country side, getting lost, pulling into a small diner you’ve never heard of, stopping every hour at weird and scary rest-stops to pee. No, instead we board a plane, go to sleep, and wake up somewhere else. This is the condition afflicting us all in the epoch of late capitalism. We move from Norman hotel room to Wichita hotel room, and at the same time, the world is as if one big hotel: We leave the Kansas City room, take a few steps down the hall, and enter the Chicago room. How convenient that hotels have begun to name their conference rooms accordingly because even they realize THAT is the condition of our world. Jameson furthers that:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Now I want to say a few words about escalators and elevators: ... caught as individual subjects.[[#sdfootnote1sym|1]]</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Day after day, night after night, it’s always the same question: Are we drinking or cutting cards? This is our escapism, a simple card game. If we have a higher card in the suit of planetary extinction, it trumps your deuce of genocide. This is the world we escape into – no longer even poker, a game of strategy and artifice. No, today we are playing War!, where we slap down our cards and see who wins. Khalilzad beats Mead, Mead beats Sid-Ahmed, Sid-Ahmed beat Berube … God damn it, you played the race card!</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It seems these citations alone, the random shouting of author and date now so effective and efficient, supplant description, explanation, and reference to worldly events and situations that are no longer even necessary. This is the perverse world in which students cloister themselves in Dallas Perkin’s basement for weeks, arriving at noon and leaving after midnight.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Debate becomes the reason we study philosophy or read the newspaper every day. When life becomes a hotel, debate becomes our life. The supreme irony of this is that we escape the IKEA furniture, the breakfast buffets with 12 types of cereal and no milk, the fake flowers and assembly-line paintings, only to turn debate into the most-postmodern Hotel of them all. The Bonaventure, in which Miami, LA, and Fullerton are replaced by the Paris ’68 room, the Berlin ‘89 room, the Berkeley ‘60’s room. Debate becomes this orgy of difference, like Epcot center, where we can walk out of a Heidegger throwdown, take a few steps down the hall and debate about healthcare politics. Our nights in the hotel, walking from drinking with K-State, to smoking with Wyoming, to hanging out in the judges lounge, is mirrored by our days at the university, Spanos against Trinity, Nietzsche against Texas, Baudrillard against Emory. Everything is so DIFFERENT! –At least, for two hours, then we pack up our tubs, board the airplane, and wake up in a new city reading a new argument.</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>The big question is: does gaming ... debate realm – not to become poets.[[#sdfootnote2sym|2]]</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Debate is our escape, it is our drug. For these two hours, this hotel room is the only place I’d want to be, ‘cause I’ve never found a high greater than reading that perfect card. So we cut more cards, read more arguments, we’ve got to fucking SPEED UP! There’s more to be said, more knowledge to be produced, because more is better – more breadth, more depth, more education.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>God knows there’s no time like the present, and none to spare in the 2NC. But Virillio warns us “Without the freedom to critique and reconstruct, there is no truly free game: we are addicts and nothing more’. […]Virilio cautions against complacent addiction, inviting us to imagine the consequences of technology: those elite pilots disconnected from sensory experience and important societal connections, capable only as a result of their technological dependency.”[[#sdfootnote3sym|3]]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>It seems we have reached Nietzsche’s twilight of the idols, in which “The text finally disappeared under the interpretation.”[[#sdfootnote4sym|4]] The resolution has at last become a fable as our modern preoccupation with procedure has finally triumphed over substance and content. In the pursuit of ensuring that debate provides its participants with a rigorous, yet manageable “research burden” while all along continuing to live up to all those standards of “fairness” and “competitive equity” our liberal academic community holds so dear – it seems that we have neglected the spaces in between.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Terms such as competitive equity, switch-side – even nuclear weapon for God’s sake! – seem to swirl around frantically. Now, in the twilight of our topical idols, the question remains what to do? Don’t get us wrong, as Shanahan said,</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>“I don’t know if you hear it, but ... Which is, I think, magical.”[[#sdfootnote5sym|5]]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This is the quality, above all else, that is circumscribed from our game, our hotel of debate. No matter how many idols we smash, the ballot remains, with the tantalizing promise of victory or threat of loss. Lose sight of this, and you risk going 0/8 like a Stephen Davis puppet show. So we compete; and, as the 1AC proved, we are nothing BUT competitors. Debate has been transformed from a vibrant political engagement, to a game, in which the aff only exists as the enemy of the neg, the neg only exists as the enemy of the aff. This is the ever-present mode we adopt when encountering that difference which threatens to teach us and enrich our lives, we define ourselves in opposition: we are Absolute and everything which differs is Other. Simone de Beauvoir explains:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Thus humanity is male and ... the Absolute – she is the Other.’ (Beauvoir 1989 xxii)[[#sdfootnote6sym|6]]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The 1AC invites us in, as long as we’ll participate in their Epcot Center orgy of difference, as long as we’ll be the woman to their man, the Jew to their anti-Semite – as long as we’ll be different in the way dictated by the rules of our game. That they spent most of the 1AC reading preempts proves this: they construct an evil Other onto which they can project all fear and uncertainty. The position of the negative is reduced to a scapegoat, to be shouted down, to be purged.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Sartre’s Anti-Semite and Jew, ... be beautified and deified.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We agree with the 1AC, of course nuclear weapons should be reduced, but we would approach debate otherwise. We do not think that the hotel should be torn down or all games are bad, “games have an incredibly imaginative side, a marvelous narrative, a journey through which the player can be transformed into a hero. […]But now the travelers are traveled. Dreamers are dreamed. They are no longer free to move about, they are traveled by the program. They are no longer free to dream, they are dreamed by the program. […] Faced with the plethora of possibilities, what game should we play? Play at being a critic.”[[#sdfootnote7sym|7]]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Thus we would debate as critique: that is critique as a verb, we refuse final closure, refuse the close the door of our room and move on to the next. Instead, we “discern the value”[[#sdfootnote8sym|8]] of things rather than affirm one plan of action or alternative. Kant explains:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We deal with a concept dogmatically ... if we consider it as contained under another concept of the object which constitutes a principle of reason and determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely critically if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking it, without undertaking to decide anything about its object.[[#sdfootnote9sym|9]]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This means attending to those halls and spaces in between, rather than leaving each debate, each argument, each hope of difference, sequestered within its hotel room. Most of all, this means being open to the possibility of being changed by debate.</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Although the 1ac was very interesting indeed, they forgot to mention something important: Empire is materializing before our very eyes…Along … global circuits of production has emerged a global order… Empire is … the sovereign power that governs the world… in step with the processes of globalization, the sovereignty of nation-states… has progressively declined. The primary factors of production and exchange…move with increasing ease across national boundaries; hence the nation-state has less and less power … Even the most dominant nation-states should no longer be thought of as supreme and sovereign authorities, … even within their own borders. … Throughout the … transformations, political …, state …, and regulatory mechanisms … rule the realm of economic and social production … sovereignty has taken a new form[[#_ftn1|[1]]]… Lets be clear now, they’re talking about removing barriers to immigration, improving peoples’ lives, bringing-into as opposed to excluding-from, but that’s what we’re talking about too. The assimilation of the other into the new global sovereign is the ultimate apparatus of imperial command … the magnanimous, liberal face of Empire. All are welcome within its boundaries, … Empire is blind to differences… Setting aside differences means, in effect, taking away the potential of the various constituent subjectivities. The resulting … power neutrality makes possible the establishment and … Empire. … the Empire is a machine for universal integration, an open mouth with inﬁnite appetite, inviting all to come peacefully within its domain… [it] does not fortify its boundaries to push others away, but rather pulls them within its paciﬁc order, … The second moment of imperial control, its differential moment, involves the afﬁrmation of differences accepted within the imperial realm. …The differential moment of imperial control must be followed by the management and hierarchization of these differences in a general economy of command. Whereas colonial power sought to ﬁx pure, separate identities, Empire thrives on circuits of movement and mixture…[[#_ftn2|[2]]] At first this may seem to be innocuous, who cares right? An empire of what? For Whom? Yet far far up and away, the manifestation of the new global production factory looms, foreboding and dangerous. The effects of this global order are yet to be seen in some places in the world, but the subjects created by the 1ac see them on their path to immigration. Toni Negri warns us that “the Mediterranean has become a highway of death …We are Therefore in a situation in which homogeneity and concord could be glorified, a realized melting pot. A politics of welcoming is not pursued, however, for economic reasons linked to the reduction of labor cost. You also have to add here the harshness of the State instruments, like, for example, the administrative procedure for obtaining visas and for family reunification, which become terrible tasks for the immigrant worker instead of being a right or an award. This emerges, moreover, from their accounts.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The Mediterranean has become an absurd sea with highways of immigration on which an evil genius sometimes puts stones and nails in order to sink the machines that pass through it. The evil genius is a European agent that tries to lower the cost of immigration. We find again the big schemes of capitalist power: the use of tenor to lower the cost of development and, at the same time, raise profits. Then there is the problem of the assimilation of masses of workers inserted in the deficiencies and in the inter­ruptions of the current transformation of the industrial and capitalist system. The Fordist modality has finished but only in the production of commodities; it continues, however, to be proposed as a hegemonic mode of social organization, as an irrational and inadequate relation between labor and nonlabor, between industrial labor and territorial organization. The Fordist relation between labor and ways of life has completely collapsed. It is in this vacuum of relation that the weak parts of the internal populations, especially immigrants, are inserted. And it is in this interruption of the socioeconomical order that the tragedies of immigration take place.[[#_ftn3|[3]]]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The 1AC begs visa applicants to traverse these highways of death and destruction, never asking those navigating the destruction for consent in their part of creating the new global empire. Dillon and Reed have written extensively about knowledge production and population management: As a precursor to global governance, governmentality, …, poses the question of order … in terms … of the management of population. …, where there is an operation of power there is knowledge, and where there is knowledge there is an operation of power. Here discursive formations emerge and, …, in every society the production of discourse is at once controlled, selected, organised and redistributed by a certain number of procedures whose role is to ward off its powers and dangers, to gain mastery over its chance events, to evade its ponderous, formidable materiality… where there is a policy problematic there is expertise, … a policy problematic will emerge. … elaborated in terms of discrete forms of knowledge as well as interlocking policy domains. … Policy &quot;actors&quot; develop and compete on the basis of the expertise that grows up around such problems or clusters of problems and their client populations. … there is no limit to the ways in which the management of population may be problematized. All aspects of human … life, is problematizable. … Governmentality thereby creates a market for policy, … in which problematizations go looking for policy sponsors while policy sponsors fiercely compete on behalf of their favored problematizations. Reproblematization of problems is constrained by the institutional and ideological investments surrounding accepted &quot;problems,&quot; and by the sheer difficulty of challenging the inescapable ontological and epistemological assumptions that go into their very formation. … And there is nothing so fiercely ridiculed as the suggestion that the real problem with problematizations exists precisely at the level of such assumptions. Such &quot;paralysis of analysis&quot; is precisely what policymakers seek to avoid since they are compelled constantly to respond to circumstances over which they ordinarily have in fact both more and less control than they proclaim. … Serial policy failure is no simple shortcoming that … policy--…will ultimately overcome. Serial policy failure is rooted in the ontological and epistemological assumptions that fashion the ways in which global governance encounters and problematizes life as a process of emergence through fitness landscapes that constantly adaptive and changing ensembles have continuously to negotiate. … global liberal governance is not a linear problem-solving process committed to the resolution of objective policy problems simply by bringing better information and knowledge to bear upon them. …[[#_ftn4|[4]]]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Fox News is the noisy background to this discussion, we hear about border militarization, the emergence of the minutemen, armed guards for the territory of the united states, and we’re infuriated. OUTRAGE! Unfortunately, the affirmative offers no release for us. Negri and Hardt tell us: it is a grave mistake to harbor any nostalgia for the powers of the nation-state or to resurrect any politics that celebrates the nation… these efforts are in vain because the decline of the nation-state …is a structural and irreversible process. … even if the nation were still to be an effective weapon, the nation carries with it a whole series of repressive structures and ideologies … and any strategy that relies on it should be rejected on that basis.[[#_ftn5|[5]]] What has replaced the modern nation-state is a society whose diminishing civil liberties and increasing rates of incarceration are in certain respects a manifestation of a constant social war. … The new forms of power and control operate increasingly in contradiction with the new social composition of the population and serve merely to block its new forms of productivity and expression. … In the modern period the wartime suspension of democratic politics was usually posed as temporary, since war was conceived as an exceptional condition.27 If …the state of war has instead become our permanent global condition, then the suspension of democracy tends also to become the norm rather than the exception…. the current global state of war forces all nations, even the professedly most democratic, to become authoritarian and totalitarian.[[#_ftn6|[6]]]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">What then are we to do with our rage within the space of politics? How should we, or you, constitute ourselves within the debate? What is the role of the critic? What is the role of the scholar? Negri and Hardt tell us Liberation is the reintroduction of the subject into the imperial space. Liberation, thus only becomes possible when we cast off the shackles of slavery to the imperial state, because: Empire is constructed …by the multitude … These … powers conﬂict … with the constituted power of Empire. They are completely positive since their ‘‘being- against’’ is a ‘‘being-for,’’ … We are situated … at that hinge of … the virtual and the possible, … Space that merely can be traversed must be transformed into a space of life; circulation must become freedom. … the mobile multitude must achieve a global citizenship… the struggle against the slavery of belonging to a nation, …is entirely positive…Only a space that is animated by subjective circulation … can be real… Outside every Enlightenment cloud … the desire of the multitude is not the cosmopolitical state but a common species….the bodies are mixed and the nomads speak a common tongue. … the postcolonial hero is … continually transgresses territorial and racial boundaries, … Imperial command, by contrast, isolates populations … and allows them to act only in the straitjackets of subordinated postcolonial nations. The exodus from localism, the transgression of customs and boundaries, and the desertion from sovereignty were the operative forces in the liberation of the Third World…Emancipation is the entry of new nations and peoples into the imperial society of control…liberation, … means the destruction of boundaries and patterns of forced migration, the reappropriation of space… [[#_ftn7|[7]]] This calls into question normal standards of competition. The affirmative in this case should not merely be allowed to say debate’s latest 4-letter word and wish away the negative strategy. Under an alternate standard of competition the idea of the perm should be suspect to you. We propose in this debate that there be an alternate standard of competition in light of the 1AC. Our framework for this debate is that the ballot should represent who best advances the liberation of the multitude. Our advocacy uses our privilege in this space to expose and confront the practices of Empire. We apprehend and reject the logic of imperialism that thrives throughout these academic walls. This is what you vote for when you vote negative. Voting affirmative does not give you this ability. If it is true that Empire has emptied the space of politics, nothing that the affirmative has spoken warrants any belief that it is on the side of confronting the logic of imperialism. The strategy that they invoke is not a new strategy that we as imperial subjects have not had the opportunity to hear, see, or read about in the past. It is more of the same, unfortunately. It is warming, possibly inspiring, and most obviously it is cute. All the while threatening Absolute Destruction. The thinning of the war function and the thickening of the police function maintain the ontological stigmata of absolute annihilation: the war police maintain the threat of genocide and nuclear destruction as their ultimate foundation[[#_ftn8|[8]]]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> They will claim that they are not the kind of theory that has allowed for the growth of empire, that the differences they assimilate are somehow… well different. They are of course guilt free, devoid of any responsibility. One must be skeptical of this defense due to its widespread prevalence throughout our society that has allowed the monster out of the cave. There are no perpetrators, only victims. Our argument only asks that the 1AC be held accountable for its requested existence in this imperial space. As members of the multitude it is our responsibility to not fall into a fear of confronting others and questioning their efficacy in this time. The population, … is characterized by all kinds of differences, but … &quot;the people&quot; is one. The multitude, in contrast, is many. The multitude is composed of innumerable internal differences that can never be reduced to a unity or a single identity—different cultures, races, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations; different forms of labor; different ways of living; different views of the world; and different desires. The multitude is a multiplicity of all these singular differences. The masses are also contrasted with the people because they too cannot be reduced to a unity or an identity. … The essence of the masses is indifference: all differences are submerged and drowned in the masses. All the colors of the population fade to gray. … In the multitude, social differences remain different. The multitude is many-colored, like Joseph's magical coat. Thus the challenge posed by the concept of multitude is for a social multiplicity to manage to communicate and act in common while remaining internally different.[[#_ftn9|[9]]] Our argument is simple, we are compelled by the contemporary state of affairs to respond to the Empires new clothes. Not only does their methodology ignore the plight of immigrants, workers, and all peoples of imperial subjectivity, it insufferably casts aside any praxis that could be helpful to their struggle. Under our framework you vote negative because the 1AC was 9 minutes of irrelevant nonsense: Intellectual masturbation and social paralysis. </span><br />
