And these protectionist barriers become politically sticky and undermine global economic integration<br />
<br />
Lucie Cerna and William Hynes – 9/2-5/10, “globalization backlash? The influence of global governance in trade and immigration”<br />
Governments should find “effective . . . stimulus for ailing economies.<br />
Excluding migrants on the basis of compassionate racism is ineffective – it doesn’t stop people from moving – it makes them unemployed, denies them agency, excludes them from our public sphere and collapses their ability to contribute to their country of origin economically.<br />

Much of the public debate . . . its high-tech economy. <br />
Immigrants living in the US create an anchor for knowledge to circulated back to their home countires – benefitting their economy, boosting relations between the US, India, China, and other target countries, sustaining development, and boosting international trade and globalization <br />

Michael Clemens, Harvard 2009, “skill flow: a fundamental reconsideration of skilled-worker mobility and development” CGD working paper 180<br />
But cash gifts are . . . and reinforced over time. <br />
Your link to brain drain is wrong – these immigrants often have dual citizenship and establish startups in both the US and their home country benefitting both economies – proves that migration is win-win and NOT zero sum<br />

Unemployment is headed back above 10 percent causing a double dip recession<br />
<br />
Newman 9/15 (Rick, Chief Business Correspondent at U.S. News and World Report, “How to Tell When the Recession's Really Over”, 9/15/10, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2010/09/15/how-to-tell-when-the-recessions-really-over.html" rel="nofollow">http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/flowchart/2010/09/15/how-to-tell-when-the-recessions-really-over.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Most economists think the recession technically ended a year or so ago, when the economy started growing again after shrinking for five quarters out of six. But a year's worth of &quot;recovery&quot; hardly feels like it. Unemployment, at 9.6 percent, is painfully high, and companies show little interest in hiring. That leaves nearly 15 million unemployed Americans wondering what to do next. Overall, Americans have lost $12 trillion in home equity, investments, and other forms of net worth. We're ready to rebuild and go back to work, but instead of picking up steam, the economy seems to be stalling, possibly headed for a dreaded double-dip recession. The prolonged malaise could cost Democrats dearly in the upcoming midterm elections. [See 11 ways to plan for a double-dip recession.] Healing is underway in badly damaged parts of the economy. But improvements have been too slow and subtle for many Americans to notice. Here are six ways to tell when we're finally entering a recovery that feels like one: The unemployed people you know start to find jobs. Unemployment is the single biggest indicator of economic health—or misery. Rising unemployment cuts into incomes and spending and spooks consumers, so it's hard for housing, retail sales, and other key parts of the economy to recover until jobs come back. So far, they haven't—but layoffs have largely stopped and temporary hiring is picking up, so we're part of the way there. Over the next few months, the unemployment rate is likely to tick upward, perhaps topping 10 percent once again. But that could be good news. If recent patterns hold, more unemployed Americans who have given up looking for work will start job-hunting again—a sign they're more hopeful than before. When that happens, the labor force will swell, so the portion of the labor force out of work will go higher and theunemployment rate will rise for a few months. But after that, if we're lucky, it should start to fall, for good. Most Americans don't follow the monthly unemployment statistics, but they'll know things are getting better when people they know who are looking for work start to find it, and hiring at their own companies picks up. &quot;Even people who are employed are really afraid about job cuts and wage freezes,&quot; says Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics. &quot;When their laid-off friends and neighbors start to find jobs, it will make people feel more secure about their own jobs.&quot; That will provide a long-awaited boost to consumer confidence.<br />

Don’t believe false green shoots – High unemployment will overcome any positive trends<br />

“If we continue to lose 600,000-plus jobs a month, that will burn out those green shoots pretty quickly,” he says. “If you lose jobs like that, it continues to undermine consumer spending and confidence.” ‘Head Fake’ Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, says he wouldn’t be surprised to see a first- quarter gain in consumer spending that “may turn out to be a head fake, which isn’t uncommon in a recession.” Spending might turn lower in the current quarter before stabilizing in the second half, he says. <br />

H1Bs spur job creation and drive up wages<br />

<br />
American industry's explosive demand for highly skilled workers is being stifled by the federal quota on H-1B visas for foreign-born highly skilled workers. The quota is hampering output, especially in high-technology sectors, and forcing companies to consider moving production offshore. The number of H-1B visas was unlimited before 1990, when it was capped at 65,000 a year. In 1998 the annual cap was raised to 115,000 for 1999 and 2000, but industry is expected to fill the quota several months before the end of the fiscal year. The shortage shows no sign of abating. Demand for core information technology workers in the United States is expected to grow by 150,000 a year for the next eight years, a rate of growth that cannot be met by the domestic labor supply alone. Fears that H-1B workers cause unemployment and depress wages are unfounded. H-1B workers create jobs for Americans by enabling the creation of new products and spurring innovation. High-tech industry executives estimate that a new H-1B engineer will typically create demand for an additional 3-5 American workers. Reports of systematic underpayment and fraud in the program are false. From 1991 through September 1999, only 134 violations were found by the U.S. Department of Labor, and only 7, or fewer than 1 per year, were found to be intentional. The lack of widespread violations confirms that the vast majority of H-1B workers is being paid the legally required prevailing wage or more, undercutting charges that they are driving down wages for native workers. Wages are rising fastest and unemployment rates are lowest in industries in which H-1B workers are most prevalent.<br />

H1Bs don’t trade off with domestic workers and prevent off shoring, which devastates job growth – Independently innovation by foreign workers creates countless new jobs<br />

<br />
In an intensely competitive global environment, with constant pressure placed on employers to cut expenses and increase productivity, the H-1B visa category has become a convenient target for critics who try to draw a connection between immigration and domestic layoffs. Although it is true that large U.S. corporations have been laying off workers in record numbers, 26 many employers are firing one type of worker and hiring other workers with different skills. H-1B professionals are not the cause of those layoffs and hiring practices but an important source of flexibility in the labor market. The need for H-1B professionals is another manifestation of the inexorable pressure on companies to adapt quickly to changing market conditions. Constraining H-1B hiring won’t end corporate downsizing. It will simply force employers to shift more and more of their operations abroad, where they can get the resources they need, including all-important human capital, to maintain production.27 When the demand for workers cannot be met domestically, which is the case today, U.S. companies must look elsewhere. Ideally, they would hire foreign workers and integrate them into their existing U.S. operations. But if U.S. companies are unable to gain access to the workers they need because of limits on H-1B hiring, then some are left with only one choice: hire the workers they need abroad with a corresponding offshore shift in domestic operations. Asked how Motorola Inc. would respond to the hiring crisis caused by inadequate numbers of H-1B visas, Motorola’s head of global immigration services recently stated: “If we have to do that [shift work overseas], we will, but that’s not a very practical business approach to the problem. . . . And it’s not very good for American workers.”28 This phenomenon, known as offshore outsourcing, can be harmful to the U.S. economy and U.S. workers, especially in the more knowledge- intensive industries. The hiring of foreignborn highly skilled workers can have a positive ripple effect not only on the companies that hire the workers but on the economy as a whole. Highly skilled workers are able to create new products and, in some cases, whole new sectors of an industry, creating opportunities for other workers. T. J. Rodgers, president and CEO of Cypress Semiconductors, testified before Congress that for every foreign-born engineer he is allowed to hire, he can hire five other workers in marketing, manufacturing, and other related areas.29 At Sun Microsystems, both the Java computer language and the innovative SPARC microprocessor were created by engineers first hired through the H-1B program; their work then opened opportunities for thousands of other workers.30<br />
<br />
The decision to offshore is based on perception of the cap<br />
<br />
Cromwell 9 (Courtney L., “Friend or Fore of the U.S. Labor Market: Why Congress Should Raise or Eliminate the H-1B Visa Cap,” BROOKLYN JOURNAL OF CORPORATE, FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL LAW v. 3, Spring 2009, p. 475-477.)<br />
<br />
Proponents of the H-1B visa argue that the visa cap threatens to set the United States behind in innovation and science and actually increases layoffs of U.S. workers because it encourages off-shoring. n190 If employers in the United States cannot hire foreign workers with the experience and training required, &quot;then companies who are trying to remain globally competitive are left with only one solution: shifting those operations offshore.&quot; n191 Many U.S. companies &quot;concede that the uncertainty created by Congress' inability to provide a reliable mechanism to hire skilled professionals has encouraged placing more human resources outside the United States to avoid being subject to legislative winds.&quot;<br />

In the late 1990s, before the technology bubble burst, H-1B visas were gone within days after the application period began in April. Since the great recession hit, demand for H-1B visas has tailed off considerably. In 2009, it took until December to hit the cap. But there are signs that demand is picking up again, as the economy rebounds. And many pro-immigration groups say these skilled workers are needed now, more than ever, to pull the U.S. out of the economic malaise, especially since technology will be a key component to recovery.<br />

Absent the plan high unemployment will trigger a double-dip recession<br />

Unemployment is called a “lagging” indicator by most economists. The jobless rate recovery often runs a quarter or two behind an upturn in GDP. A prolonged period of unemployment higher than 10% may break that mold. A large enough number of people without work could hamper consumer spending enough that some parts of the economy could move back into a recession next year. The ranks of the unemployed are rarely good credit risks. This poses important problems for banks which hope to see the quality of their loan portfolios begin to rebound. There is a point at which unemployment becomes both a lagging and leading economic indicator. It shows the end of one recession and foretells the beginning of another if double-digit joblessness persists for any period beyond next year. The modern economy has not experienced this but once in the last several decades. That was in the early 1980s. The banking system was not as riddled with problems among its largest firms then and the auto industry was not in need of nearly complete nationalization. Unemployment at or above 10% will also financially cripple many states, some of them to the level where they may not be able to provide basic services or pay their own workers. Those problems begin to cascade as states lack the ability to provide social benefits to the unemployed and state worker layoffs increase those numbers. Unemployment could pass GDP damage, housing, and the credit crisis as the defining aspect of this recession. GDP may return to a level of 1% growth or simply move to zero and stay there for some time. The government has partially solved the credit crisis by putting hundreds of billions of dollars into the banking sector and dropping interest rates. It has not been able to do anything about jobs and nothing indicates that this will change. The stimulus package may be putting more money into people’s saving accounts and may also be moving up stock prices as money printed by the government makes its way into equity investing. But, at the same time, the Administration watches the economy move further and further away from its goal of adding or preserving three and a half million jobs.<br />

<br />
Of all the foreign workers coming to the United States, no category provides such an instant boost to the economy as do H-1B professionals. Although they are here no longer than six years, H-1B professionals, like their permanent counterparts, satisfy unmet labor needs and provide a diverse, skilled, and motivated labor supply to complement our domestic workforce and spur job creation. But unlike their permanent counterparts, H-1B professionals offer the very important advantage of enabling employers to meet immediate labor needs. Employers can hire H-1Bs in months or even weeks. In contrast, it can take four years or more to qualify a worker for permanent “green card” status.8<br />

Recessions, especially the deep downturn that started in 2008, always cause us to scramble. Companies routinely slash spending while governments do the opposite, trying to shock the country's economic heart into beating again through heroic measures such as the recent stimulus package. Concern about a possible &quot;double dip&quot; recession have the hands of corporate CFO's and Washington officials hovering over the panic button again, mere months after the last push. But our scramble to reduce the impact of the latest disaster distracts us from addressing the deep-seated problems that inexorably create the next disaster, and the one after that. Why waste energy on the distant future, we reason, when we'll never get to that future if we don't solve the problem staring us in the face? We all focus on addressing here-and-now emergencies because we have no choice. What limits our options are not outside events, such as economic downturns, but internal events that go on inside our brains. As a neuroscientist, I've learned that our brains are hardwired to avoid near term threats and to ignore long term opportunities , because our brains are identical to those of our distant ancestors who faced a daily struggle for survival. When our brains evolved into their present form, about 50,000 years ago, the environment was incredibly harsh and risky, limiting life expectancies to 20-25 years. Diverting attention from day-today survival in those Paleolithic times would have invited disaster. Neuroscientists call this hard-wired preference for quick fixes over long range pursuits temporal myopia: everything past the immediate future looks fuzzy, or even invisible, and is therefore irrelevant. Unless we overcome our temporal myopia, we'll continue to put band-aids on this economy and it will continue to deteriorate: in other words, we'll continue to treat symptoms and never go for a complete cure. And what would such a cure look like? Let's start by looking at disease that afflicts us. The fundamental problem with America's economy is a decline in the capabilities and motivation of our workforce. True economic growth -- not the artificial kind spurred by fiscal policy -- stems from innovations such as Google's search engine that create entirely new businesses and markets. Such innovations grow out of technological advances, which in turn emerge from earlier scientific discoveries. Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, reinforced this idea when he said &quot;Capitalism expands wealth primarily through creative destruction -- the process by which the cash flow from obsolescent, low-return capital is invested in high-return, cutting-edge technologies.&quot; And where do cutting-edge technologies come from? Modern Economists such as Paul Romer, Robert Lucas and Robert Barro argue that technical innovations ultimately spring from the cognitive abilities of &quot;human capital&quot; (people) who attain these abilities through education and training. But the National Academy of Science report, &quot;Is America Falling off a Flat Earth?&quot; points out that science, technology and math education of the American workforce has been in steep decline for decades, as students now choose careers in business, law or media over the high tech jobs that were so attractive in the post-Sputnik 60's and 70's. In stark contrast, workforces of countries such as China are becoming much more tech savvy, such that China now rivals the US and Europe in patents and technical publications. S. James Gates, a physicist who served on the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology said, &quot;If you look at U.S. performance on various international metrics, depending on which one you use, we come out something like 24th or 25th in the world.&quot; In my own informal survey of middle school and high-school students, conducted during school speaking engagements to increase the allure of science, most kids tell me that they plan to steer clear of science because it's &quot;way too hard.&quot; Other kids observe that &quot;scientists are nerdy.&quot; As a result of these widespread attitudes -- nurtured by Hollywood's portrayal of scientists as socially clueless eccentrics -- innovation-fueled economic growth will increasingly take place outside America's borders, and our economy will spiral into relative decline for the foreseeable future. We can pull out of this dive, however, if we see through our temporal myopia to some hard facts: we will never motivate the majority of America's youth to give up &quot;cool&quot; careers that promise to make lot of money for &quot;nerdy,&quot; un-cool science and technology careers that require hard work in school. We have simply grown too comfortable as a society and lost the fire in our belly. During World War II, and right after Sputnik, did students, teachers and parents let the prospect of hard work learning science, math and engineering deter them? No, because we faced obvious crises. Harvard Business School Professor, John Kao, author of Innovation Nation: How America is Losing Its Innovative Edge, Why It Matters and How We Can Get it Back said, &quot;&quot;Fifty years ago the Soviet satellite Sputnik burst the nation's bubble of complacency and challenged America's sense of global leadership. But we rose to the challenge with massive funding for education, revamped school curricula in science and math, created NASA and put a man on the moon.&quot; Today we face a brain race vs. a space race that is every bit as problematic for America as the first Russian satellite, but this crisis amounts to a &quot;silent Sputnik&quot; that flies under America's radar. Out of sight, out of mind. I believe that Americans are unlikely to notice, let alone react to such a stealth threat. The only answer is to reach out to motivated Americans, in places like China and India, who don't yet know they're going to be Americans. Let's gear up a recruiting system that combs secondary schools in China, India, Russia, Europe and South America for top science and technology talent, just as college football programs look for the best high school athletes. We'll offer these kids -- who do have fire in their bellies because they've grown up in countries that haven't gotten complacent -- full scholarships to American colleges and a fast track to US citizenship once they complete their studies. This will, in the long run, inject new vitality into our workforce and our economy and help cure our deep economic ills. <br />

A U.S. double dip causes another global financial meltdown<br />
<br />
USA Today 9/15 (“Banks bounce back, but can they handle next crisis?”, 9/15/10, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2010-09-15-banks15_CV_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2010-09-15-banks15_CV_N.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Today, the nation's big banks are in much better shape than they were two years ago, but the issue of how to handle the collapse of another cross-border giant still shadows the global economy. Troubling weaknesses are visible in the smaller regional banks that attract less public attention. And plenty of additional change lies ahead for the industry as it battles regulators about implementing new domestic and global banking rules. NEW RULES: But will governments use them in a crisis? BLAMELESS? Lehman's ex-CEO says firm did everything it could to limit risks &quot;They have more capital. Much better management of their liquidity. In general, they're being more cautious,&quot; says Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;But the overall culture remains the same, and the system is largely unreformed.&quot; Last year's government-run stress tests led to the nation's 19 largest banks raising $205 billion in capital to buttress themselves against future losses. Another sharp decline in U.S. housing prices or in commercial real estate could yet hammer bank balance sheets. Likewise, if Europe's major banks suffer significant losses on their holdings of government debt from countries such as Greece or Ireland, U.S. banks could feel the aftershocks. If the economy sinks into a double-dip recession, U.S. banks would need to raise an additional $80 billion in capital, the International Monetary Fund concluded this summer. &quot;Stability is tenuous. ... Bank balance sheets remain fragile, and capital buffers may still be inadequate in the face of further increases in non-performing loans,&quot; said the 51-page IMF study. Confidence returns Lehman's Sept. 15, 2008, bankruptcy filing marked the break between a challenging episode of financial weakness and the onset of the worst global panic since the Great Depression. The collapse of such a storied firm — Lehman had been a Wall Street fixture since before the Civil War— caused banks to regard each other with unalloyed suspicion. Unsure which institution might be the next to succumb to losses from complex mortgage-backed securities, routine bank-to-bank lending dried up. Within a month, one measure of banks' willingness to make short-term loans to other banks registered the financial equivalent of a heart attack. The so-called TED spread, the difference between interbank loans and short-term government debt, jumped to 4.63 percentage points — almost 15 times its 2000-2007 average of 0.31. Today, the spread is just 0.16 percentage points, one reflection of the credit market's return to normalcy. The late 2008 credit freeze sent the already wobbly economy into a nose dive. In the three months prior to Lehman's implosion, the economy lost an average of 246,000 jobs per month. In the next three months, labor market casualties averaged 652,000. By then, the last remaining major investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, had become plain-vanilla bank holding companies, submitting to Federal Reserve regulation of their activities in return for access to the Fed's financial lifeline. Now, with memories of their near-death experiences fading, the nation's largest banks are once again booking profits as if the global financial crisis never occurred. In the second quarter, the industry posted earnings of $21.6 billion compared with a loss of $4.4 billion in the same period one year ago. It was the highest quarterly profit total since the third quarter of 2007, shortly before the recession began, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Some individual bank performances were eye-popping: Bank of America reported $3.1 billion in second-quarter profits, as did Wells Fargo. Citigroup earned $2.7 billion. The image of highflying bankers recovering nicely while 14.9 million Americans remain jobless — Goldman Sachs' payroll is up 9.3% the past year — has complicated the Obama administration's efforts to resuscitate the banks. Public ire has been further fueled by often-anemic bank lending. The volume of bank loans grew at an annual rate of 7.1% in the past decade, reaching a peak around $7.8 trillion in mid-2008. Since then, banks' total loans have steadily shrunk, though the pace of contraction has slowed in recent months, according to Capital Economics. Loan volume in August was 6.6% below that of one year earlier; in May, the decline was nearly 9%. Still, banks continue to stockpile excess reserves at the Fed rather than lend it. Before the Lehman bankruptcy intensified the financial crisis, excess bank reserves were negligible. But as the panic spread, bank reserves soared to the current level of $1.03 trillion — up $171.7 billion in the past year. &quot;Banks could actually expand enormously the amount of loans they're providing,&quot; says Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. Ashworth estimates that using their excess reserves, banks could make new loans worth roughly $3.5 trillion — more than four times the size of the administration's controversial stimulus program. But after a decade of ludicrously easy credit — best illustrated by so-called NINJA loans, where customers with &quot;no income, no job and no assets&quot; were granted mortgages — the lending pendulum has swung sharply in the other direction. &quot;Banks are very cautious about increasing the supply of their new loans. ... Banks will not be taking the crazy chances they were back then, and we don't want them to,&quot; said Ashworth. The problem isn't limited to the banks. With existing factories operating far below capacity, there is little reason for many businesses to expand. Demand for new commercial and industrial loans was roughly unchanged in the most recent quarter, after having dropped during the three months that ended in April, the Fed said. The most recent Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers showed some signs of easier loan availability. For the second-consecutive quarterly survey, banks reported easier credit for large and midsize businesses. For the first time since 2006, banks said they were making more credit available to smaller businesses. Domestic banks also reported — for the first time since the Fed began asking in January 2009 — that they were no longer shrinking credit lines for existing business customers. &quot;Banks are lending again. But they're still very cautious about what they're willing to get involved in,&quot; said Russ Yates, an analyst at SNL Financial in Charlottesville, Va. Smaller banks are a particular worry. The IMF noted a rising gap between the number of home foreclosures and &quot;seriously delinquent loans&quot; at regional and community banks, suggesting additional loan losses for those institutions. Larger banks hold diversified portfolios that are able to absorb some losses. But the fortunes of smaller banks in areas that have been hardest hit by the housing crash, such as Las Vegas, South Florida and parts of California, rise and fall with those local economies, Yates said. The FDIC's list of problem banks has grown to 829 mostly smaller lending institutions, up from 775 on March 31. Even some banks that received government aid under the Treasury Department's TARP program continue to struggle. In its latest report on the program, the department said 123 banks did not make their scheduled dividend payment to the government on Aug. 16. New rules and more overseers Preventing a repeat of the financial crisis was the focus of the Obama administration's overhaul of financial industry regulation. Critical decisions that will determine how far-reaching the actual changes are will be made by officials in agencies such as the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. &quot;A lot depends upon how it's implemented,&quot; says Nicolas Véron of the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. The IMF's study of the U.S. financial system endorsed the new regulatory approach, though it criticized the arrangement's hydra-headed nature. The number of agencies with responsibility for monitoring the financial sector increased under the new bill, potentially complicating existing inter-agency coordination problems. &quot;We asked many times why bolder action could not be taken,&quot; Chris Towe, deputy director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, told reporters in July. Global banking supervisors agreed Sunday on new rules that will require banks to maintain higher levels of capital reserves. The Basel III regulations, named for the Swiss town where the regulators meet, will boost a critical bank buffer from 2% of assets to 7%. Most U.S. banks already maintain capital cushions in excess of that figure. A few, including Bank of America, Capital One and M&amp;T, may need to raise capital, according to CreditSights, a credit research firm. &quot;The last crisis would likely have been significantly less harsh if capital requirements had been higher,&quot; said Douglas Elliott, a former investment banker now with the Brookings Institution. Bankers, especially in Europe, complained that higher capital requirements would crimp already struggling economies by curbing new loan issuance, so regulators provided an eight-year grace period for the new rules to be phased in. At November's G-20 summit in Seoul, President Obama and other world leaders are expected to give the new rules final approval. Assuming no new crisis before 2019, the Basel III rewrite could make the global financial system safer. But MIT's Johnson, co-author of 13 Bankers, worries that neither the new U.S. nor global rules will be sufficient to forestall a crisis rerun.<br />

Failed recovery risks nuclear war in every region of the globe<br />

Ferguson 9 (Niall, Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University, “The Axis of Upheaval,” Foreign Policy, February 16th Available at: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/02/16/the_axis_of_upheaval" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/02/16/the_axis_of_upheaval</a>)<br />
The Bush years have of course revealed the perils of drawing facile parallels between the challenges of the present day and the great catastrophes of the 20th century. Nevertheless, there is reason to fear that the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression could have comparable consequences for the international system. For more than a decade, I pondered the question of why the 20th century was characterized by so much brutal upheaval. I pored over primary and secondary literature. I wrote more than 800 pages on the subject. And ultimately I concluded, in The War of the World, that three factors made the location and timing of lethal organized violence more or less predictable in the last century. The first factor was ethnic disintegration: Violence was worst in areas of mounting ethnic tension. The second factor was economic volatility: The greater the magnitude of economic shocks, the more likely conflict was. And the third factor was empires in decline: When structures of imperial rule crumbled, battles for political power were most bloody. In at least one of the world’s regions—the greater Middle East—two of these three factors have been present for some time: Ethnic conflict has been rife there for decades, and following the difficulties and disappointments in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States already seems likely to begin winding down its quasi-imperial presence in the region. It likely still will. Now the third variable, economic volatility, has returned with a vengeance .U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s “Great Moderation”—the supposed decline of economic volatility that he hailed in a 2004 lecture—has been obliterated by a financial chain reaction, beginning in theU.S . subprime mortgage market, spreading through the banking system, reaching into the “shadow” system of credit based on securitization, and now triggering collapses in asset prices and economic activity around the world. After nearly a decade of unprecedented growth, the global economy will almost certainly sputter along in 2009, though probably not as much as it did in the early 1930s, because governments worldwide are frantically trying to repress this new depression. But no matter how low interest rates go or how high deficits rise, there will be a substantial increase in unemployment in most economies this year and a painful decline in incomes. Such economic pain nearly always has geopolitical consequences. Indeed, we can already see the first symptoms of the coming upheaval. In the essays that follow, Jeffrey Gettleman describes Somalia’s endless anarchy, Arkady Ostrovsky analyzes Russia’s new brand of aggression, and Sam Quinones explores Mexico’s drug-war-fueled misery. These, however, are just three case studies out of a possible nine or more. In Gaza, Israel has engaged in a bloody effort to weaken Hamas. But whatever was achieved militarily must be set against the damage Israel did to its international image by killing innocent civilians that Hamas fighters use as human shields. Perhaps more importantly, social and economic conditions in Gaza, which were already bad enough, are now abysmal. This situation is hardly likely to strengthen the forces of moderation among Palestinians. Worst of all, events in Gaza have fanned the flames of Islamist radicalism throughout the region—not least in Egypt. From Cairo to Riyadh, governments will now think twice before committing themselves to any new Middle East peace initiative. Iran, meanwhile, continues to support both Hamas and its Shiite counterpart in Lebanon, Hezbollah, and to pursue an alleged nuclear weapons program that Israelis legitimately see as a threat to their very existence. No one can say for sure what will happen next within Tehran’s complex political system, but it is likely that the radical faction around President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be strengthened by the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Economically, however, Iran is in a hole that will only deepen as oil prices fall further. Strategically, the country risks disaster by proceeding with its nuclear program, because even a purely Israeli air offensive would be hugely disruptive. All this risk ought to point in the direction of conciliation, even accommodation, with the United States. But with presidential elections in June, Ahmadinejad has little incentive to be moderate. On Iran’s eastern border, in Afghanistan, upheaval remains the disorder of the day. Fresh from the success of the “surge” in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, the new head of U.S. Central Command, is now grappling with the much more difficult problem of pacifying Afghanistan. The task is made especially difficult by the anarchy that prevails in neighboring Pakistan. India, meanwhile, accuses some in Pakistan of having had a hand in the Mumbai terrorist attacks of last November, spurring yet another South Asian war scare. Remember: The sabers they are rattling have nuclear tips. The democratic governments in Kabul and Islamabad are two of the weakest anywhere. Among the biggest risks the world faces this year is that one or both will break down amid escalating violence. Once again, the economic crisis is playing a crucial role. Pakistan’s small but politically powerful middle class has been slammed by the collapse of the country’s stock market. Meanwhile, a rising proportion of the country’s huge population of young men are staring unemployment in the face. It is not a recipe for political stability. This club is anything but exclusive. Candidate members include Indonesia, Thailand, and Turkey, where there are already signs that the economic crisis is exacerbating domestic political conflicts. And let us not forget the plague of piracy in Somalia, the renewed civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the continuing violence in Sudan’s Darfur region, and the heart of darkness that is Zimbabwe under President Robert Mugabe. The axis of upheaval has many members. And it’s a fairly safe bet that the roster will grow even longer this year. The problem is that, as in the 1930s, most countries are looking inward, grappling with the domestic consequences of the economic crisis and paying little attention to the wider world crisis. This is true even of the United States, which is now so preoccupied with its own economic problems that counteringglobal upheaval looks like an expensive luxury. With the U.S . rate of GDP growth set to contract between 2 and 3 percentage points this year, and with the official unemployment rate likely to approach 10 percent, all attention in Washington will remain focused on a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package. Caution has been thrown to the wind by both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. The projected deficit for 2009 is already soaring above the trillion-dollar mark, more than 8 percent of GDP. Few commentators are asking what all this means for U.S. foreign policy. The answer is obvious: The resources available for policing the world are certain to be reduced for the foreseeable future. That will be especially true if foreign investors start demanding higher yields on the bonds they buy from the United States or simply begin dumping dollars in exchange for other currencies. Economic volatility, plus ethnic disintegration, plus an empire in decline: That combination is about the most lethal in geopolitics. We now have all three. The age of upheaval starts now.<br />

Economic collapse causes war with Russia<br />

Russia, whose economy, stock markets and financial system have literally imploded over the past few months, could become increasingly problematic if faced with a protracted economic downturn. The increasingly authoritarian and aggressive Russian regime is already showing signs of anger projection. Its invasion of Georgia this summer and increasing willingness to confront the West reflect a desire to stoke the pride and anger of its people against foreign powers—particularly the United States. It is no accident that the Russians announced a willingness to deploy tactical missile systems to Kaliningrad the day after Barack Obama’s election in the U.S. This was a clear “shot across the bow” of the new administration and demonstrates Russian willingness to pursue a much more confrontational foreign policy going forward. Furthermore, the collapse in the price of oil augers poorly for Russia’s economy. The Russian budget reputedly needs oil at $70 per barrel or higher in order to be in balance. Russian foreign currency reserves, once huge, have been depleted massively over the past few months by ham-fisted attempts to arrest the slide in both markets and the financial system. Bristling with nuclear weapons and nursing an ego still badly bruised by the collapse of the Soviet Union and loss of superpower status, an impoverished and unstable Russia would be a dangerous thing to behold.<br />

Since the end of the Cold War, many have acted as though the danger of nuclear war has ended. It has not. There remain in the world more than 20,000 nuclear weapons. Alarmingly, more than 2,000 of these weapons in the U.S. and Russian arsenals remain on ready-alert status, commonly known as hair-trigger alert. They can be fired within five minutes and reach targets in the other country 30 minutes later. Just one of these weapons can destroy a city. A war involving a substantial number would cause devastation on a scale unprecedented in human history. A study conducted by Physicians for Social Responsibility in 2002 showed that if only 500 of the Russian weapons on high alert exploded over our cities, 100 million Americans would die in the first 30 minutes. An attack of this magnitude also would destroy the entire economic, communications and transportation infrastructure on which we all depend. Those who survived the initial attack would inhabit a nightmare landscape with huge swaths of the country blanketed with radioactive fallout and epidemic diseases rampant. They would have no food, no fuel, no electricity, no medicine, and certainly no organized health care. In the following months it is likely the vast majority of the U.S. population would die. Recent studies by the eminent climatologists Toon and Robock have shown that such a war would have a huge and immediate impact on climate world wide. If all of the warheads in the U.S. and Russian strategic arsenals were drawn into the conflict, the firestorms they caused would loft 180 million tons of soot and debris into the upper atmosphere — blotting out the sun. Temperatures across the globe would fall an average of 18 degrees Fahrenheit to levels not seen on earth since the depth of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago. Agriculture would stop, eco-systems would collapse, and many species, including perhaps our own, would become extinct. It is common to discuss nuclear war as a low-probabillity event. But is this true? We know of five occcasions during the last 30 years when either the U.S. or Russia believed it was under attack and prepared a counter-attack. The most recent of these near misses occurred after the end of the Cold War on Jan. 25, 1995, when the Russians mistook a U.S. weather rocket launched from Norway for a possible attack.<br />

To maintain American leadership in the global economy, Congress should raise or abolish the cap on H1-B visas. Congress should also expand the annual quota of employment-based green cards so the most valuable workers can remain in the United States. Immigrants have played a vital role in the success of America’s free- market economy. Some of America’s most successful high-tech companies—Google, eBay, Yahoo!, Sun Microsystems, and Intel—were cofounded by immigrants. A 2007 study by the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University found that one-quarter of all engineering and technology companies launched between 1995 and 2005 had at least one key founder who was foreign-born. Those companies produced $52 billion in sales and employed 450,000 workers in 2005. Most of the immigrant-founded companies were in the software and the innovation and/or manufacturing services sectors. The study also found that foreign nationals living in the United States were listed as inventors or coinventors on almost a quarter of the international patents filed from the United States in 2005. American companies need to be able to compete for top talent in the world. Our producers must be able to hire the right workers with the right skills to compete in the global marketplace. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the U.S. economy will add a net 1 million new jobs in computers, math, and engineering in the next decade. This expansion of demand occurs during a time when the number of native-born Americans earning degrees in those fields is woefully inadequate. Meanwhile, Canada, Britain, Australia, and Singapore are competing for the same talent, while China and India become more attractive for returning expatriates. The main channel for American companies to hire highly skilled foreign- born workers is the H1-B visa program. An H1-B visa allows a worker to enter the United States temporarily for a renewable period of three years. Current law maintains a cap of 65,000 such visas each year, plus another 20,000 for graduates of U.S. universities who have earned at least a master’s degree. The 65,000 cap remains at the same level as when it was first imposed in 1990 despite the dramatic growth of America’s high- tech sector. In recent years, requests for the visas have exceeded supply months before each fiscal year has begun. The Economist magazine was right to call our current H1-B cap ‘‘a policy of self-sabotage.’’ Restricting H1-B visas limits the ability of U.S. companies to expand their activities in the United States. If U.S. companies cannot find the skilled workers they need here at home, they will understandably look abroad to find their workforce through foreign outsourcing and offshoring. It is absurd to scold U.S. companies for hiring skilled workers abroad while denying them the ability to expand their skilled workforce at home. Highly skilled workers generally complement rather than compete against American-born workers. H1-B workers create employment opportunities for native-born Americans by increasing research and development, production, and exports. Studies have shown that for every H1-B visa requested by an S&amp;P 500 or technology company, the company typically adds five additional workers.<br />

Now, what has changed is the composition of power in international affairs. For almost all of history, international power was achieved in the form of military power and military force. Now, particularly in the last fifty years or so, it has become more and more economic. So power consists of economic power, military power, and diplomatic power, but the emphasis has shifted from military power (for almost all of history) to now, more economic power. And, as President Obama said in his West Point speech several months ago, our economy is the basis of our international power in general and our military power in particular. That is where it all comes from. Whether other states listen to us and act on what we say depends a good deal on their perception of the strength of the American economy. A big problem for us in the last few years has been the perception that our economy is in decline.<br />

Specifically, the U.S. must be the global leader in science and tech to maintain hard power<br />
<br />
Paarlberg 4 (Robert, Professor of Political Science at Wellesley College, “Knowledge as Power: Science, Military Dominance, and U.S. Security,” International Security - Volume 29, Number 1, Summer 2004, pp. 122-151)<br />
Can the United States maintain its global lead in science, the new key to its recently unparalleled military dominance? U.S. scientific prowess has become the deep foundation of U.S. military hegemony. U.S. weapons systems currently dominate the conventional battlefield because they incorporate powerful technologies available only from scientifically dominant U.S. weapons laboratories. Yet under conditions of globalization, scientific and technical (S&amp;T) knowledge is now spreading more quickly and more widely, suggesting that hegemony in this area might be difficult for any one country to maintain. Is the scientific hegemony that lies beneath U.S. weapons dominance strong and durable, or only weak and temporary? Military primacy today comes from weapons quality, not quantity. Each U.S. military service has dominating weapons not found in the arsenals of other states. The U.S. Air Force will soon have five different kinds of stealth aircraft in its arsenal, while no other state has even one. U.S. airborne targeting capabilities, built around global positioning system (GPS) satellites, joint surveillance and target radars, and unmanned aerial vehicles are dominating and unique.1 On land, the U.S. Army has 9,000 M1 Abrams tanks, each with a fire-control system so accurate it can find and destroy a distant enemy tank usually with a single shot. At sea, the U.S. Navy now deploys Seawolf nuclear submarines, the fastest, quietest, and most heavily armed undersea vessels ever built, plus nine supercarrier battle groups, each carrying scores of aircraft capable of delivering repeated precision strikes hundreds of miles inland. No other navy has even one supercarrier group.2 [End Page 122] Such weapons are costly to build, and the large relative size of the U.S. economy (22percent of world gross domestic product [GDP]) plus the even larger U.S. share of global military spending (43 percent of the world total in 2002, at market exchange rates) have been key to the development and deployment of these forces. Yet economic dominance and spending dominance would not suffice without knowledge dominance. It is a strong and rapidly growing S&amp;T capacity that has allowed the United States to move far ahead of would-be competitors by deploying new weapons systems with unmatched science- intensive capabilities. It was in the middle of the twentieth century that the global arms race more fundamentally became a science race. Prior to World War II, military research and development (R&amp;D) spending absorbed on average less than 1 percent of total major power military expenditures. By the 1980s, the R&amp;D share of major power military spending had increased to 11-13 percent.3 It was precisely during this period, as science became a more important part of military might, that the United States emerged as the clear global leader in science. During World War II, the military might of the United States had come more from its industrial capacity (America could build more) than from its scientific capacity (Europe, especially Germany and the United Kingdom, could still invent more). As that war came to an end, however, a fortuitous migration of European scientists to the United States plus wartime research investments such as the Manhattan Project gave the United States the scientific as well as the industrial lead.<br />

Perception of the cap drives away foreign students – They don’t think they’ll get jobs when they graduate<br />

<br />
Proponents of raising the cap argue that preventing foreign students who attend U.S. universities from accepting positions in the United States &quot;will be detrimental to our economic success because the United States will [*474] lose valuable intellectual capital.&quot; n176 Some allege that U.S. visa policies, specifically Congress's refusal to raise the H-1B cap, &quot;are primarily to blame for the decline in international student enrollment in U.S. academic institutions.&quot; n177<br />

U.S. science and tech leadership and specifically foreign students are key to soft power and effective diplomacy<br />

Chairman Baird, Ranking Member Ehlers, and distinguished members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity to discuss science diplomacy at the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. is recognized globally for its leadership in science and technology. Our scientific strength is both a tool of “soft power” – part of our strategic diplomatic arsenal – and a basis for creating partnerships with countries as they move beyond basic economic and social development. Science diplomacy is a central element of the Secretary’s transformational diplomacy initiative, because science and technology are essential to achieving stability and strengthening failed and fragile states. S&amp;T advances have immediate and enormous influence on national and global economies, and thus on the international relations between societies. Nation states, nongovernmental organizations, and multinational corporations are largely shaped by their expertise in and access to intellectual and physical capital in science, technology, and engineering. Even as S&amp;T advances of our modern era provide opportunities for economic prosperity, some also challenge the relative position of countries in the world order, and influence our social institutions and principles. America must remain at the forefront of this new world by maintaining its technological edge, and leading the way internationally through science diplomacy and engagement. The Public Diplomacy Role of Science Science by its nature facilitates diplomacy because it strengthens political relationships, embodies powerful ideals, and creates opportunities for all. The global scientific community embraces principles Americans cherish: transparency, meritocracy, accountability, the objective evaluation of evidence, and broad and frequently democratic participation. Science is inherently democratic, respecting evidence and truth above all. Science is also a common global language, able to bridge deep political and religious divides. Scientists share a common language. Scientific interactions serve to keep open lines of communication and cultural understanding. As scientists everywhere have a common evidentiary external reference system, members of ideologically divergent societies can use the common language of science to cooperatively address both domestic and the increasingly trans- national and global problems confronting humanity in the 21st century. There is a growing recognition that science and technology will increasingly drive the successful economies of the 21st century. Science and technology provide an immeasurable benefit to the U.S. by bringing scientists and students here, especially from developing countries, where they see democracy in action, make friends in the international scientific community, become familiar with American technology, and contribute to the U.S. and global economy. For example, in 2005, over 50% of physical science and engineering graduate students and postdoctoral researchers trained in the U.S. have been foreign nationals. Moreover, many foreign-born scientists who were educated and have worked in the U.S. eventually progress in their careers to hold influential positions in ministries and institutions both in this country and in their home countries. They also contribute to U.S. scientific and technologic development: According to the National Science Board’s 2008 Science and Engineering Indicators, 47% of full-time doctoral science and engineering faculty in U.S. research institutions were foreign-born.<br />

Soft power is key to heg<br />
<br />
Stanley 7 (Elizabeth, Assistant Professor at Georgetown, “International Perceptions of US Nuclear Policy” Sandia Report, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2007/070903.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2007/070903.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
How important is soft power, anyway? Given its vast conventional military power, does the United States even need soft power? Some analysts argue that US military predominance is both possible and desirable over the long term, and thus soft power is not important. But a growing consensus disagrees. These analysts argue that soft power is critical for four reasons. First, soft power is invaluable for keeping potential adversaries from gaining international support, for “winning the peace” in Afghanistan and Iraq, and for convincing moderates to refrain from supporting extremist terrorist groups. Second, soft power helps influence neutral and developing states to support US global leadership. Third, soft power is also important for convincing allies and partners to share the international security burden.14 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, given the increasing interdependence and globalization of the world system, soft power is critical for addressing most security threats the United States faces today. Most global security threats are impossible to be countered by a single state alone. Terrorism, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation, failed and failing states, conflicts over access to resources, are not confined to any one state. In addition, disease, demographic shifts, environmental degradation and global warming will have negative security implications as well.15 All of these potential threats share four traits: (1) they are best addressed proactively, rather than after they develop into full-blown crises; (2) they require multi-lateral approaches, often under the umbrella of an international institution; (3) they are not candidates for a quick fix, but rather require multi-year, or multi-decade solutions; and, (4) they are “wicked” problems. Given these four traits, soft power is critical for helping to secure the international, multi-lateral cooperation that will be necessary to address such threats effectively.<br />

Heg is key to global stability and prevents great power wars<br />
<br />

<br />
Throughout history, peace and stability have been great benefits of an era where there was a dominant power--Rome, Britain or the United States today. Scholars and statesmen have long recognized the irenic effect of power on the anarchic world of international politics. Everything we think of when we consider the current international order--free trade, a robust monetary regime, increasing respect for human rights, growing democratization--is directly linked to U.S. power. Retrenchment proponents seem to think that the current system can be maintained without the current amount of U.S. power behind it. In that they are dead wrong and need to be reminded of one of history's most significant lessons: Appalling things happen when international orders collapse. The Dark Ages followed Rome's collapse. Hitler succeeded the order established at Versailles. Without U.S. power, the liberal order created by the United States will end just as assuredly. As country and western great Ral Donner sang: &quot;You don't know what you've got (until you lose it).&quot; Consequently, it is important to note what those good things are. In addition to ensuring the security of the United States and its allies, American primacy within the international system causes many positive outcomes for Washington and the world. The first has been a more peaceful world. During the Cold War, U.S. leadership reduced friction among many states that were historical antagonists, most notably France and West Germany. Today, American primacy helps keep a number of complicated relationships aligned--between Greece and Turkey, Israel and Egypt, South Korea and Japan, India and Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. This is not to say it fulfills Woodrow Wilson's vision of ending all war. Wars still occur where Washington's interests are not seriously threatened, such as in Darfur, but a Pax Americana does reduce war's likelihood, particularly war's worst form: great power wars. Second, American power gives the United States the ability to spread democracy and other elements of its ideology of liberalism: Doing so is a source of much good for the countries concerned as well as the United States because, as John Owen noted on these pages in the Spring 2006 issue, liberal democracies are more likely to align with the United States and be sympathetic to the American worldview.( n3) So, spreading democracy helps maintain U.S. primacy. In addition, once states are governed democratically, the likelihood of any type of conflict is significantly reduced. This is not because democracies do not have clashing interests. Indeed they do. Rather, it is because they are more open, more transparent and more likely to want to resolve things amicably in concurrence with U.S. leadership. And so, in general, democratic states are good for their citizens as well as for advancing the interests of the United States<br />

This escalates to global nuclear war<br />

Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because a world in which the United States exercises leadership would have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems, such as nuclear proliferation, threats of regional hegemony by renegade states, and low-level conflicts. Finally, U.S. leadership would help preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling the United States and the world to avoid another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />
<br />
Heg is sustainable – No challengers<br />
<br />
News Week 8/12 (“We’re No. 11! America may be declining, but don’t despair.”, 8/12/10, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/12/how-to-understand-american-decline.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsweek.com/2010/08/12/how-to-understand-american-decline.html</a>)<br />
<br />
So, yes, America has clearly suffered some decline, relative to other nations, and a loss of prestige. But even battered and beaten down, American power is more resilient than the naysayers give it credit for. And so is the international system that depends on American power as its central stabilizer. What the declinists tend to miss is the fact that there really are no rivals to the United States. Sure, Germany is an export powerhouse; but will it be a global power ever again? Even the Germans don’t want that—they have no military to speak of, and no one wants them to build one. Russia? Riiiight, if you think KGB-run companies and the organized murder of dissidents amount to a good model for governance. Japan? It’s long since resigned itself to becoming the Switzerland of Asia, wealthy and comfortable but resolutely neutral about just about everything (except maybe whaling). The European Union, meanwhile, has all it can do to keep its ever-fractious self together, given the market stresses on its troubled currency. And what about China, everybody’s favorite choice for future rival? One recent book, The Beijing Consensus: How China’s Authoritarian Model Will Dominate the 21st Century, argues that Beijing is supplying the successor to the “Washington Consensus”—the post–Cold War formula for open markets that came to grief in the financial crisis. But the China model of autocratic capitalism, successful as it has been at home, is hardly something most others want to emulate, and it may well be close to peaking. “China is obviously more dynamic and is going to rival the United States in various ways, but it’s not really picking up allies, and it’s generating insecurity in Asia that’s going to bring the U.S. even further into the region,” says Prince-ton scholar John Ikenberry, author of the forthcoming Liberal Leviathan: The Origins, Crisis, and Transformation of the American System. Ikenberry has an unusual metric for global influence: he counts how many allies a country gains over the decades. Starting in 1946, he says, the United States added allies—nations with which it has some kind of security relationship—every five years or so and now has a total of 62, including many from the former Soviet bloc. (Washington also has a strategic partnership with India, another world power.) During that same period, Ikenberry says, China never managed more than two allies altogether (though it has a lot of “fellow travelers,” nations that have fallen under the sway of Chinese investment capital). “For China to really be a global peer competitor,” says Ikenberry, “you have to think there are going to be states that will peel off [from the U.S.] and start to build a security relationship with China.”<br />

Decline causes multiple nuclear wars and re-intervention that triggers their turns<br />

<br />
Withdrawal from foreign commitments might seem to be a means of evading hostility toward the United States, but the consequences would almost certainly be harmful both to regional stability and to U.S. national interests. Although Europe would almost certainly not see the return to competitive balancing among regional powers (i.e., competition and even military rivalry between France and Germany) of the kind that some realist scholars of international relations have predicted,&quot; elsewhere the dangers could increase. In Asia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would have strong motivation to acquire nuclear weapons – which they have the technological capacity to do quite quickly. Instability and regional competition could also escalate, not only between India and Pakistan, but also in Southeast Asia involving Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and possibly the Philippines. Risks in the Middle East would be likely to increase, with regional competition among the major countries of the Gulf region (Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq) as well as Egypt, Syria, and Israel. Major regional wars, eventually involving the use of weapons of mass destruction plus human suffering on a vast scale, floods of refugees, economic disruption, and risks to oil supplies are all readily conceivable. Based on past experience, the United States would almost certainly be drawn back into these areas, whether to defend friendly states, to cope with a humanitarian catastrophe, or to prevent a hostile power from dominating an entire region. Steven Peter Rosen has thus fit-tingly observed, &quot;If the logic of American empire is unappealing, it is not at all clear that the alternatives are that much more attractive.&quot;2z Similarly, Niall Ferguson has added that those who dislike American predominance ought to bear in mind that the alternative may not be a world of competing great powers, but one with no hegemon at all. Ferguson's warning may be hyperbolic, but it hints at the perils that the absence of a dominant power, &quot;apolarity,&quot; could bring &quot;an anarchic new Dark Age of waning empires and religious fanaticism; of endemic plunder and pillage in the world's forgotten regions; of economic stagnation and civilization's retreat into a few fortified enclaves.&quot;2<br />

Finally, the alternative to heg is apolarity – The resulting power vacuum causes regional conflicts that destroy multilateralism<br />

The fourth critical fact to consider is that the security provided by the power of the United States creates stability in international politics. That is vitally important for the world, but easily forgotten. Harvard professor Joseph Nye often compares the security provided by the United States to oxygen. If it were taken away, a person would think of nothing else. If the security and sta- bility provided by the United States were taken away, most countries would be much worse off, and arms races, vicious security competition, and wars would result. It would be a world without NATO or other key U.S. alliances. We can imagine easily conflict between traditional rivals like Greece and Turkey, Syria and Israel, India and Pakistan, Taiwan and China, Russia and Georgia, Hungary and Romania, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and an intense arms race between China and Japan. In that world, the breakup of Yugoslavia would have been a far bloodier affair that might have escalated to become another European war. In contrast to what might occur absent U.S. power, we see that the post-Cold War world dominated by the United States is an era of peace and stability.<br />

Congress has sought to circumvent the quotas and respond to industry demands—especially in high technology—with guest worker visas like the H1-B, a source of some controversy. The H-1B is a temporary visa for a professional offered a job by a U.S. company that agrees to pay the prevailing market wage. Only 65,000 regular H-1B visas are available each year, a quota set in the early 1990s and temporarily increased to 195,000 from 2001 to 2003. Many employers say the cap is set too low to meet their needs, especially as they seek to staff engineering and software positions. Some lawmakers would like to help them with a higher quota. These skilled immigrants often come to America as students, then go to work in growing industries. A 2008 study by the National Foundation for American Policy found that for each worker hired on an H-1B visa, at least five new jobs were created. But many labor groups argue that the cap is already set too high. Only a bachelor’s degree is required to qualify for this visa, and critics charge the H-1B visas crowd skilled Americans out of the workplace, suppress wages, and make it easier for employers to outsource jobs to low-cost countries like India. Even immigrant advocates criticize the H-1B as a second-class visa that produces an anxious life. Tied to their employers, the guest workers cannot switch jobs unless their new employer is willing to sponsor their visa, and their spouses are not allowed to work. The three-year visa can be renewed once. But after six years, the visa holder must go home unless he or she is able to get a green-card sponsor. The national-origin quotas, coupled with a limit of 90,000 immigrant visas reserved for highly skilled professionals or investors, helps to explain why so many talented immigrants—many of them H-1B visa holders—wait in vain for permission to live and work in America. Many are now leaving the U.S., or simply not coming to study or work on an H1B. After revealing the high-skill visa backlog in 2007, Vivek Wadhwa and his researchers at Duke University began to examine the impact. With the support of the Kauffman Foundation, they surveyed about 1,200 Chinese and Indian professionals who had studied or worked in America and returned home. The returnees were an impressive bunch, overwhelmingly young, smart, and ambitious, as described in the March 2009 report, “America’s Loss is the World’s Gain.” Nearly 90 percent held master’s or doctorate degrees. Many said they expected to start their own companies. Homesickness was common among the immigrants who went back, and many expressed frustration with the U.S. immigration system. But even more said the home country suddenly offered good jobs and bright career prospects. That is the new reality that demands a response, Wadhwa argues. Foreign-born mathematicians, engineers, and chemists can now find world-class companies in Bangalore, Beijing, Tel Aviv, Seoul, and Singapore. With high-tech opportunities blossoming elsewhere, and anti-immigrant attitudes hardening in America, Wadhwa said his adopted homeland faces a crisis. “The United States is no longer the only place where talented people can put their skills to work,” he writes. “It can no longer expect them to endure the indignities and inefficiencies of an indifferent immigration system, and it must now actively compete to attract these people with good jobs, security and other amenities.” The competition is heating up. In an earlier study, Wadhwa pointed out that most high-skilled immigrants obtained their primary education before coming to America, meaning that the United States inherited the benefits of schooling that was paid for elsewhere. Some countries are looking to recoup that investment and attract their diasporas back home. Alberta, Canada, sensing an opportunity to snatch talent from America, is sending recruiting teams to U.S. cities to lure disgruntled foreign professional workers on temporary H-1B visas. The province is offering expedited permanent-residency cards and quicker pathways to entrepreneurship. Many researchers believe these immigrant-attraction strategies will show results. “The reality of the global economy is that employers and their capital will follow the talent—wherever that talent is permitted to work and flourish,” Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, wrote in 2007. “While members of Congress often talk about ‘protecting’ American jobs, those who persist in pursuing restriction on hiring skilled foreign nationals unfortunately are inhibiting creation and innovation in the United States.” In 2007, Microsoft opened up a research and development facility in Vancouver, Canada, just over the border from its Seattle headquarters. Microsoft defended its decision by citing U.S. immigration restrictions on high-skilled talent. Perhaps no country understands better the role of foreign talent in creating jobs for its people than Singapore. In July 2008, Singapore’s Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, declared that Singapore must be open to foreign talent to achieve a “critical mass” for innovation and entrepreneurship. Even with the global recession in full swing, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng announced that restricting the entry of high-skill immigrants would be “short sighted” and “could ultimately lead to more job losses for Singaporeans.” America loses more than innovation if newly minted graduates go elsewhere; it loses tax dollars. A 2009 report by the respected Technology Policy Institute found that immigration restrictions cost billions in lost opportunity, taxes, and wages. The institute concluded that legislation considered by Congress to loosen green-card and H-1B visa restrictions could reduce the federal deficit on the order of $100 billion across 10 years. In short, fantastic opportunities are being lost as high-skill immigrants are steered elsewhere. We need to polish our welcome. For starters, Wadhwa argues, the United States could reduce the huge backlog of visa requests simply by making more visas available to skilled immigrants and by accelerating the processing times. His is one voice in a growing chorus that hopes to wrest the spotlight from illegal immigration and illuminate the larger wave, its potential, and the consequences of inaction. But the academic studies, while critically important, do not seem to cut through the noise and connect with the American people. The American people are not demanding high-skill immigration reform. They don’t see it as a job-creation opportunity. The word “immigrant” almost automatically summons an angry response that immigrants “take jobs.” Something else is needed. Time for a New Narrative Stories connect us to each other. Drawing from the same well of human aspiration, triumph and failure, our personal stories create an emotional bond that transforms strangers into familiar faces. As America once again struggles with the question of whether and how to welcome the immigrant stranger, the telling of new immigrant stories is needed to help heal the chasm between “us” and “them,” and between our personal immigrant past and our nation’s immigrant present and future. During this Great Recession, with unemployment near 10%, the immigration narrative also needs to offer hope for Americans—hope that tomorrow will be better. Hope today comes in the form of good old American jobs. We have been told that maybe 4 million blue and white-collar jobs may be created by advances in alternative energy technology, and that wind, solar, thermal, and other sources of energy will move us closer to energy independence, greater national security and a healthier planet. But so far, we haven’t been that interested in asking the question, “who will create and commercialize this new green technology? Much like the role that immigrants played, in partnership with American-born colleagues, in the information technology revolution and the elevation of Silicon Valley to almost mythical status, immigrants are now emerging as key drivers of America’s quest for world-class clean energy technology. A glance at recent research on the contributions of immigrants supports the expectation that immigrants are helping to lead the green economy and other emerging industries: 􀂾 Immigrants are nearly twice as likely as native-born Americans to start a business. 􀂾 Immigrants are filing patents at twice the rate of the American-born. 􀂾 Immigrants founded more than half of the high-tech companies in Silicon Valley. 􀂾 Immigrants are much more likely to earn an advanced degree than the native-born. But cold, hard data on this phenomenon is not enough to nudge American back to its embrace of immigrants. Personal stories of overcoming hardship, loss, and eventually achieving success—this will resonate and help re-capture the imagination of Americans. In the book, Immigrant, Inc. — Why Immigrant Entrepreneurs Are Driving the New Economy (and how they will save the American worker) (John Wiley, 2009), we explore some of these stories of immigrant entrepreneurs who have invented or helped commercialize groundbreaking green technology. This is an exciting story of immigrants leading America into a new world—creating, not taking, jobs. This is the story of America.<br />

Increased H1Bs will go to green jobs<br />

Hundreds of Thousands of Americans owe their jobs and fantastic salaries to this immigrant innovation, not to mention the millions in related industries that have been spawned as a result. Today because of the abuses of a small minority of companies, mainly due to the lack of oversight by media and politicians eager to receive large donations and investments from these same said companies, all H1B hiring is seeming like a dirty business. Companies like Microsoft, a top 10 company of H1B hires, who via their founder Bill Gates have been strong advocates of the program have been forced to defend past hiring practices as well as almost for Public Relations alone tone down their rhetoric as far as hiring of foreigners on H1B visas are concerned. One can only speculate internally what this is having on their hiring policies for the near future. The answer as to who is going to get H1Bs in 2009 for FY2010 beginning on October 1 is; 1.

High-skilled immigrants key to global collaboration on alternative energy<br />

It should come as no surprise that immigrants will help drive the green revolution. America’s young scientists and engineers, especially the ones drawn to emerging industries like alternative energy, tend to speak with an accent. The 2000 Census found that immigrants, while accounting for 12 percent of the population, made up nearly half of the all scientists and engineers with doctorate degrees. Their importance will only grow. Nearly 70 percent of the men and women who entered the fields of science and engineering from 1995 to 2006 were immigrants. Yet, the connection between immigration and the development and commercialization of alternative energy technology is rarely discussed. Policymakers envision millions of new jobs as the nation pursues renewable energy sources, like wind and solar power, and builds a smart grid to tap it. But Dan Arvizu, the leading expert on solar power and the director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy in Golden, Colorado, warns that much of the clean-technology talent lies overseas, in nations that began pursuing alternative energy sources decades ago. Expanding our own clean-tech industry will require working closely with foreign nations and foreign-born scientists, he said. Immigration restrictions are making collaboration difficult. His lab’s efforts to work with a Chinese energy lab, for example, were stalled due to U.S. immigration barriers. “We can’t get researchers over here,” Arvizu, the son of a once-undocumented immigrant from Mexico, said in an interview in March 2009, his voice tinged with dismay. “It makes no sense to me. We need a much more enlightened approach.” Dr. Zhao Gang, the Vice Director of the Renewable Energy and New Energy International Cooperation Planning Office of the Ministry of Science and Technology in China, says that America needs that enlightenment fast. “The Chinese government continues to impress upon the Obama administration that immigration restrictions are creating major impediments to U.S.-China collaboration on clean energy development,” he said during a recent speech in Cleveland. So what’s the problem? Some of it can be attributed to national security restrictions that impede international collaboration on clean energy. But Arvizu places greater weight on immigration barriers, suggesting that national secrecy is less important in the fast-paced world of green-tech development. “We are innovating so fast here, what we do today is often outdated tomorrow. Finding solutions to alternative energy is a complex, global problem that requires global teamwork,” he said. We need an immigration system that prioritizes the attraction and retention of scarce, high-end talent needed to invent and commercialize alternative energy technology and other emerging technologies. One idea we floated by Arvizu was a new immigrant “Energy Scientist Visa,” providing fast-track green cards for Ph.D.s with the most promising energy research, as reviewed by a panel of top U.S. scientists. Arvizu enthusiastically responded, “Wow, that’s a brilliant idea.” As the recent submission of the Startup Visa Act bill suggests, there’s really no shortage of good ideas of leveraging immigration to jumpstart the economy. The challenge is getting the American people to understand that high-skill immigration creates jobs, that the current system is broken, and that action is required now.<br />

Flanked by forced-out former green jobs czar Van Jones, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said Monday that creating new jobs in green industries presents the &quot;greatest market opportunity of our generation.&quot; Comparing the call to create &quot;green jobs&quot; to former President John F. Kennedy's call for landing a man on the Moon, Gillibrand said at a forum that the nation needs to act in order to inspire the next generation of scientists. &quot;Green jobs&quot; are those in industries that promote environmental protection and energy independence, like energy efficiency, renewable energy and smart energy. With millions of Americans unemployed and global warming threatening the globe, the burgeoning field of green technology could be the nation's next great job creation vehicle. It's the &quot;moral, political and economic challenge of our time,&quot; said Jones, former special adviser for Green Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Jones said that creating new jobs in green industries would combat both global warming and the recession. Jones was <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/06/glenn-beck-gets-first-sca_n_278281.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/06/glenn-beck-gets-first-sca_n_278281.html</a> forced out of the White House in September after conservatives, led by Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck, launched an attack on his background in radical activism. While the U.S. dithers, other countries are aggressively moving ahead. Gillibrand noted that China invested $440 billion last year in green technology such as solar panels. Gillibrand said that she'd like to see the nation be &quot;energy independent in a decade,&quot; adding that it's a &quot;call to action I'd like to see this President give us.&quot; Jones said that government policy needs to favor problem solvers like green entrepreneurs rather than problem makers like the oil and coal industries. But Gillibrand pointed out that the Senate is not full of progressives clamoring for change. Moderation is needed, she said. The big ideas like the ones that powered the Obama campaign are &quot;not a reality&quot; from a legislative or political perspective, Gillibrand said. Obama himself is &quot;already pushing towards moderation,&quot; she noted in a reference to the president's embrace of nuclear technology, traditionally a Republican cause. &quot;There was a sweeping election in 2008, but there wasn't a sweeping movement in 2008,&quot; said Erica Payne, founder of the Agenda Project, the progressive advocacy organization that hosted Monday's forum. A movement needs a combination of ideas, messages and leaders, Payne said. All three are needed in large supply, she added. To get the country to fully embrace the green technology movement, Obama needs to give a &quot;shoot-for-the-moon speech,&quot; Gillibrand said. &quot;And he has to do it now.&quot;<br />

Warming causes extinction of all life on earth.<br />
<br />
Girling, Richard. &quot;What will climate change do to our planet?&quot; Times Online. 3/11/2007. permalink: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1480669.ece" rel="nofollow">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article1480669.ece</a><br />
<br />
Although warming on this scale lies within the IPCC's officially endorsed range of 21st-century possibilities, climate models have little to say about what Lynas, echoing Dante, describes as &quot;the Sixth Circle of Hell&quot;. To see the most recent climatic lookalike, we have to turn the geological clock back between 144m and 65m years, to the Cretaceous, which ended with the extinction of the dinosaurs. There was an even closer fit at the end of the Permian, 251m years ago, when global temperatures rose by - yes - six degrees, and 95% of species were wiped out. &quot;That episode,&quot; says Lynas, &quot;was the worst ever endured by life on Earth, the closest the planet has come to ending up a dead and desolate rock in space.&quot; On land, the only winners were fungi that flourished on dying trees and shrubs. At sea there were only losers. &quot;Warm water is a killer. Less oxygen can dissolve, so conditions become stagnant and anoxic. Oxygen-breathing water-dwellers - all the higher forms of life from plankton to sharks - face suffocation. Warm water also expands, and sea levels rose by 20 metres.&quot; The resulting &quot;super-hurricanes&quot; hitting the coasts would have &quot;triggered flash floods that no living thing could have survived&quot;. There are aspects of the so-called &quot;end-Permian extinction&quot; that are unlikely to recur - most importantly, the vast volcanic eruption in Siberia that spread magma hundreds of metres thick over an area bigger than western Europe and shot billions of tonnes of CO² into the atmosphere. That is small comfort, however, for beneath the oceans, another monster stirred - the same that would bring a devastating end to the Palaeocene nearly 200m years later, and that still lies in wait today. Methane hydrate. Lynas describes what happens when warming water releases pent-up gas from the sea bed. &quot;First, a small disturbance drives a gas-saturated parcel of water upwards. As it rises, bubbles begin to appear, as dissolved gas fizzles out with reducing pressure - just as a bottle of lemonade overflows if the top is taken off too quickly. These bubbles make the parcel of water still more buoyant, accelerating its rise through the water. As it surges upwards, reaching explosive force, it drags surrounding water up with it. At the surface, water is shot hundreds of metres into the air as the released gas blasts into the atmosphere. Shockwaves propagate outwards in all directions, triggering more eruptions nearby.&quot; The eruption is more than just another positive feedback in the quickening process of global warming. Unlike CO², methane is flammable. &quot;Even in air-methane concentrations as low as 5%,&quot; says Lynas, &quot;the mixture could ignite from lightning or some other spark and send fireballs tearing across the sky.&quot; The effect would be much like that of the fuel-air explosives used by the US and Russian armies - so-called &quot;vacuum bombs&quot; that ignite fuel droplets above a target. According to the CIA, &quot;Those near the ignition point are obliterated. Those at the fringes are likely to suffer many internal injuries, including burst eardrums, severe concussion, ruptured lungs and internal organs, and possibly blindness.&quot; Such tactical weapons, however, are squibs when set against methane-air clouds from oceanic eruptions. Scientists calculate that they could &quot;destroy terrestrial life almost entirely&quot; (251m years ago, only one large land animal, the pig-like lystrosaurus, survived). It has been estimated that a large eruption in future could release energy equivalent to 108 megatonnes of TNT - 100,000 times more than the world's entire stockpile of nuclear weapons. Not even Lynas, for all his scientific propriety, can avoid the Hollywood ending. &quot;It is not too difficult to imagine the ultimate nightmare, with oceanic methane eruptions near large population centres wiping out billions of people - perhaps in days. Imagine a 'fuel-air explosive' fireball racing towards a city - London, say, or Tokyo - the blast wave spreading out from the explosive centre with the speed and force of an atomic bomb. Buildings are flattened, people are incinerated where they stand, or left blind and deaf by the force of the explosion. Mix Hiroshima with post-Katrina New Orleans to get some idea of what such a catastrophe might look like: burnt survivors battling over food, wandering far and wide from empty cities.&quot; Then would come hydrogen sulphide from the stagnant oceans. &quot;It would be a silent killer: imagine the scene at Bhopal following the Union Carbide gas release in 1984, replayed first at coastal settlements, then continental interiors across the world. At the same time, as the ozone layer came under assault, we would feel the sun's rays burning into our skin, and the first cell mutations would be triggering outbreaks of cancer among anyone who survived. Dante's hell was a place of judgment, where humanity was for ever punished for its sins. With all the remaining forests burning, and the corpses of people, livestock and wildlife piling up in every continent, the six-degree world would be a harsh penalty indeed for the mundane crime of burning fossil energy.&quot; RED ALERT If global warming continues at the current rate, we could be facing extinction. So what exactly is going to happen as the Earth heats up? Here is a degree-by-degree guide 1c Increase Ice-free sea absorbs ?more heat and accelerates global warming; fresh water lost from a third of the world's surface; low-lying coastlines flooded 2c Increase Europeans dying of heatstroke; forests ravaged by fire; stressed plants beginning to emit carbon rather than absorbing it; a third of all species face extinction 3c Increase Carbon release from vegetation and soils ?speeds global warming; death of the Amazon rainforest; super-hurricanes hit coastal cities; starvation in Africa 4c Increase Runaway thaw of permafrost makes global warming unstoppable; much of Britain made uninhabitable by severe flooding; Mediterranean region abandoned 5c Increase Methane from ocean floor accelerates global warming; ice gone from both poles; humans migrate in search of food and try vainly to live like animals off the land 6c Increase Life on Earth ends with apocalyptic storms, flash floods, hydrogen sulphide gas and methane fireballs racing across the globe with the power of atomic bombs; only fungi survive Chance of avoiding six degrees of global warming: zero if the rise passes five degrees, by which time all feedbacks will be running out of control.<br />

On October 23, 2007, sixteen members of the New Democrat Coalition, led by the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, requested that &quot;the House take action this year to resolve the immediate talent crisis that is facing U.S. employers.&quot; The group is pushing for reform that would increase H1B and employment based permanent residence, or &quot;green card&quot; quotas, before Congress adjourns this year. The New Democrat Coalition is comprised of 59 Democratic members of Congress who are interested in modernizing the Democratic Party and the entire country.

Mr. Bush’s absence may also be a source of regret for Republicans. The instinct of many GOP politicians is to denounce any form of legalization, and in the shrill tones one hears from callers on talk-radio programs. But those shrill tones seem to turn off many voters, not just Hispanics but also suburbanites who favor strict enforcement of immigration laws but shy away from anything that sounds like prejudice against minorities. Republicans would be well advised to avoid such rhetoric. They should take a cue from Sen. Kyl’s work on the 2007 bill, and from the thoughtful 2009 report of a bipartisan panel assembled by the Brookings Institution and Duke University’s Kenan Center. Both urged significant reductions in the number of green cards for legal residents’ relatives beyond the nuclear family and for a sizeable increase in the number issued to high-skill immigrants. This is the approach taken currently by Canada and Australia, with good results. The argument would be that in our current economy we need fewer job seekers and more job creators. These reforms would probably not be welcomed by the Hispanic groups that are pushing the Democrats to take up this legislation. But a package that provided limited legalization, further strengthened enforcement, and made room for more high-skill immigrants might be the only way to obtain bipartisan support—and could minimize the damage that each party faces from this emotion-laden issue.<br />

Bipart’s key to the agenda and builds political capital<br />
<br />
Schroeder 9 (Robert, &quot;A Return to Bipartisanship Would Pay for Obama,&quot; MARKETWATCH, February 19, 2009, npg.)<br />
<br />
President Barack Obama will soon need to get back to promoting bipartisanship if he wants to rebuild the political capital he spent on passing the economic stimulus bill and hasten action on the next big issues on his long-term agenda. At first glance, Obama wouldn't seem to need Republicans to get his agenda through Congress. His poll numbers are sky-high. Democrats control the House and have a slim but significant majority in the Senate. The new president has also weathered flaps over Cabinet and other appointees' problems with taxes. In short, he's off to a great start. &quot;Right now, he doesn't need to reach across the aisle substantively,&quot; says pollster Scott Rasmussen, who adds that the stimulus passed because of Obama's own popularity among voters. But, looking ahead, there's ample reason to believe that Obama will need the Republicans he alienated and the capital he burned in getting his huge package approved.<br />
<br />
Winners win<br />
<br />
Singer 9 (Johnathan, editor and JD Candidate, UC-Berkeley, “by Expending Capital, Obama Grows His Capital,” MY DIRECT DEMOCRACY, 3—3—09, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2009/3/3/191825/0428" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydd.com/story/2009/3/3/191825/0428</a>)<br />
<br />
Peter Hart gets at a key point. Some believe that political capital is finite, that it can be used up. To an extent that's true. But it's important to note, too, that political capital can be regenerated -- and, specifically, that when a President expends a great deal of capital on a measure that was difficult to enact and then succeeds, he can build up more capital. Indeed, that appears to be what is happening with Barack Obama, who went to the mat to pass the stimulus package out of the gate, got it passed despite near-unanimous opposition of the Republicans on Capitol Hill, and is being rewarded by the American public as a result. Take a look at the numbers. President Obama now has a 68 percent favorable rating in the NBC-WSJ poll, his highest ever showing in the survey. Nearly half of those surveyed (47 percent) view him very positively. Obama's Democratic Party earns a respectable 49 percent favorable rating. The Republican Party, however, is in the toilet, with its worst ever showing in the history of the NBC-WSJ poll, 26 percent favorable. On the question of blame for the partisanship in Washington, 56 percent place the onus on the Bush administration and another 41 percent place it on Congressional Republicans. Yet just 24 percent blame Congressional Democrats, and a mere 11 percent blame the Obama administration. So at this point, with President Obama seemingly benefiting from his ambitious actions and the Republicans sinking further and further as a result of their knee-jerked opposition to that agenda, there appears to be no reason not to push forward on anything from universal healthcare to energy reform to ending the war in Iraq.<br />

<br />
In late October 1999, Sen. John McCain (R–Ariz.) became the first member of Congress to propose doing away with the H- 1B cap altogether. The 21st Century Technology Resources and Commercial Leadership Act (S. 1804) would suspend the cap on H-1B nonimmigrants for the next six years, through FY06. It would also require the INS to give priority to processing H-1B petitions on behalf of students graduating from U.S. universities with advanced degrees in technical disciplines. Congress will likely consider some variation of these proposals in 2000.<br />

Their alliance was just one step in the political reinvention of Mr. McCain, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Previously a marginal player better known for heckling the Senate than for influencing it, Mr. McCain returned from the 2000 campaign with a new national reputation and a new political sophistication. Over the next eight years, he mastered the art of political triangulation — variously teaming up with Mr. Lott against the president or the new Republican leaders, with Democrats against Republicans, and with the president against the Democrats — to become perhaps the chamber’s most influential member. “He was looked upon as the magic ingredient in any legislative deal; the addition of John McCain was going to greatly improve its chances of success,” said Ross K. Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist who studies the Senate. Former Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader until 2004, agreed. With the possible exception of the two party leaders, he said, “I can’t think of many senators more influential.”<br />

Voters hate H1Bs – Populism<br />
<br />

<br />
New York Senator Chuck Schumer may have described Indian information technology giant Infosys as a &quot;chop shop&quot;, but what the Bangalore-based company has been chopping is the number of its H1B hires. And given lower demand for that visa, analysts believe that the recent Bill passed by the United States Senate levying a penalty on firms based in America with more than 50 per cent H1 and L1 visa employees, is a populist gimmick in an election year. The mid-term congressional and state elections in the US are just three months away. The numbers present a stark picture of how the H1B isn't as popular as it once was. The cap for the fiscal 2009-2010 was only reached in January this year, while the uptake for the current year has been worse — just 28,500 petitions as against the available quota of 65,000 H1Bs. And Infosys is actually the leading company in sharply reducing its H1B intake. In 2008, it had 4,559 HIB visas approved; that number dropped to just 440 in 2009, a drop of over 90 per cent. Demand has also dropped from Wipro, another company targeted by the Bill's proponents, while US majors such as Microsoft and Intel have increased the number of H1B hires, according to data available. The bill sponsored by Senator Schumer and Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri primarily seeks to tighten security along the US-Mexico border, and proposes to raise funding for its objectives, including unmanned drones, through penalties on mainly Indian companies. Vivek Wadhwa, Senior Research Associate at Harvard University, described the bill as &quot;bizarre.&quot; In fact, illegal immigration and a tighter rein along the US border with Mexico will be a major issue leading up to the elections and the Democratic Party, to which Senators Schumer and McCaskill belong, has been on the backfoot on this issue. Immigration attorney Cyrus Mehta said, in this regard, &quot;It's a symbolic gesture. They are trying to show they are doing something. It's basically political.&quot; The political factor behind this Bill was also underscored by Sanjay Puri, chairman of the lobbying group USINPAC, as he said, &quot;While the security of the US borders and the protection of American jobs are of prime importance, it should not be done to score points during a heated political climate.&quot;<br />

It is only natural that the downturn in the U.S. economy, the rise of off-shoring and the visibility of the visa programs would collide and generate a firestorm of public outrage. The cry of how can you bring in high-tech foreign guest workers while at the same time IT unemployment is on the rise would quickly get the attention of politicians in the U.S. Phillips (2004). The inevitable result is the normal life cycle of public policy. Special interest groups lobby for their side. Lawyers and IT employers want few limitations on matching high-tech jobs with available candidates wherever they may originate. The desire to hire the best in any field requires the ability to use a global supply of talent. Besides, many of these potential visa holders are already enrolled in U.S. masters and doctoral programs. The visa program is an opportunity to keep that brain power in the U.S. Unemployed IT workers unite into groups that make their case to legislators at both the local and national levels. They argue that the U.S. does not need a special visa program targeting high-tech workers when many highly educated citizens are either unemployed or underemployed. From California to Connecticut, lawmakers are trying to restrict the visa programs or the broader off-shoring question. Some examples include prohibiting contractors from performing work outside the U.S., giving contracts only to U.S. citizens or people authorized to work in the U.S., attempts to restrict the H-1B and L-1 visa caps, attempts to stop federal grants and loans and loan guarantees from being granted to companies that lay off more workers in the U.S. than in other countries. Every opportunity to cite specific hardship cases and abuses is used to make the case for restrictive legislation. President Bush signed into law the L-1 Visa and H-1B Visa Reform Act as part of the Fiscal 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. The Act amends previous legislation by addressing the issue of outsourcing. The purpose of the Act was to ensure the visa program is more consistent with the spirit and intent of the original legislation. This would involve greater oversight of intra-company transfers to ensure visa holders are actually working in the specific role, with the specialized knowledge and for the specific subsidiary in which they were granted the visa in the first place. There are several new restrictions to the legislation. For example, an L-1B employee must remain under the control and supervision of the L-1 employer. For instance, Company X can't place its L-1 visa employee at Company Y to install an ERP system designed by Company X unless a manager from Company X oversees the project. Past abuses of the program involved assigning visa holders to third-party, off-site locations as contract labor-for-hire. A Comprehensive Analysis of the H-1B and L-1 Visa Programs Donald R. Moscato &amp; Eric D. Moscato Communications of the IIMA 82 2005 Volume 5 Issue 2 The new law also establishes a new fraud prevention and detection fee of $500 when applying for an H-1B or L type of visa. The revenues from this fee are distributed to the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Labor. This applies to petitions filed after March 8, 2005. The U.S. must seek a delicate balance in its attempts to regulate the immigration of highly skilled technology workers. The issue is very complex and emotionally volatile but it strikes at the very essence of the U.S. being a nation of immigrants. THE VISA PROGRAMS AND HOMELAND SECURITY “Homeland Security’s Citizenship and Immigration Services manages several databases containing sensitive information about people who have applied for permission to live and work in the United States.” Greenemeier (2005) Since 9/11 there has been a very emotional debate raging in the U.S. concerning the balance between security and privacy. The right to privacy is viewed very differently by various cultures. For instance, the right to privacy is different between the U.S. and the European Community. Moscato and Robinson (2002) The issue is further complicated when the differences between U.S. citizens and non-citizens are taken into consideration. If a person is deemed a security threat, then that person is assumed not to be allowed to stay in the U.S. Violating a visiting worker’s rights might end up in litigation. It is relatively easy to see how the fears of unemployment and homeland security can flame the passions of people on both sides of the debate. The link can be used by those who demagogue the issue for their own personal cause or gain.<br />

Fearing political fallout, senior Senators McCain (R-AZ) and Kennedy (D-MA) retreated from the H-1B and Immigration Reform bill battlefield last week. The McCain/Kennedy coalition split and opted not to release the immigration reform bill they've been working on. McCain seemed frustrated with the endeavor and is also concerned about losing support from his conservative base in his bid for the Republican presidential candidacy. Conservative voters are strongly against guest worker programs which, many feel, leads to amnesty for illegal aliens. The H-1B program is not related to illegal immigration but it is growing into an equally controversial guest worker program with heavyweight opponents such as IEEE-USA, the AFL-CIO, the CWA and many others who are joining in as the immigration battle progresses.<br />

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) will be the most important test of labor’s efforts to save incumbent lawmakers. Based in a state with high unemployment and a high home foreclosure rate, Reid is facing a tough reelection race this year. Consequentially, unions are revving up their general-election campaigns three months earlier than usual, as soon as Reid’s Republican challenger is picked in the June 8 primary. “It’s our single focus. Harry Reid has done more for the state — more than anyone in history,” said Danny Thompson, executive secretary-treasurer of the Nevada State AFL-CIO, which has more than 200,000 members. The state labor federation has a three-pronged program in place: a worksite initiative, from construction sites to casinos, where workers will lobby other workers to vote for Reid, target union members for door-to-door campaigning and then direct-mail pieces paid for by the national union. Thompson said he believes the labor vote will be key to Reid’s reelection, estimating it makes up to 32 to 34 percent of the vote in Nevada. “We are right now putting everything in place. The people who will be running the campaign are in place. The structure is in place. We are ready to go,” Thompson said.<br />

<br />
The challenge now facing Democrats in the less than four months remaining before November is to create an equally effective mobilisation on their side. They need the White House to commit both resources and the personal involvement of the president in support of vulnerable Democrats in the fall campaign. And, since these elections will be low turn-out contests and decided by the party that has the most intense voter support, they want the White House to help gin up excitement among the party's faithful to create a change in momentum offsetting the GOP's current edge. Of course other factors can help. A dramatic upturn in the economy or another White House success that carries with it some felt benefit for voters, or a more compelling Democratic message that convinces voters that &quot;staying the course&quot; would be more in their interest than returning to a divided government. Any of these would help change the national mood and the dynamic leading up to the elections. But even with this, Congressional Democrats want the White House engaged and fighting on their side, energising and not depressing potential voters. That's why the Gibb comments created such a stir. By week's end, following a White House meeting, they appeared on the same page with promises of a combined effort to buck historical trends and transform the public mood helping Democrats forestall GOP wins in November.<br />

The New Democrat Coalition is urging Congress to pass the new reform this year, before the Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 H1B filing season opens for the filing of new cap-subject H1B cases on April 1, 2008. In addition to requesting more H1B visas and employment-based permanent residence, the group is pushing for modernized student visa programs. It is attempting to align the student visas with an uninterrupted supply of employment-based temporary and permanent visas, should the students find employment offers following graduation. During FY2008, the gross inadequacy of the 65,000 H1B limit became evident, as there were not enough H1B cap numbers even for cases filed on the first day of filing. It is expected that this coming cap season will be even more severe, if the H1B cap-subject quota is not substantially increased. In addition to this push for reform from the Democrats, there is also overwhelming pressure from political lobbyists and the general public. Some observers believe, therefore, that a newly-increased H1B quota could be available this year.<br />

In probably the most controversial portion of his testimony, Gates said that the shortage of trained scientists and engineers had grown so severe that it required a dramatic increase in the number of highly-skilled immigrants permitted to enter the country. He charged that the current limit of 65,000 H-1B visas per year &quot;bears no relation to the U.S. economy's demand for skilled professionals,&quot; and noted that all of the visas for fiscal year 2008 were snapped up on the first day they were available.

The increased lobbying efforts and campaign contributions are only part of a multi-pronged strategy Microsoft has to deal with this perceived threat from the government. They have established phoney grass-roots groups, hired people to write opinion pieces for newspapers and magazines, pose as ordinary citizens in various Internet chat rooms, sponsored polls to make it appear they have a groundswell of support and have enlisted their stockholders and business partners to lobby for them.<br />

High-tech employers are lobbying Congress to raise a cap on visas for specialty workers and allow an additional 30,000 such workers into the United States each year. Companies say that would give them more flexibility to put the world's best and brightest to work in America instead of in competing countries. They say it would increase the chances of employees developing groundbreaking innovations in the United States. But an increase in the number of these visas could create tougher job competition for American workers. &quot;It's a major, major issue for Arizona companies,&quot; said Shoshana Tancer, a Phoenix lawyer and member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. &quot;It's not just the giant high-tech companies. It is the small businesses that want people. They've graduated with master's degrees and they want to work in the United States for a time, and they have the skills (small businesses) need.&quot; Business organizations such as the National Association of Manufacturers, high-tech trade association AeA and Compete America are lobbying for the increase. High-tech companies including Intel Corp., Motorola Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are supporters. The cap would cover H-1B visas, a category that allows workers in specialty occupations to work in the United States for up to six years. They are admitted on the basis of their professional education, skills or experience. Companies with 15 percent or more of their workforce on H-1B visas are required to seek U.S. workers or attest that they have not laid off a U.S. worker before hiring foreign employees under the program. For immigrants, an H-1B is often a prelude to applying for status as a legal permanent resident.<br />

The computers and Internet industry has given 66 percent of its money in the 2010 election cycle to Democrats, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. Of the $12.9 million the industry has given to federal candidates and party committees in the 2010 election, over $8.4 million has gone to Democrats. Since corporations and labor unions by law may not contribute to federal candidates, these figures reflect contributions from industry employees, their families, and political action committees associated with computer and Internet companies. Of the top 10 recipients of money from the computer and Internet industry this election, nine are Democrats. New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer leads with $194,384, followed by Washington Democratic Sen.Patty Murray ($176,973) and New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ($161,395). The lone Republican in the top 10 is Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown at number eight with $88,750. Microsoft is the top contributor with 60 percent of its nearly $1.3 million in contributions going to Democrats. This number reflects contributions made to incumbents, challengers, and national party committees. Contributions from those associated with Cisco make it the second highest contributor in the industry with $557,919 in donations, 67 percent of which went to Democratic candidates and committees. Google is next, with $456,119 in contributions, 75 percent of which went to Democrats, followed by Intel, with 57 percent of its $373,205 in contributions going to Democrats. The fifth-most-prominent computer/internet company, Hewlett-Packard, also favored Democrats, despite the fact that its former CEO, Carly Fiorina, is running as a Republican in California's high-profile Senate race. Those associated with Hewlett-Packard gave $367,460, with only 40 percent going to Republican candidates and parties.<br />

State action creates a race to the most exclusionary laws, and a lapse in enforcement<br />

<br />
The practice of employing state and municipal laws to exclude immigrants should be discontinued. State and local governments cannot cite and allege the depletion of resources as the rationale for passing laws when the real reason is to prohibit immigrants from entering their communities. Similarly, states and municipalities cannot use state and local laws to cause the removal of lawful immigrants from the community. n149 If states and localities are permitted to enact immigration laws, our country will have fifty different iterations of pro- and anti- immigrant laws. This will also cause state and local governments across the country to compete with each other to see who can pass laws to exclude immigrants from their states, so they will not have to address any issues that come along with migration and integrating immigrants into their communities. This will essentially result in a downward spiral of states with laws that exclude (a race to the bottom) as states and localities attempt to enact laws which result in immigrants relocating or self-deporting. This will cause the unequal regulation and enforcement of immigration laws which may lead to violations of immigrants' rights. This can all be halted with the federal government taking an active role in enforcing existing immigration laws and enacting laws that clearly articulate that federal government regulates immigration and defines the conditions under which states and localities can aid the federal government.<br />

When states and localities pass immigration related laws, the main concern is whether federal, state or local governments are the proper level of government to regulate immigration. The goal of this paper is to chal [*581] lenge the position that states and localities should play a central role in immigration enforcement and regulation. To support this contention, part I provides a brief overview of the historical roles of federal, state, and local governments in regulating and enforcing immigration. In particular, the first section focuses on the most recent state and local laws targeting immigrants. These laws pointedly deny essential services of employment, housing, and welfare benefits to immigrants often forcing them to relocate or self-deport. Part II analyzes current case law and the federal circuit split on the constitutionality of state and local laws. This section focuses on two precedent in the passage of laws targeting immigrants: Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and the State of Arizona.

3. Germ warfare! Like chemical agents, biological weapons have never lived up to their billing in popular culture. Consider the 1995 medical thriller Outbreak, in which a highly contagious virus takes out entire towns. The reality is quite different. Weaponized smallpox escaped from a Soviet laboratory in Aralsk, Kazakhstan, in 1971; three people died, no epidemic followed. In 1979, weapons-grade anthrax got out of a Soviet facility in Sverdlovsk (now called Ekaterinburg); 68 died, no epidemic. The loss of life was tragic, but no greater than could have been caused by a single conventional bomb. In 1989, workers at a US government facility near Washington were accidentally exposed to Ebola virus. They walked around the community and hung out with family and friends for several days before the mistake was discovered. No one died. The fact is, evolution has spent millions of years conditioning mammals to resist germs. Consider the Black Plague. It was the worst known pathogen in history, loose in a Middle Ages society of poor public health, awful sanitation, and no antibiotics. Yet it didn't kill off humanity. Most people who were caught in the epidemic survived. Any superbug introduced into today's Western world would encounter top-notch public health, excellent sanitation, and an array of medicines specifically engineered to kill bioagents. Perhaps one day some aspiring Dr. Evil will invent a bug that bypasses the immune system. Because it is possible some novel superdisease could be invented, or that existing pathogens like smallpox could be genetically altered to make them more virulent (two-thirds of those who contract natural smallpox survive), biological agents are a legitimate concern. They may turn increasingly troublesome as time passes and knowledge of biotechnology becomes harder to control, allowing individuals or small groups to cook up nasty germs as readily as they can buy guns today. But no superplague has ever come close to wiping out humanity before, and it seems unlikely to happen in the future.<br />

The US demand for enhanced access to Chinese, Indian and Brazilian markets, while at the same time stepping up protective trade measures, has further mired the already stalled Doha trade negotiations, trade diplomats said. The US “can’t achieve gains without making further concessions,” Indian Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar told the Washington Trade Daily, an influential American trade publication, in an exclusive interview last week. “The US is the one which taught this lesson to everybody at the WTO that there is no free ride or free lunch... So, if you want a concession, you have to pay for it,” he said, suggesting that the demands made by the US on agriculture and industrial goods are unreasonable and inconsistent with the Doha mandate.<br />

The Doha round of trade negotiations, estimated to result in additional $270 billion of trade annually, is nowhere near conclusion even after nine years of its launch. WTO deputy director general Alejandro Jara talks about the state of negotiations and what lies ahead for world trade. Excerpts of an interview with ET. There has not been any negotiation between trade ministers at the WTO ever since they failed to reach a breakthrough in July 2008 in Geneva. Is interest in the round waning? It is true that in Geneva we failed to achieve a breakthrough in the key issues of agriculture and Nama (industrial goods). Since then we did a lot of work in terms of better defining different options that are available and looking for consensus. This work has been very productive from a technical point of view and there has been constant progress. We expect that some time in the future there would again be conditions for ministers to meet and take political decisions to make progress in negotiations. It has not been possible so far as there have been elections, frustrations and many other factors that make political conditions difficult. We are trying to facilitate (proper conditions). Perhaps we are going to find some time next year for ministers to meet. Also, it is not that the WTO is paralysed. All trade ministers did meet in Geneva last December, not to negotiate, but for a normal meeting.<br />

<br />
Agriculture has been a sensitive issue for countries like India. One of the reasons for no breakthrough in July 2008 was disagreement over special safeguard measure (SSMs) to protect farmers. How do you see this getting sorted out? I think agriculture is universally sensitive. SSM for developing countries is a sensitive point also for exporting countries like Uruguay and Argentina. We have to define a set of circumstances to decide where you put in place curbs on imports without restricting trade. The problem is more about finding a point at which you can prevent something traumatic happening to farmers and at the same time preserve market access. Going by what is there on the table right now if governments are reasonable, which I am sure they are, it will not be difficult to find the point at which an agreement around the SSM can be reached.<br />

Co2 key to Cotton<br />

<br />
Elevated CO2 enhanced individual leaf area by 20%, while it increased whole plant leaf area by an average of 47% across all temperature treatments. CO2-enriched leaves also had greater specific densities (mass per unit area) than leaves grown at ambient CO2, which can be attributed to the greater amounts of nonstructural carbohydrates they contained. As a result, plants grown in elevated CO2 had 31 to 78% more biomass than plants grown at ambient CO2. Atmospheric CO2 enrichment additionally increased the number of fruiting sites per plant at all temperatures; but most fruit aborted, regardless of CO2 concentration, at temperatures greater than 30°C. What it means Cotton should grow more vigorously as the amount of CO2 in the air continues to climb. Leaves will likely be larger, thereby giving plants greater photosynthetic surface area to produce more carbohydrates to facilitate growth. With more atmospheric CO2, greater numbers of branches and fruiting sites will likely develop as well, which should ultimately provide for the production of more lint for making cloth and textile products.<br />

Cotton provides raw material to more than 337 textile mills, 1500 ginning factories and 5000 oil mills. Approximately 65 per cent of Pakistan's annual export income comes from textile sector. Similarly other industries, such as pharmaceutical, soap, chemical and feed industries also rely on cotton by-products.

Nuclear testing creates political instability because it requires a substantial economic investment. One, small fission device typically costs five million U.S. dollars to manufacture. 84 Pakistan's economy is fragile already. 85 Pakistan's total budget for 1996-1997 was $ 12.5 [*503] billion, out of which 45 percent was spent on debt service and 24 percent on defense. 86 If Pakistan begins increasing its defense budget there will be nothing left for its people. 87 The spending effects of continued nuclear tests might bankrupt the Pakistani economy. One day, the Pakistani government might be forced to sell nuclear fuel, nuclear weapons or nuclear technology to generate capital. Uncontrollable nuclear proliferation could ensue and the world political regime might become destabilized. There are strong political forces contending for control of Pakistan. 88 Pakistan has been ruled on and off by the military for half of its history. 89 In October of 1999, Pakistan's democratically elected government was overthrown and traded for a military regime. 90 If Pakistan's political climate does not eventually stabilize, Pakistan may become divided and compartmentalized, like a warlord-ridden, nuclear Somalia. Each faction would control nuclear weapons and a nuclear civil war could ensue. The world could be at the mercy of a rogue nuclear state. The effect on the world could be incredibly destabilizing.<br />

Increased Co2-increases earthworm activities<br />

<em>As the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise, nearly all plants will exhibit increased photosynthetic rates and enhanced biomass production both above- and belowground. This increase in root production, along with enhanced nutrient exudation from roots, should increase the organic matter content of nearly all soils. In turn, greater soil organic matter contents will stimulate many earthworm activities, including the egestion of nutrient-rich casts that increase the fertility of soils. And with greater soil fertility, the absolute growth response of plants to rising levels of atmospheric CO2 should increase. Thus, this beneficial circular relationship between earthworms and plants, which is mediated by soil organic matter content, is increasingly-enhanced by the rising CO2 content of the air. And this phenomenon makes the soils a better place for both plants and earthworms.</em><br />

Only where you find earthworms will you find rich, healthy soil with high amounts of organic matter and vice versa. Earthworms simply cannot proliferate and flourish in areas where chemical fertilizers and pesticides are paramount.Earthworms, actually, act as a barometer for soil health. Many agriculture oriented people still do not understand or appreciate the tremendous enriching value that earthworms have on our soils. It took a French scientist and ecologist, André Voisin, author of the insightful Soil, Grass and Cancer, to point out that the earthworm, and in particular the slippery lumbricid, most common in the United States and Europe, is not only essential to good agriculture but is the very foundation of all civilization. In Better Grassland Sward, Voisin traces man's civilizations in relation to the distribution of active earthworms, of which he lists some three thousand species. Among the most ancient of terrestrial animal groups, several hundred million years old, they come in various colors and sizes: brown, purple, red, pink, blue, green and light tan, the smallest barely an inch long, the largest a ten-foot giant in Australia, though South African newspapers reported a boa-constrictor-sized monster twenty feet long, a yard wide through the middle. The most common European and American earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, grows barely longer than six inches. Ten thousand years ago, immediately after the last ice age, the lumbricid earthworms were to be found only in certain restricted areas of the planet, such as in the valleys of three great civilizations - the Indus, the Euphrates, and the Nile - where crops grew almost without cultivation in a soil of immensely fruitful richness. As Jerry Minnich points out in The Earthworm Book, other areas of the earth offered ideal climates and rich soils, but produced, with the exception of China, no such civilizations. The Egyptian experience alone, says Minnich, is strong indication that a complex civilization cannot develop until the basic agricultural needs of its people are met, and that requires the earthworm. Not that the point was entirely overlooked by the USDA. an agricultural report on investigations carried out in the valley of the Nile in 1949, before the folly of the Aswan Dam, indicated that the great fertility of the soil was due in large part the work of earthworms. It was estimated that during the six months of active growing season each year the castings of earthworms on these soils amounted to a stunning 120 tons per acre, and in each handful of that soil are more microorganisms than there are humans on the planet. Thirty years before the birth of Darwin, as the American colonists were breaking away from the mother country, an English naturalist, Gilbert White, was writing: Worms seem to be the great promoters of vegetation, perforating and loosening the soil, rendering it pervious to rains and the fibers of plants by drawing straws and stalks of leaves and twigs into it; and, most of all, by throwing up such infinite numbers of lumps of earth called worm-casts, which being their excrement, is a fine manure for grain and grass. . . . The earth without worms would soon become cold, hard-bound, and void of fermentation, and consequently sterile. That the phenomenon was understood before the time of Christ is clear from Cleopatra's decree that the earthworm be revered and protected by all her subjects as a sacred animal. Egyptians were forbidden to remove it from the land, and farmers were not to trouble the worms for fear of stunting the renowned fertility of the Nilotic valley's soil.<br />

Mr. Kirk also appeared to be dissatisfied with the steps taken by the U.S. Congress with regard to H-1B visa, which is said to be the life line of the Silicon Valley. He argued that this is an economic issue, while the Congress takes this as an immigration matter. “The reality is, Congress is zealous about its right to determine immigration policy. We see this as an economic issue but Congress feels it should be seen as part of our overall immigration policy,” he said. “Hopefully, we can get to a place where we can have a more thoughtful, rational debate on immigration and address this issue,” Mr. Kirk said.<br />

Interbranch conflict undermines effective foreign policy – Crushes heg and the environment<br />

Indeed there are very few domestic issues that do not have strong international implications, and likewise there are numerous transnational issues in which all nations have a stake. Environmental degradation, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, population control, migration, international narcotics trafficking, the spread of AIDS, and the deterioration of the human condition in the less developed world are circumstances affecting all corners of the globe. Neither political isolation nor policy bifurcation is an option for the United States. Global circumstances have drastically changed with the end of the Cold War and the political and policy conditions that sustained bipartisan consensus are not applicable to the post-war era. The formulation of a new foreign policy must be grounded in broad-based principles that reflect domestic economic, political and social concerns while providing practical solutions to new situations. Toward a cooperative US Foreign Policy for the 1990s: If the federal government is to meet the new international policy challenges of the post-cold war era, institutional dissension caused by partisan competition and executive-legislative friction must give way to a new way of business. Policy flexibility must be the watchword of the 1990s in the foreign policy domain if the United States is to have any hope of securing its interests in the uncertain years ahead. One former policymaker, noting the historical tendency of the United States to make fixed “attachments,” has argued that a changing world dictates policy flexibility, where practical solutions can be developed on principles of broad-based policy objectives (Fulbright 1979). Flexibility, however, will not be possible without interbranch cooperation. The end of the Cold War and the new single-party control of the White House and Congress provide a unique opportunity to reestablish foreign policy cooperation. Reconfiguring post cold war objectives requires comprehension of the remarkable transformations in world affairs and demands an intense political dialogue that goes beyond the executive branch (Mann 1990, 28-29).<br />

Environment collapse causes extinction<br />

The first principle is the most important because earth-life is needed to support earth-life. Ecosystems are composed of countless species that are mutually dependent upon each other for nutrients directly as food or as by-products of earth-life (e.g., as carbon dioxide and oxygen). If the biodiversity of an ecosystem is substantially compromised, then the entire system could collapse due to destructive negative nutrient cycle feedback effects. If enough ecosystems collapse worldwide, then the cascading impact on global nutrient cycles could lead to catastrophic species extinction. Thus, to ensure the survival of earth-life into the distant future the earth's biodiversity must be protected.<br />

May 2010 -- LEXIS<br />
<br />
The fact that an executive agency charged with setting visa numbers might change those numbers on an annual basis could [*1812] account for the strong opposition to delegation from employer lobbies, who probably fear that visa streams will be cut off or diminished in an unpredictable fashion. These interests might prefer to lock a secure number of visas into a legislative bargain. n71 One of the key challenges, then, in designing a labor visa agency or commission will be to ensure that employers and other important interests have the incentive and ability to predict changes in policy in a manner that allows them to go about their business. For the reasons discussed in Part I, flexibility and predictability need not be completely at odds. But even when they are, the virtue of the administrative process relative to the legislative process is that the former can continuously balance these competing objectives, recalibrating the balance in response to policy outcomes.<br />

At the same time, there has been growing recognition not only of the global benefits of greater mobility but also that the emigration of skilled labour may not be negative for the sending country. In the first place, emigration of talent may provide a positive signal that motivates others in the sending country to acquire more education, thereby raising human capital and possibly promoting growth. Second, emigrants may in due course return, or through networks and resource repatriation, such as through remittances, provide essential inputs to new businesses and activities in the sending countr y. Third, emigration may actively promote a more effective flow of knowledge and information. Fourth, the changing nature of mobility – in part due to major advances in communications technology – may be limiting the extent to which skills are actually lost. A network industry, like software, is possibly a case in point.<br />

Brain Drain arguments flawed—circulation benefits Asian economies<br />

Understandably, the rapid growth of the foreign-born workforce has evoked intense debates over U.S. immigration policy, both here and in the developing world. In the United States, discussions of the immigration of scientists and engineers have focused primarily on the extent to which foreign-born professionals displace native workers. The view from sending countries, by contrast, has been that the emigration of highly skilled personnel to the United States represents a big economic loss, a &quot;brain drain.&quot; Neither view is adequate in today's global economy. Far from simply replacing native workers, foreign-born engineers are starting new businesses and generating jobs and wealth at least as fast as their U.S. counterparts. And the dynamism of emerging regions in Asia and elsewhere now draws skilled immigrants homeward. Even when they choose not to return home, they are serving as middlemen linking businesses in the United States with those in distant regions. In some parts of the world, the old dynamic of &quot;brain drain&quot; is giving way to one I call &quot;brain circulation.&quot; Most people instinctively assume that the movement of skill and talent must benefit one country at the expense of another. But thanks to brain circulation, high-skilled immigration increasingly benefits both sides. Economically speaking, it is blessed to give and to receive.<br />

Our results confirm anecdotal evidence that immigrants from India and China who return to their home countries do so in part due to perceptions of greater economic and professional opportunities in their home countries. They report significant professional advancement into roles more senior in their home countries than previously held positions in the United States. Interestingly, the responses to our survey seemed to indicate that returnees’ departures were not related solely to preferences for starting a business in their home countries or to perceptions of possibilities of further professional advancement in their home countries. Returnees showed a strong preference for their home country because of family and personal considerations. To a certain degree, this is to be expected: as the economies of China and India develop rapidly, they offer opportunities for middleand upper-class standards of living not previously available. Likewise, factors that previously would have weighed dramatically in favor of the U.S., such as quality of life and professional opportunities, diminish relative to ones more personal and familial. Of particular note is the overwhelming preference for their home countries in respect of care of aging parents and closeness to family and friends. This highlights a disadvantage the United States has in attracting and retaining skilled immigrants.<br />

CCP collapse inevitable – Fuel prices, land disputes and pollution<br />
<br />
IPS, 2007, China: Surging Fuel Prices Spark Unrest, 11-14<br />
The government’s main concern is that higher fuel prices could have a domino effect on other fuels and energy sources that could squeeze China’s poorer residents. Rising fuel prices and the resulting inflation sparked street protests in Indonesia two years ago, and was blamed for the August/September unrest in Burma. China, where economic disparity between the urban and rural areas has been growing, already faces a significant risk of social upheaval. Last year rights groups reported some 90,000 protests against local governments over land disputes and rampant pollution. The government team led by President Hu Jintao has made equalizing growth and helping poor peasants in inland provinces its top policy priority and is loath to see any social discontent arising from fuel price hikes. “The higher than targeted inflation in the first nine months of this year is the reason why domestic fuel prices were not (initially) allowed to keep pace with surging international crude oil prices,“ Liu Zhenqiu, price bureau chief with the National Development and Reform Commission told the Central Chinese Television on the weekend.<br />
