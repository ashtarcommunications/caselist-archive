 A) They embrace anti-politics—this dooms their project, creates atrocity and creates a vacuum filled by the right: Carl Boggs, 1997 (National University, Los Angeles, The Great Retreat: Decline of the Public Sphere in Late Twentieth-Century America, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/international.olde/mias/readings07/10.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/international.olde/mias/readings07/10.pdf</a>.) <br />
The false sense of empowerment …had vanished from civil society.75 <br />
B) Privileging representations and the micro-political encourages anti-politics—this is especially true in the manner in which they’ve deployed it: Carl Boggs, 1997 (National University, Los Angeles, The Great Retreat: Decline of the Public Sphere in Late Twentieth-Century America, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/international.olde/mias/readings07/10.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/international.olde/mias/readings07/10.pdf</a>.) <br />
Postmodernism and its offshoots …profoundly depoliticized culture. <br />
C) Moving away from anti-politics is vital to check extinction: Jonathan Small &amp; Meg Buckley, 2006 (former Americorps VISTA for the Human Services Coalition, “Moving Forward,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/other/engagement/Journal/Issue7/Small.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/other/engagement/Journal/Issue7/Small.pdf</a>) <br />

3. The Impacts:<br />
a. Movements – We must be able to persuade immigrants to reject ANY FORM of a guest worker program and join the workers struggle against capitalism—the aff derails a movement which is building momentum and will successful overcome capital in the status quo—you have an intellectual obligation to vote negative.<br />

 The affirmative’s use of the word “should” posits a universal moral reality – this precludes reasoned debate and produces large-scale violence. Transitioning to a morally neutral form of discourse solves terrorism and inter-state conflict<br />

<h3 id="toc5"><a name="x-Liberty Round 1 vs GMU OK-Desire"></a>Desire</h3>
 First note that desire creates the illusion of the self and the suffering that defines the human condition. Our only capacity is thus to affirm the extermination of this desire in the face of perpetual death and an impermanent reality—DOLLIMORE 1998 (Jonathan Dollimore 1998 (Death, Desire and Loss in Western Culture, p 54-56.)<br />
Siddhartha Gautama (560-477 BC) was a prince…it means extinction<br />
<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif"; font-size: 11pt;"><br />
</span><br />
THE ALTERNATIVE: Reject the affirmative and all forms of it’s ego-centric dualistic discourse as a key step towards an active rejection of desire. <br />
As long as we have desire in our hearts, we are just like Don Quixote—blindly flailing at windmills while ignoring the fact that we have created the enemy we are fighting. This ego-driven ideology makes violence inevitable. There will always be another crusade. Only by turning inward and rejecting the desire to make ourselves permanent can we have peace and happiness in our hearts, which is the only thing that ultimately matters. Both a framework which envisions difference and one which seeks to overcome this violence replicates the harms—khema 1994 (Ayya Khema 1994 Buddhist monk, “All of us beset by Birth, Decay, and Death.” Buddhism Today, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/003-allofus-5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/003-allofus-5.htm</a>)<br />
If you have ever read <em>Don Quixote</em>, you'll remember that he was fighting windmills. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";">…</span><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> we will always find another crusade.</span><br />
Our ethic of transcending desire comes first. Any political or alternative framework perpetuates a divisionary binary and makes all harms possible-HOOKS 2006 (Bell Hooks, Buddhism and the Politics or Domination.Mindful Politics, 2006)<br />
A similar door has opened…fixed markers in life<br />
<span style="font-family: "Georgia","serif"; font-size: 11pt;"><br />
</span><br />
A rejection of this cycle of desire allows us to have an enlightened engagement with the world—a fundamental prerequisite to all other “action”—DAVIS 2004 (Bret W. Davis, 2004 (Department of Japanese Philosophy Kyoto University “Zen After Zarathustra: The Problem of the Will in the Confrontation Between Nietzsche and Buddhism” The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 28 (2004) 89-138, accessed through muse.edu)<br />
The way things are here and now, according to Buddhism…<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">their dependent co-origination. </span><br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc6"><a name="_Toc272420529"></a></h3>
 TURN: MISDIRECTION--Metaphors misdirect attention from the root cause of problems—we get caught up in the metaphor and ignore examinations of root causes:<br />
Snowball, chair of department of speech communication @ Augustana College, ’91 (Continuity &amp; Change in the Rhetoric of the Moral Majority; pg.128-129)<br />
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">A number of scholars have expressed </span>… in many ways, &quot;treacherous.&quot;13<br />
TURN: CO-OPTION--Metaphors that cross “domains” will be coopted by conservatives:<br />
Lakoff, 1995 (Metaphor, Morality, and Politics, Or, Why Conservatives Have Left Liberals In the Dust<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wwcd.org/issues/Lakoff.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wwcd.org/issues/Lakoff.html</a>)<br />
This example illustrates what a cognitive scientist …<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">retribution to that of restitution.</span><br />
Far-fetched metaphors cause people to get wrapped up in the metaphor over the idea:<br />
Tim Love, November 1996. (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mattressemporium.com/metaphor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://mattressemporium.com/metaphor.htm</a>)<br />
confusion, obscurity, gaudiness - <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">…Far-fetched metaphors are called 'conceits'.</span><br />
METAPHORS ARE A FORM OF COERCION AND EXCLUSION: IT CREATES IN AND OUT GROUPS:<br />
COHEN, 1997 (Ted – prof at univ of Chicago, Philosophy and Literature 21.2, &quot;Metaphor, Feeling, and Narrative,&quot; pp. 223-244, project muse).<br />
In summary: One motive to metaphor is the …of joining the speaker in feeling. (p. 239).
