The term “human trafficking” masks the fact that it is a crime of exploitation, not movement. This is important because it stops us from helping people who are exploited within their own borders. It is better to use the term “modern-day slavery”<br />

 A.) Link- The era of post politics radically depoliticizes the economy – this can never obtain the dimensions of universality because it precludes acts of authentic politics – we must establish a radical strategy that re-politicizes the economy in order to break free from the chains of global capitalism – vote negative to disturb the Fantasy of the depoliticized economy and engage in an authentic act of politics<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1999<br />

What one should bear in mind, however….. within a given situation, a gesture counts as an<br />

B.) The Impact- It is not possible to solve any situation without solving them all – only a criticism which attacks the universal of capitalism can solve their impacts and the inevitable destruction of the earth and its people<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1989<br />
(Slavoj, The Sublime Object of Ideology, page 3-4 gjm)<br />
It is upon the unity of these two features….. a transparent, rationally governed society.<br />

 Their focus on subjective flashpoints of violence creates a stop-gap in thought which distracts us from attempts to solve the root cause of all violence - Capital<br />
Zizek, ’08 (Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia and a professor at the European Graduate School, Violence, p. 1-4)<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is a unifying thesis that runs … violence kept at a distance out of respect towards its victims.<br />
<br />
The capitalist drive for resources will ensure that wars grow bigger and more intense over time.<br />
Meszaros, ’95 (Istivan, professor emeritus at the University of Sussex, Beyond Capital, pg. 886)<br />
<br />
The crisis we face, then, is not simply a political … violently readjusting the prevailing relation of forces.<br />
<br />
Corporate control of energy breeds the extreme poverty and inequality that is the root cause of terrorism.<br />
Slater, ’06 (Philip, A.B. and Ph. D. from Harvard and taught sociology at Harvard, Brandeis, and UCSC, “The Root Causes of Terrorism and Why No One Wants to End Them”, October 25th, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-slater/the-root-causes-of-terror_b_32466.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-slater/the-root-causes-of-terror_b_32466.html</a>)<br />
<br />
The people who do most to … until caps are placed on inequality.<br />

Extinction inevitable - capitalism’s domination over nature and culture is the root cause of all violence<br />
Shiva, ’02 (Vandana, Alternative Nobel Laureate, Director of The Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Natural Resource Policy, a network of researchers specializing in sustainable agriculture and development, and Philosophy Ph.D., “Terrorism as Cannibalism,” January 23, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zmag.org/sustainers/content/2002-01/23shiva.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zmag.org/sustainers/content/2002-01/23shiva.cfm</a>)<br />
<br />
Humans are experiencing their … new invisible cages trapping humanity.<br />
<br />
There is no value to life under capitalism – people are reduced to their economic worth<br />
Dillon ’99 (Michael, Professor of IR @ Lancaster, “Another Justice” Political Theory, Vol. 27, No. 2. April, pp. 165)<br />
<br />
Quite the reverse. The subject was never a firm foundation … never forget that, &quot;we are dealing always with whatever exceeds measure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, the alt is a pre-requisite to the affirmative – capitalist ideology makes it impossible to adequately or accurately answer the questions of the affirmative. We must step outside of the current restrictions on thinking before we can begin to ponder where to go next.<br />
Johnston ’04<br />
(Adrian, interdisciplinary research fellow in psychoanalysis at Emory, The Cynic’s Fetish: Slavoj Zizek and the Dynamics of Belief, Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society)<br />
<br />
The height of Zizek's philosophical traditionalism, his fidelity … disrupt capitalism or are ideologically co-opted by it.<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s try or die for the alt – if extinction is inevitable then even a 1% risk of alt solvency means vote neg<br />
Meyercord, ’01 (Ken, The Ethic of Zero Growth, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zerogrowth.org/ZeroGrowth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zerogrowth.org/ZeroGrowth.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Do we need an alternative to growth? Many signs - from ozone … doomsayers, after all, only have to be right once.<br />

Capitalism is unsustainable – leads to endocrine disruption and extinction<br />
Douthwaite, ‘99 (Richard, council member of Comhar, the Irish government's national sustainability council and a Fellow of the Post Carbon Institute. Visiting lecturer at the University of Plymouth, Critical development theory: contributions to a new paradigm, GoogleBooks, 158, AMiles)<br />
<br />
A third reason that the world economy is unsustainable … sustainable then neither is its economic system.<br />

Capitalism makes all their truth claims suspect<br />

Plan action short-circuits alt solvency - action necessarily precludes thinking<br />
Zizek, ’09 (Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, professor at the European Graduate School, and total BAMF, First as Tragedy, Then as Farce, p. 10-11)<br />
<br />
At the height of the meltdown … in the first place.<br />
<br />
Action within the confines of liberal democracy is doomed to fail – the plan only makes the system run more smoothly. Abstaining from the desire to act is the only way to solve capital and the aff.<br />
Zizek, ’08 (Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia and a professor at the European Graduate School, Violence, p. 216-217)<br />
<br />
<br />
In psychoanalytic terms, the voters’ abstention … nothing is the most violent thing to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
It isn’t surprising they have evidence that our alt will fail – the status quo leaves no room for authentic action against capitalism. We must insist on risking the impossible of a successful revolution – we radically restructure the ethico-political imagination to include the possibility of successful actions against domination.<br />
Zizek and Daly 2004<br />
(Slavoj, professor of philosophy at the Institute for Sociology, Ljubljana, and Glyn, Senior Lecturer in Politics in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at University College, Northampton, Conversations with Zizek, page 18-19)<br />
<br />
For Zizek, a confrontation with the obscenities … exhorts us to risk the impossible.<br />
