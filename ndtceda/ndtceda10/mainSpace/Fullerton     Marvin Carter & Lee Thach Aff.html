<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Citizenship is “the debates, interpretations, and professed needs and interests that surround legal statutes and the social practices to which these are linked</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn1">[1</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” It is “a marker of identity” that “signals &quot;belonging&quot; and &quot;insider-status&quot; in a privileged way</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn2">[2</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” Debates on citizenship tell us “what it means to be an American</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn3">[3</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">”. According to <span class="verdana">Jonathan Weinberg, of the </span>Michigan Law Review, in 2009, “There is no such thing as a U.S. immigrant </span><a name="HIT_2"></a><a name="ORIGHIT_2"></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span class="hit">visa</span> that does not carry with it the promise of </span><a name="HIT_3"></a><a name="ORIGHIT_3"></a><span class="hit"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">citizenship</span></span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn4">[4</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span class="hit">.”</span> But the visa cannot make an American out of the foreign other. As Bill Ong Hing argues, when the US inevitably cycles through a nativist period, even the 14th Amendment cannot protect the targets of “de-Americanization</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn5">[5</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” “The de-Americanization process can reinvent itself generation after generation… it is a nativism cloaked in a Eurocentric sense of America that combines hate and racial profiling</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn6">[6</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.”</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Immigration history reveals the brutal violence of white supremacy actualized in citizenship. Russ Costronovo argues, US political membership is “complicit with a logic that kills off the past and leaves citizens</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn7">[7</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” Part of the neutrality of citizenship the way it sidesteps history</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn8">[8</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Naturalization is “an amnesiac operation of ideology, in order to signal that the identity of citizen disavows conflictual and antagonistic processes that frame political being. As a natural identity, the citizen discards the scraps and heterogeneous leftovers that do not fit the pattern of legal personhood</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn9">[9</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” Citizenship dehistorizes its own “historical conditions of its own articulation, conditions laden with memories of alternative geographies and temporalities for political being</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn10">[10</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” Although it is not possible to note the countless impositions of white supremacy in US immigration history, we will attempt to note several. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">America is a falsely inclusive discourse that seeks to appear neutral and open to the other,</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn11">[11</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> where immigration policy in the post-civil rights era circumvents the 14th Amendment by separating race from ethnicity</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn12">[12</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Shireen M. Roshanravan explains in 2009, “The separation of whiteness from European ethnicity exposes the empty constitution of white racial identity that, in turn, facilitates its conflation with an all-inclusive “America.” According to this logic, those who were of European origin possessed ethnicities amenable to “American” (read: white) ideals, while those with national origins racialized as non-white would forever be labeled foreign and incapable of assimilation (</span><a name="b24-text"></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">, 7–8). If white is a racial prerequisite for citizenship, and one’s national origins are racialized as non-white, then becoming “American” is an impossible task. Hailed as a color-blind meritocracy, this white-supremacist America nevertheless denies racial barriers to national inclusion. The popular discourse that anyone can achieve the “American Dream” so long as they work hard seduces immigrants of color to negate their racial-ethnic identity as a means of becoming “American just like everybody else.” The seduction is facilitated by the negative formulation of white racial identity</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn13">[13</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” The seduction of American neutrality invites immigrants of color to assimilate, but in order to complete assimilation immigrants must negate the self “becoming non-Mexican Mexicans, non-Indian Indians, non-Korean Koreans, and so on. The illusory base of the seduction is evidenced by the fact that one remains “Mexican,” “Korean,” “Indian,” “minority,” or “foreign” even after the processes of negating one’s racial-ethnic self in a mimicry of white/Anglo ways… in a racial context where whiteness is coded as the unmarked norm of society, inclusion in that society may seem less impossible</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn14">[14</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 11pt;">.” </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">American citizenship is tied to our beginnings, Manifest Destiny. The U.S. settler population mentality, to this very day, shares “a core belief that it is somehow inherently, singularly, even mystically, entitled to dominate all it encounters, possessing or at least benefiting from that which belongs to others, regardless of the costs and consequences visited upon those thereby subjugated and dispossessed…there are few who would queue up to argue the defensibility of a way of life predicated in/sustained by invasion, conquest, genocide, ecocide, colonization, and other modes of systemic theft</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn15">[15</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” “The genocide allows an “acceptable cost of doing business” blend(s) “perfectly into their own autogenocide until the grim prospect of species extinction has at last been realize</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn16">[16</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” From 1492 to 1650, the indigenous population of North American declined from 112 million people to 6 million when the US drew its geographical and sociological lines determining access to the country</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn17">[17</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The genocide of North America was the foundation of US immigration policy whereby the U.S. reserves the right to expand its territory while determining which bodies belong in that territory based on white supremacist assumptions. Part of this process was the Treaty of Guadalupe, signed post the Mexican-American War, “formally requires of Mexican Americans that they give up, relinquish, the &quot;character&quot; of Mexicanness in order to enjoy &quot;all the rights of the citizens of the United States</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn18">[18</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” Maria Josefina Saldana-Portillo, associate professor of ethnic studies at Brown in 2004, contends<span style="font-size: 10pt;">, </span>“the first step on the road to becoming a U.S. citizen is a negation, a becoming un-preserved, disposed of, lost, wasted</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn19">[19</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The economy would be a major catalyst in the need for immigrants, but the people brought to the US would not be considered American. One of the most egregious immigration programs was the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. African slaves were kidnapped in one of the most brutal crimes in US history and forcibly brought to the US; “the Trans-Atlantic slave trade was a crime against humanity.</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn20">[20</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">” The conditions on slave ships were so inhumane that “an English surgeon in 1790 estimated that two-thirds of the deaths on the slave journey were due to a &quot;mortal melancholy&quot; similar to an involuntary suicide.</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn21">[21</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">” Once in the US, slave traders dehumanized and profited from the labor of slaves by physically and psychologically terrorizing them. Families were separated/babies sold at auctions; rape was a constant threat their entire lives; slaves limbs were amputated to prevent them from fleeing; and traders sometimes burned slaves alive or hanged them from trees for reasons ranging from simple torture to punishment for attempting to secure their freedom</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn22">[22</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was one such act. Chinese laborers laid around 1700 miles of tracks for the US economy. “On average, for each two miles of track laid, three Chinese laborers were killed by accidents. More than one thousand Chinese railroad workers died </span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn23">[23</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” And when the Trans Atlantic railroad was built, Chinese laborers had been used up and were now being prohibited from entering the country as they were competing against white citizens.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Immigration restrictions to protect the American worker became the norm. The Immigration Act of 1924 made national quotas permanent</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn24">[24</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. “The quota machinery legitimated ideas about assimilability, identified certain kinds of immigrants as being incapable of ‘fitting in’…and validated the belief that ‘race’ classification was the most accurate way of making sense of the world’s peoples</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn25">[25</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” “While the national origins category racialized some Europeans, it reaffirmed their common whiteness. In naturalization applications, European immigrants were expected to fill in their “color” as “white,” while indicating their national origin as their “race”…In the context of growing undocumented…immigration created by quota legislation, an independent Border Patrol was established</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn26">[26</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This racialization process has created the racial and religious animosity toward Arabs and Muslims in the post-9/11 era</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn27">[27</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Modern visa issuance and immigration enforcement must be screened through the lens of national security in an effort to prevent a highly racialized terrorist from entering the US</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn28">[28</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Natsu Saito argues, “Arab Americans and Muslims have been &quot;raced&quot; as &quot;terrorists&quot;: foreign, disloyal, and imminently threatening</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn29">[29</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.” The fear of Arab and Muslim people as imminently threatening resulted in a social condition of inhumanness that the government leveraged to justify torturing enemy combatants who fit their profile</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn30">[30</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">White Supremacy constantly reformulates the conception of the white citizen in order to neutralize and/or exterminate immigrants who cannot fit within the normative confines of American citizenship. Dylan Rodriguez explains in 2007: </span></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 8pt; margin: 12pt 0in 0pt;">Dylan Rodriguez 07, Professor at UC Riverside, in 2007 describes the impact of white supremacy that US immigration history so clearly demonstrates<a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn31">[31</a>], </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Variable, overlapping,</span> <strong><u>and mutually constituting white supremacist regimes have</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">in fact</span> <strong><u>been fundamental to the formation</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and movements</span> <strong><u>of the United States,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">from racial chattel slavery and frontier genocide to recent and current modes of neoliberal land displacement and warfare. Without exception, these regimes have been differently entangled with the state’s changing paradigms, strategies, and technologies of human incarceration and punishment ( to follow the prior examples: the plantation, the reservation, the neoliberal sweatshop, and the domestic-to-global prison). The historical nature of these entanglements is widely acknowledged</span><strong><u>,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">although explanations of the structuring relations of force tend to either isolate or historically compartmentalize the complexities of historical white supremacy</span><strong><u>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">For the theoretical purposes of this essay, </span><strong><u>white supremacy maybe understood as a logic of social organization that produces</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">regimented,</span> <strong><u>institutionalized,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and militarized</span> <strong><u>conceptions of hierarchized “human” difference, enforced through</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">coercions and</span> <strong><u>violences that are structured by genocidal possibility</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(including physical extermination and curtailment of people’s collective capacities to socially, culturally, or biologically reproduce). As a historical vernacular and philosophical apparatus of domination,</span> <strong><u>white supremacy is</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">simultaneously</span> <strong><u>premised on</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and consistently innovating</span> <strong><u>universalized conceptions of the white “human”</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> vis-à-vis the rigorous production,penal discipline</span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><u>and</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">frequent</span> <strong><u>social, political, and biological neutralization or extermination of the (non-white) sub-or non-human</u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.</span></strong> <strong><u>To consider white supremacy as essential to American social formation, facilitates a discussion of modalities through which this material logic of violence overdetemines the social, political, economic, and cultural structures that compose American globality</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and constitute the common sense that is organic </span><strong><u>to its ordering</u></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span></strong></span><br />
<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Framework: Who provides the best methodology to challenge White Supremacy in the historical construction of citizenship.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Advocacy: We affirm the politizen as a political disruption of the whiteness and white supremacy inherent in American citizenship.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Grant Farred professor of cultural studies at Cornell, in 2007, argues “<u>the politizen is a figure whose name and whose acts mark the limits of citizenship.” The politizen is both inside and outside of citizenship; it is both inside and outside the resolution. The politizen recognizes “it is always only the political crisis that separates the citizen from the not-citizen</u>…<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Its very name, </span><u>&quot;politizen,&quot;</u> then, <u>compels us to engage repeatedly with the politics of citizenship, with the often brutal delimitations of citizenship. The politizen is a politizen because it is… never, afforded the full rights of citizenship—the politizen is the response to what it is denied, because of race or ethnicity, as citizen</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">… every instance of the citizen is simultaneously a &quot;document&quot; of the politizen's (often repeated) struggle against its disenfranchisement</span></span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn32">[32</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. </span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The politizen is what Lee and I can do from our position. As debaters and as Americans of color, we are located on the outsider of the inside. It is being legal and illegal simultaneously. The politizen must be unpredictable within the political because that is “its singular advantage: the citizen never knows, can never know, what stirs the politizen into life; neither the citizen nor the state is ever sure if, or when, the politizen will erupt into the political. The politizen's lack of &quot;political characteristics,&quot; organization, party structure, trade union membership, constitutes its signal advantage: it is the political actor that disrupts the political and then retreats into, if not its &quot;foreignness,&quot; then certainly its circumscribed citizenship</span><a class="wiki_link" href="Fullerton%20%20%20%20%20Marvin%20Carter%20%26%20Lee%20Thach%20Aff.html#_ftn33">[33</a>]<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">The politizen is contingent in its relation to the citizen as it is the embodiment of disparities and racialization that allows it to negate the whiteness that citizenship affirms. The politizen is geographically displaced, foreign to their ancestry as well as foreign intruders in their home, and therefore escape the binaries of inside and outside, as they are the outsiders in the inside. We are surplus to citizenship, as opposed to the constituents of citizenship, embodying the part that has no part. We are the Americans who cannot be American. If to be an American is predicated in whiteness and White Supremacy, then a politizen is a direct challenge to White Supremacy through the embodiment of partial rights, rights that can be lifted at any moment, that builds the everyday praxis of resistance.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">FARRED, in 2k7, explains…</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">There is, as the moment of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon demonstrates, nothing that &quot;can be made simple&quot; about </span><strong><u>the politizen</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">because it</span> <strong><u>always,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and only,</span> <strong><u>operates, in its intimacy with the citizen</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The politizen must be thought in its proximate relation to the citizen, as the Lebanese Australian in Lebanon exemplifies: it is</span> <strong><u>the politizen</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">who is</span> <strong><u>refused citizenship</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Cronulla and, albeit reluctantly, belatedly, </span><strong><u>then has—against some public outcry, some calls for it to be abandoned to its necropolitical &quot;fate&quot; in the land of its &quot;nativity&quot;—its citizenship renewed even though it remains a politizen, a &quot;right&quot; that is always contingent.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">The politizen derives from the suspension of citizenship, much like Clichy DuBois if not Cronulla exactly, derives from the politizen's symbolic expulsion from the state. Despite this, however,</span> <strong><u>in precisely the moment that we would expect the politizen not to matter, in the moment of its dislocation from the</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Australian</span> <strong><u>state, in the moment of the politizen's greatest vulnerability</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in the moment when it could be said to matter most that Lebanese Australians do not matter, </span><strong><u>they are, by the force of their own history, by the immensity of the violence that threatens to not only engulf but literally destroy them, they come to—are shown to—matter intensely</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is not simply that the Australian state was not willing to abandon them or that the state reserved for itself alone the right to enact sovereignty over its own politizens. The &quot;rescue&quot; of the Lebanese Australians points to an ideological blindspot: because</span> <strong><u>the politizen is such a new creature of the political, the state has not yet resolved how to deal with the politizen extraterritorially. The</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(un-fully abandoned)</span> <strong><u>politizen is the political unconscious of the citizen</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Nativity is, in Mitropoulos's terms, that &quot;nationalist compact between descendants of the English upper classes and working class Irish.&quot;13 (Haunted as this white citizenship is by the ever-present specter of the aboriginal, the first native, the native colonized, done violence to, and almost exterminated, is still a citizen who does not conform fully to Australian citizenship.) </span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><u>Audible here</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in the incendiary urgings of Alan Jones and the various articulations of the Cronulla five thousand, </span><strong><u>is</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><strong><u>xenophobia</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of Pauline Hanson, the now disgraced leader of the One Nation Party, in her maiden parliamentary speech, Hanson memorably declared: &quot;I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians.&quot; [End Page 153] Through and because of the &quot;white Australia first&quot; imperatives of a Pauline Hanson, now infamously an ex-convict, </span><strong><u>the politizen is made to conceive of itself as a political contradiction, of inhabiting the political between the impossibility of return</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—to Lebanon or any other part of the Middle East—</span><strong><u>and the impossibility of citizenship</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><strong><u>Enfranchised, but without rights, the</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Lebanese </span><strong><u>politizen is located at the outside of the inside, which also means that it understands that there is really no outside</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (no outside of Australia, no outside of &quot;Lebanon&quot;) </span><strong><u>and that it has to constantly negotiate this ontological conflict: the thinking of the materiality of</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the Australian here from a figurative Lebanese &quot;there,&quot; </span><strong><u>a &quot;there&quot; that is only partially accessible, only partially thinkable, recoverable in the mundane acts of daily life—what the politizen eats, whom it makes primary community with, how it conducts itself in public, how it prays, how it understands the body in public space, what the restrictions on the body are</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially female Lebanese bodies, and, </span><strong><u>more particularly, in its relation to the &quot;revealed&quot; white</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">Australian </span><strong><u>bodies</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (that are nowhere more evident than at the beach). </span><strong><u>The politizen is compelled into a thinking of the outside, its status as Other, from an inside that partially and in moments of violent crisis fully refuses its presence, that links its presence—its Otherness—to other places, other events</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><strong><u>from which the politizen is not entirely disconnected; the politizen is placed, by virtue of who it is</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, within a &quot;Muslim&quot; or &quot;Lebanese&quot; outside that has long since become constitutive of the Australian inside—the events of 9/11 and Bali, in particular, reiterate how the doubleness of Lebanese &quot;insiderness&quot;—physically inside the Australian suburbs, metaphysically and culturally inside &quot;Lebanon&quot;; </span><strong><u>all this</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, of course, also </span><strong><u>points to a double outsiderness</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">—physically &quot;outside&quot; of Lebanon, biopolitically outside of Australia. </span><strong><u>In this way, the</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Lebanese </span><strong><u>politizen</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Australia </span><strong><u>evacuates the dichotomy between &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; of any political meaning.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6pt;">Nowhere on the Australian sociopolitical landscape is the fiction of &quot;insider/outsider&quot; binary revealed more starkly, or ironically, than in that most famous form of homosocial bonding: mateship. Best translated as absolutely loyalty to your friends, mateship is a name for that close bond that connects, say, surfers on a particular beach to each other, which sees men engrave tattoos with their postal codes (as happened widely in the aftermath of Cronulla) on their bodies to mark [End Page 154] their loyalty to their mates and their place. However, as an &quot;autoimmune&quot; construction of community, mateship rests upon a loyalty to the self and those other selves that is necessarily in an antagonistic relation to the Other/s, to those who may be white but are not your mates or to those who are not white. &quot;Not white, Not welcome at Cronulla&quot; is about as reductive as mateship gets. But Cronulla was not without its twists in the politics of mateship. While, as was to be expected, white supremacists supported Cronulla residents, what is more telling is how that articulation of mateship was extended, and racially complicated, in the event of Cronulla and Maroubra. The Pacific Islanders, ordinarily no friends of the &quot;Bra Boys&quot; (the white Maroubra male community), supported the white suburban boys against the &quot;Lebs.&quot; Although theirs is not by any means a secure form of citizenship, the Pacific Islanders are &quot;immigrants&quot; of longer standing—they are not presumed to be Muslim, they have no links to the Bali bombings—so they made common cause with the Bra Boys. This produced a strangely complicated racial calculus: for the Pacific Islanders, long considered racially other by white Australians, the enemy of the enemy made of the enemy a friend, if only for that moment of Cronulla/Maroubra. / It is telling that white Australian women were involved in the attack on the Lebanese community in the event of Cronulla. They were, through this act, articulating that they were not only bodies over which the white heterosexual nation was fighting the politizen. White Australian women from Cronulla were not simply figured as those killed in Bali, they were not only victims, they too were capable of fighting for the Anglo-Celtic nation, capable of engaging in violent &quot;retaliation&quot;—for Bali, for the white natural imaginary—against the Lebanese. White Australian women took their place as citizens against the &quot;foreigners.&quot; Mateship is, in the face of the threat of the politizen, reconceived, feminized, forged into a distinct re-articulation of the heterosexual white Australian nation. / For their part, the Lebanese have a reminiscent form of mateship: &quot;me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against the world&quot; goes the proverb in the Lebanese community. The Leb is, in this ironic but politically salient way, archetypically Australian: absolute loyalty to kind, except it is distinguished by race or &quot;national&quot; affiliation; to be Lebanese is, inveterately, not to be Australian. Leb [End Page 155] mateship, however, does not constitute the multiculturalizing of this key Australian sociopolitical phenomenon. Represented as out of place in the place where they live, they turn, in the event, to that form of political community that is at the core of local values, which are also transnational and even, we might say, transcultural: is there anything more Australian than being loyal to your mates, even if that means resorting to violence? Or, is violence absolutely constitutive to mateship and so inevitable in the &quot;clash of mateships,&quot; in the event of Cronulla that produced its immediate aftermath, and equivalent, in Maroubra, the event(s) that made an Australian &quot;eleven,&quot; an eleven unthinkable without the spectered presence of international events? / In the event, the politizen reveals the unsustainable contradiction of its condition of citizenship; in the moment that it is denied its rights as citizen, it is held to the normative standards of citizenship without being granted any of the concomitant rights. Following the violence it inaugurated in Cronulla, Maroubra, Brighton-le-Sands, Rockdale, Woolooware, and Tempe, &quot;youths of Middle Eastern background . . . out for revenge, which included vandalizing more than 100 cars at Maroubra,&quot;14 the home of the infamous &quot;Bra Boys,&quot; the alpha males of aggressive white Sydney masculinity, there was widespread condemnation of the Lebanese community. The Australian was at the forefront of these denunciations, which included everything from charges that &quot;a shadowy tyranny of ethnic gangs&quot; hangs &quot;over the political establishment&quot;15 to its support for the New South Wales opposition leader Peter Debnam's hyperbolic onslaught against the Lebanese community and the political tenor of Sydney—and statewide—politics: &quot;Mr Debnam said that the Government was too 'politically correct' to act against ethnic gangs. 'The community wants these people locked up and I'm going to keep raising the issue every day until those couple of hundred Middle Eastern thugs are behind bars.'&quot;16</span> <strong><u>The politizen reveals the limits, the biopolitically grave limits, of those who have rights but have no rights. The politizen reveals,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">if you will,</span> <strong><u>the gap between the Law—which grants the rights—and the sovereign—who determines which rights can be enacted</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. The politizen is compelled, in this way, to act within the terms of the Schmittian nomos: under the order of the sovereign. </span><strong><u>The politizen is likely to run afoul of both the Law and the sovereign, reduced from precarious citizen—the raced citizen who owes its citizenship to the &quot;hospitality&quot; of the white</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> [End Page 156]</span> <strong><u>host—to the, at once and alternately, vulnerable and aggressive politizen</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. For this reason, </span><strong><u>the politizen might be properly conceived of as</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the Rancièrean </span><strong><u>subject of the political because, in the moment of the crisis within the nation, the status of the erstwhile citizen is revealed as</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> what Rancière terms </span><strong><u>the &quot;surplus subject of politics</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.&quot; In the Australian and the French state, </span><strong><u>the politizen reveals itself as enfranchised without ever constituting more than the part that has no part.</u></strong> </span><br />

 <strong>The historical production of racialization has been one of gendering the racialized body in order to be submissive to the white citizen, so a historical analysis of gendering must take into consideration into the construct of the white citizen that perpetuates the gendering process onto racialized bodies. For example, the chinese exclusion act was based on the gendering of chinese males in order to subordinate them into working “feminized’ jobs</strong><br />

Racialization along the legal axis of definitions of citizenship has…”masculinity” whose racialization is the material trace of the history of this “gendering.”<br />
<strong>It is this form of racialization that has stabilized the feminine in the immigrant body as well as in the national space, where the territory of the United States has come to represent the ‘white mother,’ who in turn gets raped by the colored immigrant</strong><br />

AMNESTY AFF - Aff @ Kentucky Rd 1<br />
<br />
We are here for those that the resolution has ignored. We are here because we too, have benefitted from the invisible labor of undocumented immigrants. <br />
They bring us food to the dinner table by spending 12 hours a day 7 days a week picking grapes and strawberries in 90 degree humidity. They are what keep the floors on which we stand clean. They make our beds in our hotel rooms; they give us the luxury of never having to worry about whether we’ve cleaned the room or tipped them enough. And the only response they get is that is that when we can’t find our iPod in our room, it’s because the maids must have taken it. <br />
They work these jobs so that we don’t have to; they work these jobs because we don’t want to; they work these jobs even though we don’t want them. They are demonized, seen as diseased, alien, gang members, leaches. They bare the brunt of both stealing our jobs and being lazy. They can’t in the middle of a construction job say, “I’m undocumented” without fear of not just being deported, but of being physically brutalized for stealing American jobs, as if jobs are entitled only to Americans. <br />
<span style="color: #333333;">America political over looks undocs currently. Status quo doesn’t see these bodies as such an important part of our lives within America. The current rhetoric from most discourse surrounding immigrants devastates and destroys these people and their culture, some may call this an American tragedy, yet we call it a LACK of social justice. Often times many are quick to push away from the real discussion, the discussion about the undocumented bodies. The resolution actively was strategically designed and made to push these bodies out of the topic, push them to the point of a nihilistic self loathing, push them into invisibility, push them into a force us and them dichotomy where we actively move to destroy them as the other, push them into a body that can be used in terms of its utility, we push away love, we push away social justice for the narcissistic solipsistic personal politics that destroys the potential for political and human agency. Stop pushing them into the fearful unseen work as part of a larger project to marginalize these bodies due the strains of hetro white capitalistic patriarchy.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Undocumented immigrants live in a state of constant fear. Imagine having to live knowing that you can’t go to the emergency room, imagine having to choose between dying or being deported. Imagine having to live knowing you cannot go to the police because you are as much of a criminal as the guy breaking into your house. Imagine being an undocumented debater, having to go to airports with a high school ID, spending your whole college career telling airport security that you’re seventeen and just going to debate camp, with the sinking feeling that maybe this time ICE will get you. <br />
But why is it that, there are 12 million undocumented people in the United States in the first place? Do you think it’s easy to just leave the place the you love, where your family lives, your friends, your culture, your very heritage and history? <br />
<span style="color: #333333;">People don’t want to leave their homes and families and lives just for the sake of saying I want to go to America today, NO, it’s a larger problem with push pull factors, were we constantly damage other countries and promises dreams of false hope into the racialized subject just to control and manipulate them as tools for production. Many of these people are livin in utter misery man,… you know…. we shouldn’t romantize poverty, we shouldn’t scapegoat these people, we shouldn’t objectify these people, we shouldn’t continue to label a minority of our population that is ranging in the millions and sustains the privileges that we have yet to even realize. Where is the social justice in that! Malcolm X didn’t run from politics, he actively engaged it. Look, we can wish away change; we need start stand in solidiary with real solutions to change the system, to shift how we engage the world. In numbers many walked for change, maybe our massive can grow the legs to walk for change to shift the miserable conditions that have been placed on the unseen in this county. This argument is not to be read like that system will bring us peace, but tell me, how can you look at undocs and say we affirm your labour or you, WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR THEM, the answer is nothing… its says stay in your place in society, remain in a place of horror and fear, violence.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
From NAFTA in which corporations were given free reign to pollute the rivers of northern Mexico in maciladoras, where US agricultural subsidies unfairly outcompete Mexican farms, and then our immigration policy set up a visa system that costs hundreds of dollars and waiting periods that a poor family could never in their dreams afford. <br />
Yet, when we invade and destroy countries like Vietnam, carpet bombing the country and setting villages on fire, is when we accept immigrants who come from an upper middle class have the ability to migrate over here on ‘political asylum’. Like Lee’s mom, who was able to come to this country because she no longer lived in a country that she could call home, but still had the money and education to come here as a refugee. Mexican migrants on the other hand cannot come because we have created a classist system in which ‘abject poverty’ that is caused by the US isn’t a viable reason for migration, as if only the conditions of war caused by the United States are legitimate reasons to move. <br />
<span style="color: #333333;">These people actually live social justice… they want amnesty and they deserve it. How could this community over look the more ravaged of bodies ignored by the resolution? They don’t come to the US because they want to get away from everything… The Exception is not why the majority gives acceptance to the virtual slave conditions they live in. Often they do it because they are out of options at home, and they think this is going to be a better option and they LIVE IT and now its’ not better yet, now they are stuck and NOW undocs are used against them to put them in terrible conditions and THEY LIVE IN TERROR! In debate we don’t think fear, risks actually life, these people can’t go to the police just like how blacks cant see police helping their communities only corrupting it like mack trucks, these undocs can’t even go to the emergency and clog it but because of fear of deportation, just like the millions of racialized subjects that can’t get access to health care, many of these undocs cant get access to schooling and the benefits of engaging in that educational system that is vital to move up in the Myth of America, These peoples fear the chance of being visibility seen for the fear of violence from ICE or deportation, rendered invisible for live in America is there ONLY option. Most of these undoc immigrants wonder if they will lose everything one day and the undocs don’t think for a second that those in power will help them BECAUSE POLITICS SEES THEM AS FERAL, RURAL, SAVAGE, UNCIVILIZED, FOREIGN, DISLOYAL, IMMANENT AND THREATING JUST LIKE THE DEPICTIONS FROM SLAVERY WITH THE IMAGES OF THE PICKANINNY. The undocs give to the rest of our lives and the American citizens live on the benefits of undoc peoples. This is violence when they are CHEATED AND LIVED OFF THEIR LABOUR FOR THE COMFORT OF THE ELITE!!</span><br />
That is why we advocate that citizens should show solidarity for amnesty and be the Harriet Tubman’s of immigration until we receive amnesty. <br />
<span style="color: #333333;">DEMAND CHANGE! And amnesty in mass then there could happen to be change, but because we can scapegoat and buy the conservative kool-aid, that means that amnesty is radical and could never happen, and the uS has done this before and no nuclear war happened and no crazy genocide or backlash, Out of the 9billions things Reagan did wrong the one move he probably did correct was give amnesty to those that needed it. Some or most don’t know the undocs and know the situation to care about something… most don’t care till we know the situation and this process that could happen and they deserve a right to not feel hunted and be hunted. If debate can’t say that with a fear to appealing to the system and mingling with the enemies and then what are we doing with debate. Debate is just hating things and then what fucking good is that. How is the world going to get better because we hated, amnesty; look amnesty is not perfect and wont fix all the problems in the world we get that however this is a critical move for those bodies that are rendered invisible. Come on these are good people and they deserve an actually good chance.. Social justice is not ICE putting rounding up people and dumping them into prisons, and we call it ICE because its fucking cold and terrible. And this is synonym for killing people putting them on ICE.</span><br />
As Angela Davis once said, 'At its best, social justice activity is about education,' Davis sai 'Is justice, by definition, confined to the realm of the law? As Dr. Martin Luther King realized, we must sometimes break the law in order to be more effective advocates for justice.' <br />
And in light of us not being policy makers but still advocating for a policy that will give amnesty to undocumented immigrants, we must do our part in breaking an unjust law, of giving job opportunities, educational opportunities, of secretly harboring them into this debate activity. <br />
Because if we are going to have debate in which we never question our privileges over others, our roles as the oppressed as well as oppressors, we will only continue a form of debate that the resolution currently represents, one of exclusion, marginalization, of silencing the voice of the oppressed to continue the same policies of domination. <br />
As bell hooks argues, “If we want a beloved community, we must stand for justice, have recognition for difference without attaching difference to privilege.” Because our goal at the end of the day is to create a debate community that values not the line by line, or impact outweighs, but simply, love.<br />

<br />
The resolution has sanitized immigration discourse and debate by only addressing visa policy in a dispassionate positivist framework, it functions as an unmarked center of cultural power that obscures critical discussions of immigration. <br />
<br />
It enacts this power by ignoring and rendering irrelevant historical instances of how:<br />
Chattel slavery and the Middle Passage served as the first forced immigration policy,<br />
The genocide and land displacement of Native Americans as the first emigration policy, <br />
The temporary suspension of Japanese Americans’ rights in time of war,<br />
The constant second class citizenship rendered to women especially of color,<br />
The way whiteness became a strategy that allowed the Irish and model minority to garner racial privilege, <br />
How the topic ignores the fundamental discussion of undocumented residents, <br />
And citizens who are racialized as foreign in their own home.<br />
<br />
Before we can have a policy discussion of visas, we must epistemologically interrogate White Supremacy’s construction of American citizenship in the resolution, as the ideological construction of citizenship is what informs us on which ‘foreigners’ can enter this country, who endangers society, who contributes to the U.S. economy, who should live and who is disposed of. To practice politics without this understanding in debate is to continue politics on an objective disconnected policy paradigm that will recreate state violence.<br />
<br />
<strong>This is why we must critically engage with the limits of American citizenship, as these examples of racialized subjects embody what Grant Farred calls the politizen, arguing that</strong> “<u>the politizen is a figure whose name and whose acts mark the limits of citizenship.”</u> The politizen recognizes <u>“it is always only the political crisis that separates the citizen from the not-citizen</u>…<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Its very name, </span><u>&quot;politizen,&quot;</u> then, <u>compels us to engage repeatedly with the politics of citizenship, with the often brutal delimitations of citizenship. The politizen is a politizen because it is… never, afforded the full rights of citizenship—the politizen is the response to what it is denied, because of race or ethnicity, as citizen</u><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">… every instance of the citizen is simultaneously a &quot;document&quot; of the politizen's (often repeated) struggle against its disenfranchisement</span>[<em>[1]]]</em><em>.</em><br />
<br />
<em><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">White Supremacy constantly reformulates the conception of the white citizen in order to neutralize and/or exterminate racialized subjects who cannot fit within the normative confines of American citizenship. </span></strong></em><br />
<em><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dylan Rodriguez explains in 2007: </span></strong></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Dylan Rodriguez 07, Professor at UC Riverside, in 2007 describes the impact of white supremacy that US immigration history so clearly demonstrates</span></em>[2]]], <br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Variable, overlapping, and mutually constituting</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> white supremacist regimes have</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">in fact</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">been fundamental to the formation</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">and movements</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">of the United States, from racial chattel slavery and frontier genocide to recent and current modes of neoliberal land displacement and warfare</span>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">Without exception, these regimes have been differently entangled with the state’s changing paradigms, strategies, and technologies of human incarceration and punishment ( to follow the prior examples: the plantation, the reservation, the neoliberal sweatshop, and the domestic-to-global prison). The historical nature of these entanglements is widely acknowledged, although explanations of the structuring relations of force tend to either isolate or historically compartmentalize the complexities of historical white supremacy<strong><u>.</u></strong> For the theoretical purposes of this essay</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">, </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">white supremacy maybe understood as a logic of social organization that produces regimented, institutionalized, and militarized conceptions of hierarchized “human” difference, enforced through</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">coercions and</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">violences that are structured by genocidal possibility</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">(including physical extermination</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">a</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">nd curtailment of people’s collective capacities to socially, culturally, or biologically reproduce).</span> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">As a historical vernacular and philosophical apparatus of domination,</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">white supremacy is</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">simultaneously</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">premised on</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">and consistently innovating</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">universalized conceptions of the white “human”</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;"> vis-à-vis the rigorous production,penal discipline</span><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">and</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">frequent</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">social, political, and biological </span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">neutralization </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">or <strong><u>extermination of the (non-white) sub-or non-human</u>.</strong> <strong><u>To consider white supremacy as essential to American social formation, facilitates a discussion of modalities through which this material logic of violence overdetemines the social, political, economic, and cultural structures that compose American globality</u></strong></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and constitute the common sense </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">that is organic to its ordering. </span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">American citizenship provides us with the false notion of rights, rights that even when enacted are exempted from racialized subjects, with Hurricane Katrina as a prime example. The USFG knew the levees would break, yet Black people who did not have the means to leave the city were given zero assistance and left stranded to survive the flood, leaving bloated corpses floating in the rotting water in New Orleans. The media portrayed Black people as looting while White people were only ‘finding’ food and supplies. These policies and representations exemplify how the Black body has become criminalized to justify their disposability. </span></strong><br />
Henry Giroux argues in 06, “<u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">The bodies of the Katrina victims</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">could not speak with the same directness to the state of American racist violence but they </span><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">did reveal and shatter the conservative fiction of living in a color-blind society. The bodies of the Katrina victims laid bare the racial and class fault lines that mark an increasingly damaged and withering democracy and revealed the emergence of a new kind of politics, one in which entire populations are now considered disposable, an unnecessary burden on state coffers, and consigned to fend for themselves.</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">At the same time,</span> <u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">what happened in New Orleans</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">also revealed some frightening signposts of those repressive features in American society, demanding that artists, public intellectuals, scholars, and other cultural workers take seriously what Angela Davis insists </span><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">“are very clear signs of . . . impending fascist policies and practices,” which not only construct an imaginary social environment for all of those populations rendered disposable but also exemplify a site and space “where democracy has lost its claims.”</span></u><em>[3]<u>]]</u></em><br />
<br />
<em>The politics of disposability is premised on a falsely inclusive citizen discourse that seeks to appear neutral and open to the Other,</em>|[4]]] similar to the way traditional policy frameworks attempt to commodify us by making us assimilate to a white performance that sanitizes the racial norms of debate under the veil of openness. It is to say “we allow you to exist in the world if you have predictable stable plan on our grounds” this predictability is white supremacist in nature because of the surveillance premised on the white gazes ability to know our existence to enact extermination .<br />
<br />
The managerial politics of gentrification in New Orleans, in which Black people lived in areas that were prone to urban decay and natural disaster, is the same way debaters are pushed into a limited form of traditional debate that is premised on self-negation of our cultural identity through roleplaying the oppressor.<br />
<br />
Shireen M. Roshanravan explains in 2009, “<u>The separation of whiteness from European ethnicity exposes the empty constitution of white racial identity that</u>, <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">in turn</span>, <u>facilitates its conflation with an all-inclusive “America.” According to this logic, those who were of European origin possessed ethnicities amenable to “American” (read: white) ideals, while those with national origins racialized as non-white would forever be labeled foreign and incapable of assimilation</u> (<a name="b24-text"></a>, 7–8). <u>If white is a racial prerequisite for citizenship,</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">and one’s national origins are racialized as non-white</span><u>, then becoming “American” is an impossible task.</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Hailed as a color-blind meritocracy,</span> <u>this white-supremacist America</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">nevertheless</span> <u>denies racial barriers to national inclusion. The popular discourse that anyone can achieve the “American Dream” so long as they work hard seduces immigrants of color to negate their racial-ethnic identity as a means of becoming “American</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">just like everybody else.”</span> <u>The seduction is facilitated by the negative formulation of white racial identity[<em>|</em></u><em>[5]<u>]].” The seduction of American neutrality invites immigrants of color to assimilate, but</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">in order to complete assimilation immigrants</span> <u>must negate the self “becoming non-Mexican Mexicans, non-Indian Indians, non-Korean Koreans,</u> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">and so on.</span> <u>The illusory base of the seduction is evidenced by the fact that one remains “Mexican,” “Korean,” “Indian,” “minority,” or “foreign” even after the processes of negating one’s racial-ethnic self in a mimicry of white/Anglo ways… in a racial context where whiteness is coded as the unmarked norm of society, inclusion in that society may seem less impossible</u>[</em>6]]]<u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">.” </span></u><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This self-negation renders bodies disposable like in the aftermath of the hurricane. The Vietnamese community in Versailles quickly coalesced to rebuild their town after Hurricane Katrina. However, New Orleans majoy Ray Nagin, who was not even aware that the Vietnamese have moved back, exercised his emergency power to open the Chef Menteur landfill for Katrina’s demolition waste a mile away from Versaille’s urban farm site. The landfill was opened through bypassing the community’s input as it was convenient for Waste Management and city officials to sidestep any opposition. Katrina’s waste includes homes that have been soaked for days in toxic water containing arsenic and sulfide gas, with no requirements for air, soil, or groundwater contamination.</span></strong><em>[7]]]</em><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"> </span><br />
<em>Citizenship is then not the legal institution that fiats our rights as Versaille has shown. Citizenship is “the debates, interpretations, and professed needs and interests that surround legal statutes and the social practices to which these are linked[[</em>[8]]].” It is “a marker of identity” that “signals &quot;belonging&quot; and &quot;insider-status&quot; in a privileged way[[<em>|[9]]]</em><em>.” Debates on citizenship tell us “what it means to be an American[[</em>[10]]]”. According to <span class="verdana">Jonathan Weinberg, of the </span>Michigan Law Review, in 2009, “There is no such thing as a U.S. immigrant <a name="HIT_2"></a><a name="ORIGHIT_2"></a><span class="hit">visa</span> that does not carry with it the promise of <a name="HIT_3"></a><a name="ORIGHIT_3"></a><span class="hit">citizenship</span>[[<em>[11]]]</em><em><span class="hit">.”</span> But the visa cannot make an American out of the foreign other. As Bill Ong Hing argues, when the US inevitably cycles through a nativist period, even the 14th Amendment cannot protect the targets of “de-Americanization[[</em>12]]].” “The de-Americanization process can reinvent itself generation after generation… it is a nativism cloaked in a Eurocentric sense of America that combines hate and racial profiling[[<em>[13]]]</em><em>.”</em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">We become surplus to citizenship, as opposed to the constitutions of citizenship, embodying the part that has no part. We are the Americans who cannot be American. To be an American is predicated in whiteness and White Supremacy. A politizen is a direct challenge to White Supremacy through the embodiment of partial rights, rights that can be lifted at any moment, which critically builds everyday praxis of resistance. As it is the moments of our greatest oppression, in which the levees break in the absence of any government response, where ones homes becomes flooded by thousands of other demolished homes, which the politizen erupts into the political.</span></em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;">Grant Farred explains:</span></em><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">“There is, as the moment of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon demonstrates, nothing that &quot;can be made simple&quot; about </span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">the politizen</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">because it</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">always</span>,</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">and only,</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">operates, in its intimacy with the citizen</span></u></strong>.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The politizen must be thought in its proximate relation to the citizen, as the Lebanese Australian in Lebanon exemplifies</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">: it is</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">the politizen</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">who is</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">refused citizenship</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in Cronulla </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">and, albeit reluctantly, belatedly,</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">then has—against some public outcry, some calls for it to be abandoned to its necropolitical &quot;fate&quot; in the land of its &quot;nativity&quot;—its citizenship renewed even though it remains a politizen, a &quot;right&quot; that is always contingent</span>.</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">The politizen derives from the suspension of citizenship, much like Clichy DuBois if not Cronulla exactly, derives from the politizen's symbolic expulsion from the state. Despite this, however,</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">in precisely the moment that we would expect the politizen not to matter, in the moment of its dislocation from the</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Australian</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">state, in the moment of the politizen's greatest vulnerability</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in the moment when it could be said to matter most that Lebanese Australians do not matter</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">, <strong><u>they are, by the force of their own history, by the immensity of the violence that threatens to not only engulf but literally destroy them, they come to—are shown to—matter intensely</u></strong></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. It is not simply that the Australian state was not willing to abandon them or that the state reserved for itself alone the right to enact sovereignty over its own politizens. The &quot;rescue&quot; of the Lebanese Australians points to an ideological blindspot: </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">because</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">the politizen is such a new creature of the</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">political, the state has not yet resolved how to deal with the politizen extraterritorially. The</span></u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">(un-fully abandoned)</span> <strong><u><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">politizen is the political unconscious of the citizen</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.”</span></em>[14]]] <br />
<br />
<strong>Therefore our,</strong><br />
<strong>Framework:</strong> <strong>Who provides the best methodology to challenge the logic of domination in construction of citizenship.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Advocacy:</strong> <strong>We affirm the politizen as a political disruption of the imperialist heteronormative white supremacist capitalist patriarchy embedded in American citizenship.</strong><br />
<br />
bell hooks reminds us that the interlocking political systems that overdetermine social relations in society need to be fought against in order to overthrow the logic of domination that allows for their existence, the politizen enables this site for possibility <br />
<br />
To affirm the politizen is to no longer view the law and citizenship as the sole means of political empowerment and representation, as American citizenship is rendered meaningless for racialized subjects who have their citizenship lifted from them or used against them. The politizen is a critical form of citizenship, in which Lee and I affirm as racialized subjects who, though are considered ‘citizens’ have had to use non-juridical politics for mere survival in the face of White Supremacy. As debaters and Americans of color, we are the outsiders in the inside. It is being legal and illegal simultaneously. It is to know the privilege of being American, and to know that we don’t always have the privilege to be American.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">It is this methodology that the Vietnamese community in Versaille have practiced. Residents protested at City Hall and crowded public hearings. Legal battles were waged at the state and federal level. Realizing that the legal battle could not be won, the community staged protests, chanting in English and Vietnamese, at the landfill itself. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Father Vien Nguyen, one of the leaders of the protest explained, “We were always quiet, never protested, never raise our voices. We basically stayed below the radar screen.” This was a matter of survival in an American society that equated recent Vietnamese immigrants with the Viet Cong. The ability to become invisible, to retreat into one’s circumscribed citizenship, is needed as a means of survival. As Father Vien Nguyen reflects on the protests against the landfill, “Now, no one would dare speak about rebuilding New Orleans without mentioning our community, because they know we are back. They know we are here”[[<em>[15]]]</em> </span><br />
<em><span style="font-size: 11pt; margin-bottom: 7.5pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 6pt;">This form of praxis of sporadically erupting into the political ruptures the inside and out, in which Vietnam is no longer home, yet America is refused as a home. </span></em><br />

<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">Configured as <u>the politizen</u>, the Lebanese <u>cannot be said to possess a nationality that is commensurate with</u> an Australian <u>citizenship or</u> an Australian &quot;<u>nationality.&quot;</u> What Cronulla made evident, arguably more than anything else, was that <u>the multicultural nation recognizes Anglo</u>-Celtic <u>nativity as the only true &quot;nativity,&quot; and, consequently, as the only legitimate form of citizenship</u>.

<em><span style="font-size: 8.0pt;">“Vietnamese Americans dream of a new urban farm in New Orleans but fear post-Katrina environmental hazards.</span><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Urban farming was key to helping the Vietnamese American community of about 20,000 become among the first to return to flood-ravaged homes and restart their lives after Katrina, with little assistance from government officials. They immediately planted small gardens, even outside FEMA trailers housed on a large vacant lot before moving back into their own homes. It took many months for a grocery store to reopen anywhere nearby, but urban farming provided them sustenance along with a sense of calm and cultural connection in trying times.[[</span></u></strong></em>[16]<u><strong>]]”</strong></u><br />

<em>This eruption into the political is always unpredictable in relation to the state control of citizenship; in the midst of the USFG failure to rebuild New Orleans, the Vietnamese community’s rebuilding of Versailles constitute new social practices that are not beholden to the predictable limits of the state in the times of political crisis. The politizen’s political unpredictability is “its singular advantage: the citizen never knows, can never know, what stirs the politizen into life; neither the citizen nor the state is ever sure if, or when, the politizen will erupt into the political. The politizen's lack of &quot;political characteristics,&quot; organization, party structure, trade union membership, constitutes its signal advantage: it is the political actor that disrupts the political and then retreats into, if not its &quot;foreignness,&quot; then certainly its circumscribed citizenship</em><br />
