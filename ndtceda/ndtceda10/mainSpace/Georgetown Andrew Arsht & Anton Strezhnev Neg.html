The United States federal district courts should provide unconditional immigration relief to all individuals filing civil claims under Section 1595 of Title 18 of US code. All benefits currently provided for T visas for criminal prosecution will be provided to Section 1595 civil plaintiffs. All necessary levels of the United States federal government will comply with these determinations. Successful plaintiffs in Section 1595 civil actions will receive treble damages, as well as any and all assets seized from defendants and additional tortfeasers. Both asset seizure and treble damages will be awarded under an implied right of action derived interpretively from TVPA provisions.<br />

TEMP VISA CP – 1NC<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should establish a scholarship for foreign students who pursue graduate studies in Science, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics at accredited U.S. universities. The United States federal government should create a temporary visa, not subject to any numerical limitation, that allows recipients of an advanced degree from a US university to work in the United States for up to six years after their graduation. Change in employers or startup of a new business will not negatively affect the terms of this visa. The certification process should be modeled off the employment-based visas.<br />
