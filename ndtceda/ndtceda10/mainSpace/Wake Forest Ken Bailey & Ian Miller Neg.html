<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">First, limits – there are thousands of industries that the aff could choose to exempt – that means they could pick the industry of the week and find some small reason that industry is good – the neg could never keep up, this puts us at a massive structural disadvantage </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">Second, ground – allowing the aff to offer exemptions rather than actually increasing the cap or eligibility lets the aff circumvent the core of the topic since they only make minor modifications to who actually gets visas, they don’t have to make any actual change to the visa process – this means we can never get generic links to the heart of the literature on the visa process </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 13pt;">T has to be a voting issue – otherwise the aff would win every round on a new, non-topical aff – your ballot sets a precedent for what the community considers topical </span><br />
