<br />
<strong>As the affirmative has pointed out, the US finds itself locked within a “war for talent”, for those few best and brightest that must be snatched up from foreign countries. Recently, the president of Google says that a top performing engineer worth 300 times as much as an average one . Bill Gates said “if it weren't for 20 key people, Microsoft wouldn't be the company it is today.” So what are we to do? The affirmative's answer is clear: it's all the more urgent that we do whatever necessary to attract those precious few. Yet we can see this logic at work everywhere today, with executives who earn hundreds or thousands of times the salary of their workers, with the deprivation of the third world to feed the US, or – as is only rational – in Google paying that top-performing engineer 300 times as much as the lowly engineers she's able to replace. This locks in a laissez fair system in which values, equality, social welfare are replaced with a hyper-meritocracy.</strong><br />

<strong>Immigrant entrepreneurs are used to justify the individualist ethic which masks oppression. The success stories of a privileged few entrepeneurs are used to silence dissent on part of exploited immigrant communities – this is excacerbated by the spread of the entrepreneurial model cited in your Saxenian evidence</strong><br />

&quot;As both oppressed and oppressors...devastation our system produces.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Looking back in US history, we can this logic exemplified in one other period: The Great Depression. Politicians – serving a laissez fair vision of capitalism, and eliminating any social safety net or ideals of equality of justice in the name of competition – becomes solely obsessed with coming out on top in the global economy. This schizophrenic drive corrupts economic policy and ensures that it fails.</strong><br />

I have always been fascinated by the complexity of movement when Andy gets out of the squad van – that ungainly transit across the passenger seat through the near side door – the overlay of his knees in the metal door flank – the conjunction of the illuminized gutter trim with the volume of his thighs – the crashing of his left breast by the door frame and its self extension as he continues to rise – the movement of his left hand across the chromium trim of the right head lamp assembly – the movements distorted in the projecting catapults of the bonnet – the juckt and drake of his pubis as he sits in the drivers seat – the soft pressure of his thighs against the rim of the steering wheel –<br />
Ahh… The key image in the 20th century, the man in the motor car, it sums up everything – the elements of speed, drama, aggression, the junction of advertising and consumer goods, the technological landscape, the sense of violence and desire, power and energy, the shared experience of moving together through an elaborately signaled landscape.<br />

 <span style="margin-right: -0.75pt; page-break-before: always;">While the affirmative preaches about queering the public and inclusion, they are ignorant as to the histories of that movement. Queer individuals have long struggled under the banner of inclusion and openness, accepting to everyone – from the middle-class, white, male queen, to the middle-class, white, female butch. For people of color there has been no “gay community,” for whom black men where nothing but big Black dicks, sexual objects for consumption. This total ignorance of the role of race only reproduces structures of domination and turns the aff.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-right: -0.75pt;">This is not just as link of omission that can be permed away – the 1AC proved the affirmative falls in the line of gay rights struggles which turn a blind eye towards race, and any permutation will only be assimilation of black perspectives and a sidelining of black issues.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="page-break-before: always;">That they appeal to queer theory rather than lesbian and gay issues is no better. In fact, queer theory universalizes queer experience and creates a queer subject – one who is white, middle-class, and typically male. Only quaring public address – which recognizes the intersection of class, race, gender, and sexuality can overcome these problems.</span><br />

 <strong>We read a 1NC (listed below) as a campy performance (a form/content argument, that queer politics should be manifested in form of presentation). Will add more explanation later. Have to go to octos now.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>T-The Topic</u></strong><br />
A. Definition-The Topic is “ A word used to pretend that a conversation has a point.”<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=topic" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=topic</a><br />
B. Violation- The affirmative team affirms the topic. That’s untopical.<br />
C. Standards<br />
1. Education- Having only one topic for discussion means we can’t learn about other stuff. That seems pretty important. One kind of education is genocidal.<br />
2. Fairness- It is only fair to let me say whatever I want. If you don’t Spanos says that genocidal.<br />
3. Ground- Critical teams don’t want to talk about the topic, so what do they do? There are a lot of worthless shit I’d like to talk about outside of immigration. Ground rights are like Native American stuff, and Churchill says that’s genocidal.<br />
D. Voters for Anti-Jurisdiction. Duh, topic is untopical so its way outside your jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>B-Spec</u></strong><br />
A. Violation: The 1AC does not spec their beneficiary.<br />
There are multiple different kinds<br />
<strong>Thomas in 2009</strong><br />
All people have different beneficiaries that tailor to specific needs. Pimps, Sugar Daddies , and Skip Eno are centered around sexual romps. Grandpa’s and DILFs are clearly the best ones because they are nice but have tons of money. There are big ass companies that have tons of money but never give it out to anyone because they’d rather buy jet planes.<br />
B. Reason to Prefer<br />
1. Ground- We can’t PIC out of your beneficiary.<br />
2. Education- I can’t find me a new papi without knowing who pays your bills<br />
Voter for the Reasons above<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Immi-gay-tion PIC</u></strong><br />
We affirm the entirety of the 1AC but without the word Immigration. Instead we offer a fabulous counter advocacy using the word Immi-gay-tion.<br />
Net benefit is pretty super. This has three scenarios<br />
First, is Ponchos.<br />
Ponchos are super ugly and don’t show off anyone’s figure. If big girls have curves, we can’t see them! The colors are usually drab and worn out. No one looks good hoping a fence with a tarp. The term Immi-Gay-tion forces immigrants to dress better and treat every opportunity as a Project Runway catwalk.<br />
Second, More Selena Songs on Glee<br />
Let’s be honest- that show is super white. Just because the Black girl hits every note doesn’t mean they are multicultural. Seriously, the Asian and Black guy just dance. The immi-gay-tion movement would create more cultural diversity leading to better song choice for Fox.<br />
Third, The Creation of the Gay Nation<br />
If we label immigrants as gay, then they will simply follow along with those guidelines. This means get Will &amp; Grace back on the air and make Monday Night Football clothing optional. Seriously, the term immi-gay-tion is way more faaaaabulous!<br />

<strong><u>DADT Politics</u></strong><br />

“That backlash will express itself…ambassadorship to a sunny Caribbean isle.”<br />
<strong>Immigration is a win for the democrats – makes the republicans look unreasonable</strong><br />
<strong>Hernandez 7/1/10</strong> (Daisy, “Obama Passes the Buck on Immigration, Then Lectures Everybody”) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://colorlines.com/archives/2010/07/obama_on_immigration.html" rel="nofollow">http://colorlines.com/archives/2010/07/obama_on_immigration.html</a><br />

<h1 id="toc8"><a name="Sheherazade don’t need no visa"></a><span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><u><span style="font-size: 120%;">Sheherazade don’t need no visa</span></u></span></h1>
 <br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Sheherazade don’t need no visa.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Here is your damn paperwork … I am a dual national you bloody idiot … Yet when a woman unveils … tongues start wagging … Which part of your tongue do I need to chop off? How do you know who I really am?</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The erotic/exotic harem girl, the downtrodden peasant, veiled, illiterate, miserable, squatting in the field- the Intifada woman throwing rocks in the street </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">…What is the visa required to move in and out of the bodies of the self? A signifier? A stamp like the ones used to get in bars? A ticket? A tattoo? A rainbow flag? And how is alien-ness determined? Whether you are a resident or documented one?</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Checkpoint– Beirut -switch papers/codes/languages </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Checkpoint – the Green Line - switch papers/codes/languages </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Have you been with Moslems? Why do you live with those animals? Maybe you are a collaborator. Maybe you are fucking them. Pull them over and interrogate them … interrogate them all till no question unresolved without asking a question at all</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Checkpoint – U.S. immigration officers – Logan airport in Boston, trans-national San Antonio, holiday in Cambodia - switch papers/codes/languages … </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Where do you think you are going? Get into that room with your bags … </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">My partner and I were locked in this room for one-and-a-half hours being interrogated as to where we were from, what we did, where we got our papers, why we were here, if we were really married, whether we slept together or not, what movies we watched, what our politics were, how our genitals look and interact.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">What happens when a penis enters the meatus of an-other</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Papers/codes/flows</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">All these crossings … under barbed wire, under barbed tongues, striated, under fire lungs, under the cover of darkness, under the moon, under the beating sun, passing…</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">… as white? - switch papers/codes/languages/flows/clothes – </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">brush your shoulders off…</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">We are at the Mexican/U.S. border in San Diego with two white friends in the front and Margarita and I sitting in the back and then, &quot;Are you sure you are all U.S. citizens?”</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">As American? - switch papers/codes/languages/flows/clothes/positions</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">And it's answering .. questions asking where I am from – I don't seem American – I have an accent they can't quite place. My nose just a little too long– my attitudes just a little &quot;radical&quot; and subversive – and that name of mine, what country is that from?</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">As patriotic? - switch </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">As straight? - sans - papers/codes/languages – trans – flows/codes/roads – starting points – erode, implode, switch explode, switch erode – decay just as dangerous if not more, their veil </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">And it is in class at the university – and all of this at the beginning of the discussion of compulsory heterosexuality and its assumptions …</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">As queer? switch papers/codes/languages </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">When I ask if she means the queer organization, she exhales and smiles and says, &quot;I was scared to mention it to you…&quot;</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">So this is an unveiling of colonizing frameworks … this is an unveiling of different ways of being and of representing that being … this constant switching of papers, codes, and languages creates whole new forms of epistemic knowledges and how to bring forth these knowledges … And so Sheherazade may or may not have a veil which she may or may not wear, but she only uses it when she wants to, and she stops at no borders but those of her own creation </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">… And, by the way, she don't need no visa …</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">What are we doing here? Better question. What is here? Are we sitting in a classroom in Chicago? Are we in some world constructed to fantasize about the passage of a wonderfully naïve affirmative plan? Our imagined communities are never neutral spaces. We create them in our interpretations and our performances, our productions and projections of the world we desire. There is no globalized system “out-there,” there is always only the here and spaces that we inhabit. The transnational spaces the affirmative attempts to control through visas can never be truly separated from the local spaces they are built upon. Professors Gavin Brown and and Katherine Browne explain… </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Welcome to America.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The home of the brave</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Indigenous Holocaust</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">And the land of the Slaves</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Does America prefer order over justice? People seem equally repulsed and fascinated by the notion of lists … we use them to structure our day, we use them to set agendas… we use them in the most mundane ways, every day, day in and day out, day in and day out.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Let them in, keep them out, let them in, keep them out … reminds you of she loves me, she loves me not, doesn't it? … the lines that separate the types, the categories, the arguments and flows - the papers; real, unreal, surreal, hyper-real, the real flesh and blood human-types that attempt to enter this fine multicultural nation, this nation under God, this nation comprised of resident citizens, resident aliens, illegal aliens, undocumented aliens, and, some say in the corn fields of Nebraska, unidentified aliens…</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">you are left with two choices – to implode, or explode … even if you can't, even if you are at a check point being harassed, even if you are trapped in a dangerous situation…</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">one citizen alien, one resident alien, one visa-ed alien…</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Where are you coming from? What were you doing there? How long did you stay? Where did you go next? What was your business there? …</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">You are told that this is standard procedure … </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">You demand your rights as a U.S. citizen, to be allowed entry back in your country, where all men are created equal under GOD - land of plenty, land of opportunity, of freedom … hear it ringing in your ears as the blood rushes, swirling inchoate like your words ….</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">…You think about the land you just left, the land you sometimes call home. You think about where this places you on the hyphen this time … where does this experience fit in the schema of alien(-)nations … of trans-nations … of &quot;One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&quot; </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">The American ideal is not an umbrella sheltering us all, but a funnel, or a sift designed to filter out that which is different. It purges alterity in order to construct a homogenous population of docile bodies under a double standard of exclusive inclusion and the farce that is American Citizenship[[#_ftn2|[2]]]…</span></strong><br />
