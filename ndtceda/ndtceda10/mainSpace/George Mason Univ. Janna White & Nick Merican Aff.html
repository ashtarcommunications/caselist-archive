Plan Text: The United States federal government should substantially increase the number of H-1B visas by eliminating the current cap on H-1B visas.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: It's the Economy Stupid.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: Innovation/Competition/Education/Growth BAM!<br />
<br />
Current policy of only 65,000 H-1B Visa's clearly restricts college-educated foreign nationals to U.S. Labor Market.<br />

The H-1B visa...the US labor market.<br />
<br />
Restrictive H-1B policy limits the ability and quality of foreign students considering education in America, detering the “best and brightest” and stifling Long-Term U.S. economic innovation and growth.<br />

<br />
More Foreign Grad Students increase innovation two ways: 1) Collaboration between university and non-university groups. And 2) Private Industries purchase IP rights from the innovating University, benefiting Indirectly from Grad Students.<br />

Next, larger enrollments... work in scientific fields<br />
<br />
Direct Contribution, Spillovers to other researchers, provision of managemental skills, and reaching critical mass in specific research areas. All reasons why Innovation increases.<br />

Economists have studied...from the United States.<br />

Current squo policies have stagnated U.S. Skill levels. Only increasing highly skilled immigration allows U.S. to compete.<br />

Raising the H-1B cap enables U.S. Competitiveness. Prevents off-shoring, and increases U.S. In-tellectual Capital.<br />
