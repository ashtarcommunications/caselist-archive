A. Admissibility standards apply to all visas under INA §212(a), while eligibility standards relate to specific categories of visas. Eligibility allows you to receive a visa before you travel, while admissibility gets you into the US once you have arrived. <br />

Predictable limits – eligibility restrictions are specific to the visas in the resolution – admissibility applies to all visas in US immigration law<br />

Grammar –They make the word “eligibility” meaningless by making it overlap with “admissibility”. Mooting words leads to misunderstanding, which blocks good communication needed for education.<br />

Fair Ground – plenty of affs meet our interpretation – allow same sex marriages in family visas, lift the cap on H1-Bs, don’t force trafficking victims to prove they were trafficked<br />

Immigration is also likely to split the party along both ideological and geographic lines. “It would show fissures,” said Rep. Jason Altmire (D-Pa.). For Altmire, voting no on comprehensive immigration reform is a no-brainer. “It’s not a tough vote for me at all. I’m not going to vote for amnesty,” he said. That pits him against the Congressional Hispanic Caucus — and against other vulnerable Democrats in districts with significant Hispanic populations, like Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.). It’s a situation Republicans hope to exploit. “If the Democrats want to take on an issue that will serve to highlight the striking divisions that exist in their caucus, then we welcome it,” said Joanna Burgos, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.<br />
