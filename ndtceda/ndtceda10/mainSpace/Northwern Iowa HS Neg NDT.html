 The affirmative’s claim to affect the economy is a financial fetishism that perpetuates competition and rewards Enron style misreporting-resulting in economic indeterminacy that destroys all policy options and ensures the collapse of economics.<br />
Karyn Ball 2007 (“Death Driven Futures, or You Can’t Spell Deconstruction Without Enron” Cultural Critique, 65, Fall, 2007, Muse)<br />
“In 2004, Magnolia Pictures released” “last refuge in a crisis.”<br />
The aff call for expanding h-1b visas is an attempt to maintain U.S. imperialist hegemony because of the belief that they have a unique right to the best and brightest. This self perceived superiority insures that violent attempts to secure global hegemony.<br />
Stuart Tannock 2009 “White Collar Imperialisms: the h-1b debate in America” Social Semiotics<br />
“Current cals for expanding the h-1b visa program” “remains essentially unchanged.”<br />
First-corporations will lie disproves their solvency claims. Second, analysts will miscalculate turns case. Third public distrust kills investment killing the economy and resulting in a total collapse.<br />
Karyn Ball 2007 (“Death Driven Futures, or You Can’t Spell Deconstruction Without Enron” Cultural Critique, 65, Fall, 2007, Muse)<br />
“Enron’s “creative” trade in derivatives” “their own surveillance.”<br />
The imperialism of the aff insures continued U.S. military and economic intervention causing violence, displacing millions. This is a sequencing debate- U.S. imperialism must be brought into open kritik before we can solve the status quo. <br />
Stuart Tannock 2009 “White Collar Imperialisms: the h-1b debate in America” Social Semiotics<br />
“On the pro-side of the h-1B debate” “trawl for talent.”<br />
The alternative is to rject the aff framing of economics and vote neg to reproblamatize state competition theory. Only by opening up a space to rethink the management of economics can we overcome the traditional economic theory. <br />
Tore Fougner “The state international competitiveness and neoliberal globalization: is there a future beyond the competitive state?” Review of International Studies, 2006, 32, 165-185)<br />
“The broader significance of this” “conception of the state.”<br />
