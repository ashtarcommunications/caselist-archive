(Ronald, Rep. Bartlett: EMP Attack Would Wipe Out U.S. Military, 28 Sep 2009,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newsmax.com/RonaldKessler/emp-nuclear-military/2009/09/28/id/335240" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsmax.com/RonaldKessler/emp-nuclear-military/2009/09/28/id/335240</a>)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">As for the military, “At each hearing when it was appropriate, I would ask the admiral or the general how much of your war-fighting capability remains after a robust EMP laydown,” Bartlett says. “Invariably they would turn to their aides behind them to see if they could get an answer — we’ll get back to you on the record for that — because they didn’t know.” Yet, </span><span class="underline">says [Representative] Bartlett, Russian, Chinese, and Iranian military war plans envision an EMP attack on the U.S. While the Defense Department agreed with the recommendations of the 2008 EMP commission</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> report that it should take EMP into account, </span><span class="underline">no change has actually occurred in how DOD procures weapons systems and equipment, experts say. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> “A tramp steamer with a SCUD launcher, which they can buy for $100,000, and any crude nuclear weapon shuts down all of New England or all of California,” Bartlett says. “It could be done by a terrorist. It will not be launched from anybody’s soil. These people are evil, but they aren’t idiots.”</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The consequences of an EMP attack would of course be far more significant today, with so much of our infrastructure (civilian as well as military) dependent on electricity and electronics. The EMP Threat Commission estimated that it could take &quot;months to years&quot; to fully restore critical infrastructures after an EMP attack: Depending on the specific characteristics of the attacks, </span><span class="underline">unprecedented cascading failures of our major infrastructures could result. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">In that event, </span><span class="underline">a regional or national recovery would be long and difficult and would seriously degrade the safety and overall viability of our nation. The primary avenues for</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> catastrophic </span><span class="underline">damage</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to the nation </span><span class="underline">are through our electric power infrastructure</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and thence into our </span><span class="underline">telecommunications, energy, and other infrastructures. These</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, in turn, </span><span class="underline">can seriously impact</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> other important aspects of our nation's life, including </span><span class="underline">the financial system; means of getting food, water, and medical care to the citizenry; trade; and production of goods and services. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> The </span><span class="underline">recovery of any one of the key national infrastructures is dependent on the recovery of others. The longer the outage, the more problematic and uncertain the recovery will be. It is possible for the functional outages to become mutually reinforcing until at some point the degradation of infrastructure could have irreversible effects on the country's ability to support its population. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Emphasis added.]</span><br />

According to a well-known anecdote, a German officer visited Picasso in his Paris studio during the Second World War. There he saw <em>Guernica</em> and, shocked at the modernist “chaos” of the painting, asked Picasso: “Did you do this?” Picasso calmly replied: “No, <em>you</em> did this!” <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Today, many a liberal, when faced with violent outbursts such as the recent looting in the suburbs of Paris, asks the few remaining leftists who still count on a radical social transformation: “Isn’t it you who did this?

<br />
<u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Where, then, do we stand today? <span style="background-color: aqua;">How can we break out of the crisis</span> of determinate negation and enact a subtraction in all its authentic violence</span>? Gerald A. Cohen has enumerated the four features of the classical Marxist notion of the working class: (1) it constitutes the majority of society; (2) it produces the wealth of society; (3) it consists of the exploited members of society; (4) its members are the needy people in society. When these four features are combined, they generate two further features: (5) the working class has nothing to lose from revolution; (6) it can and will engage in a revolutionary transformation of society.’ None of the first four features applies to the contemporary working class, which is why features (5) and (6) cannot be generated. Even if some of the features continue to apply to parts of today’s society, they are no longer united in single agent: the needy people in society are no longer the workers, and so on and so forth. Correct as it is, this enumeration should be supplemented by a systematic theoretical deduction: for Marx, they all follow from the basic position of a worker who has nothing but her labor-power to sell. As such, workers are by definition exploited; with the progressive expansion of capitalism, they constitute the majority which also produces the wealth; and so on. Flow, then, are we to redefine a revolutionary perspective in today’s conditions? Is the way out of this predicament, the <em>combinatoire</em> of multiple antagonisms, their potential overlappings? The underlying problem is: how are we to think the singular universality of the emancipatory subject as not purely formal, that is, as objectively-materially determined, hut without the working class as its substantial base? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">The solution is</span> a <span style="background-color: aqua;">negative</span> one: it is capitalism itself which offers a negative substantial determination, for <span style="background-color: aqua;">the global capitalist system</span> is the substantial “base” which mediates and <span style="background-color: aqua;">generates the excesses (slums, ecological threats, and so on) that open up sites of resistance</span></span>. It is easy to make fun of Fukuyama’s notion of the End of History, but the dominant ethos today is “Fukuyamaian”: liberal-democratic capital‘ ism is accepted as the finally found formula of the best possible society, all that one can do is render it more just, tolerant, and so forth. The only true question today is: do we endorse this “naturalization” of capitalism, or does contemporary global capitalism contain antagonisms which are sufficiently strong to prevent its indefinite reproduction? Let us cite four such antagonisms: 1. Ecology: in spite of the infinite adaptability of capitalism which, in the case of an acute ecological catastrophe or crisis, can easily turn ecolo7 into a new field of capitalist investment and competition, the very nature of the risk involved fundamentally precludes a market solution—why? Capitalism only works in precise social conditions: it implies trust in the objectivized/”reified” mechanism of the market’s “invisible hand” which, as a kind of Cunning of Reason, guarantees that the competition of individual egotisms works for the common good. However, we are currenty experiencing a radical change. Up until now, historical Sub stance—history as an objective process obeying certain laws—played out its role as the medium and foundation of all subjective interventions: whatever social and political subjects did, it was mediated and ultimately dominated, overdetermined, by the historical Substance. What looms on the horizon today is the unprecendented possibility that a subjective intervention will intervene directly into the historical Substance, catastrophically disturbing its course by triggering an ecological catastrophe, a fateful biogenetic mutation, a nuclear or similar military—social catastrophe, and so on. No longer can we rely on the safeguarding role of the limited scope of our acts: it no longer holds that, whatever we do, history will carry on. For the first time in human history, the act of a single socio political agent can really alter and even interrupt the global historical process, so that, ironically, it is only today that we can say that the historical process should effectively be conceived “not only as Substance, but also as Subject.” This is why, when confronted with singular catastrophic prospects (say, a political group which intends to attack its enemy with nuclear or biological weapons), we can no longer rely on the standard logic of the “Cunning of Reason” which, precisely, pre supposes the primacy of the historical Substance over acting subjects: we can no longer adopt the stance of “let us call the bluff of the enemy who threatens us for he will thereby self-destruct” —the price for letting historical Reason do its work is too high since, in the meantime, we may all perish together with the enemy. Recall a frightening detail from the Cuban missile crisis: only later did we learn how close to nuclear war we were during a naval skirmish between an American destroyer and a Soviet B—59 submarine off Cuba on October 27, 1962. The destroyer dropped depth charges near the submarine to try to force it to the surface, not knowing it had a nucleartipped torpedo. Vadim Orlov, a member of the submarine crew, told the conference in Havana that the submarine had been authorized to fire it if three officers agreed. The officers began a fierce shouting match over whether to sink the ship. Two of them said yes and the other said no. “A guy named Arkhipov saved the world,” was the bitter comment of a historian on this incident.2 2. The inadequacy of private property for so-called ‘intellectual property.” The key antagonism of the new (digital) industries is thus: how to maintain the form of (private) property, within which the logic of profit can be maintained (see also the Napster problem, the free circulation of music)? And do the legal complications in biogenetics not point in the same direction? A key element of the new international trade agreements is the “protection of intellectual property”: whenever, in a merger, a big First World company takes over a Third World company, the first thing they do is close down the research department. Phenomena emerge here which push the notion of property towards extraordinary dialectical paradoxes: in India, the local communities suddenly discover that med ical practices and materials they have been using for centuries are now owned by American companies, so they should be bought from the latter; with the biogenetic companies patenting genes, we are all discovering that parts of ourselves, our genetic components, are already copyrighted, owned by others . . . The crucial date in the history of cyberspace was February 3, 1976, the day when Bill Gates published his (in)famous “Open Letter to Hobbyists,” the assertion of private property in the software domain: “As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. [. . .] Most directly, the thing you do is theft.” Bill Gates has built his entire empire and reputation on his extreme views about knowledge being treated as if it were tangible property. This was a decisive signal which triggered the battle for the “enclosure” of the common domain of software. 3. The socio-ethical implications of new techno-scientific development (especially in biogenetics)—Fukuyama himself was compelled to admit that biogenetic interventions into human nature are the most serious threat to his vision of the End of History. r What is false about today’s discussion concerning the “ethical con sequences of biogenetics” (along with similar matters) is that it is rapidly turning into what Germans call <em>Bindenstrich</em>-<em>Ethik</em>, the ethics of the hyphen —technology-ethics, environment-ethics, and so on. This ethics does have a role to play, a role homologous to that of the “provisional ethic” Descartes mentions at the beginning of his <em>Discourse</em> <em>on</em> <em>Method</em>: when we engage on a new path, full of dangers and shattering new insights, we need to stick to old established rules as a practical guide for our daily lives, although we are well aware that the new insights will compel us to provide a fresh foundation for our entire ethical edifice (in Descartes’s case, this new foundation was provided by Kant, in his ethics of subjective autonomy). Today, we are in the same predicament: “provisional ethics” cannot replace the need for a profound reflection regarding the emerging New. In short, what gets lost here, in this hyphen-ethics, is simply ethics as such. The problem is not that universal ethics gets dissolved into particular topics, but, quite the contrary, that particular scientific breakthroughs are directly confronted with old humanist “values” (say, that biogenetics affects our sense of dignity and autonomy). This, then, is the choice we confront today: either we choose the typically postmodern stance of reticence (let’s not go to the end—let’s keep a proper distance towards the scientific Thing so that this Thing will not draw us into its black hole, destroying all our moral and human notions), or we dare to “tarry with the negative (<em>das Verweilen beim Negativen</em>), “that is, we dare to fully assume the consequences of scientific modernity, with the wager that “our Mind is a genome” will also function as an infinite judgment. 4. And, last but not least, new forms of apartheid, new walls and slums. On September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers were hit; twelve years earlier, on November’9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. November 9 announced the “happy nineties,” the Fukuyama dream that liberal democracy had won, that the search was over, that the advent of a global, liberal world community was lurking just around the corner, that the obstacles to this ultra-Hollywoodesque happy ending were merely empirical and contingent (local pockets of resistance where the leaders had not yet grasped that their time was over). In contrast, 9/11 is the key symbol of the end of the Clintonite happy nineties, of the era in which new walls are emerging everywhere, between Israel and the West Bank, around the European Union, along the US—Mexico border. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">So what of the new proletarian position is that of the inhabitants of slums in the new megalopolises? The explosive growth of slums over the last decades</span>, especially in the Third World mega-cities from Mexico City and other Latin American capitals through Africa (Lagos, Chad) to India, China, the Philippines, and Indonesia<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, is perhaps the crucial geopolitical event of our times</span>.3 The case of Lagos, the biggest node in the shanty town corridor of 70 million people that stretches from Abidjan to Ibadan, is exemplary here: according to the official sources themselves, about two-thirds of Lagos State’s total land mass of 3,577 square kilometers could be classified as shanties or slums; no one even knows the size of its population .—.officially it is 6 million, but most experts estimate it at 10 million. Since, Sometime very soon (or maybe, given the imprecision of the Third World censuses, it has already happened), the urban population of the earth will outnumber the rural population, and since slum inhabitants will compose the majority of the urban population, we are in no way dealing with a marginal phenomenon. We are thus witnessing the fast growth of a population living outside state control, in conditions half outside the law, in terrible need of the minimal forms of self-organization. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Although <span style="background-color: aqua;">this population is composed of marginalized laborers</span>,</span> sacked civil servants and ex-peasants, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">they are not simply a redundant surplus</span></span>: they are incorporated into the global economy in numerous ways, many of them working as informal wage workers or self-employed entrepreneurs, with no adequate health or social-security coverage. (The main source of their emergence is the inclusion of Third World countries in the global economy, with cheap food imports from the First World countries ruining local agriculture.) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">They are the true ‘symptom” of slogans such as ‘Development,” “Modernization,” and the “World Market”:</span> not an unfortunate accident, but <span style="background-color: aqua;">a necessary product</span></span> of the innermost logic <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">of global capitalism</span></span>.4 No wonder that the hegemonic form of ideology in slums is Pentecostal Christianity, with its mixture of charismatic miracles-and-spectaclesoriented fundamentalism and of social programs such as community kitchens and care of children and the old. While, of course, one should resist the easy temptation of elevating and idealizing the slum-dwellers into a new revolutionary class, one should nonetheless, in Badiou’s terms, perceive slums as one of the few authentic “evental sites” in contemporary society—the slum-dwellers are literally a collection of those who are the “part of no-part,” the “supernumerary” element of society, excluded from the benefits of citizenship, the uprooted and dispossessed, those who really “have nothing to lose but their chains.” It is indeed surprising how many features of slum-dwellers fit the good old Marxist determination of the proletarian revolutionary subject: they are “free” in the double meaning of the word even more than the classic proletariat (“freed” from all substantial ties; dwelling in a free space, beyond the police regulations of the state); they are a large collective, forcibly thrown together, “thrown” into a situation where they have to invent some mode of being-together, and simultaneously deprived of any support in traditional ways of life, in inherited religious or ethnic life-forms. Of course, there is a crucial difference between the slum-dwellers and the classical Marxist working class: while the latter is defined in the precise terms of economic “exploitation” (the appropriation of surplus value generated by the situation of having to sell one’s own labor-power as a commodity on the market), the defining feature of the slum-dwellers is socio-political, it concerns their (non-)integration into the legal space of citizenship with (most of) its incumbent rights—to put it in somewhat simplified terms, much more than a refugee, a slum-dweller is a homo sacer, the systemically generated “living dead” of global capitalism. The slum-dweller is a kind of negative of the refugee: a refugee from his own community, the figure that state power is not trying to control through concentration —where (to repeat the unforgettable pun from Ernst Lubitch’s To Be or Not to Be) those in power do the concentrating while the refugees do the camping—but pushed into a space beyond control; in contrast to the Foucauldian micro-practices of discipline, with regard to slum-dwellers, state power renounces its right to exert full control and discipline, finding it more appropriate to let them vegetate in the twilight zone. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">What one finds in the “really-existing slums’ is, of course, a mixture of improvised modes of social life</span>, from criminal gangs and religious “fundamentalist” groups held together by a charismatic leader up to and including seeds of new Forms of “socialist” solidarity. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">The slumdwellers are the counter-class</span> to the other newly emerging class, the socalled “symbolic class’ (</span>managers, journalists, and PR people, academics, artists, and so on) <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">which is also uprooted</span> and perceives itself as directly universal (a New York academic has more in common with a Slovene academic than with blacks in Harlem half mile from his campus). Is this the new axis of class struggle, or is the symbolic class” inherently split, so that one can make the emancipatory wager on a coalition between the slum-dwellers and the “progressive” part of the symbolic class? <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">We should be looking for signs of the new forms of social awareness that will emerge from the slum collectives</span>: they will be the germs of the future. Peter Hallward was right to point out that the poetics of “resistance,” of deterritorialized nomadic mobility, of creating <em>lignes de fuite</em>, of never being where one is expected to dwell, is not enough; the time has come to start creating what one is tempted to call liberated territories, the welldefined and delineated social spaces in which the reign of the System is suspended: a religious or artistic community, a political organization, and other forms of “a place of one’s own.” This is what makes slums so interesting: their territorial character. While contemporary society is often characterized as the society of total control, slums are the territories within a state’s frontiers from which the state has (partially, at least) withdrawn its control, territories which function as white spots, blanks, in the official map of a state territory. Although they are de facto included in a state by the links of the black economy, organized crime, religious groups, and so forth, the state’s control is nonetheless suspended, they are domains outside the rule of law. In the map of Berlin that one could buy in the now defunct GDR, the area of West Berlin was left blank, a weird hole in the detailed structure of the big city; when Christa Wolf, the wellknown East German half-dissident writer, took her small daughter to East Berlin’s TV tower, from which one had a nice view over prohibited West Berlin, the small girl shouted happily: “Look, mother, it is not white over there, there are houses with people like here!”—as if discovering a hidden slum zone . . <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">This is why the “destructured” masses,</span> poor and deprived of every thing, situated in a non-proletarianized urban environment, <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">constitute one of the principal horizons of the politics to come. These masses, therefore, are an important factor in the phenomenon of globalization. A genuine form of globalization, today, would be found in the organization of these masses</span> — on a worldwide scale, if possible —<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">whose conditions of existence are essentially the same</span>. Whoever lives in the banlieues of Bamako or Shanghai is not essentially different from someone who lives in the banlieue of Paris or the ghettos of Chicago. Indeed, if the principal task of the emancipatory politics of the nineteenth century was to break the monopoly of the bourgeois liberals by politicizing the working class, and if the task of the twentieth century was to politically awaken the immense rural populations of Asia and Africa<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">, <span style="background-color: aqua;">the principal task of the twenty-first century is to politicize</span></span>—organize and discipline -<span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">the “destructured masses” of slum-dwellers</span></span><span style="background-color: aqua;">.</span></u><br />

<u>A critical analysis of the present global constellation – one which offers no clear solution, no “practical” advice on what to do, and provides no light at the end of the tunnel, since one is well aware that this light might belong to a train crashing towards us – usually meets with reproach: “<span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Do you mean we should do nothing? J</span>ust sit and wait?” <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">One should gather the courage to answer: “YES, precisely that!” There are situations when the only truly “practical” thing to do is to resist the temptation to engage immediately </span>and to “wait and see” by means of a patient, critical analysis. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Engagement seems to exert its pressures on us from all directions</span>. In a well-known passage from his <em>existentialism and humanism,</em> Sartre deployed the dilemma of a young man in France in 1942, torn between the duty to help his lone, ill mother and the duty to enter the Resistance and fight the Germans; Sartre’s point is, of course, that there is no a priori answer to this dilemma. The young man needs to make a decision grounded only in his own abyssal freedom and assume full responsibility for it. An obscene third way out of the dilemma would have been to advise the young man to tell his mother that he will join the Resistance, and to tell his Resistance friends that he will take care of his mother, while, in reality, withdrawing to a secluded place and studying… There is more than cheap cynicism in this advice. It brings to mind a well-known soviet joke about Lenin. Under socialism, Lenin’s advice to young people, his answer to what they should do, was “Learn, learn, and learn.” This was evoked at all times and displayed on all school walls. The joke goes: Marx, Engels, and Lenin are asked whether they would prefer to have a wife or a mistress. As expected, Marx, rather conservative in private matters, answers, “A wife!” while Engels, more of a bon vivant, opts for a mistress. To everyone’s surprise, Lenin says, “I’d like to have both!” Why? Is there a hidden stripe of decadent jouisseur behind his austere revolutionary image? No-he explains: “So that I can tell my wife that I am going to my mistress and my mistress that I have to be with my wife…” “And then, what do you do?” “I go to a solitary place to learn, learn, and learn!” Is this not exactly what Lenin did after the catastrophe of 1914? He withdrew to a lonely place in Switzerland, where he “learned, learned, and learned,” reading Hegel’s logic. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline">And this is what we should do today when we find ourselves bombarded with mediatic image of violence.

Its capitalist wing finds ever more creative and ingenious ways to profit. Diversity becomes multiculturalism™: parents can buy colorful multilingual dolls; producers can make action films with global appeal; educators can buy multicultural teaching kits designed to insure that their students are well-prepared to compete in a global economy. Likewise, democratic debate is easily capitalized: citizens seeking information are ready eyeballs for advertisers; politicians can champion the role of the Internet in keeping their constituencies connected, while telecoms, ISPs, chip, hardware, and software providers wisely nod their heads and pocket their vastly increased revenues. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Against, this</span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">motley crew, generosity and </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">tolerance won’t work</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

But this isn’t politics. Politics involves division, saying “yes” to some options and “no” to others. A willingness to take responsibility for the divisions inseparable from politics seems to have been lost, or relegated to small, local, struggles. Particularly odd in radical pluralists’ and deliberative democrats’ focus on fundamentalism is its alliance with the central tenets of the bad guys themselves. Neoconservatives and neoliberals agree that fundamentalism is the most important political problem. Fundamentalism, they chorus, opposes the unfolding of freedom in the world. </span></span><br />

<br />
<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">I am not alone in my concern about the attack that is coming. On December 24 the New York Times lead editorial was entitled: &quot;A Coming Assault on the EPA.&quot; That editorial predicted that: </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">Republicans</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">in the next Congress</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">are</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> obviously </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">set on limiting the Environmental Protection Agency's authority</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">under the Clean Air Act</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">to regulate</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">a wide range of</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">air pollutants </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- even if it means</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">denying</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the agency</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">money to run</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">its</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">programs</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and chaining its administrator, Lisa Jackson, to the witness stand. I don't see the symbolic posturing or preening Representatives as a threat to the EPA, but the cynical right wing strategy of &quot;starving the beast&quot; by cutting funding could pose</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">a grave threat</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">to this chronically underfunded agency. EPA is a very decentralized and relatively small federal agency. Throughout the anti-environmental Bush years, EPA was starved financially. When Bush came into office in 2001 EPA's annual budget was about $8 billion and by the time he left it had declined to about $7.5 billion. These data are not presented in constant dollars, and so the purchasing power of EPA's budget declined substantially during the Bush years. EPA had a staff of about 18,000 when Bush arrived at the White House, by the time he left it had declined to about 17,200. Most of EPA's staff is not in Washington but in the ten regional offices around the nation that work closely with state and municipal governments to manage our environment. Under President Obama, the EPA's resource picture has been improving. The agency's budget is finally over $10 billion, and the staff size is gradually approaching 18,000 again. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">Since funding bills must begin in the</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">now</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">Republican</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">controlled</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">House</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">of Representatives, the threat to EPA's funding is real. President </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">Obama will need to use</span> his <span style="background-color: aqua;">political capital to defend the EPA's budget</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Ten billion dollars may be a lot of money, but not when compared to the entire federal budget. In the military budget it would be a rounding error. While defending EPA will be good politics, it is even better public policy. America is learning that</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">sustainable economic development requires</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">protection of our ecosphere. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Polluting the planet poisons our water, air and food and impairs human health and well being. We have already spent hundreds of billions of public and private dollars on toxic waste clean up. The Chinese government will soon be learning the same lesson as it pays the costs of its rapid economic expansion. BP learned that lesson last summer in the Gulf of Mexico. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">A well-funded EPA can</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">help us</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">manage the environment and ensure</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">that the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">benefits of</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">our economic </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">growth outweigh</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: aqua;">costs</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. An underfunded EPA is asking for more disasters like the massive oil spill in the Gulf. The cause of that catastrophe was under-regulation. Do we really want to incur similar risks throughout our economy? The President should begin to make clear his support for EPA's work and its need for resources. </span></u><br />

 <u><span class="StyleStyleBold12pt"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Overby, ‘9 </span></span></u><br />
<u>[Stephanie, award-winning reporter and writer with fifteen years of professional journalism experience, CIO.com, 8/18, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cio.com/article/499907/The_Truth_About_the_H_1B_and_L_1_Visa_Reform_Act_of_2009" rel="nofollow">http://www.cio.com/article/499907/The_Truth_About_the_H_1B_and_L_1_Visa_Reform_Act_of_2009</a>]</u><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">That old Schoolhouse Rock song was right: It is a long journey to the capital city and a long, long wait, sitting in committee. (Indeed, the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> H-1B </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">and L-1 Visa </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Reform</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Act of 2009 </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">is</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> currently </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">in committee</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.) But unlike the optimistic Saturday morning cartoon jingle, most bills never make it past that point. The last bill solely focused on H-1B and L-1 visas to break through was the L-1 Visa and H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004, which President George W. Bush signed into law. It raised application fees, required employees to pay H-1B workers 100 percent of the prevailing wage, and effectively increased the number of visas awarded annually by exempting from the cap an additional 20,000 H-1B petitions for foreign nationals with advanced degrees from U.S. institutions. Among those bills that didn't survive were the USA Jobs Protection Act of 2003 from former Rep. Nancy Johnson (R-Conn.) and Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.); the Bill to Abolish H-1B, introduced by former Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.); the Defend the American Dream Act put forth by Rep. Bill Pascrell (R-N.J.); and Grassley and Durbin's previous attempt at H-1B visa reform, the H-1B and L-1 Visa Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007, which never made it out of committee during the last Congressional session. So what are the chances that this bill will become law? </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">Durbin and Grassley </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">both</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">sit on the</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Senate</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">Immigration Subcommittee, which means</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the bipartisan tag team should have</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">more influence </span>on </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">how the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">legislation </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">proceeds</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> than Dodd and Johnson</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> did, says Ron Hira, associate professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and co-author of the book Outsourcing America. Still, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">few expect</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">H-1B</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2009 to proceed as a</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">standalone</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">bill. It is</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">likely to be incorporated into larger immigration legislation</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Like it or not, lobbying works. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">Representatives from </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">both the supply and demand side of the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">IT</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> outsourcing community publicly </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">support efforts to reduce fraud</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the system. Privately, however, they're pressuring lawmakers to reduce the scope of the legislation. &quot;There is likely to be continued opposition in the business community to some of the provisions of the bill, which add more roadblocks into the H-1B process,&quot; says Allen Erenbaum, a partner in the Los Angeles office of law firm Mayer Brown. As a result, says Elizabeth Espin Stern, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of law firm Baker and McKenzie, &quot;we do not expect the bill to proceed separately from overall, comprehensive immigration reform.&quot; Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, announced his intention to introduce immigration reform later this year. Onlookers expect Grassley and Durbin to tack the components of the bill (or something like it) to that broader legislation. And don't be surprised if some of the original bill's more hard line measures—like the 50/50 rule—get watered down or edited out entirely, says Shalabh Garg, director of offshore outsourcing consultancy neoIT. There's just one colossal caveat: A legislative agenda packed with such thorny issues as healthcare, climate change, and regulation of the financial system may delay immigration reform efforts. &quot;</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">With</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">ongoing political controversy</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> about the topic—since that type of reform would have to address the 11 to 18 million undocumented workers in the country—</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">we do not expect</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to see </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">passage</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> of the bill </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">anytime soon</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; says Stern. It isn't the only effort to reduce H-1B and L-1 visa fraud. Most recently, the economic stimulus bill introduced H-1B visa restrictions for companies that received funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). What's more, some companies that sponsor foreign-born professionals for H-1B and L-1 visas are already reporting more scrutiny in the visa application process. &quot;We have seen an increase, particularly among IT companies, for [information such as] proof of work availability for the full three-year period of the petition and attestations from outside parties (such as clients) that the company employs true workers in professional specialties,&quot; says Stern. She notes that such requests are thus far the exception rather than the rule. &quot;Proof of the nature of the job duties is more frequently requested.&quot; U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Services (USCIS), which administers the H-1B and L-1 visa programs, has beefed up its anti-fraud auditing efforts recently with surprise site visits to companies that employ temporary non-immigrant visa holders. The unannounced audits come on the heels of a study conducted by the Office of Fraud Detection and National Security, which estimates that more than one-fifth of H-1B petitions violate program rules. Offenses range from technical violations to outright fraud. However, unlike the rules set forth by the Grassley-Durbin bill, compliance with USCIS's worksite investigations—while advisable—is not mandatory. It is a sign that the H-1B and L-1 visa programs are here to stay. The </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">H-1B</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> visa program </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline">remains <span style="background-color: yellow;">a hot button issue with</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> some </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">very vocal critics</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, among them </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">IT labor unions</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> like Alliance@IBM, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">lobbying groups</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">such as Bright Future Jobs, </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: yellow;">and individuals</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> including RIT's Hira and University of California at Davis computer science professor Norm Matloff. They</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">argue</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> that the</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">non-immigrant visa programs injure the U.S. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">IT</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">workforce</span>. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Although the reform bill addresses some complaints about visa administration and regulation, it is actually a clear signal that H-1Bs and L-1s will remain an option for U.S. employers for the foreseeable future. The annual limit on H-1Bs awarded has been lowered from a high of 195,000 in 2003 to 65,000 (not counting the 20,000 additional set aside for advanced degree holders), but the reform bill indicates that</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">middle-ground seeking legislators may be willing to raise the</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">annual</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">cap</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">on such visas</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">if</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">the proposed</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">changes</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">to the visa programs</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"> <span style="background-color: yellow;">pass</span>. </span></u><br />

 <strong>Coyne and Hoekstra, 07 -</strong> *professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago AND <strong>Associate Professor in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University (Jerry and Hopi, The New Republic, “The Greatest Dying,” 9/24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.truthout.org/article/jerry-coyne-and-hopi-e-hoekstra-the-greatest-dying" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthout.org/article/jerry-coyne-and-hopi-e-hoekstra-the-greatest-dying</a>)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Aside from the Great Dying, there have been four other mass extinctions, all of which severely pruned life's diversity. Scientists agree that we're now in the midst of a sixth such episode. This new one, however, is different - and, in many ways, much worse. For, unlike earlier extinctions, this one results from the work of a single species, Homo sapiens.We are relentlessly taking over the planet, laying it to waste and eliminating most of our fellow species. Moreover, we're doing it much faster than the mass extinctions that came before.</span> <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">Every year</span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, up to</span> <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">30,000 species disappear due to human activity</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">alone. At this rate, we could lose half of Earth's species in this century. And,</span> <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">unlike with previous extinctions, there's no hope</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">that</span> <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">biodiversity will ever recover</span></span>,</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">since the cause of the decimation - us - is here to stay. To scientists, this is an unparalleled calamity, far more severe than global warming, which is, after all, only one of many threats to biodiversity. Yet global warming gets far more press. Why? One reason is that, while the increase in temperature is easy to document, the decrease of species is not. Biologists don't know, for example, exactly how many species exist on Earth. Estimates range widely, from three million to more than 50 million, and that doesn't count microbes, critical (albeit invisible) components of ecosystems. We're not certain about the rate of extinction, either; how could we be, since the vast majority of species have yet to be described? We're even less sure how the loss of some species will affect the ecosystems in which they're embedded, since the intricate connection between organisms means that the loss of a single species can ramify unpredictably. But we do know some things. Tropical rainforests are disappearing at a rate of 2 percent per year. Populations of most large fish are down to only 10 percent of what they were in 1950. Many primates and all the great apes - our closest relatives - are nearly gone from the wild. And we know that extinction and global warming act synergistically. Extinction exacerbates global warming: By burning rainforests, we're not only polluting the atmosphere with carbon dioxide (a major greenhouse gas) but destroying the very plants that can remove this gas from the air. Conversely, global warming increases extinction, both directly (killing corals) and indirectly (destroying the habitats of Arctic and Antarctic animals). As extinction increases, then, so does global warming, which in turn causes more extinction - and so on, into a downward spiral of destruction. Why, exactly, should we care? Let's start with the most celebrated case: the rainforests. Their loss will worsen global warming - raising temperatures, melting icecaps, and flooding coastal cities. And, as the forest habitat shrinks, so begins the inevitable contact between organisms that have not evolved together, a scenario played out many times, and one that is never good. Dreadful diseases have successfully jumped species boundaries, with humans as prime recipients. We have gotten aids from apes, sars from civets, and Ebola from fruit bats. Additional worldwide plagues from unknown microbes are a very real possibility. But it isn't just the destruction of the rainforests that should trouble us. Healthy</span> <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">ecosystems</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">the world over</span> <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">provide </span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">hidden services like waste disposal, nutrient cycling, soil formation,</span> <u><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">water purification, and oxygen </span></span></u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">production. Such services are best rendered by ecosystems that are diverse. Yet, through both intention and accident, humans have introduced exotic species that turn biodiversity into monoculture. Fast-growing zebra mussels, for example, have outcompeted more than 15 species of native mussels in North America's Great Lakes and have damaged harbors and water-treatment plants. Native prairies are becoming dominated by single species (often genetically homogenous) of corn or wheat. Thanks to these developments, soils will erode and become unproductive - which, along with temperature change, will diminish agricultural yields. Meanwhile,</span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">with increased pollution</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">and runoff, as well as reduced forest cover, ecosystems will no longer be able to purify water; and a shortage of clean water spells disaster. In many ways, oceans are the most vulnerable areas of all. As overfishing eliminates major predators, while polluted and warming waters kill off phytoplankton, the intricate aquatic food web could collapse from both sides. Fish, on which so many humans depend, will be a fond memory. As phytoplankton vanish, so does the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. (Half of the oxygen we breathe is made by phytoplankton, with the rest coming from land plants.) Species extinction is also imperiling coral reefs - a major problem since these reefs have far more than recreational value: They provide tremendous amounts of food for human populations and buffer coastlines against erosion. In fact, the global value of &quot;hidden&quot; services provided by ecosystems - those services, like waste disposal, that aren't bought and sold in the marketplace - has been estimated to be as much as $50 trillion per year, roughly equal to the gross domestic product of all countries combined. And that doesn't include tangible goods like fish and timber. </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">Life as we know it would be impossible</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">if ecosystems collapsed. Yet that is where we're heading if species extinction continues at its current pace. Extinction also has a huge impact on medicine. Who really cares if, say, a worm in the remote swamps of French Guiana goes extinct? Well, those who suffer from cardiovascular disease. The recent discovery of a rare South American leech has led to the isolation of a powerful enzyme that, unlike other anticoagulants, not only prevents blood from clotting but also dissolves existing clots. And it's not just this one species of worm: Its wriggly relatives have evolved other biomedically valuable proteins, including antistatin (a potential anticancer agent), decorsin and ornatin (platelet aggregation inhibitors), and hirudin (another anticoagulant). Plants, too, are pharmaceutical gold mines. The bark of trees, for example, has given us quinine (the first cure for malaria), taxol (a drug highly effective against ovarian and breast cancer), and aspirin. More than a quarter of the medicines on our pharmacy shelves were originally derived from plants. The sap of the Madagascar periwinkle contains more than 70 useful alkaloids, including vincristine, a powerful anticancer drug that saved the life of one of our friends. Of the roughly 250,000 plant species on Earth, fewer than 5 percent have been screened for pharmaceutical properties. Who knows what life-saving drugs remain to be discovered? Given current extinction rates, it's estimated that we're losing one valuable drug every two years. Our arguments so far have tacitly assumed that species are worth saving only in proportion to their economic value and their effects on our quality of life, an attitude that is strongly ingrained, especially in Americans. That is why conservationists always base their case on an economic calculus. But we biologists know in our hearts that there are deeper and equally compelling reasons to worry about the loss of biodiversity: namely, simple morality and intellectual values that transcend pecuniary interests. What, for example, gives us the right to destroy other creatures? And what could be more thrilling than looking around us, seeing that we are surrounded by our evolutionary cousins, and realizing that we all got here by the same simple process of natural selection? To biologists, and potentially everyone else, apprehending the genetic kinship and common origin of all species is a spiritual experience - not necessarily religious, but spiritual nonetheless, for it stirs the soul. But, whether or not one is moved by such concerns, it is certain that our future is bleak if we do nothing to stem this sixth extinction</span><u>. <span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">We are creating a world in which exotic diseases flourish</span></span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">but natural medicinal cures are lost; a world in which carbon waste accumulates </span><span class="StyleBoldUnderline"><span style="background-color: aqua;">while food sources dwindle</span></span><u><span style="background-color: #d3d3d3;">;</span></u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">a world of sweltering heat, failing crops, and impure water. In the end, we must accept the possibility that we ourselves are not immune to extinction. Or, if we survive, perhaps only a few of us will remain, scratching out a grubby existence on a devastated planet. Global warming will seem like a secondary problem when humanity finally faces the consequences of what we have done to nature: not just another Great Dying, but perhaps the greatest dying of them all. </span></strong><br />

<strong>The impact to the criticism is ethics and this consideration comes first– extend the Zizek and Daly in 2k4 evidence– 3 arguments:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>A) The ultimate ethico-political responsibility is to challenge the subordination of Capital. You don’t have to be a philosopher to draw the line between economic disparity and the ability of the market to dominate social relations – in the face of the affirmative you should struggle not against the particulars of immigration but instead against the organizing principles which produced the foundation for the status quos strategies of domination</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>B) Forget the Big Other – the ethic of the 1AC will never be political because it will always rely on a higher external authority to outline and implement our ethical strategies – this depoliticized ethics is never progressive for the oppressed</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>C) Risk the Impossible – the system of capital creates an ethical dilemma because it seems that all action outside of its confines will necessarily fail – ethics will never be political if we don’t insist on risking the impossible of a successful revolution against capitalism – we radically restructure the ethico-political imagination to include the possibility of successful actions against domination</strong><br />

The teachings of economics encounter opposition not only from the supporters of altruism, but also from the practitioners of an irrational, short-sighted, self-defeating form of self-interest, as well. These are, above all, the businessmen and wage earners whose short-run interests would be harmed by the free competition of capitalism and are protected or positively promoted by policies of government intervention, and who do not scruple to seek government intervention. For example, the businessmen and wage earners who seek government subsidies, price supports, tariffs, licensing laws, exclusive government franchises, labor-union privileges, immigration quotas, and the like.<br />
