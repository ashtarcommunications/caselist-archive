The United States Congress should eliminate the requirement that cooperation with law enforcement be mandatory for T visa eligibility.<br />
<br />
Contention One – The Status Quo<br />
<br />
Current human trafficking certification requirements turn the notion of state responsibility into a criminal justice affair. The US only accepts individuals who have been trafficked if they’re willing to serve as evidence in prosecuting their trafficker. If you don’t participate in the criminal justice process you are denied entry <br />

<br />
Women are processed to see how well they fit the weak-woman and weak-migrant stereotype. Women are chosen for their ability to perform stereotypical gender roles in the courtroom<br />

<span class="StyleStyleBold">Cognitive biases make it easier to tolerate extreme acts of cruelty when the victims can be identified by racial, gender, and class markers—as members of a privileged social group, we cannot help but take comfort when we begin to see the disadvantaged group as especially vulnerable.

<br />
Contention 1 – Trafficking on Trial<br />
Women who are trafficking victims have little choice in the criminal justice system – either they admit to being a victim, causing them to become otherized based on gendered narratives and assumptions of women sex workers as being untrustworthy, or they choose non-victim status and then get denied access to any of the benefits of testifying, causing them to be deported<br />
Marie Segrave, et al, 2009 (Sanja Milivojevic &amp; Sharon Pickering, Sex Trafficking: International Context and Response, p. 79-81)<br />
In the articulation of choice...before they open their mouth<br />
<br />
These discourses are used to solidify anti-immigrant sentiment<br />
Berman,10’ [Jacqueline, PhD in International Relations and principal analyst @ Berkeley Policy  Associates, “Biopolitical Management, Economic Calculation, and ‘Trafficked Women’”, International Migration 48.4, pp. 84-113]<br />
As discussed further below...who would seek to migrate<br />
<br />
The state gives services to trafficking victims to ensure their cooperation in court cases – but, the ultimate goal of gathering evidence for the prosecution silences women’s perspectives and voices<br />
Marie Segrave, et al, 2009 (Sanja Milivojevic &amp; Sharon Pickering, Sex Trafficking: International Context and Response, p. 81-4)<br />
While not referring explicitly to trafficking victims...to victim-oriented policy initiatives.<br />
<br />
The criminal justice system assumes that victims of sex trafficking want to participate in investigations – support is only given to those whose testimony best conforms to gendered stereotypes. In the end, cases are decided to advance to prosecution based on these gendered assumptions of women as victims.<br />
Marie Segrave, et al, 2009 (Sanja Milivojevic &amp; Sharon Pickering, Sex Trafficking: International Context and Response, p. 195-6)<br />
Despite the increased meshing...the problematic processing of women<br />
<br />
The problem is that prosecution is currently seen as the starting point – it is seen as the “natural” order of affairs and proceeds unchallenged in contemporary discourse.<br />
Marie Segrave, et al, 2009 (Sanja Milivojevic &amp; Sharon Pickering, Sex Trafficking: International Context and Response, p. 122-3)<br />
Pursuing the prosecution of traffickers...prosecution outcomes in Australia, Thailand and Serbia.<br />
<br />
And, the notion of T-visas as incentives for cooperation is a ruse – Police use the visa provision to coerce women into cooperate but subsequently deny them access <br />
Marie Segrave, et al, 2009 (Sanja Milivojevic &amp; Sharon Pickering, Sex Trafficking: International Context and Response, p. 86-7)<br />
A number of participants referred...but I just wanted to come home<br />
<br />
It’s a forced choice – Half of all victims that escape do not want to cooperate with law enforcement for fear of violence against their families.<br />

Fletcher (Acting Clinical Professor of Law and Director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic, University of California, Berkeley, School of Law) Eric Stover (Director of the Human Rights Center and Adjunct Professor of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley), “Hidden Slaves: Forced Labor in the United States,” Berkeley Journal of International Law, 2005, 23 Berkeley J. Int'l L. 47&gt;<br />
Yet for every victim who is willing to come forward...future arrests and prosecutions of perpetrators<br />
<br />
And, it ensures that those most affected by the trauma of trafficking are excluded because they don’t fit the profile of an ideal witness<br />
Lopiccolo, 2009 (Julie Marie Lopiccolo[J.D. Candidate 2010, Whittier Law School; B.A. in History, San Diego State University, 2005]Note and Comment: Where Are the Victims?

Finally, there is a problem...in eradicating human trafficking.<br />
<br />
Our harms are magnified by bureaucratic pressure, creating incentives to produce large numbers of anti-trafficking cases for political gain. The state needs victims to co-operate so it can generate anti-trafficking trophies which are critical to sustain the image of anti-trafficking benevolence.<br />
Marie Segrave, et al, 2009 (Sanja Milivojevic &amp; Sharon Pickering, Sex Trafficking: International Context and Response, p. 38-9)<br />
These administrative and diplomatic pressures...propelling the search for victims<br />
<br />
This produces state-sponsored victimization – the police rely on highly gendered assumptions of trafficking victims to increase their case total.<br />

Trafficking in persons presents...operation of the investigation process<br />

Critical reflection on the experiences...approval for anti-immigrant practices<br />
<br />
In the name of preventing sexual violence the US justifies new forms of greater international violence.  The able to hide it’s imperialism under the veneer of a humanitarian agenda.<br />
