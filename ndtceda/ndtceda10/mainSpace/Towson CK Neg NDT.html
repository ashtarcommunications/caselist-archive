<strong><span style="font-family: Times;">Decision: 3-0 Towson. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times;">Johnson comments- towson wins meta level link arguments. The aff has a failure to question the benevolence of America. A few case level link arguments that are not answered well. Aff needs more substantive offense other than offense on the link level. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times;">Lacy comments-Best bet for aff is on permutation, aff is pure negative action. Still a residual link from multiculturalism mall analogy etc. permutation still links-cant sever original representations of the 1ac. Similar to what blake had </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times;">Spring comments-aff go for perm can overcome representations argument. So if the alt can overcome the state, the alt can overcome representations. Aff needs to stick to your guns and defend state good. Neg ahead on alt solves warming. </span></strong><br />

The only ethical demand available to modern politics is that of the Slave and the Savage, the demand for the end of America itself. This cry, born out of the belly of slave ships and the churning vertigo of constitutive genocide, exposes the grammar of the Affirmative’s calls for larger institutional access as a fundamental fortification of White Settler and Slave Master civil society by its diversionary focus on the ethicality of the policies and practices of the United States as opposed to the a priori question its very existence. This silence of the Affirmative’s assumptive logic renders them unaccountable to the revolutionary political ontology of Redness and Blackness and thereby sets the stage for the various dramas of conflictual relationships i.e. class struggle, gender conflict, immigrants rights, etc. that are made possible by the antagonism between Settler and Savage, Master and Slave. <br />
Wilderson 2010 [Frank B., killed apartheid officials in South Africa, nuff said, Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, pages 1-5] <br />
When I was a young student at Columbia University (TO) the close reading of feature films and political theory that follows. <br />
<br />
While the afterlife of slavery is far from an abstraction in the lived reality of blackness, recourse to the sociological empirics of suffering already codifies the category of “exploitation” as the base grammar of suffering, ignoring the gratuitousness of anti-black violence and enshrining the call for more public policy as the limit point of our revolutionary demands. This elides the way in which civil society is parasitic on The Middle Passage and thus how Humanity itself can only be constituted in opposition to the fundamentally anti-Human position of the slave. It is this libidinal economy of anti-blackness which exists as the condition of possibility for the violence of the world. <br />
Wilderson 2010 <br />
[Frank B., again, dude straight up MURKED white supremacists like buk buk, Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms, pages 10-11] <br />
Regatding the Black position, some might ask why (TO) the gates of Columbia University awaits an answer. <br />
<br />
Thus we should focus our energies and points of attention on an unflinching paradigmatic analysis that calls for the end of America. <br />

Life will not change for the better absent an assault on the establishment. That doesn’t mean we will live to enjoy the fruits of the revolution but it DOES mean that we should pursue revolutionary suicide because death is inevitable and this is the only one worth pursuing. <br />

Connected to reactionary suicide, although even more painful (TO) The reality will be grimmer. <br />

Their calls to prevent wars just gloss over the ongoing living apocalypse for people of color. <br />

We outweigh, their characterization of nuclear peace in doomsday scenarios separates the question of apocalyptic violence from racial justice ignoring that THE WORLD HAS ALREADY ENDED for people of color and that their focus on mere survivability ignores that nuclear holocaust is waged on a daily basis against non-white bodies, only our bottom up resistance solves and specifically so in the context of women of color <br />

The perm is nothing more than white supremacist multiculturalism. It is an attempt to take the alien body/presence and integrate it into the localities of whiteness-this inclusion of the “other” is simpluy another way in which white hegemony makes minorities take on the white identity even if it is the so called enemy population-this multiculturalist white supremacy is crucial to the project of white supremacist globality. <br />
Dylan Rodriguez 2009, University of California, Riverside, “The Terms of Engagement: Warfare, White Locality, and Abolition” Critical Sociology, Vol. 36 Issue 1 <br />
It thus is within the confines of Homeland Security as white supremacist (TO) the historical project of white supremacist globality. <br />
<br />
The permutation fails because it includes the destructive policing of blackness as an afterthought or part of an exasperated laundry list catalog of equivalents. This fails to center anti-black, white supremacist policing as the constitutive condition of the entire structural network of violent domination and thereby misunderstands the truth of the social order. This failure of centering structures the affirmative politics to the anti-blackness of white civil society, leading to the inevitable amplification of state power and white supremacist violence. <br />

The upshot of this predicament is that obscuring the structural position (TO) less momentous than yet another revolution.78 <br />
