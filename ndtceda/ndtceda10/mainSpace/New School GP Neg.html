<strong>Immigrant Acts Neg</strong><br />
<br />
Immigration as a phenomenon, understood within the context of American nationalism produces a ladder of assimilation for the immigrant. How does the nation-state produce itself to define the belonging of Others? How does collective identity justify violence? <br />
<br />
<u>Part One: Immigration and the Debate Nation-State</u> <br />
<br />
The 1AC’s methodological choice codifies the experiences of immigrants into policy-oriented discussions and attempts to liberalize and expand the bodies that exist within America, but these bodies do not necessarily belong. Bodies are relegated to become calculable figures to justify one policy option or another. Lives are disposable to the logic of capital, and personhood erased. Immigration unfolds into the ways that the state purports an ideological figure—that of the normative citizen. Immigrants are juxtaposed and bodies are marked and exiled into the periphery. We don’t account for the lives that are affected after these policies. Violence becomes possible because they are undesirable, they are threats to the stable narrative that legitimizes America’s imperialism domestic and abroad. <br />
<br />
We extend a metaphor into the debate community, understanding the resolution as a zero sum policy game produces the same technologies within our scholarship production that is an extension of American empire. We are given a choice, to either be a ‘skilled’ worker and immigrant into the debate community by assimilating into its norms that is rooted in technologies that are divorced from the material realities of immigrants, or be deported because we do not fit into the constructs of the nation-state and are seen as threats to destabilize the narrative of the debate nation-state. We cannot speak. We can only produce. We are faced with the worst form of epistemic violence in these discursive spaces that obscures our participation in American Empire and silences those who suffer from it.<br />

<u>Part Two: Debate Technologies: Exclusion Laws 2010</u> <br />
<br />
Political reforms like the 1AC codify immigrants as temporary and disposable labor for the advancement of the economy. This situates the immigrant as an object for management, calaculability, and justifies violence in the name of the nation-state. Their advantages posit immigrants as pawns in the game of politics. This is a continuation of imperialist ambitions executed through ideological premise of nationalism and nativism.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
Additionally, the 1AC’s appeal to legal channels to incorporate the immigrant within the nation-state for its economic exigencies masks the centrality of whiteness to produce political, social, and cultural exclusion that results in material disenfranchisement. The falsity of incorporation into the national polity effaces the narrative of assimilation, one that produces a violent form of historical amnesia that sustains the atrocities of US nationalism that necessitated immigration in the first place. <br />

<br />
</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in; mso-add-space: auto;">Finally, the 1AC instrumentalizes the immigrant as an object of the law. Theorizing immigration within a problem/solution paradigm is a violent form of ethnocentrism that erases the violence that immigrants face in their everyday lives as it relates to visa policies and immigration laws in the racialization, labor exploitation, and political exclusion of bodies from the nation-state</span><br />

<u>Part Three: Immigrant Acts</u> <br />
<br />
Our Alternative in this debate is to affirm the lives and stories of immigrants in their material realities of the everyday.<br />
<br />
The ballot should be awarded to the team that best opens up space for immigrant voices in debate. We have to recognize how our knowledge production can either be exported to sustain the legalistic and material oppression of immigrants or make visible these technologies of violence in order to elucidate the complexities of immigration and how it affects the people that it affects.<br />
