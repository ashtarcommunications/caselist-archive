 The affs political analysis is counter productive – we all agree that a decision which better includes [the immigrant] is desirable but the solution lies not in willing government change but in analyizing the social conditions that give birth to the desire to exclude [the immigrant]<br />
Gilbert et crew 8 <br />
“deleuzian politics? A roundtable discussion” pg 165-175<br />
One has to look at the level at…that what micropolitics is about? <br />
The affirmative misindentifies political and social reality, by positing the federal government as a pre-given enityt that exists as an agent of social change the aff obfuscates the productive nature of desire. Fantasizing about the plan merely participates in the production of a desire for a world governed by the state, and as such produces a society of statecraft that produces fascist subjectivitst that do violence to the immigrant body<br />
Roxanne doty 2003<br />
Anti-immigrationism in western democracies: statecraft, desire, and the politics of exclusion pg. 11-12<br />
Along with the movement of deterritorialization is the often violent movement….hearts of his subjects. <br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The trans-nationalism of the migrant is merely a symptom of the obsolescence of the state – the aff’s ritualistic fixation on what “the united states federal government” should do represents a desire for professional control of politics, destroying agency of the non-professional</span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The notion of state, as conceived by international relations theory…and agents who make up the state. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The aff’s scholarship takes the state as a pregiven, obfuscating that their very belief in the state as the manager of migration is what GRANTS it the authority to manage migration via governmentality.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">John Torpey 2000</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">The invention of the passport: surveillance, citizenship and the state pg 5-6 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let me emphasize that I am not claiming that states…to constituting the very “state-ness” of states. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Aff turns debate into surveillance at a distance, positing you as the consular with the sovereign ability to threaten the immigrant who refuses docility with the refusal of their visa. The knowledge accumulation and scenario planning of their advantages naturalizes worst case scenario risk management that solidifies biopolitical domination</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Didier Bigo 2006</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Globalized (in)Security: the field and the ban-opticon</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">“The greatest measure of control is exercised….the diasporas, migrants and, if the argument holds, tourists.”</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Continuing to stress how useful immigrants are for our economy does not change conservative’s minds – rather it solidifies an image of the state as being a political entity that alleviates anxiety which guarantees the scapegoating of immigrants as harbringers of danger. This assumes their link turn and says the alternative is a better mechanism </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Didier bigo 2002</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Security and immigration: toward a critique of governmentality of unease; alternatives 27 special issue, pg 63-92</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">My hypothesis is that the securitization of immigration…the immigrant as an “outsider, inside the state.” </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Their identification of external sources of fascism/warfare/conflict is founded upon a life denying politics of ressentiment in which we obfuscate the production of danger and destruction from the fascism in our heads by blending into an egotist herd mentality</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mark Seem 1972</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, pg xvi-xvii</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">In a security that amounts to being lost in the herd…that cares little about preserving or affirming life</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Status quo constructions of the immigrant uniquely privilege statecraft and guarantee the assimilation and annihilation of anti-state criticism. As such our criticism expands the political imagination by embodying a line of flight for a-institutional politics</span><br />

the paradoxical logic of weapons produced never to be used allows warfare to take on a far more insidious form of immaterial violence in the form of reducing the world to a series of targets, causes nucelar annihiliation<br />

<br />
the consumation of the affirmatives attempt to solve is merely the repression of the visible elements of their impact, securing the blindspot in metaphysics in the disqualifiaction of the invisible as ontologically nothing. the specter of militarism as a byproduct of the united states reinvigorated sense of moral responsibility and manigest destiny will invariably haunt their solvency. <br />

The affirmative’s pseudo-criticism of American Imperialism notwithstanding, the ontological construct of America’s mission to set an example for the world establishes a new façade for Pax American to humanize itself under. <br />

<br />
But america’s support of France…march of the nation across the continent. <br />

The affirmative views the US as merely a recipient of sex trafficking- this obfuscates the way that American culture directly solidifies an ontology of exchange and marketability that solidifies trafficking- the aff humanizes this <br />

Their attempt to smooth over the exclusions of law replicates the idea that the State is ultimately responsiblt for protecting aginst injury. This leads to ressentiment. <br />

The criminalization of disease produces medicine in a purely negative ethic orietnted around subtracting form life that which we determine diseased. This notion of health constructs an idealized, unreachable image of the human body, producing irresolvable guilt supplemented by a desire for self desturciton and the inability to ever affirm life. <br />
