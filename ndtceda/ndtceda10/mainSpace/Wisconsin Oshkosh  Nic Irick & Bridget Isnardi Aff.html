The current political system engages in strategic action in order to manipulate everyone and everything by identifying a proper place and actions that maybe taken—this is what happens when the United States determines who and for what reasons someone may enter the country—but this isn’t the only way of being, there is also tactical action that can be taken<br />

<br />
A distinction between strategies....bet on place or on time.<br />
<br />
This is why we affirm the everyday tactical action of the resolution. One example of everyday tactical action is poetry. This is an example<br />
<br />
A poem is read here, the exact poem will be put up soon. It just changed the night before GSU.<br />
<br />
But don’t get us wrong, this poem just read is not the only way to understanding the political world—our affirmative is not about bringing any form of knowledge and insight to the forefront exclusively, but to have all forms of insight accepted<br />

<br />
The case studies in my book .....relations scholarship.<br />
<br />
And the poem read is an example of everyday tactical action against the domination of the hegemonic structures. Tactical Action can slowly challenge norms and structures to be more tolerant and understanding by opening up the space for critical thought and questioning of current politics<br />

What is left of the concept.....irrational, absurd, taboo.48<br />
<br />
The space that opened can create a new type of policy that is resistant to hegemonic practices that are traditionally placed upon the immigrant. Instead the policy needs to not just tolerate the immigrant, but to open up space for the immigrant to portray themselves with their everyday tactical actions— this has the potential to transform society as our repressive systems become exposed by the juxtaposition of the immigrant<br />

<br />
I’ve been attempting throughout .....counter public spheres.<br />
<br />
There are two impacts to this opening of space through tactical action.<br />
First, we avoid the destruction of ones being by exposing repressive hegemonic practices-- this outweighs all other impacts including extinction<br />

Zimmerman, 94 (Michael, Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, Contesting Earth's Future, pg 119-120)<br />
<br />
Heidegger asserted that .....disclosed” by humanity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, the opening of space ensures communication which can expose and prevent structural violence<br />
<br />
Habermas, Prof Phil @Frankfurt, 2003<br />
(Jurgen, Philosophy in a Time of Terror, p 35)<br />
<br />
Since September 11 I have often ...needs to be repaired.<br />
<br />
And, Structural violence outweighs the neg impacts<br />

How legitimate is it to ascribe....most serious flaw.
