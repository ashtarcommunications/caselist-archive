<br />
A &quot;new dynamic&quot; has emerged in the Doha ?many divisions in the talks remain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Specifically, there?s no deal on service liberalization now. This is because the U.S. won?t credibly budge on Mode 4.<br />

The U.S. business community is stepping up pressure on the Bush administration to move more aggressively to spur progress in the so-called Mode 4 talks ?developed-country offers on Mode 4.?<br />
<br />
<br />
H-1Bs are key ? they?re the most valuable Mode 4 commitment and unlock Mode 3.<br />

<br />
Mode 4 refers to delivery of services by movement of natural persons from one country to another to perform a service.2 A bloc of developing countries ? seeking additional Mode 4 access.<br />
<br />
Alt causes from the ag topic don?t cut it ? Credible Mode 4 actions unlock Mode 3 and unlock other Doha issues. This also causes energy service deals.<br />

That is ironic, because services liberalization through the WTO ?for them to sign off on a deal, too.<br />

(Note: the following serves as factual proof that Singh is part of the UPA and Congress party. It is often confusing that “Congress” refers to a single Indian Political party and *not* the legislative body which is called the “Parliament”. This evidence is from wikipedia’s UPA entry. And, while Wikipedia may normally suck, they did not get this one wrong. <br />

<br />
The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) is a ruling coalition of center-left/centrist political parties heading the government of India. The coalition is led by the Indian National Congress (INC), which is currently the single largest political party in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament of India). The Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, and the Council of Ministers are drawn from members of the UPA. INC's President, Sonia Gandhi, serves as the Chairwoman of the UPA.)<br />
