The title of the TVPA is a misnomer. n38 Although one of the main functions of the act is to protect human trafficking victims,</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;"> <strong><u>the overemphasis on prosecution of traffickers has rendered the act an ineffective tool in providing aid to victims of human trafficking</u></strong>. n39 <strong><u>The level of assistance a victim of human trafficking receives is strongly correlated to the victim's ability and willingness to cooperate with law enforcement officials</u></strong></span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">. n40 What is important for law enforcement to understand is that emphasizing prosecution of traffickers, rather than protection of victims, undermines the intent of Congress in passing the TVPA.</span><br />
