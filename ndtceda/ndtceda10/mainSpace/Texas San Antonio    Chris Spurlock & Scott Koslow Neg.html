<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As a child I dreamed at dusk – schitzo-maniacal fucked up flows of intensities… oozing, spewing, spinning… - around me – the world – I never grasped, always went, never stopping at swampland to build… for it was unheard of on my block, thus I had none to lay…</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Play, - never shouted by large, curly haired men, pouring out sweat faster than words, ranting about a community to come as he pesters her for purchase of those clear plastic boots with the goldfish inside.</span><br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> No planes striated, only fading streaks traced and strummed against my window in the rear… No ‘saying no’ – snow, to swim, warm only… tasting of grape, cherry, and chilled jesus juice</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Or at least I think, - I cant really say for certain, for neither words nor certainty existed, … there, then… and now memories flee at first sight of these things, even if I remembered them in the first place.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This problem disappeared as I grew older, or possibly dreams themselves began… yet intercom vibrations of mr. green and stranger danger birthed hearty organs within me, as they pounded against my ears as if a tub I bathe. Yet as I grew, so to did a parasite inside… An ugly, evil little beast, the likes of Muhammad jiahad or satan himself – feeding from the sermon offerings of father maple as I his bread, and as the warmth of his love grew warmer, my lust more cold – sharing endorphins to prevent their release the voices grew louder and louder – anxious, over exited, and rock hard, I could do nothing more than set them to a lounge beat. They kept their rhythm in perfect time, adopting its name to avoid the uttering of mannilow, progressing in harmony (-) with myself, closer and closer to cadence…</span><br />

Why did koslow have to glance at me with those beautiful, understanding eyes? – It just came out, I demanded it, all of it to cross my lips in the same name of all those dreams before…</span><br />

In 1934, Hannah Arendt fled Germany as a Jew under the Nazi regime. From here, she spent 15 years as a refuge in Europe, turned away by every state, robbed of any political protection, literally unhomed. She lived through the experience of constant migrant in her 15 years without a home, and yet the inclusion the various states of Europe and the US offered to her was a sham; she was rightless, as a stranger in a strange land. Finally, in 1959 she was welcomed back to Germany – to the free city of Hamburg, to receive the Lessing prize for Humanism. Yet this gesture of the state to the displaced migrant was a sham, an attempt at purifying the country's cultural memory. Lisa Disch explains:<br />
<br />
Lisa Disch. “On Friendship in 'Dark Times'.” In: Feminist Interpretations of Hannah Arendt. Ed. Bonnie Honig. 1995. Page 291-292.<br />
<br />
This critique of modernity ....<br />
Hitlerism&quot; in its own way (MDT 18).<br />
<br />
This act of welcoming the migrant, which we can see mirrored in the 1AC, fit well within Germany's totalitarian history. Yet Hamburg of 1959 was not the Hamburg of 1934, and the US is not Nazi Germany. As Arendt says: fascism has its roots in liberalism, yet liberalism is not fascism. Yet in the case of worker's visas this is precisely what liberalism becomes. Migrants are valued solely for their labor, they are defined as laborers excluded from politics, preventing any expression of their selves.<br />

<br />
As Warner makes clear, in their .....<br />
performed in the political realm.<br />
<br />
We would thus take up the gesture of Arendt upon receiving the Lessing Prize for Humanism. She refused the ability of the state to act as a custodian of national memory, instead taking political action as a Jew, as an excluded migrant, to forge a role for herself within politics. This was her address upon receiving the award:<br />

 <br />
In the beginning, there was the void. Not even nothing, because for there to be nothing there must be a something. Then, God said “Let there be light,” and there was. And he separated the light from the dark, the heavens from the earth, and the land from the sea. This was the originary act, the ungrounded ground for all life – which sprung from the void – perpetrated by the unmoved-first-mover. According to the Torah, when God had separated land from sea, when God had created all the plants and the animals and the stars in the sky, God looked down on them and saw that it was good. Yet from where did the inspiration for this miraculous whole, which is at every moment becoming something new and phenomenal, from where did it spring? God was in the void, with neither light nor dark, heaven nor earth, sea nor land, beyond all forms and influence. So from where did this order spring?<br />
<br />
Leonardo De Vinci used to tell his students to stare at a blank, white wall until the lines in the paint, cracks, and caulking formed into an image, and then to paint that image. Andre Breton advised students to gaze at clouds until landscapes and portraits, forms and monsters appeared, as a source of inspiration. WELL- I prefer the beaches, that boundary between land and sea, and the forms inscribed upon them. Lines and circles in the sand.<br />
<br />
I like to build castles, complete with castle walls, borders, and boundary stones. Yet every night the tide comes in and erases it, forcing me to begin again, to refound a new order on the blank, limitless expanse of sand.<br />
<br />
<br />

In 1948, Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Guggenheim museum of art in New York City, and its design is unique. From the outside, it looks like a giant “white ribbon curled into a cylindrical stack.”[[#sdfootnote1sym|1]] On the inside, it's a spiral slope, going five stories high. With each circumscription of the tower, you follow the history of an artistic movement, from the transgressive rupture that founds the new style, through it's growth, sustenance, decline, and death. Following this spiral from bottom to top, with each circle you follow the same story told differently, repeated for impressionism, post-impressionism, futurism, and on – each path beginning at inception and continuing to death. This is opposed to most art museums, which are designed in one of two ways: With big open spaces and small walls – nothing more than spots to hang paintings, where you wander around aimlessly, unsure of where you've been or where you're going. Or else with long corridors, where you follow a linear path from room to room, hallway to hallway, never swerving from the prescribed way.<br />
<br />
I've always wondered what would happen if they placed an elevator in the Guggenheim, so that you could climb on, press a button, and move from one style to another. I would board the elevator, close my eyes, and push a button at random, allowing it to take me to a new style, a new movement, a new way of viewing the world.<br />

In the medieval period, the European state system expanded, bringing more and more land under their control, until they reached the ocean, which resisted all appropriation. Here, they encountered the Leviathan:<br />
<br />
“1 Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?<br />
2 Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? 3 Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words? 4 Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life? 5 Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls? 6 Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? 7 Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? 8 If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again! 9 Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering. 10 No-one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me? 11 Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me. 12 I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form. 13 Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle? 14 Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth? 15 His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together; 16 each is so close to the next that no air can pass between. 17 They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted. 18 His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn. 19 Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out. 20 Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds. 21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth. 22 Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him. 23 The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable. 24 His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone. 25 When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing. 26 The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin. 27 Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood. 28 Arrows do not make him flee, slingstones are like chaff to him. 29 A club seems to him but a piece of straw, he laughs at the rattling of the lance. 30 His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing-sledge. 31 He makes the depths churn like a boiling cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment. 32 Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair. 33 Nothing on earth is his equal— a creature without fear. 34 He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud.”[[#sdfootnote2sym|2]]<br />
Until the 15th century, sailors never strayed far from land, fearing that if they deviated from land too far, away from the coastal shelf or thoroughly mapped currents, they would be lost to the Leviathan forever. Hence the ambivalent attitude towards the seas.<br />
<br />
In Homer's Odyssey, Ulysses is constantly asked whether he is a pirate or a merchant – and he would always answer pirate. Merchants were the despised foreigners who exploited workers for their riches. They were an affront to traditional values, thieves and robbers. Pirates weren't thieves. “[P]iracy was a crime with extenuating circumstances”[[#sdfootnote3sym|3]] They risked the Leviathan, targeting merchants, for honor and glory. They went beyond where anyone else could or would follow. Then returned to ports of harbor to give their riches to the poor in exchange for booze, drugs, in sex – certainly a hero in my book.<br />
<br />
All this changed with the astrolabe.<br />
<br />
The astrolabe allowed navigators to determine latitude by the position of the sun and the North Star. The chronometer allowed them to determine longitude by their speed and the true time. Now, deep sea voyage was possible, now the nations of the world could chase those damn pirate thieves to their ports of asylum and hunt them down. Now, “The sovereign decides whether these figures will be killed, introduced as famuli, or ignored on the sea.”[[#sdfootnote4sym|4]] Now the great sea empires could colonize North America, South America, Africa, and the world. All you needed was a map and an astrolab and chronometer to find your location on it, and the government could exert their reach universally, anywhere on earth.<br />

Mikkel Thorup explains:<br />
<br />
“What makes this work interesting is that it can serve us as a way to understand Schmitt’s simultaneous critique and fascination of liberal internationalism, in particular the American ‘new imperialism’. European international law was, according to Schmitt, based, inscribed or grounded in earth, territory, boundaries drawn on the land and, ultimately, on the division into states. From this, as we have already seen, derives the real, the contained, the most peaceful available kind of law, war and enmity. The Europe of land-based law is the classical epoch, the era of the jus publicum Europaeum, where Europe writes the law. This state of (idyllized) international relations is disrupted, when Britain turns to the sea. We get what we could call the maritime borderland, which is incomparably stronger to repress, codify and fill with statehood than the continental land mass. A split is introduced in Europe. Law based on land develops, according to Schmitt, a codified war, a contained enmity, where state confronts state, each with a regularized army. Only the fighting armies are in principle enemies and the civilian population is considered beyond the fightings. This is the scene of the conventional enmity. But once a dominant power turns to the sea, all this changes, because the sea is a stateless space, which renders the interstate containment of enmity impossible (2003b: 382). Britain initiates a ‘space revolution’ in its choice of the sea (1981: 54-7). Out of Britain’s maritime dominance (in the hunt to fill the non-European borderland with colonial dominance, which shows that the non-European world beyond the line was both precondition and destroyer of the Eurocentric order), the absolute enmity re-emerges. The sea is a natural borderland. It isn’t owned by anyone, it defies proper institutionalization or demarcation and it evades being filled with infrastructural power. The sea resists the state. The sea, then, offers another law, another organizational, political and juridical modus operandi, which stands in direct opposition to the state or land based order. In the years 1588-1688 the island of England detaches itself from mainland Europe and becomes the metropolis of an overseas world empire and the creator of the industrial revolution, all this without attaining the continental state characteristics (1985: 66-7). Free trade, industry and safe passage became catchwords of a new universalist-liberal world order, which breaks down the line separating Europe from the rest of the world. A line which used to be defined, according to what Schmitt considered substantial notions of similarity and equality, rather than the new functionalist and internationalist notions of a one world (market).<br />
The paradigmatic war of the state/land order is the clash on the battlefield. The paradigmatic war of the maritime order is the sea war. Inherent in the two are, according to Schmitt, completely different concepts and realities of both war and enmity. In the sea war the war effort is also directed against the trade and economics of the enemy. This makes civilians and neutrals direct participants in the war (1981: 87-8; 1995c-e; 1995f: 253-9): “The British sea war is total in its capacity for a total enmity. It knows, like only one of the great world historical arts of war, how to mobilize religious, ideological, psychological and moral force” (1994k: 271). The war is not won through a decisive battle but by starving and exhausting the enemy: Blockade, economic pressure, sanctions. Sea war is, according to Schmitt, the first liberal war and its implicit logic is a ‘space-abolishing universalism’ (1995d: 390),34 which, in Schmitt’s understanding, is the first reappearance of the borderland in Europe. The British are, according to Schmitt, not even principally against exodus, against moving their nation elsewhere, which shows the same kind of lack of attachment to the land, as he thought to discover in Protestants who could erect their industry anywhere (1995c: 421). Schmitt’s narrative is based on the presumption of benign limitation, that is, of the moderating effects of being embedded in a particular, limited context and the dangers of universalist disembedding; and on a very selective reading of the history of warfare, which dramatizes the difference between land and sea warfare. This is important to bear in mind, as much of the strength of Schmitt’s argument is preconditioned upon this difference, but I’ll argue that his critique can be uphold and developed without this questionable real-historical foundation.<br />
The return of absolute enmity threatens to destroy European interstate law and thereby the containment of war inherent in the paradigm. The enemy is no longer the concrete other on the battlefield but is on the contrary being portrayed as the enemy of humanity. As the battlefield shifts to the sea, the constraints of enmity are abolished. The sea war reintroduces the private contractor of violence, which the nation state had incorporated and conquered as a precondition for its sovereign status. Privateers, freebooters and pirates with semi-public authorization enter the war, blurring the boundary between combatant and civilian on the side of both perpetrator and victim. It is also highly significant that the turn to the sea wasn’t a state decision but a move initiated by whalers, privateers, adventurers and trade companies (1981: 29-44; 1995c: 412-4). The former divide between enemy and criminal, combatant and civilian/neutral, war and policing, ultimately between war and peace dissolves. The enemy is criminalized, which again leads to interventions described as police actions or punitive expeditions. The legitimization of war goes from being described in terms of state interest to that of morality. This is no sign of progress in Schmitt’s theory. The new sea- based warfare (which is, of course, also conducted on land, it’s a general mode of war) requires a new concept of enmity to justify its means of combat: The concept of ‘enemy of humanity’ is, according to Schmitt, utterly meaningless, as humanity as such cannot have an enemy, as he/she/they would then be effectively non-human. But the concept is still very useful politically- ideologically: “’Humanity’ is an especially useful ideological instrument for imperial expansions” (1996a: 55). One side is prosecutor, judge and executioner, whereas the other side is ‘enemy and criminal, vermin and criminal’ (1991b: 76). A new discriminatory concept of war emerges. The concept of enemy is lifted from the concrete confrontation; the aim of the war is no longer just the defeat of a present and actual enemy; the interested parties in the conflict are no longer two or a few more states; the battlefield is no longer geographically contained and the duration of the war is no longer temporally contained; the war is now a just war, the enemy a global criminal and the war aim suddenly “concerns the whole world and is of global significance: It is about naming the political opponent as a criminal who acts against the interest of the whole world and who is the last barrier before world peace” (2005c: 664). To invoke humanity is to occupy a universal concept and thereby immunize one’s own position and defame that of the other. Schmitt is fond of quoting Proudhon, who allegedly said: “Whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat” (1996a: 55). This change in operative enmities makes war more not less likely. It provides new possibilities for ‘international hostis-declarations’ and it “legitimates and sanctions some kinds of wars” (1996a: 52 &amp; 57) As Schmitt says in the closing lines of Der Begriff des Politischen, we have seen the introduction of:<br />
... a new, essentially pacifist vocabulary, which no longer knows war but now only executions, sanctions, punitive expeditions, pacifications, protection of treaties, international police, arrangements to secure the peace. The adversary is no longer called the enemy but instead breaker or disturber of the peace, hors-la-loi and hors l’humanité, and a war waged to protect and expand positions of economic power must, through the use of propaganda, be turned into a ‘crusade’ and to ‘the last war of humankind’. This is required in the astonishingly systematic and consequent polarity of ethics and economics. But this apparently unpolitical and even anti-political system too serves either existing or newly emerging friend/enemy groupings and cannot escape the logic of the political. (1996a: 77-8)”[[#sdfootnote5sym|5]]<br />

<br />
In Le Mort d'Arthur, Arthur was granted the position of King, because he could pull a sword from a stone. This new order is what made the lord into God-Kings, what allowed a king to change holy writ through an act of law. They ruled the land, they drew the borders, not out of truth or morality, but out of freedom and lightness, like a child making sand-castles on the beaches. Sergei Prozorov states:<br />
<br />
“Secondly, the political is argued to be independent of ethical, economic and aesthetic content. If the enemy is ultimately not the bad, the ugly or the economic competitor, if the friend does not stand for the good, the beautiful and the economically useful, one may observe that the distinction lacks any substance at all.18 “The political can derive its energy from the most varied human endeavours, from the religious, economic, moral and other antitheses. It does not describe its own substance, but only the intensity of an association or dissociation of human beings [...]”19 Once a certain level of intensity is reached, the moral, the economic or the religious acquire a political dimension: “the point of the political may be reached from the economic as well as from any other domain.”<br />
Schmitt takes care to note that no such level of intensity can be theoretically prescribed and may only be decided by actual participants in a concrete situation: the enemy is “the other, the stranger; and it is sufficient for his nature that he is, in a specially intense way, existentially something different and alien, so that in the extreme case conflicts with him are possible. These can neither be decided by a previously determined general norm nor by the judgment of a disinterested and therefore neutral third party.”21 Contrary to many interpretations,22 Schmitt not merely refuses to ‘legitimise’ war as a ‘social ideal’23 but in fact denies the very possibility of normatively justifying any recourse to ‘physical killing of human beings’, including the ‘wars to end all wars’ and ‘wars for peace’ practiced by the pacifist militants of liberalism. In contrast to the enormous hypocrisy that we observe in the attempts to legitimise liberal aggression, the Schmittian position manifests an admirable sincerity:<br />
It is a manifest fraud to condemn war as homicide and then demand of men that they wage war, kill and be killed, so that there will never again be war. War, the readiness of combatants to die, the physical killing of human beings who belong on the side of the enemy – all this has no normative meaning, but an existential meaning only, particularly in a real combat situation with a real enemy. There exists no rational purpose, no norm, no matter how true, no program no matter how exemplary, no social ideal no matter how beautiful, no legitimacy nor legality which could justify men in killing each other. If such physical destruction of human life is not motivated by an existential threat to one’s own way of life, then it cannot be justified. Just as little can war be justified by ethical and juristic norms.<br />
Deprived of normative substance, the political becomes elusive by definition, its entire definition contained in its undefinability. The political act can not be defined, simply because it is itself that which defines, defines the positivity of order while eluding subsumption under its definition. The friend-enemy distinction is an act of existential decision, a constitutive practice that is not grounded in truth or morality and is rather made possible by this very ungroundedness: “The decision frees itself from all normative ties and becomes in the true sense absolute”. The political decision does not draw on the categories of the moral or the economic to justify itself, it does not make a reference to the pre-existing, but rather brings into existence in what may be read as a “free act of artistic genius”. The Schmittian enemy, ‘existentially different and alien’, is neither different from or alien to a pre-existing self, nor antecedent to that self in its existential strangeness. Both the friend and the enemy, the self and the other, owe their existence to the decisionist act of distinction that brings them into being simultaneously. The concept of the political therefore consists entirely in a constitutive decision, or, more precisely, in the decision that is always constitutive: “There can never be absolutely declaratory decisions.”27 Divorced from substantive content, the political is to be isolated in the acts that possess an intense force of constitution, acts that are ontogenetic28 in relation to the social order, acts that give it form by escaping from it: “The constitutive, specific element of the decision is from the perspective of the content of the norm new and alien.”29 In Derrida’s terms, “this founding [...] moment of law is, in law, an instance of non-law [...] It is the moment in which the foundation of law becomes suspended in the void or over the abyss, suspended by a pure performative act that would not have to answer to or before anyone.”30 Thus, the political is also an undeconstructible element within order, since it is rather the function of the concept to deconstruct its assertion of self-immanence. The ontological status of the supplement is not substantive (or identitarian) but existential: the political isn’t anything in a strict sense, it simply is.”[[#sdfootnote6sym|6]]<br />

Under these conditions, the knights of the round table waged war against their neighbors. Every fiefdom was an enemy, yet given the limitedness of this order, they could also make piece. All this changed when Lancelot slept with the queen – an affront against the Catholic Church.<br />

In 1950, Carl Schmitt prophesied that the US would win the Cold War and extend liberalism around the world. Today, we find ourselves in the interregnum, a time which Spanos defines as “a realm of in-between – the no more of the gods that have fled and the not-yet of the gods that are coming.” The USSR has fallen, yet the US has yet to win out. Like the time between the death of a king and succession of their heir, we find ourselves suspended in the void, waiting for the inscription of a new ruler and a new order.<br />
<br />
Now the nation-state order extends through the world – and the US wants to draw a new, international order of globalized, democratic states, working together in democratic peace and harmony. Yet who remains the enemy? Baudrillard explains that:<br />
<br />
“'We may assume', wrote Victor Segalen, 'that fundamental differences will never resolve themselves into a truly seamless and unpatched fabric; increasing unity, falling barriers and great reductions in real distance must of themselves compensate somewhere by means of new partitions and unanticipated gaps.'”[[#sdfootnote7sym|7]]<br />
<br />
Our new partitions are arrayed against the undemocratic, the nationalistic, the sectarian, the evil – that is, every state that insists on sovereignty against the imposed order of the United States and the West. This new order ensures that:<br />
<br />
“Over recent centuries all forms of violent otherness have been incorporated, willingly or under threat of force, into a discourse of difference which simultaneously implies inclusion and exclusion, recognition and discrimination. Childhood, lunacy, death, primitive societies all have been categorized, integrated and absorbed as parts of a universal harmony. Madness, once its exclusionary status had been revoked, was caught up in the far subtler toils of psychology. The dead, as soon as they were recognized in their identity as such, were banished to outlying cemeteries kept at such a distance that the face of death itself was lost. As for Indians, their right to exist was no sooner accorded them than they were confined to reservations. These are the vicissitudes of a logic of difference.”[[#sdfootnote8sym|8]]<br />

Euripedes stages his play – Hecuba – after the end of the Trojan war. Hecuba, deposed queen of Troy, laments her loses at the hands of Greece: her brother, her son, her husband, her country, her own freedom, and finally her daughter. Troy had stolen Helen, and so Greece came, with God on their side, with justice and virtue and honor on their side, and they had visited their law upon Troy, they had brought justice and vengeance to make Troy pay. And at the end, among the legions of Troy only Hecuba was left to learn this Brutal lesson.<br />
<br />
Two thousand years later, Shakespeare restages Hecuba in his play Hamlet. Hamlet watches the actor, weeping over Hebuca's suffering, and asks:<br />
<br />
“O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wan'd; Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba? What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her?&quot;[[#sdfootnote9sym|9]]<br />
Hecuba is repeated time and again, every night broken down to nothing, to be rebuilt on a new, blank stage. Yet while Hamlet feels nothing for the death of his father, the betrayal of his mother, this actor weeps for Hecuba.<br />

Today, we have lost all fronteers – no more oceans to erase the traces of the night before – we have learned to write upon the land and the sea, the skies and even outer-space. We've extended our reach to the heavens themselves. And yet God is missing:<br />
<br />
“Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly: &quot;I seek God! I seek God!&quot;---As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. Has he got lost? asked one. Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated?---Thus they yelled and laughed.<br />
The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. &quot;Whither is God?&quot; he cried; &quot;I will tell you. We have killed him---you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.<br />
&quot;How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed; and whoever is born after us---for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto.&quot;<br />
Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern on the ground, and it broke into pieces and went out. &quot;I have come too early,&quot; he said then; &quot;my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wandering; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light of the stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than most distant stars---and yet they have done it themselves.<br />
It has been related further that on the same day the madman forced his way into several churches and there struck up his requiem aeternam deo. Led out and called to account, he is said always to have replied nothing but: &quot;What after all are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of God?&quot;”[[#sdfootnote10sym|10]]<br />

Hannah Arendt. “Humanity In Dark Times: Thoughts about Lessing.” Address on Accepting the Lessing Prize of the Free City of Hamburg. 1959. Republished in: Hannah Arendt. Men In Dark Times. 1983. Translated by Clara and Richard Winston.<br />
<br />
The distinction conferred by a free city, and a prize that bears the name of Lessing, are a great honor. I admit that I do not know how I have come to receive it, and also that it has not been altogether easy for me to come to terms with it. In saying this I can ignore entirely the delicate question of merit. In this very respect an honor gives us a forcible lesson in modesty; for it implies that it is not for us to judge our own merits as we judge the merits and accomplishments of others. In awards, the world speaks out, and if we accept the award and express our gratitude for it, we can do so only by ignoring ourselves and acting entirely within the framework of our attitude toward the world, toward a world and public to which we owe the space into which we speak and in which we are heard. […]<br />
When we thus consider the real meaning of public honors and prizes under present conditions, it may occur to us that the Hamburg Senate found a solution to the problem rather like that of Columbus' egg when it decided to link to city's prize with the name of Lessing. For Lessing never felt at home in the world as it then existed and probably never wanted to, and still after his own fashion he always remained committed to it. […] His attitude toward the world was neither positive nor negative, but radically critical and, in respect to the public realm of his time, completely revolutionary. But it was also an attitude that remained indebted to the world, never left the solid ground of the world, and never went to the extreme of sentimental utopianism. […]<br />
Lessing never made his peace with the world in which he lived. He enjoyed “challenging prejudices” and “telling the truth to the court minions.” Dearly though he paid for these pleasures, they were literally pleasures. Once when he was attempting to explain to himself the source of “tragic pleasure,” he said that “all passions, even the most unpleasant, are as passions pleasant” because “they make us … more conscious of our existence, they make us feel more real.” This sentence strikingly recalls the Greek doctrine of passions, which counted anger, for example, among the pleasant emotions but reckoned hope along with fear among the evils. This evaluation rests on differences in reality, exactly as in Lessing; not, however, in the sense that reality is measured by the force with which the passion affects the soul but rather by the amount of reality the passion transmits to it. In hope, the soul overleaps reality, as in fear it shrinks back from it. But anger, and above all Lessing's kind of anger, reveals and exposes the world just as Lessing's kind of laughter in Minna von Barnhelm seeks to bring about reconciliation with the world. Such laughter helps one to find a place in the world, but ironically, which is to say, without selling one's soul to it. Pleasure, which is fundamentally the intensified awareness of reality, springs from a passionate openness to the world and love of it. Not even the knowledge that man may be destroyed by the world detracts from the “tragic pleasure.” […]<br />
He not only wanted no one to coerce him, but he also wanted to coerce no one, either by force or by proofs. He regarded the tyranny of those who attempt to dominate thinking by reasoning and sophistries, by compelling argumentation, as more dangerous to freedom than orthodoxy. Above all he never coerced himself, and instead of fixing his identity in history with a perfectly consistent system, he scattered into the world, as he himself know, “nothing but fermenta cognitionis.” […]<br />
To be sure, the very humanity of man loses its vitality to the extent that he abstains from thinking and puts his confidence into old verities or even new truths, throwing them down as if they were coins with which to balance all experiences. And yet, if this is true for man, it is not true for the world. The world becomes inhuman, inhospitable to human needs – which are the needs of mortals – when it is violently wrenched into a movement in which there is no longer any sort of permanence. That is why ever since the great failure of the French revolution people have repeatedly re-erected the old pillars which were then overthrown, only again and again to see them first quivering, then collapsing anew. The most frightful errors have replaced the “best-known truths,” and the error of these doctrines constitutes no proof, no new pillar for the old truths. In the political realm restoration is never a substitute for a new foundation but will be at best an emergency measure that becomes inevitable when the act of foundation, which is called revolution, has failed. But it is likewise inevitable that in such a constellation, especially when it extends over such long spans of time, people's mistrust of the world and all aspects of the public realm should grow steadily. For the fragility of these repeatedly restored props of the public order is bound to become more apparent after every collapse, so that ultimately the public order is based on people's holding as self-evident precisely those “best-known truths” which secretly scarcely anyone still believes in. [...]<br />
These and similar questions of the proper attitude in “dark times” are of course especially familiar to the generation and the group to which I belong. If concern with the world, which is part and parcel of receiving honors, has never been an easy matter in our times and in the circumstances of our world, it is even less so for us. Certainly honors were no part of our birthright, and it would not be surprising if we were no longer capable of the openness and trustfulness that are needed simply to accept gratefully what the world offers in good faith. Even those among us who by speaking and writing have ventured into public life have not done so out of any original pleasure in the public scene, and have hardly expected or aspired to receive the stamp of public approval. Even in public they tended to address only their friends or to speak to those unknown, scattered readers and listeners with whom everyone who speaks and writes at all cannot help feeling joined in some rather obscure brotherhood. I am afraid that in their efforts they felt very little responsibility toward the world; these efforts were, rather, guided by their hope of preserving some minimum of humanity in a world grown inhuman while at the same time as far as possible resisting the weird irreality of this worldlessness – each after his own fashion and some few by seeking to the limits of their ability to understand even inhumanity and the intellectual and political monstrosities of a time out of joint.<br />
I so explicitly stress my membership in the group of Jews expelled from Germany at a relatively early age because I wish to anticipate certain misunderstandings which can arise only too easily when one speaks of humanity. In this connection I cannot gloss over the fact that for many years I considered the only adequate reply to the question, Who are you? To be: A Jew. That answer alone took into account the reality of persecution. […]<br />
In saying, “A Jew,” I did not even refer to a reality burdened or marked out for distinction by history. Rather, I was only acknowledging a political fact through which my being a member of this group outweighed all other questions of personal identity or rather had decided them in favor of anonymity, of namelessness. Nowadays, such an attitude would seem like a pose. Nowadays, therefore, it is easy to remark that those who reacted in this way had never got very far in the school of “humanity,” had fallen into the trap set by Hitler, and thus had succumbed to the spirit of Hitlerism in their own way. Unfortunately, the basically simple principle in question here is one that is particularly hard to understand in times of defamation and persecution: the principle that one can resist only in terms of the identity that is under attack. Those who reject such identification on the part of a hostile world may feel wonderfully superior to the world, but their superiority is then truly no longer of this world: it is the superiority of a more or less well-equipped cloud-cuckoo-land.<br />
When I thus bluntly reveal the personal background of my reflections, it may easily sound to those who know the fate of the Jews only from Hearsay as if I am talking out of school, a school they have not attended and whose lessons do not concern them. But as it happens, during that selfsame period in Germany there existed the phenomenon known as the “inner emigration,” and those who know anything about that experience may well recognize certain questions and conflicts akin to the problems I have mentioned in more than a mere formal and structural sense. As its very name suggests, the “inner emigration” was a curiously ambiguous phenomenon. It signified on the one hand that there were persons inside Germany who behaved as if they no longer belonged to the country, who felt like emigrants; and on the other hand it indicated that they had not in reality emigrated, but had withdrawn to an interior realm, into the invisibility of thinking and feeling. It would be a mistake to imagine that this form of exile, a withdrawal from the world into an interior realm, existed only in Germany, just as it would be a mistake to imagine that such emigration came to an end with the end of the Third Reich. But in that darkest of times, inside and outside Germany the temptation was particularly strong, in the face of a seemingly unendurable reality, to shift from the world and its public space to an interior life, or else simply to ignore that world in favor of an imaginary world “as it ought to be” or as it once upon a time had been.<br />
There has been much discussion of the widespread tendency in Germany to act as though the years from 1933 to 1945 never existed; as though this part of German and European and thus world history could be expunged from the textbooks; as though everything depended on forgetting the “negative” aspect of the past and reducing horror to sentimentality. It was a grotesque state of affairs when German young people were not allowed to learn the facts that every schoolchild a few miles away could not help knowing. Behind all this there was, of course, genuine perplexity. And this very incapacity to face the reality of the past might possibly have been a direct heritage of the inner emigration, as it was undoubtedly to a considerable extent, and even more directly, a consequence of the Hitler regime – that is to say, a consequence of the organized guilt in which the Nazis had involved all inhabitants of the German lands, the inner exiles no less than the stalwart Party members and the vacillating fellow travelers. It was the fact of this guilt which the Allies simply incorporated into the fateful hypothesis of collective guilt. Herein lies the reason for the Germans' profound awkwardness, which strikes every outsider, in any discussion of questions of the past. How difficult it must be to find a reasonable attitude is perhaps more clearly expressed by the cliché that the past is still “unmastered” and in the conviction held particularly by men of good will that the first thing to be done is to set about “mastering” it. Perhaps that cannot be done with any past, but certainly not with the past of Hitler Germany. The best that can be achieved is to know precisely what it was, and to ensure this knowledge, and then to wait and see what comes of knowing and enduring.<br />
Perhaps I can best explain this by a less painful example. After the First World War we experienced the “mastering of the past” in a spate of descriptions of the war that varied enormously in kind and quality; naturally, this happened not only in Germany, but in all the affected countries. Nevertheless, nearly thirty years were to pass before a work of art appeared which so transparently displayed the inner truth of the event that it became possible to say: Yes, this is how it was. And in this novel, William Faulkner's A Fable, very little is described, still less explained, and nothing at all “mastered”; its end is tears, which the reader also weeps, and what remains beyond that is the “tragic effect” or the “tragic pleasure,” the shattering emotion which makes one able to accept the fact that something like this war could have happened at all. I deliberately mention tragedy because it more than the other literary forms represents a process of recognition. The tragic hero becomes knowledgeable by re-experiencing what has been done in the way of suffering, and in this pathos, in resuffering the past, the network of individual acts is transformed into an event, a significant whole. The dramatic climax of tragedy occurs when the actor turns into a sufferer; therein lies its peripeteia, the disclosure of the denouement. But even non-tragic plots become genuine events only when they are experienced a second time in the form of suffering by memory operating retrospectively and perceptively. Such memory can speak only when indignation and just anger, which impel us to action, have been silenced – and that needs time. We can no more master the past than we can undo it. But we can reconcile ourselves to it. The form for this is the lament, which arises out of all recollection. It is, as Goethe has said:<br />
Pain arises anew, lament repeats<br />
Life's labyrinthine, erring course. […]<br />
At the same time we cannot fail to see the limited political relevance of such an existence, even if it is sustained in purity. Its limits are inherent in the fact that strength and power are not the same; that power arises only where people act together, but not where people grow stronger as individuals. No strength is ever great enough to replace power; wherever strength is confronted by power, strength will always succumb. But even the sheer strength to escape and to resist while fleeing cannot materialize where reality is bypassed or forgotten – as when an individual thinks himself too good and noble to pit himself against such a world, or when he fails to face up to the absolute “negativeness” or prevailing world conditions at a given time. How tempting it was, for example, simply to ignore the intolerably stupid blabber of the Nazis. But seductive though it may be to yield to such temptations and to hole up in the refuge of one's own psyche, the result will always be a loss of humanness along with the forsaking of reality.<br />
Thus, in the case of a friendship between a German and a Jew under the conditions of the Third Reich it would scarcely have been a sign of humanness for the friends to have said: Are we not both human beings? It would have been mere evasion of reality and of the world common to both at that time; they would not have been resisting the world as it was. A law that prohibited the intercourse of Jews and Germans could be evaded but could not be defied by people who denied the reality of the distinction. In keeping with a humanness that had not lost the solid ground of reality, a humanness in the midst of the reality of persecution, they would have had to say to each other: A German and a Jew, and friends. But wherever such a friendship succeeded at that time (of course the situation is completely changed, nowadays) and was maintained in purity, that is to say without false guilt complexes on the one side and false complexes of superiority or inferiority on the other, a bit of humanness in a world become inhuman had been achieved. […]<br />
Lessing, however, rejoiced in the very thing that has ever – or at least since Parmenides and Plato – distressed philosophers: that the truth, as soon as it is uttered, is immediately transformed into one opinion among many, is contested, reformulated, reduced to one subject of discourse among others. Lessing's greatness does not merely consist in a theoretical insight that there cannot be one single truth within the human world but in his gladness that it does not exist and that, therefore, the unending discourse among men will never cease so long as there are men at all. A single absolute truth, could there have been one, would have been the death of all those disputes in which this ancestor and master of all polemicism in the German language was so much at home and always took sides with the utmost clarity and definiteness. And this would have spelled the end of humanity. […]<br />
In spite of the difference between the notions of possessing the truth and being right, these two points of view have one thing in common: those who take one or the other are generally not prepared to sacrifice their view to humanity or friendship in case a conflict should arise. They actually believe that to do so would be to violate a higher duty, the duty of “objectivity”; so that even if they occasionally make such a sacrifice they do not feel they are acting out of conscience but are even ashamed of their humanity and often feel distinctly guilty about it. In terms of the age in which we live, and in terms of the many dogmatic opinions that dominate our thinking, we can translate Lessing's conflict into one closer to our experience, by showing its application to the twelve years and the dominant ideology of the Third Reich. Let us for the moment set aside the fact that Nazi racial doctrine is in principle unprovable because it contradicts man's “nature.” But let us assume for the moment that the racial theories could have been convincingly proved. For it cannot be gainsaid that the practical political conclusions the Nazis drew from these theories were perfectly logical. Suppose that a race could indeed be shown by indubitable scientific evidence, to be inferior; would that fact justify its extermination? But the answer to this question is still too easy, because we can invoke the “Thou shalt not kill” which in fact has become the fundamental commandment governing legal and moral thinking of the Occident ever since the victory of Christianity over antiquity. But in terms of a way of thinking governed by neither legal nor moral nor religious strictures – and Lessing's thought was an untrammeled, as “live and changing” as that – the question would have to be posed thus: Would any such doctrine, however convincingly proved, be worth the sacrifice of so much as a single friendship between two men?<br />

I am convinced that the maps we’ve been shown since grade school – of a vast United States and diverse world, with 5 oceans and 7 continents – is a lie. Instead, the world is confined to an area the size of the supposed New Hampshire. The world is only series of hotels, universities, and airports, surrounded by water. We take off from Chicago O’Hare and circle in a plane for 3 hours before landing 20 miles away at New York JFK. As proof of this I offer debate tournaments. Every tournament I go to sleep in Edmond, only to find myself waking up in Atlanta, San Francisco, Spokane … the location doesn’t matter, everything remains the same.<br />
<br />
The world is a few cities, with no space in between, and life a series of hotel rooms. Pack up your suite in Austin: one toothbrush, one toothpaste, travel shampoo and conditioner, two pairs pants, three pairs socks, three shirts, one jacket. Then wake up Dallas to unpack.<br />
<br />
No longer do we ride across the country side, getting lost, pulling into a small diner you’ve never heard of, stopping every hour at weird and scary rest-stops to pee. No, instead we board a plane, go to sleep, and wake up somewhere else. This is the condition afflicting us all in the epoch of late capitalism. We move from Norman hotel room to Wichita hotel room, and at the same time, the world is as if one big hotel: We leave the Kansas City room, take a few steps down the hall, and enter the Chicago room. How convenient that hotels have begun to name their conference rooms accordingly because even they realize THAT is the condition of our world. Jameson furthers that:<br />
<br />
Now I want to say a few words about escalators and elevators: ... caught as individual subjects.[[#sdfootnote1sym|1]]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Day after day, night after night, it’s always the same question: Are we drinking or cutting cards? This is our escapism, a simple card game. If we have a higher card in the suit of planetary extinction, it trumps your deuce of genocide. This is the world we escape into – no longer even poker, a game of strategy and artifice. No, today we are playing War!, where we slap down our cards and see who wins. Khalilzad beats Mead, Mead beats Sid-Ahmed, Sid-Ahmed beat Berube … God damn it, you played the race card!<br />
<br />
It seems these citations alone, the random shouting of author and date now so effective and efficient, supplant description, explanation, and reference to worldly events and situations that are no longer even necessary. This is the perverse world in which students cloister themselves in Dallas Perkin’s basement for weeks, arriving at noon and leaving after midnight.<br />
<br />
Debate becomes the reason we study philosophy or read the newspaper every day. When life becomes a hotel, debate becomes our life. The supreme irony of this is that we escape the IKEA furniture, the breakfast buffets with 12 types of cereal and no milk, the fake flowers and assembly-line paintings, only to turn debate into the most-postmodern Hotel of them all. The Bonaventure, in which Miami, LA, and Fullerton are replaced by the Paris ’68 room, the Berlin ‘89 room, the Berkeley ‘60’s room. Debate becomes this orgy of difference, like Epcot center, where we can walk out of a Heidegger throwdown, take a few steps down the hall and debate about healthcare politics. Our nights in the hotel, walking from drinking with K-State, to smoking with Wyoming, to hanging out in the judges lounge, is mirrored by our days at the university, Spanos against Trinity, Nietzsche against Texas, Baudrillard against Emory. Everything is so DIFFERENT! –At least, for two hours, then we pack up our tubs, board the airplane, and wake up in a new city reading a new argument.<br />

The big question is: does gaming ... debate realm – not to become poets.[[#sdfootnote2sym|2]]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Debate is our escape, it is our drug. For these two hours, this hotel room is the only place I’d want to be, ‘cause I’ve never found a high greater than reading that perfect card. So we cut more cards, read more arguments, we’ve got to fucking SPEED UP! There’s more to be said, more knowledge to be produced, because more is better – more breadth, more depth, more education.<br />
<br />
God knows there’s no time like the present, and none to spare in the 2NC. But Virillio warns us “Without the freedom to critique and reconstruct, there is no truly free game: we are addicts and nothing more’. […]Virilio cautions against complacent addiction, inviting us to imagine the consequences of technology: those elite pilots disconnected from sensory experience and important societal connections, capable only as a result of their technological dependency.”[[#sdfootnote3sym|3]]<br />
<br />
It seems we have reached Nietzsche’s twilight of the idols, in which “The text finally disappeared under the interpretation.”[[#sdfootnote4sym|4]] The resolution has at last become a fable as our modern preoccupation with procedure has finally triumphed over substance and content. In the pursuit of ensuring that debate provides its participants with a rigorous, yet manageable “research burden” while all along continuing to live up to all those standards of “fairness” and “competitive equity” our liberal academic community holds so dear – it seems that we have neglected the spaces in between.<br />
<br />
Terms such as competitive equity, switch-side – even immigration for God’s sake! – seem to swirl around frantically. Now, in the twilight of our topical idols, the question remains what to do? Don’t get us wrong, as Shanahan said,<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if you hear it, but ... Which is, I think, magical.”[[#sdfootnote5sym|5]]<br />
<br />
This is the quality, above all else, that is circumscribed from our game, our hotel of debate. No matter how many idols we smash, the ballot remains, with the tantalizing promise of victory or threat of loss. Lose sight of this, and you risk going 0/8 like a Stephen Davis puppet show. So we compete; and, as the 1AC proved, we are nothing BUT competitors. Debate has been transformed from a vibrant political engagement, to a game, in which the aff only exists as the enemy of the neg, the neg only exists as the enemy of the aff. This is the ever-present mode we adopt when encountering that difference which threatens to teach us and enrich our lives, we define ourselves in opposition: we are Absolute and everything which differs is Other. Simone de Beauvoir explains:<br />
<br />
Thus humanity is male and ... the Absolute – she is the Other.’ (Beauvoir 1989 xxii)[[#sdfootnote6sym|6]]<br />
<br />
The 1AC invites us in, as long as we’ll participate in their Epcot Center orgy of difference, as long as we’ll be the woman to their man, the Jew to their anti-Semite – as long as we’ll be different in the way dictated by the rules of our game. That they spent most of the 1AC reading preempts proves this: they construct an evil Other onto which they can project all fear and uncertainty. The position of the negative is reduced to a scapegoat, to be shouted down, to be purged.<br />
<br />

<br />
Sartre’s Anti-Semite and Jew, ... be beautified and deified.<br />
<br />
We agree with the 1AC, of course visa restrictions should be removed`, but we would approach debate otherwise. We do not think that the hotel should be torn down or all games are bad, “games have an incredibly imaginative side, a marvelous narrative, a journey through which the player can be transformed into a hero. […]But now the travelers are traveled. Dreamers are dreamed. They are no longer free to move about, they are traveled by the program. They are no longer free to dream, they are dreamed by the program. […] Faced with the plethora of possibilities, what game should we play? Play at being a critic.”[[#sdfootnote7sym|7]]<br />
<br />
Thus we would debate as critique: that is critique as a verb, we refuse final closure, refuse the close the door of our room and move on to the next. Instead, we “discern the value”[[#sdfootnote8sym|8]] of things rather than affirm one plan of action or alternative. Kant explains:<br />
<br />
We deal with a concept dogmatically ... if we consider it as contained under another concept of the object which constitutes a principle of reason and determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely critically if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive faculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking it, without undertaking to decide anything about its object.[[#sdfootnote9sym|9]]<br />
<br />
This means attending to those halls and spaces in between, rather than leaving each debate, each argument, each hope of difference, sequestered within its hotel room. Most of all, this means being open to the possibility of being changed by debate.<br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Sometime after George W. Bush’s war on Iraq turned from being a showcase for twenty-first century American military might into what was instead an increasingly ugly display of American brutality, ineptitude and moral decay, corporate, political and academic elites in the US began to catch a strong case of Sputnik fever—and they wanted the rest of the country to catch it too. Sputnik—that small, 183-pound ball of steel the Russians sent into orbit almost a half-century ago on 4 October 1957, shocking America into a decades-long space and arms race with the Soviet Union—was once again on the lips of a lot of powerful people. Senators Lamar Alexander, Pete Domenici, Jeff Bingaman and John Kerry; former Commerce Secretary Donald Evans, Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, and soon-to-be House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Intel CEO Craig Barrett, ex-IBM CEO Louis Gerstner Jr., and ex-Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine—all were speaking Sputnik talk. So too were the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering, the Council of Graduate Schools and the Association of American Universities.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> What all these individuals and organisations agreed is that America needs a second Sputnik. The US’s position of world dominance is currently under threat, so their argument goes, but the problems for effective response are multiple: the threat is subtle, diffuse (indeed, global) and therefore difficult to pin down; most Americans aren’t paying attention anyways, because they have grown complacent, lazy and expectant of a life of eternal entitlement to privilege; the country’s leadership, furthermore, is misrecognising and failing to protect the true basis of American global power. Contemporary US world dominance rests on military and economic strength, it is true: but these in turn are based on critical past investments in science and technology. ‘Innovation—not military might or divine right—fueled the country’s unprecedented prosperity after World War II’, a January 2005 report from the Business-Higher Education Forum boldly states.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Back in the 1950s, when US global dominance had been similarly challenged by the growing strength of Russia, the launch of Sputnik ‘shocked Americans into the realisation that US scientific and educational leadership could not be assumed’ (AAU, 2006 p. 13). Rising to the occasion, Congress passed in 1958 the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) to rapidly develop science and math education, foreign language and area studies at both the K-12 and college levels. The first major federal engagement in national education in US history, the NDEA represents, according to the Council of Graduate Schools (2005), ‘one of the most significant pieces of legislation of the last fifty years’ (p. 8). Also in 1958, Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Advanced Research Project Agency at the Department of Defense (now known as DARPA). In the first four years after Sputnik alone, federal investment in research and development more than doubled. ‘The greatest scientific and national security significance of Sputnik’, the Association of American Universities (AAU) argues, ‘was America’s response to it’ (p. 14). What we desperately need today is another round of extensive federal investment in research, education and development—and another Sputnik to get the wheels for such a mammoth project rolling once again.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> This resurgence of Cold War nostalgia at the very moment of the country’s engagement in a hot and dirty war in the Middle East is best interpreted as representing both surface-level—though still significant—change as well as deeper continuity. In the realm of electoral politics, Sputnik fever clearly represents a reaction against the ‘anti-science’ excess of the Bush administration, and could portend a welcome change in Washington on matters such as global warming, the environment, energy policy and overall approach to using scientific data and analysis. On the other hand, Sputnik fever picks up an old political past-time of scapegoating US schools for national struggles that are better understood by focusing elsewhere, while furthering the interests of business elites in harnessing public education more fully to their own ends. In relation to the fundamental question of US imperialism, Sputnik fever continues the project of maintaining American world domination through combining free market ideology, military might and high technology: it simply offers new packaging so that Democrats and dissident Republicans can present themselves to the American public and international community as having an alternative vision to the current, highly unpopular Bush administration, while essentially proposing to do more of much the same.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Today, we find ourselves in the interregnum, a time which Spanos defines as “a realm of in-between – the no more of the gods that have fled and the not-yet of the gods that are coming.” The USSR has fallen, yet the 1AC inherency proves the US has yet to win out. Like the time between the death of a king and succession of their heir, we find ourselves suspended in the void, waiting for the inscription of a new ruler and a new order. Carl Schmitt prophesied this condition 60 years ago. In 1950 he said the US would win the Cold War and attempt to extend liberalism around the world, yet we find today that like Greece, Rome, Spain, France, Britain, and every imperial power in the past this strategy inevitably fails and the diverse others of the world refuse to live up to the global order of the US.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Yet the aff continues the futile attempts to rejuvenate the myth of a benign exceptional American as World-Historical police and the Truth of the Planet.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Stuart Tannock. “White-Collar Imperialism: The H-1B Debate in America.” Social Semiotics, 19:3. September 2009.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> This internationalization was driven, in part, … not cost, is the fundamental issue.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">Indeed, it was this myth that debates over H-1B's have been supporting for the past 20 years, and which allowed the US to elevate its nationalist policy to the level of global truth, empirically leading to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Stuart Tannock furthers that the 1AC mirrors this debate perfectly, that: “During the intense debate that raged over whether or not to expand H-1B numbers in the 1990s, arguments focused explicitly on claims of labor shortages in the national economy. The lack of skilled workers available domestically in the vital IT sector, H-1B proponents claimed, was not just harmful to IT employers but threatened to slow down overall economic expansion. Foreign workers had to be brought into the country to perform this essential work. Opponents of the H-1B program focused on challenging these claims of labor shortage and insisted that plenty of skilled citizens were available to work, if employers would only give them a chance, a decent wage and a small amount of on-the-job training (Freeman and Hill 2006; Watts 2001). As Kamat, Mir, and Mathew (2004, 17) suggest, claims that the H-1B program was a ‘‘temporary measure, designed to alleviate short-term labour shortages while appropriate local labour was being trained and developed,’’ provided politically expedient cover at the time for what was actually a longer-term project of opening up the US high-skill labor market to global competition. In hindsight, it seems clear that these debates were part of the opening salvos of the latest stage of neo-liberal reform: in the wake of globalizing capital, trade and production, business and political elites across the world now seek to liberalize the global movement of skilled labor, and create a truly global labor market.”[[#sdfootnote2sym|2]]</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> This globalized way of thinking instantiates a new mode of being with cannot allow any manner of difference, which must assimilate or annihilate everything. William Rasch explains:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> William Rasch. ?uman Rights as Geopolitics: Carl Schmitt and the Legal Form of American Supremacy.Cultural Critique, 54. 2003.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> In the past, we/they, neighbor/foreigner … by some, as an ominous threat.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> This is the root cause of the affirmative's impacts:</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> For Schmitt, the Christianity of Vitoria, … city's moral and legal jurisdiction.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;">So, we stand here today, within the interregnum, and we are forced to make a decision: A decision to include migrants and the World in the centered circle of US global hegemony, or to exclude them. While inclusion and humanism seem the more charitable option, Jean Baudrillard second Rasch when he says: “'We may assume', wrote Victor Segalen, 'that fundamental differences will never resolve themselves into a truly seamless and unpatched fabric; increasing unity, falling barriers and great reductions in real distance must of themselves compensate somewhere by means of new partitions and unanticipated gaps.'”[[#sdfootnote3sym|3]]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Thus, we draw a line in the sand, a line to separate friend from enemy, US from foreigner. By doing so, we undermine the vision of an all-inclusive order, in which a benign, exceptionalist, America hands down justice to the world. This act is radically ungrounded, based only on the vicissitudes of fate and the contingency of history. The foreigner is not a US citizen, and we will act on these distinctions, but only because they happened to be born elsewhere. It forces a recognition that the international arena is a pluriverse in which many ideologies and nations compete for authority, and none can ever win – that an Indian is not a US citizen, yet there, but for the grace of God, go I.</span><br />

Waking life dream of a pimped, prostituted encounter; I recall the virtuous virgin <em>“alterity”</em> - before even able to speak her beautiful name - pure and passionate beyond comprehension and touch she still calls out to me in the melodramatic tones of a mute muse – a radical siren echoing from afar like a ray of light just now reaching, and then already past, reflecting from the screen of my retina - that star burned out several years ago just now seen in all its transparency – <em>“what else could I do – I said I will see what I can do”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|<strong>[1]</strong>]]</span> –</em><br />
<br />
<em>“First as authentic event and then being repeated as farce.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn2|<strong>[2]</strong>]]</span></em> Where the Other once appeared the same now lies, faint and flaccid, infinitely repeating. <em>Difference</em> - proliferating from all directions, every angle, coaxed from each corner, crawl space and corridor to concealment, now from, into the light… and hence Otherness nowhere to be found.

Yet, we continue to strive for this utopia achieved and an orgy concluded - more contact, clearer channels, total information and perfect communication. Life long access to learning, better forms of knowledge and means of obtaining it - increased understanding and exposure to all worldly things, entities, and concepts – tolerance, acceptance, and the right to be different no matter how strange you seem. <em>“We are procurers of encounter, pimps of interfacing and interactivity”</em>, A world absent suffering, and more importantly one that gives us the all ability to live another day, hopefully till the end of time which has been postponed indefinitely – a world of rational animals, of political beings collectively working to bring about a brighter tomorrow by envisioning it today. Nothing is greater than this, I fucking promise! Now give me that Christian side-hug!<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Our current situation confronts us with a double-bind: A system of violence that maintains its hegemony by making everything speak, everyone an authentic subject, returning to each individual autonomy, responsibility, and sovereign narrative capacity - at the same time it is with these very parasitic gifts that we have constituted all of our understandings and strategies of resistance</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif;"> Within this limited frame reliant upon the subject position we have been blinded to a superior force of object practices, via calls parallel the 1AC, situating us in-voluntarily in servitude to the production of the systems own violence</span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: left;">As the affirmative has pointed out, the US finds itself locked within a “war for talent”, for those few best and brightest that must be snatched up from foreign countries. Recently, the president of Google says that a top performing engineer worth 300 times as much as an average one[[#sdfootnote1sym|1]]. Bill Gates said “if it weren't for 20 key people, Microsoft wouldn't be the company it is today.”[[#sdfootnote2sym|2]] So what are we to do? The affirmative's answer is clear: it's all the more urgent that we do whatever necessary to attract those precious few. Yet we can see this logic at work everywhere today, with executives who earn hundreds or thousands of times the salary of their workers, with the deprivation of the third world to feed the US, or – as is only rational – in Google paying that top-performing engineer 300 times as much as the lowly engineers she's able to replace. This locks in a laissez fair system in which values, equality, social welfare are replaced with a hyper-meritocracy. </span><br />

<span style="display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: left;">This situation came about as a result of our own devil's bargain, and as any pop-culture fanatic will tell you, the reward is always fleeting and the cost too high. When confronted with unemployment, loss of jobs in manufacturing and industry, and general unrest among working Americans, leaders of industry and government sold us a vision of a new globalized world – we could outsource our labor, let the rest of the world do our dirty work, and instead we would gain the highly skilled, highly paid jobs. The majority in the US went along with this vision, turning away from politics, unionization, and welfare to education, ensured that this would secure them their future. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #000000; display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: left;">Of course, we would not reiterate the refrain of “Dey took'er jobs!” which is only rooted in the same meritocratic belief that emphasizes competition, nationalism, and economy over politics and social values. In fact, this perverted form of capitalism – alternately dubbed the war for talent or economic nationalism, serves to further racism within the country. Their appeals to Indians as a model minority – as those scappy ethnics who could – is used to prove that meritocracy is true. That anyone, regardless of race or ethnicity, can pull themselves up by their bootstraps. This only furthers the preversion of capitalism, robbing it of any social values or support network. </span><br />

This schizophrenic drive corrupts economic policy and ensures that it fails.</span><br />

<span style="line-height: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in;">Ah, Humanity! The Jews may have been robbed of their place as the chosen nation, the Christians may have been robbed of God, Europe may have been robbed of Science and Enlightenment by the Holocaust, all these Idols have been smashed. Yet the affirmative can cling to their one last idol, Man – Humankind, the height of creation, and the ultimate good, to be protected at all costs. So the affirmative does just that, acting a petty bureaucrats of decision-making to ensure their new-est God is never dethroned, to calculate risks and benefits and prevent extinction. But we would ask a more fundamental question. Daniel Conway says:</span><br />

The difficulty of...viable, thriving species.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in;">The affirmative begs this fundamental question: Is life worth it, is humanity worth it, and so they will always come to the same conclusion: No. Life will never be safe, will never be secure, the values we champion will never win out absolutely, just as sure as you or I will die, so will the human race.

<br />
<span style="line-height: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in; margin-right: 0.2in;"> That is, values devalue themselves, particularly in terms of security. The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world order because life and politics are unpredictable. Terrorism is an ever-present threat, another recession is just around the corner, Africanized bees are infecting our neighborhoods, and there just might be poison in our children's Halloween candy! The affirmative' desire for security becomes a violent desire for only power, where all of life is subsumed under an imperative that inevitably fails. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="line-height: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in;">The ultimate cost of this negative orientation towards life is life itself. As all our highest values collapse on themselves, we're left robbed of any foundation or support. Nietzsche says that it's not pain, but the idea that pain needs to be caused – needs to be explained and justified, that makes us hurt when we lose our bearings of the world. There is no terrorist to imprison, no criminal to accuse, no God to give us ultimate meaning and pacify us, and so the everything hurts.</span><br />
<span style="line-height: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in;"> Locked within this frame, the world is never good enough, constantly devaluing itself of its own accord, rendering itself meaningless.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="line-height: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in;">The only recourse left to the affirmative is to find a scapegoat and eliminate it. The world is not good enough, so we must <em>make it</em> good enough, and to hell with all manner of difference that we find in our way.</span><br />

<span style="line-height: 0.14in; margin-bottom: 0in;">In the face of the affirmative's schizophrenic call to action, our alternative is to do nothing. This is an acceptance of an uncontrollable and unexplainable world. It is a recognition that we are diseased with this condition called life, which will surely kill us all.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: #000000; display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-style: normal; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;">Once upon a time, in some out of the way corner of that universe which is dispersed into numberless twinkling solar systems, there was a star upon which clever beasts invented knowing. That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of &quot;world history,&quot; but nevertheless, it was only a minute. After nature had drawn a few breaths, the star cooled and congealed, and the clever beasts had to die. One might invent such a fable, and yet he still would not have adequately illustrated how miserable, how shadowy and transient, how aimless and arbitrary the human intellect looks within nature. There were eternities during which it did not exist. And when it is all over with the human intellect, nothing will have happened. For this intellect has no additional mission which would lead it beyond human life. Rather, it is human, and only its possessor and begetter takes it so solemnly-as though the world's axis turned within it. But if we could communicate with the gnat, we would learn that he likewise flies through the air with the same solemnity, that he feels the flying center of the universe within himself. There is nothing so reprehensible and unimportant in nature that it would not immediately swell up like a balloon at the slightest puff of this power of knowing. And just as every porter wants to have an admirer, so even the proudest of men, the philosopher, supposes that he sees on all sides the eyes of the universe telescopically focused upon his action and thought.

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">Too far into the future did I fly; dread fell upon me.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And when I looked around, behold! Then time was my only contemporary.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Then I fled backward, homeward – with ever greater haste. Thus I came to you, you of the present, and into the land of education.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> For the first time I brought along eyes for you, and a strong desire; indeed, I came with longing in my heart.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> But what happened to me? As frightened as I was – I had to laugh! Never had my eyes seen anything so splattered with colors!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> I laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled and my heart as well: “This must be the home of all paint pots!” I said.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> With fifty blotches painted on your face and limbs, thus you sat there to my amazement, you people of the present!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And with fifty mirrors around you, flattering and echoing your play of colors!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Indeed, you couldn’t wear a better mask, you people of today, than that of your own face! Who could recognize you!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Written full with the characters of the past, and even these characters painted over with new characters: thus you have hidden yourselves well from all interpreters of characters!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And even if one were to give you a physical examination, who would even believe you have a body? You seem to be baked from colors and paper slips glued together.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Motley, all ages and peoples peek from your veils; motley, all customs and beliefs speak from your gestures.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> If one were to pull away veil and wrap and color and gesture from you, there would be just enough left over to scare away the crows.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Indeed, I myself am the scared crow who once saw you naked and without color; and I flew away when the skeleton beckoned amorously.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> I would rather be a day laborer in the underworld and among the shades of yore! – Even the underworldly are fatter and fuller than you!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> This, oh this is bitterness for my bowels, that I can stand you neither naked nor clothed, you people of the present!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> All uncanniness of the future, and whatever caused flown birds to shudder, is truly homelier and more familiar than your “reality.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> For you speak thus: “We are real entirely, and without beliefs and superstition.” Thus you stick out your chests – alas, even without chests!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Indeed, how should you be capable of believing, you color-splattered ones – you who are paintings of everything that has ever been believed!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Rambling refutations of belief itself are you, and the limb-fracturing of every thought. Unbelievable is what I call you, you so-called real ones!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> All ages prattle against each other in your minds; and the dreams and prattling of all ages were more real than even your waking is!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> You are sterile: therefore you lack beliefs. But whoever had to create also always had his prophetic dreams and astrological signs – and believed in believing! –</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> You are half-open gates, at which the gravediggers wait. And this is your reality: “Everything deserves to perish.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Oh how you stand there, you sterile ones, how skinny in the ribs! And some one of you probably realized this on his own.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And he spoke: “Surely some god secretly removed something from me while I slept? Indeed, enough to form himself a little woman from it!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Wondrous is the poverty of my ribs!” Thus spoke many a person of the present.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Indeed, you make me laugh, you people of the present! And especially when you are amazed at yourselves!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And woe to me if I couldn’t laugh at your amazement, and had to drink down all the repugnant contents of your bowls!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> So I shall take you more lightly, as I have a heavy burden; and what does it matter to me if beetles and winged worms still land on my bundle?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Indeed, it will not become any heavier for that! And not from you, you people of the present, shall my great weariness come. –</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Alas, where shall I climb now with my longing! From all mountains I look out for father- and motherlands.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> But nowhere did I find home; I am unsettled in every settlement, and a departure at every gate.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Foreign to me and a mockery are these people of the present to whom my heart recently drove me; and I am driven out of father- and motherlands.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Thus I love only my children’s land, the undiscovered land in the furthest sea: for it I command my sails to seek and seek.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> I want to make it up to my children for being the child of my fathers; and to all the future – for the existence of this present!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">Thus spoke Zarathustra.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">I know this because he told me. Friedrich Nietzsche himself appeared to me in my room the other night, amidst an orgy of cards and liquor, dreams and visions, gossamer filaments linking Spanos to Nietzsche to Agamben to Morgenthau – and of course an actual orgy as well.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> We were all seated before a wiseman lecturing on sleep. He told us that every day, to have good sleep, we must overcome ourselves ten times. Everyday, to have good sleep, we must reconcile ourselves ten times. Every day we must learn ten truths. Every day we must improve ourselves ten times. And at the end of that day, when we are lying in bed, we must not dwell on sleep. No, that most noble master of virtue – sleep – never answers to such heavy-handed solicitation. Instead, when lying in bed at night we should count the forty triumphs of our day and so ensnare sleep and lure it to us.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> BUT – Nietzsche interjected, every day is then lived for the obliteration of that day. One only wakes up in order to sleep. And with that – the wiseman screeched and we left him. On we went, Nietzsche, the wanderer, his shadow, the ugliest man, a king, his ass, a dwarf, and Scott and I as well – wandering along until we reached a path where we stopped, and:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">Friedrich Nietzsche. “Book 3: On the Vision and the Riddle: 2.” Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Ed. Adrian Del Caro and Robert B. Pippin. 2006. 1885. Page 125-127.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">Stop, dwarf!” I said. “I – or you! But I am the stronger of us two – you do not know my abysmal thought! That – you could not bear!” –</span></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Then something happened that made me lighter, for the dwarf jumped down from my shoulder, the inquisitive one, and he crouched upon a stone there before me. But right there where we stopped was a gateway.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> “See this gateway, dwarf!” [Nietzsche] continued. “It has two faces. Two paths come together here; no one has yet walked them to the end.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> This long lane back: it lasts an eternity. And that long lane outward – that is another eternity.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> They contradict each other, these paths; they blatantly offend each other – and here at this gateway is where they come together. The name of the gateway is inscribed at the top: ‘Moment.'</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> But whoever were to walk one of them further – and ever further and ever on: do you believe, dwarf, that these paths contradict each other eternally?” –</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> “All that is straight lies,” murmured the dwarf contemptuously. “All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> “You spirit of gravity!” [Nietzsche] said, angrily. “Do not make it too easy on yourself! Or I shall leave you crouching here where you crouch, lamefoot – and I bore you this high!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> See this moment!” I continued. “From this gateway Moment a long eternal lane stretches backward: behind us lies an eternity.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Must not whatever can already have passed this way before? Must not whatever can happen, already have happened, been done, passed by before?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And if everything has already been here before, what do you think of this moment, dwarf? Must this gateway too not already – have been here?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And are not all things firmly knotted together in such a way that this moment draws after it all things to come? Therefore – itself as well?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> For, whatever can run, even in this long lane outward – must run it once more! –</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And this slow spider that creeps in the moonlight, and this moonlight itself, and I and you in the gateway whispering together, whispering of eternal things – must not all of us have been here before?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> – And return and run in that other lane, outward, before us, in this long, eerie lane – must we not return eternally? –”</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> [And I stood there, shrinking smaller and smaller], for I was afraid of my own thought and secret thoughts. Then, suddenly, I heard a dog howl nearby.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Had I ever heard a dog howl like this? My thoughts raced back. Yes!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> When I was a child, in my most distant childhood: – then I heard a dog howl like this. And I saw it too, bristling, its head up, trembling in the stillest midnight when even dogs believe in ghosts: – so that I felt pity. For the full moon had passed over the house, silent as death, and it had just stopped, a round smolder – stopped on the flat roof just as if on a stranger’s property – that is the why the dog was so horror-stricken, because dogs believe in thieves and ghosts. And when I heard it howl like this again, I felt pity once more.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Where now was the dwarf? And the gateway? And the spider? And all the whispering? Was I dreaming? Was I waking? I stood all of a sudden among wild cliffs, alone, desolate, in the most desolate moonlight.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> But there lay a human being! And there! The dog jumping, bristling, whining – now it saw me coming – then it howled again, it screamed: had I ever heard a dog scream like this for help?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And truly, I saw something the like of which I had never seen before.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> A young shepherd I saw; writhing, choking, twitching, his face distorted, with a thick black snake hanging from his mouth.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Had I ever seen so much nausea and pale dread in one face? Surely he must have fallen asleep? Then the snake crawled into his throat – where it bit down firmly.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> My hand tore at the snake and tore – in vain! It could not tear the snake from his throat. Then it cried out of me: “Bite down! Bite down!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Bite off the head! Bite down!” – Thus it cried out of me, my dread, my hatred, my nausea, my pity, all my good and bad cried out of me with one shout. –</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> You bold ones around me! You searchers, researchers and whoever among you ever shipped out with cunning sails onto unexplored seas! You riddle-happy ones!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Now guess me this riddle that I saw back then, now interpret me this vision of the loneliest one!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> For it was a vision and a foreseeing: what did I see then as a parable?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And who is it that must some day come?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Who is the shepherd into whose throat the snake crawled this way? Who is the human being into whose throat everything that is heaviest, blackest will crawl?</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> – Meanwhile the shepherd bit down as my shout advised him; he bit with a good bite! Far away he spat the head of the snake – and he leaped to his feet. –</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> No longer shepherd, no longer human – a transformed, illuminated, laughing being!</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Never yet on earth had I heard a human being laugh as he laughed!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">Finally I laughed also, a hollow laughter, for I realized Nietzsche was right when we said:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-style: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">Friedrich Nietzsche. “Eternal Recurrence: 1066-1067.” The Will To Power. Translated by Walter Kaufman and R. J. Hollingdale. 1967. Page 548-550.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">The new world-conception.- The world exists; it is not something that becomes, not something that passes away. Or rather: it becomes, it passes away, but it has never begun to become and never ceased from passing away-it maintains itself in both.- It lives on itself: its excrements are its food.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> We need not worry for a moment about the hypothesis of a created world. The concept &quot;create&quot; is today completely indefinable, unrealizable; merely a word, a rudimentary survival from the ages of superstition; one can explain nothing with a mere word. The last attempt to conceive a world that had a beginning has lately been made several times with the aid of logical procedures – generally, as one may divine, with an ulterior theological motive.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> Lately one has sought several times to find a contradiction in the concept &quot;temporal infinity of the world in the past&quot; (regressus in infinitum): one has even found it, although at the cost of confusing the head with the tail. Nothing can prevent me from reckoning backward from this moment and saying &quot;I shall never reach the end&quot;; just as I can reckon forward from the same moment into the infinite. Only if I made the mistake-I shall guard against it-of equating this correct concept of a regressus in infinitum with an utterly unrealizable concept of a finite progressus up to this present, only if I suppose that the direction (forward or backward) is logically a matter of indifference, would I take the head-this moment-for the tail: 1 shall leave that to you, my dear Herr Duhring!-</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> I have come across this idea in earlier thinkers: every time it was determined by other ulterior considerations (-mostly theological, in favor of the creator spiritus). If the world could in any way become rigid, dry, dead, nothing, or if it could reach a state of equilibrium, or if it had any kind of goal that involved duration, immutability, the once-and-for-all (in short, speaking metaphysically: if becoming could resolve itself into being or into nothingness), then this state must have been reached. But it has not been reached: from which it follows-</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> This is the sole certainty we have in our hands to serve as a corrective to a great host of world hypotheses possible in themselves. If, e.g., the mechanistic theory cannot avoid the consequence, drawn for it by William Thomson, of leading to a final state, then the mechanistic theory stands refuted.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> If the world may be thought of as a certain definite quantity of force and as a certain definite number of centers of force-and every other representation remains indefinite and therefore useless -it follows that, in the great dice game of existence, it must pass through a calculable number of combinations. In infinite time, every possible combination would at some time or another be realized; more: it would be realized an infinite number of times. And since between every combination and its next recurrence all other possible combinations would have to take place, and each of these combinations conditions the entire sequence of combinations in the same series, a circular movement of absolutely identical series is thus demonstrated: the world as a circular movement that has already repeated itself infinitely often and plays its game in infinitum.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> This conception is not simply a mechanistic conception; for if it were that, it would not condition an infinite recurrence of identical cases, but a final state. Because the world has not reached this, mechanistic theory must be considered an imperfect and merely provisional hypothesis.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"> And do you know what &quot;the world&quot; is to me? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end; a firm, iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller, that does not expend itself but only transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a household without expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income; enclosed by &quot;nothingness&quot; as by a boundary; not something blurry or wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force, and not a space that might be &quot;empty&quot; here or there, but rather as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing here and at the same time decreasing there; a sea of forces flowing and rushing together, eternally changing, eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a flood of its forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the most complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms toward the hottest, most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple out of this abundance, out of the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing itself as that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my &quot;beyond good and evil,&quot; without goal, unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself-do you want a name for this world? A solution for all its riddles? A light for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men?- This world is the will to power-and nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this will to power-and nothing besides!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">As Nietzsche spoke the sun materialized behind him, forming a golden halo around his head. He appeared as a saint with a purple halo of fire about his head. He preached:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="text-decoration: none;">“<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,serif;">What concerns me is the psychological type of the Saviour. This type might be depicted in the Gospels, in however mutilated a form and however much overladen with extraneous characters—that is, in spite of the Gospels; just as the figure of Francis of Assisi shows itself in his legends in spite of his legends. It is not a question of mere truthful evidence as to what he did, what he said and how he actually died; the question is, whether his type is still conceivable, whether it has been handed down to us.—All the attempts that I know of to read the history of a “soul” in the Gospels seem to me to reveal only a lamentable psychological levity. M. Renan, that mountebank in psychologicus, has contributed the two most unseemly notions to this business of explaining the type of Jesus: the notion of the genius and that of the hero (“héros”). But if there is anything essentially unevangelical, it is surely the concept of the hero. What the Gospels make instinctive is precisely the reverse of all heroic struggle, of all taste for conflict: the very incapacity for resistance is here converted into something moral: (“resist not evil!”—the most profound sentence in the Gospels, perhaps the true key to them), to wit, the blessedness of peace, of gentleness, the inability to be an enemy. What is the meaning of “glad tidings”?—The true life, the life eternal has been found—it is not merely promised, it is here, it is in you; it is the life that lies in love free from all retreats and exclusions, from all keeping of distances. Every one is the child of God—Jesus claims nothing for himself alone—as the child of God each man is the equal of every other man.... Imagine making Jesus a hero!—And what a tremendous misunderstanding appears in the word “genius”! Our whole conception of the “spiritual,” the whole conception of our civilization, could have had no meaning in the world that Jesus lived in. In the strict sense of the physiologist, a quite different word ought to be used here.... We all know that there is a morbid sensibility of the tactile nerves which causes those suffering from it to recoil from every touch, and from every effort to grasp a solid object. Brought to its logical conclusion, such a physiological habitus becomes an instinctive hatred of all reality, a flight into the “intangible,” into the “incomprehensible”; a distaste for all formulae, for all conceptions of time and space, for everything established—customs, institutions, the church—; a feeling of being at home in a world in which no sort of reality survives, a merely “inner” world, a “true” world, an “eternal” world.... “The Kingdom of God is within you”....”</span></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; text-decoration: none;">[[#sdfootnote3sym|3]]</span></span><br />

<span style="color: #000000; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">We have seen that in Nietzsche's opinion we cannot bear meaningless [pain] and so we give it a meaning. Christianity, for example, explains it as punishment for sin. Eternal recurrence, however, would certainly seem to U (WP 55). It implies that [pain] just happens, it repeats eternally, it is fated. There is no plan, no purpose, no reason for it. Eternal recurrence would seem to rub our noses in meaningless [pain].</span><br />

<span style="color: #000000; display: block; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; text-align: left;"><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">The will to suffer and those who feel compassion</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">. Is it good for you yourselves to be above all else compassionate persons?And is it good for those who suffer if you are compassionate? But let us leave the first question unanswered for a moment. What we most deeply and most personally suffer from is incomprehensible and inaccessible to nearly everyone else; here we are hidden from our nearest, even if we eat from the same pot. But whenever we are </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">noticed</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> to be suffering, our suffering is superficially construed; it is the essence of the feeling of compassion that it </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">strips</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> the suffering of what is truly personal: our “benefactors” diminish our worth and our will more than our enemies do. In most cases of beneficence toward those in distress there is something offensive in the intellectual frivolity with which the one who feels compassion plays the role of fate: he knows nothing of the whole inner sequence and interconnection that spells misfortune for </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">me</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> or for </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">you</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> The entire economy of my soul and the balance effected by “misfortune”, the breaking open of new springs and needs, the healing of old wounds, the shedding of entire periods of the past – all such things that can be involved in misfortune do not concern the dear compassionate one: they want to </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">help</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> and have no thought that there is a personal necessity of misfortune; that terrors, deprivations, impoverishments, midnights, adventures, risks, and blunders are as necessary for me and you as their opposites; indeed, to express myself mystically, that the path to one's own heaven always leads through the voluptuousness of one's own hell. No, they know nothing of that: the “religion of compassion” (or “the heart”) commands them to help, and they believe they have helped best when they have helped most quickly! Should you adherents to this religion really have the same attitude towards yourselves that you have towards you fellow men; should you refuse to let your suffering lie on you even for an hour and instead constantly prevent all possible misfortune ahead of time; should you experience suffering and displeasure as evil, hateful, deserving of annihilation, as a defect of existence, then you have besides your religion of pity also another religion in your hearts; and the latter is perhaps the mother of the former – </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">the religion of snug cosiness</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">. Oh, how little do you know of the happiness of man, you comfortable and good-natured ones! For happiness and misfortune are two siblings and twins who either grow up together or – as with you </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">remain small</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> together! But now back to the first question. How is it possible to keep to </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">one's own</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> path! Some clamor is constantly calling us aside; rarely does our eye see something there that does not make it necessary to drop our own occupation instantly and spring to assistance. I know, there are a hundred decent and praiseworthy ways of losing myself </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">from my path</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">, and, verily, highly “moral” ways! Yes, the moral teacher of compassion even goes so far as to hold that precisely this and only this is moral – to lose </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">one's own</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> way like this in order to help a neighbor. I, too, know with certainty that I need only to expose myself to the sight of real distress and I, too, </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">am</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> lost! If a suffering friend said to me, “look, I am about to die; please promise to die with me,” I would promise it; likewise, the sight of a small mountain tribe fighting for its freedom would make me offer my hand and my life – for once to choose bad examples, for good reasons. Yes, there is a secret seduction even in all these things which arouse compassion and cry out for help, for our own way is so hard and demanding and so far from love and gratitude of others that we are by no means reluctant to escape from it, from it and our ownmost conscience – and take refuge in the conscience of others and in the lovely temple of the “religion of compassion.” As soon as any war breaks out, precisely the noblest men in the population immediately begin to experience a delight which is, to be sure, kept secret: they throw themselves rapturously into the new danger of </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">death</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> because it seems to offer them that long desired permission – the permission </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">to deviate from their goal</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">; war offers them a detour to suicide, but a detour with a good conscience. And although I will keep quiet here about some things, I do not wish to keep quiet about my morality, which tells me: Live in seclusion so that you </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">are able</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> to live for yourself! Live </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">in ignorance</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> of what seems most important to your age! Lay at least the skin of three hundred years between you and today! And let the clamor of today, the noise of war and revolutions be but a murmur to you. You will also want to help – but only those whose distress you properly </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">understand </span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">because they share with you one suffering and one hope – your </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">friends</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;"> – and only in the way you help yourself: I want to make them braver, more persevering, simpler, more full of gaiety. I want to teach them which today understood by so few, least of all these preachers of compassion: to share not pain but </span><em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-weight: normal;">joy</span></em><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% #ffffff; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal;">.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;">And with that, I heard a bell chime, 12 times it chimed, limning Noon, that moment of the shortest shadow, the end of the longest error of humankind, the twilight of the topical idols, the hour to philosophize with a hammer. And at the 12th stroke I awoke, to find myself lying in bed, and I laughed.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">Our current situation confronts us with a double-bind: A system of violence that maintains its hegemony by making everything speak, everyone an authentic subject, returning to each individual autonomy, responsibility, and sovereign narrative capacity - at the same time it is with these very parasitic gifts that we have constituted all of our understandings and strategies of resistance </span><br />
