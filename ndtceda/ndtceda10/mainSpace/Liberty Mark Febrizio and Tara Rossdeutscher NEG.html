<strong>DOHA CP:</strong><br />

<strong>The United States Federal Government should abolish all domestic agricultural subsidies and tariffs and drop their opposition to a special safeguard mechanism in the DOHA round of trade talks.</strong> <br />

<strong>Theory:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>ASPEC:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. Violation – The Affirmative fails to specify an agent of action. Rather they just say “United States Federal Government.”</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>B. Failure to specify is illegitimate and a voting issue.</strong><br />
<strong>1. Ground – Specifying an agent is critical to Disads relating to the specific agent of action and Counterplans to use a different agent. The agent must be named in the plan to ensure that Counterplans compete and to maximize the value of pre-round preparation, which is essential at the beginning of the year when strategies are not fully developed.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2. Moving Target – Failure to specify an agent in the plan text allows the affirmative to shift out of 1NC arguments by allowing new 2AC clarification about the agent of action. This makes it impossible for the negative to debate because the AFF could always change their plan after they heard the 1NC arguments.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Topicality:</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Admissibility not Eligibility:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Interpretation-Admissibility is distinct from eligibility under INA §212(a), eligibility is what qualifies an immigrant for a visa whereas admissibility is what allows them entrance to the country</strong><br />
<strong>Hasche 05,</strong><br />
<strong>(Tilman, &quot;An Overview of Immigration Law,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbl.net/IMMIGRANT_SELECTION_SYSTEM.doc</a>) bct</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Act establishes a two check … “lawfully admitted for permanent residence.”</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Violation- The affirmative removes an admissibility requirement which is distinct from an expansion of eligibility.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>C. STANDARDS</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1. Limits. Our Interpretation limits out an infinite number of cases that merely change the admissibility requirements for visas exploding the neg research burden killing fairness</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>2. Ground. Takes away the best ground on the topic by forcing the neg to defend current policy as opposed to negating the positive expansion of eligibility</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>3. Extratopicality. The USCIS lists visa name-number categories according to the 4 groups in the topic. If the aff grows one of those government-listed categories, they are topical. Their interpretation would allow them to remove admissibility standards that relate of any category of visa. This is extratopical, and makes it impossible for the judge to make an objective determination of jurisdiction, which is unfair to both sides.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness, education, and communication. It’s a game of competing interpretations.</strong>
