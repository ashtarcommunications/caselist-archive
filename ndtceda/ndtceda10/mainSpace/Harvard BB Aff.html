<strong>contention 1: the queer migrant, 2011</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Rendered against the backdrop of heteronormativity, queer migrants pose a threat of contamination that must be violently contained through the border</strong><br />
Luibheid in 8<br />
Eithne, director of the institute for LGBT studies and associate prof of women's studies at U of Arizona &quot;Queer/Migration: An unruly body of scholarship&quot; GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies Vol 14 no 2-3 p 170-6<br />
queer migration scholarship has...migration circuits in particular ways<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus Seth and i believe that, 2011: The United States federal government should cease to restrict beneficiary eligibility for family-based visas on the basis of queerness.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>For policy makers this solution seems simple: the statement 'no more queer exclusion' promises to wash away the violence of the status quo by fiat. however, it is precisely this understanding of politics that causes the systemic erasure of the violence of history. Grappling with the crisis of queer migration requires a deeper exploration of exclusion than made possible in traditional policy circles.</strong><br />

<strong>contention 2: the invisibility of history</strong><br />

examining how immigration-control practices... sexual, gender, racial, class, or national characteristics<br />
<br />
<strong>As Luibheid points out, the history of US exclusion is embedded in its immigration policy. by rendering the queer migrant invisible and unintelligible, US visa policy enforces normative positionalities that produce spatial and temporal fields of manageable bodies for total abjection</strong><br />

queer migration scholarship has consistently explored... tied to the abjection of queers and queerness.<br />
<br />
<strong>governmentality requires us to understand the historical genealogy of governance practices, to look back at history instead of forward to the solutions. how queerness is excluded is a certain history, a valorization of a discursive legacy handed down from the past. history is the exclusion of certain practices, the arrangement of subjectivity such that difference can be controlled.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>specifically, this policing of boundaries to protect our &quot;back doors&quot; from the queer immigrant is grounded in the extensive historical narrative of the queer subject and its violent exclusion from US visa policy. the abjection of queer subjects in immigration policy begins not with changes to US immigration policy but the constant organization of discourse that transforms fears of queer mobility into zones of containment.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>contention 3: the biological contaminant, 1917</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>the immigration exclusion criteria of 1917 did not use the terms homosexual, gay, lesbian, or queer. immigration law made no mention of the queer migrant, yet medical discourse and psychological classifications under the guise of public health established the violent exclusion of queerness as different and dangerous. this &quot;normative&quot; social order is the mobilization of the body politic to eradicate the queer threat.</strong><br />

homosexuality as medical and mental illness...discourse perpetuating the medical model.<br />

<br />
<strong>this production of the dangerous queer operates in the permanent state of exception, a grammar of history that constructs teh inhuman queer migrant at the border- this logic of control through division guarantees the murderous functions of the state</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>the end result is omnicide, the convergence of the universal suspicion of queerness and the genocidal impulse to eradicate it motivates a larger apocalyptic movement to rescue hetero-culture by total extermination</strong><br />

<strong>Thus Seth and I believe that, 1917: The United States federal government should cease to restrict beneficiary eligibility for family-based visas on the basis of queerness</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>contention 4: the angel of history</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>the simultaneous affirmation of these statements-one from 2011, one from 1917- produces a resonance between two historical registers, one which ruptures the stratified organization of history that produces the discourses and practices that make exclusion of queerness possible</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>progressive history relies on a linear narrative of history that selectively organizes the past to justify the future. instead of looking forward, you should adopt the position of the queer angel of history who looks backwards and understands the present as the culmination of a series of continuous catastrophes</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>the affirmation of these simultaneous intersections of queer exclusions is a constellation of minor histories that challenges the stratified organization of history against the abjected queer subject. voting affirmative ruptures the sovereign logic of progress- time that culminates in multi-dimensional omnicide</strong><br />

<strong>the conception fo time that imagines history as progress links up biopolitical and totalitarian projects. this conception of the present as perfected and the past as left behind instantiates a project of complete extermination- nothing can stand in the way of the forces of history purifying the world of the queer threat. the only place this can end is the annihilation of everything</strong><br />

<strong>The pathological Policing of Boundaries to protect our “back doors” from the Queer Immigrant, a defense against the penetration of the Queer at our border, is grounded in the extensive historical narrative of the Queer subject and its violent exclusion from US visa policy</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Migration—the symbol of Mobility that threatens to destabilize these violent modes of identification—lies at the foundation of the State’s drive for social order that mandates modern forms of necropolitical power</strong><br />
<br />
Stychin, Pro-Vice Chancellor and Professor of Law and Social Theory at the University of Reading, 2003 (Carl Franklin, “Transnational Citizens: Mobility and Sexuality,” Governing sexuality: the changing politics of citizenship and law, p. 98-101)<br />
<br />
&lt;Mobility often triggers social anxieties … mobility, health, immunity, infection, and containment.&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>The constitution of Queer Migrants Identities occurs at the Border, a Critical Locus in the Creation of Subjectivities. Rendered against the Backdrop of Heteronormativity, the Queer Migrant is a threat, a risk of contamination to the citizenry that does not Fit the Stable Binaries of Include/Excluded or Hetero/Homo and must be Contained.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>That the Queer Immigrant cannot be neatly mapped across Space and Time sustains an anxiety that manifests itself in the creation of populations mobilized against those deemed “Outsiders”. The end result of this incessant drive for order and stability that defines Heteronormative Border Control and Immigrant Visas underlies the global management of Life and Death</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Because of their difference the foreign Queer is the fictionalized enemy at our borders and must be controlled.

<strong>The time is now to Radically Rethink the Smoothing of Queerness embodied in US immigration policy. The intersection and mobilization of discourses on queerness and migration offer a Powerful Critical Tool to break down hetero-sexualized notions of citizenship that embody current immigration practices and transform the manifold forms of violent discrimination that occur against the Queer Migrant.

<strong>Only by Voting Affirmative—by recognizing the Futility of imagining Center-Seeking Policy Changes or demanding the State Distribution of Rights and reclaiming the Border in this Debate Space—can we reshape Queer Migration to mobilize new ways of being Political</strong><br />

<strong>PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH!</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Our Refusal to accept the Violent Exclusion of Queer Migrants occupies the space of the uninhabitable at the Arbitrary Line we call our Border, undermining the Social Basis for state Control over Queer Migration. By relieving the state of its ability to Dictate Ineligibility, our Act reconfigures norms of Gender and Sexuality in current Immigration Policy. We can shatter the Dominance of State Control over Life and Death</strong><br />

<strong>Our Intervention in this Debate Space challenges the heteronormative Police Logic of Queer Migrant Exclusion, allowing for the emancipation of the subject from status quo identitarian regimes. In this space, a space where the abjected Queer subject can speak, New Forms of political community and New Regimes of Politics surface. This micropolitics is the necessary first step in Unraveling the hetero-dominant police order and Facilitates the eruption of Queer migrant subjectivities</strong><br />
