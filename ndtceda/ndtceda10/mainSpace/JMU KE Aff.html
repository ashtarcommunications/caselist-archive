 3. Turn - H1B workers increase the wages of US workers- prefer our evidence because it cites 3 different empirical studies, where theirs is simply hypothetical<br />

There is little evidence <br />
The country is certainly better off by having the whole world as a potential supplier of highly talented individuals rather than only the native-born.”<br />
4. Turn - Even if they prove that wages are lowered, H1B workers create new jobs. This solves the internal link to overall wage deflation because lowered wages in one sector is more than made up for by the radical increase in wages in other sectors that occurs when someone who is unemployed gets a brandy new job.<br />

 Additionally, racism justifies the modern state’s biopolitical “right to kill” to ensure that order is upheld<br />
Mbembe 03. Achille, Ph.D, Senior researcher at the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of the Witwatersrand. “Necropolitics” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/icuss/pdfs/Mbembe.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/icuss/pdfs/Mbembe.pdf</a><br />
That <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">race</span> (or for that matter racism) . <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">figures so prominently in the calculus of biopower</span> is entirely justifiable. After all, more so than class-thinking (the ideology that de. nes history as an economic struggle of classes), <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">race has been the ever present shadow in Western political thought and practice, especially when it comes to imagining the inhumanity of, or rule over, foreign peoples.</span> Referring to both this ever-presence and the phantomlike world of race in general, Arendt locates their roots in the shattering experience of otherness and suggests that the politics of race is ultimately linked to the politics of death.18 Indeed, in Foucault’s terms, racism is above all a technology aimed at permitting the exercise of biopower, “that old sovereign right of death.”19 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">In the economy of biopower, the function of racism is to regulate the distribution of death and to make possible the murderous functions of the state</span>. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It is</span>, he says, “<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the condition for the acceptability of putting to death</span>.”20 <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">Foucault states clearly that the sovereign right to kill</span> (droit de glaive) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">and the mechanisms of biopower are inscribed in the way all modern states function</span>;21 indeed, they can be seen as constitutive elements of state power in modernity. According to Foucault, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">the Nazi state was the most complete example of a state exercising the right to kill</span>. This state, he claims, made the management, protection, and cultivation of life coextensive with the sovereign right to kill. By biological extrapolation on the theme of the political enemy, in organizing the war against its adversaries and, at the same time, exposing its own citizens to war, the Nazi state is seen as having opened the way for a formidable consolidation of the right to kill, which culminated in the project of the “final solution.” In doing so, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">it became the archetype of a power formation that combined the characteristics of the racist state, the murderous state, and the suicidal state</span>. <br />
This right to kill is at the root of war and the elimination of entire populations<br />
Rabinow 84. Paul, Professor of Anthropology @ UC-Berkeley. The Foucault Reader.p. 260. [Gender paraphrased by RJ Green]. <br />
<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">It is as managers of life and survival, of bodies and the race, that so many regimes have been able to wage</span> so many <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">wars, causing so many [people] to be killed</span>. And through a turn that closes the circle, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">as the technology of wars has caused them to tend increasingly toward all-out destruction, the decision that initiates them and the one that terminates them are in fact increasingly informed by the naked question of survival. The atomic situation is now at the end point of this process: the power to expose a whole population to death is the underside of the power to guarantee an individual's continued existence</span>. The principle underlying the tactics of battle-that one has to be capable of killing in order to go on living-has become the principle that defines the strategy of states. But the existence in question is no longer the juridical existence of sovereignty; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">at stake is the biological existence of a population. If genocide is indeed the dream of modem powers, this is not because of a recent return of the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population</span>.<br />

 Foucalt k: they mix up racism and xenophobia. Xenophobia is the fear of anyone who is not “from here.” they say that people’s mindsets don’t change. this is the mindset that we are trying to change. they are the prime example of the xenophobic mindset. They provide a real world example that proves that we need to solve this. Extend our gower 2010 evidence from the narrative, prefer the specifity of our cards over their analytics. <br />

 Over two foggy days in April, a group of high-ranking Chinese science and education leaders and some American counterparts met at <br />
a <span style="font-size: 6pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.signonsandiego.com/topic/University_of_California" rel="nofollow">University of California</a></span> San Diego faculty club to discuss an issue crucial to both nations: educating future generations in the ethical standards surrounding the conduct of research.The meeting was low-key – no TV cameras, no headlines – but from the start, its potential for high impact was clear. Not so many years ago, during the Cold War, the two nations were locked in conflict. Now they were collaborating to strengthen science for the 21st century.<br />
The talks were emblematic of...<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">and to global conflict.</span><br />
