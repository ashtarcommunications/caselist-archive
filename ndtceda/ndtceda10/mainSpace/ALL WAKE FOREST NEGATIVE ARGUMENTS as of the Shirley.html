The United States federal government should no longer assess race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, or non-violent criminal status in determining security risk for eligibility for employment-based immigrant visas, nonimmigrant temporary worker visas, family based visas, and human trafficking-based visas. <br />
The United States federal government should place Immigration Customs and Enforcement Visa Security Program agents at each foreign embassy to implement screening procedures for potential terrorists. The United States federal government should substantially increase training offered to these agents regarding methods of detecting terrorists that do not utilize racial or ethnic profiling.<br />
The United States federal government should regularly conduct random screening tests at airports, embassies, and border crossings to ensure the criteria the counterplan excludes aren’t being used as a metric for entry.<br />
Counterplan solves case because it allows open borders – however it excludes terrorists<br />

 <span style="font-size: 13pt;">The aff relies upon a fundamental notion of community and being that is flawed. Even though they question how we constitute communities, this logic relies on the belief that there IS a community that can be defined and traced. The aff says “Against this tradition we affirm the trauma of the resolution and speak the betrayal of our very community”. There is no betrayal of our community because THERE IS NO COMMUNITY. There is only a myth of community uphold by their assumptions. This causes the violence and exclusion they attempt to solve</span><br />
