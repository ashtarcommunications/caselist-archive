<h2 id="toc10"><a name="x-Displaced Ethics"></a>Displaced Ethics</h2>
 The Affirmative poses the question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves with the reorientation of our collective political spheres takes precedent and in the process produces these ethics and our relationship with others merely as a background for political transformations. The affirmative makes the question not how much how we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationships which makes genuine ethical engagement impossible.<br />
Zupančič, Researcher at the Slovene Academy of Sciences 2000<br />
(Alenka, Institute of Philosophy, Ljubljana, <em>Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan</em>, p 10-11) cnb<br />
In other words,……as a priori.<br />
<br />
The Affirmative will respond that the plan and the political plays no prominent role in the posture of the 1AC. This, however, is the premise of our whole argument. Their belief that the political must remain in the background nonetheless, in order to generate change, is the ultimate sell-out of their ethical commitment. This act in and of itself is unethical because it admits from the get-go that the ethical posture alone is insufficient absent its capacity to generate change within the domain of institutional politics<br />

Thus, as Derrida…..resembles pure faith.<br />
<br />
The Belief that our activisms must respond to the political conditions of our time through the leveraging of particular institutional appeals is precisely what nullifies our ethical potential. No matter the force of its opposition, the connection of transformation with an appeal to our institutions, mediates our relationships in such a manner that ethical transformation outside this frame of mediation becomes impossible.<br />

I have argued…..and ‘being wronged’.<br />
<br />
If the mediation of our ethics is the source of our ethical impoverishment and the corruption of our relationships, it’s time to withdraw from this framework of mediation. We ask you to affirm the ethical commitment of the 1AC in its immediacy. Suspending the wall that mediates our relationships constitutes the only genuine ethical act.<br />

The affirmative use of the political to answer the call of ethics causes the political to make itself indispensable in a never ending cycle of control—legal institutions thus co-opt social activism and shift unique individuals to the position of generic citizens, eliminating the relationships which provide the very meaning to life. <br />

It is often…message of Mahatmas.<br />
<br />
For the affirmative, the ethical and the political are one in the same as inseparable. In essence, the political domain has become incomplete without ethical intervention and ethical intervention has become insufficient without political input. It is this logic that is responsible for the corruption of our ethics. Reading ethics through the lens of politics ignores ethical possibilities around us all the time. The affirmative builds a wall between these ethical possibilities, insisting that they are only possible when our political gestures are transformed.<br />

<h3 id="toc14"><a name="x-Framework-Contention Two: Reasons to Prefer"></a>Contention Two: Reasons to Prefer</h3>
 <br />
Resolution centered debate is critical to a fair debate – it’s a voting issue.<br />
<br />
1. Predictability- <br />
A. the resolution sets the topic for discussion- allowing the aff to choose their ground outside of the resolution makes it impossible for the negative to engage the affirmative. There are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies unrelated to the topic which are impossible to predict- this leaves the negative unprepared to debate<br />
<br />
B. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, enabling the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground<br />
<br />
C. The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion<br />
Ruth <strong>Shively</strong>, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 20 <strong>00</strong> (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 181-2)<br />
The requirements given…..agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
D. Unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that allows us to critically examine their approach- this prevents informed clash which outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously examining it.<br />
<br />
2. Education -<br />
A. policy options are key to real world education about possible reforms- their framework devastates learning about the real world with reciprocal and clear deliberation about the merits of an idea<br />
<br />
B. Topical Education—by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government. Their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism<br />
Martin W. <strong>Lewis</strong>, Professor of Geography and Regional Science at George Washington University, 19 <strong>92</strong> (Green Delusions: An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism. Page 247)<br />
A majority of…..their instructors’ intentions.<br />
<br />
C. Implementation- the aff will always win the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract- we can only debate the merits of arguments if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Harvard Carr Center for Human Rights Policy director and human rights practices professor, <strong>04__</strong> (<em>The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror</em>, 20-21)<br />
There are two….to betray another.<br />
<br />
D. Informed Citizens - Fiat is key to being informed citizens, without it we never learn about the political process and don’t take responsibility for the possible bad outcomes of our actions. Simulating policy solves all their offense, allowing people a safe space to test new ideas<br />
