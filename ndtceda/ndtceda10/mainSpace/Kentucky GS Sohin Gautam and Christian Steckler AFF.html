 <strong>Plan: the United States federal government should no longer consider terror grounds in determining eligibility for employment-based visas, temporary worker visas, family based visas, and trafficking-based visas.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Terror and security related grounds make aliens ineligible to receive visas</strong><br />

<strong>The visa regime exists to rein in the threat the mobile migrant represents – the process creates categories of migrants and eligibility for immigration is determined by the exclusion of risky migrants - the ultimate outcome renders ALL applicants as potential risks to be managed</strong><br />

<strong>Advantage 1: Interest Convergence</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The debate surrounding immigration is never complete- they are merely snap-shots controlled by risk managers to describe an always incomplete picture of reality based on the anticipation of future threats; however, this coupling of security and immigration highlights the exact moment where security interest converge with immigrants bartering for ground are constantly taken back to justify never-ending violence</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The ability to control the flow of information and situation of immigrants forces the same the same rigged bargain as the postwar Civil Right Compromise: The price extracted in exchange for the legitimacy of action is accepting the current terms of debate which means that the official <em>solutions</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> elites and reformists advocate must remain blind to the linkage between race and the imperialism of American capital.</span></strong><br />

<strong>Scenarios surrounding immigration are always lodged in the framing of worst-case-scenarios because it is trapped in a way that always makes them the objects of violence-- risk NECESSARILY fixes their position as scientifically and objectively always already the targets of bombs</strong><br />
