Why the 1AC is Bad<br />
The 1AC should be understood in historical context – the US Empire was built on the backs of immigrants and maintained via their instrumentalization<br />
Lovato ‘8 [Roberto, New America Media, The Public Eye Magazine, v23, #1 Spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v23n1/immigrant_crackdowns.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v23n1/immigrant_crackdowns.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The 1AC’s economic advantages are just another version of the transcontinental railroad – ethnocentric motivations masked by claims of inclusiveness. The AFF wrongly posits its advocacy in opposition to xenophobia, when in reality the two go hand in hand<br />
LUPE ’10 [La Union del Pueblo Entero – Immigrant Labor Activist Group founded by Cesar Chavez, “Coupling exploitation of immigrants with anti-immigrant policy is the perfect recipe for workforce control,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lupergv.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/coupling-exploitation-of-immigrants-with-anti-immigrant-policy-is-the-perfect-recipe-for-workforce-control/" rel="nofollow">http://lupergv.wordpress.com/2010/05/24/coupling-exploitation-of-immigrants-with-anti-immigrant-policy-is-the-perfect-recipe-for-workforce-control/</a>]<br />

The 1AC perpetuates the Colonialist project of domination– touting the power of immigration while simultaneously silencing and erasing immigrant agency –<br />

Vote NEG<br />
1AC’s advocacy tropes reinforce the structures which are the root cause of the harms – the AFF only risks making SQuo worse – vote NEG on presumption<br />

Immigration Law is a Hydra – the 1AC’s claims of solvency ignore its regenerative powers &amp; the AFFs methods of instrumnentalizing immigrants re-inscribes White Supremacy<br />
Cheney ’93 [Deborah, U of Kent “Value Judgments?: A Reading of Immigration Cases,” Journal of Law &amp; Society, v20, #1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1410110" rel="nofollow">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1410110</a>] pp23-24<br />
<br />
The AFF’s attempt to bypass this interrogation Immigration Law’s racialized subtext reinforces systemic racism<br />

Immigration creates a reserve army for capitalism that keeps wages down, increases the share profit has in the total economy, additionally it falls prey to capitalist tricks of racism and xenophobia which causes indigenous workers to feel as an intermediate class, preventing a desire to fight capitalism, while encouraging those workers to exploit another group for the ruling class and excluding the new immigrants from political activity, weakening the class as a whole<br />
