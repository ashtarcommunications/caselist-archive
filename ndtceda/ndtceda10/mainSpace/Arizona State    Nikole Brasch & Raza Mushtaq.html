The global scientific community embraces principles Americans cherish: transparency, meritocracy, accountability, the objective evaluation of evidence, and broad and frequently democratic participation. Science is inherently democratic, respecting evidence and truth above all. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Science is also a common global language, able to bridge deep political and religious divides</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> Scientists share a common language. Scientific interactions serve to keep open lines of communication and cultural understanding. As scientists everywhere have a common evidentiary external reference system, members of ideologically divergent societies can use the common language of science to cooperatively address both domestic and the increasingly trans- national and global problems confronting humanity in the 21st century. There is a growing recognition that science and technology will increasingly drive the successful economies of the 21st century. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Science </span>and technology <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">provide an immeasurable benefit to the U.S. by bringing scientists </span>and students <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">here</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, especially from developing countries, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">where they see democracy in action, make friends in the international scientific community</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, become familiar with American technology, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and contribute to the U.S. and global economy.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> For example, in 2005, over 50% of physical science and engineering graduate students and postdoctoral researchers trained in the U.S. have been foreign nationals. Moreover, many foreign-born scientists who were educated and have worked in the U.S. eventually progress in their careers to hold influential positions in ministries and institutions both in this country and in their home countries. They also contribute to U.S. scientific and technologic development: According to the National Science Board’s 2008 Science and Engineering Indicators, 47% of full-time doctoral science and engineering faculty in U.S. research institutions were foreign-born. Finally, some types of science – particularly those that address the grand challenges in science and technology – are inherently international in scope and collaborative by necessity. The ITER Project, an international fusion research and development collaboration, is a product of the thaw in superpower relations between Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan. This reactor will harness the power of nuclear fusion as a possible new and viable energy source by bringing a star to earth. ITER serves as a symbol of international scientific cooperation among key scientific leaders in the developed and developing world – Japan, Korea, China, E.U., India, Russia, and United States – representing 70% of the world’s current population.. The recent elimination of funding for FY08 U.S. contributions to the ITER project comes at an inopportune time as the Agreement on the Establishment of the ITER International Fusion Energy Organization for the Joint Implementation of the ITER Project had entered into force only on October 2007. The elimination of the promised U.S. contribution drew our allies to question our commitment and credibility in international cooperative ventures. More problematically, it jeopardizes a platform for reaffirming U.S. relations with key states. It should be noted that </span><span class="underline">even <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">at the height of the cold war, the United States used science diplomacy as a means to maintain communications and avoid misunderstanding</span> between the world’s two nuclear powers </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">– the Soviet Union and the United States. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In a complex multi-polar world, relations are more challenging, the threats perhaps greater, and the need for engagement more paramount.</span> </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Increasing science diplomacy key to international non-proliferation efforts – solves escalating nuclear wars </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dickson 10</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (David, Director, SciDev.Net, 7 May 2010, “Nuclear disarmament is top priority for science diplomacy”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/nuclear-disarmament-is-top-priority-for-science-diplomacy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scidev.net/en/editorials/nuclear-disarmament-is-top-priority-for-science-diplomacy.html</a>, 7/28/10, atl) </span><br />
<span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The political climate is ripe for a new push to eliminate nuclear weapons; scientists can boost its chance of success</span></span>. Earlier this year, <span class="underline">US satellites detected the first plume of steam from a nuclear reactor in Pakistan that has been built to produce fuel for nuclear bombs, confirming the country's desire to strengthen its status as a nuclear power</span>. The observation — coming shortly before this month's review conference in New York of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) — is further evidence that <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the unregulated spread of nuclear technology remains closely linked to the dangers of nuclear conflict</span></span>. The good news is that US President Barack <span class="underline">Obama seems determined to make eliminating nuclear weapons a top priority.</span> Indeed, last month he invited 47 heads of state to an unprecedented summit in Washington to promote disarmament and agree strategies to prevent nuclear terrorism and safeguard nuclear material. <span class="underline">But the news from Pakistan, together with continued disagreement on how best to tackle other emerging nuclear states such as Iran and North Korea, illustrates how far there is to go — and the political hurdles that must still be scaled — before this goal is achieved</span>. New hope Still, there is a sense of optimism for this year's review conference that was missing from the last meeting in 2005. Then, the aggressive stance taken by the Bush administration — describing North Korea as part of an &quot;axis of evil&quot;, for example — doomed the discussions to stalemate. This time round, the prospects for agreement are significantly higher. Not only has Obama adopted a more moderate attitude towards international affairs in general, but he has already made significant achievements on the nuclear front. <span class="underline">Last month, for example, Russia and the United States announced an arms control agreement under which both will significantly reduce their nuclear arsenals. And since then, Obama has revised his nuclear policy to state, for the first time, that non-nuclear states that have signed the NPT will never be targets of US nuclear weapons</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.</span> Both agreements could have gone further. Some in Obama's administration wanted him to take the further step of banning the use of nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear threat or attack. And despite the new cuts, both Russia and the United States will still own enough nuclear weapons to destroy human life many times over. But the recent moves have nonetheless created a political climate in which significant agreement, at least between nuclear weapons states, looks more realistic than it did five years ago. There are even signs that the United States could eventually ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the next major step towards global nuclear disarmament. Need for vigilance <span class="underline">The reasons for optimism are not restricted to the shift in the US position. Equally influential has been a growing awareness within the developed and developing worlds of the threats of nuclear terrorism and the need to improve protection of nuclear materials. Eighteen months ago, for example, an armed group was caught breaking into a nuclear facility in South Africa in an apparent attempt to steal weapons-grade uranium that has been stored at the site since the early 1990s, under international supervision. The incident provides a stark reminder of the need for continued and effective vigilance. This need will increase as more developing countries turn towards nuclear power as a source of affordable energy — a trend that will be reinforced by international efforts to promote renewable energy as a strategy for tackling climate change. But the danger is that US-led initiatives will, with some justification, be seen as little more than attempts to defend American interests, influenced as much by political relationships as by a genuine desire for nuclear disarmament.</span> For example, the nuclear cooperation deal between the United States and India that entered force in 2008 has been cited by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace as an example of putting diplomatic and commercial interests ahead of non-proliferation responsibilities and was criticised for exacerbating nuclear tensions in South Asia. Scientists, diplomats or both? <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The only solution is for the developing world to accept that international nuclear non-proliferation is in its own interests — the only way to prevent regional conflicts escalating into nuclear exchanges. The scientific community has an important role to play in this process by explaining the threat posed by even relatively small nuclear weapons, </span>and advising on how to develop safeguards without overly restricting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Scientists have already shown their worth when they kept communication channels open between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</span></span> The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs were instrumental to such <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">'science diplomacy'</span></span> and it<span class="underline"> can be no coincidence that the approach <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is rapidly gaining favour in Washington</span>, where John Holdren, who once headed Pugwash, is Obama's science and technology advisor. If such diplomacy, on the control of nuclear weapons or other scientific issues, is driven by the political and commercial interests of the developed world, it will remain suspect and doomed to fail. But <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if it can be truly international, the chances of success are much higher. Reaching a global agreement on the steps needed to eliminate nuclear weapons from the world would be a good place to start.</span> </span><br />

Their framework makes extinction inevitable- viewing survival as the first priority before all is key.<br />

There is only one circumstance in which it might be possible to sum up the life and achievement of the species, and that circumstance would be that it had already died; but then, of course, there would be no one left to do the summing up. Only a generation that believed itself to be in possession of final, absolute truth could ever conclude that it had reason to put an end to hu<span style="text-line-through: double;">man</span> life, and only generations that recognized the limits to their own wisdom and virtue would be likely to subordinate their interests and dreams to the as yet unformed interests and undreamed dreams of the future generations, and let hu<span style="text-line-through: double;">man</span> life go on. From the foregoing, it follows that <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there can be no justification for extinguishing <span style="text-line-through: double;">man</span>kind and </span>therefore no justification <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for any nation ever to push the world into nuclear hostilities, which </span>once inaugurated<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, may lead</span> uncontrollably<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> to </span>full-scale holocaust and to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">extinction</span>.</u> But from t<span style="text-line-through: double;">his</span> conclusion it does not follow that at any action is permitted as long as it serves the end of preventing ex­tinction. The grounds for these two propositions become clearer if we consider the nature of ethical obligation. It seems especially important to consider the ethical side of the question, because the other common justification for military action-self-interest-obvi­ously can never justify extinction, inasmuch as extinction would constitute suicide for the perpetrator; and suicide, whatever else it may be, is scarcely in the interest of the one who commits it. <br />

Such<span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">workers are critical to the success of many US industries and their global competitiveness</span>.</span> Across all technologies, 42.3% of all H-1B visa holders have India as a country of origin, and 10% are from China, followed in descending order by Canada (3.9%), the United Kingdom (3.2%), Philippines (3.2%), Taiwan (2.2%), Korea (2.1%), Japan (2.0%), Pakistan (1.9%), the Russian Federation (1.7%), Germany (1.6%), France (1.5%), Mexico (1.2%), Brazil (1.1%), and other countries (21.8%). More than half of the H-1B visa applications currently granted are in computer-related occupations<span style="color: #636318; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12.0pt;">[[#B2|2]]</span>.<br />
The role of the foreign worker (H-1B visa holder) in the US biotechnology industry was not appreciated until early 2000. <span class="underline">Our annual national surveys have revealed that, depending upon US region, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">between 6% and 10% of the US biotechnology workforce has H-1B visas</span>. </span>Clearly, the constant shortfall in various specialized technical workers over the past six years has been partially alleviated by access to talented individuals originating outside of the existing US labor pool. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The demand is such that the industry could easily accept a further 25% increase in H-1Bs</span></span> in 2004.<br />
Our third annual national survey of H-1Bs in the biotechnology industry demonstrates again the special nature of these talented individuals and their importance to companies<span style="color: #636318; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12.0pt;">[[#B3|3]]</span>. <span class="underline">Similar to &quot;high technology&quot; H-1Bs, most biotechnology H-1Bs are products of US colleges and universities and most acquire permanent status. In fact, 80% of biotechnology H-1Bs are from US universities, and 85% of those eventually acquire permanent residency in the United States</span>. Companies now spend an average of $10,200 on each H-1B holder for processing fees and legal expenses through to a green card, leading to the conclusion that US companies have spent in excess of $150 million over the past five years to acquire and keep their H-1B workers<span style="color: #636318; font-family: Verdana; font-size: 12.0pt;">[[#B3|3]]</span>.<br />
In addition, <span class="underline">about a quarter of all H-1B holders formerly had foreign student (F visa) status<span style="color: windowtext;">[[#B2|2]]</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Foreign-born workers</span> (both temporary and permanent immigrants) <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">accounted for about 17% of the US high tech and information technology workforce in 2000</span>, compared with 10% of the overall population<span style="color: windowtext;">[[#B2|2]]</span>. Importantly, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">there is no evidence of foreign H-1B &quot;visa mills&quot;</span>—for-profit operations that bring foreign workers into the United States by any means possible—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in the introduction of foreign workers into the national biotechnology industry or the information technology industry</span>, although it is known that the largest US hardware and software companies have strong ties to India<span style="color: windowtext;">[[#B2|2]]</span>, a property not shared by the US biotechnology industry to date. </span><br />

A terrorist WMD attack is inevitable by 2013 – biological weapons are the most likely scenario<br />

Sometime <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">during the next five years, the U.S. can expect a terrorists attack using biological</span></span>, possibly even nuclear <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">weapons. That's the findings of a study coming out this week from a bipartisan group</span></span> called the Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism.<br />
Here to tell us more about that report is the vice chair of the commission, former senator from Missouri, Jim Talent. Welcome to the program, sir. And if you could tell us a bit about this report. It states that<span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the biological threat to this country is greater than the nuclear one</span></span>. What sort of biological threat are we talking about?<br />
Former Senator JIM TALENT (Vice Chair, The Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism): Well, people normally think in terms of like <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Anthrax, and</span></span> that's the most visible potential pathogen. There's others that could be used, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">smallpox, for example</span></span>. And one of the dangers is that, with DNA synthesizers that are available and dual-use technology all over the world, it's becoming increasingly easy to isolate pathogens, old or new. It's technologically easier to weaponize.<br />
COHEN: Can you tell me a little bit about how you conducted the research for this report?<br />
Former Senator TALENT: We're a follow onto the 9/11 commission, congressionally created, bipartisan. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The report was unanimous, and we interviewed hundreds of people who travel all over the world</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">,</span> everywhere from the national labs in Sandia, to London, to Asia, to Russia interviewing people.<br />
And then we all, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">each of us on the commission, has experience in this area as well</span>.</span> And what Congress wanted was an update on the assessment of the threat and then recommendations about what can be done to reduce it.<br />
COHEN: According to your report, where might such an attack occur?<br />
Former Senator TALENT: That's so speculative that we didn't say this city or that city. There are obvious ones that know they're targets or potential targets, New York, London. It could happen in a more rural or suburban area, but probably a population center for the obvious reason that they get, unfortunately, more casualties if they can do a weapon of mass destruction in a place like New York.<br />
COHEN: This report also looked at who could possibly pose this sort of threat, where they're based. What were the findings there?<br />
Former Senator TALENT: Al-Qaeda is probably still the lead terrorist group. There are others, as we're seeing, or could be seeing, in India right now. Some of them are regional in nature, but the problem is that <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">these terrorists all have organizationally the sophistication to get the technology to use one of these weapons. And we know that they have the desire to do it.</span> </span><br />
Now, we don't think they have the capability yet, but they have the sophistication to get it. And<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> <span class="underline">in terms of bio, if they recruit the right</span></span><span class="underline">,</span> you know, bio scientist or two, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">they get the technical capability.</span> </span><br />
COHEN: Do the recent bombings last week in Mumbai add any weight to this report?<br />
Former Senator TALENT: What it does is point out the nature of the struggle that we're involved in. And whether you call it a war or conflict or whatever, we're dealing with transnational conspiracies who are empowered by the information revolution, by the forces of globalization.<br />
They know - they see the world as a number of systems. You know, a matrix is a system stuck together, and <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">they know we're vulnerable at a lot of different points. And that's the reason we're seeing more and more groups using these kinds of methods.</span> </span><br />

Risk assessment is preferable over rejection of predictions three reasons: 1. It exposes policymakers assumptions. 2. Ensures objectivity AND 3. enhances strategic flexibility<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: ArialMT; font-size: 8.0pt;"> Fitzsimmons, Michael (2006) 'The Problem of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning', Survival, 48:4, 131 - 146</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0in;"><span style="font-family: Times-Roman;">Uncertainty is not a new phenomenon for strategists. Clausewitz knew that ‘many intelligence reports in war are contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain’. In coping with uncertainty, he believed that ‘what one can reasonably ask of an officer is that he should possess a standard of judgment, which he can gain only from knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense. He should be guided by the laws of probability. <u>Granted, one can certainly allow for epistemological debates about the best ways of gaining ‘a standard of judgment’</u> from ‘knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense’. Scientific inquiry into the ‘laws of probability’ for any given strategic question may not always be possible or appropriate. Certainly, analysis cannot and should not be presumed to trump the intuition of decision-makers. Nevertheless, Clausewitz’s implication seems to be that <u>the burden of proof in any debates about planning should belong to the decision-maker who rejects formal analysis, standards of evidence and probabilistic reasoning.</u> <u>Ultimately, though, the value of prediction in strategic planning does not rest primarily in getting the correct answer,</u> or even in the more feasible objective of bounding the range of correct answers. <u>Rather, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">prediction requires decision- makers to expose, not only to others but to themselves, the beliefs they hold regarding why a given event is likely or unlikely and why it would be important or unimportant</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> Richard Neustadt and Ernest May highlight this useful property of probabilistic </span>reasoning in their renowned study of the use of history in decision-making, Thinking in Time. In discussing the importance of probing presumptions, they contend: The need is for tests prompting questions, for sharp, straightforward mechanisms the decision makers and their aides might readily recall and use to dig into their own and each others’ presumptions. And they need tests that get at basics somewhat by indirection, not by frontal inquiry: not ‘what is your inferred causation, General?’ Above all, not, ‘what are your values, Mr. Secretary?’ ... If someone says ‘a fair chance’ ... ask, ‘if you were a betting man or woman, what odds would you put on that?’ If others are present, ask the same of each, and of yourself, too. Then probe the differences: why? This is tantamount to seeking and then arguing assumptions underlying different numbers placed on a subjective probability assessment. We know of no better way to force clarification of meanings while exposing hidden differences ... Once differing odds have been quoted, the question ‘why?’ can follow any number of tracks. <u>Argument may pit common sense against common sense or analogy against analogy. What is important is that the expert’s basis for linking ‘if’ with ‘then’ gets exposed to the hearing of other experts before the lay official has to say yes or no</u>.’35 <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There are at least three critical and related benefits of predictio</span>n</u> in strategic planning. The first reflects Neustadt and May’s point – <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">prediction enforces a certain level of discipline in making explicit the assumptions</span>,</u> key variables and implied causal relationships that constitute decision-makers’ beliefs and that might otherwise remain implicit. <u>Imagine,</u> for example, <u>if</u> Shinseki and <u>Wolfowitz had been made to assign probabilities to their opposing expectations regarding post-war Iraq. Not only would they have had to work harder to justify their views, they might have seen more clearly the substantial chance that they were wrong and had to make greater efforts in their planning to prepare for that contingency. Secondly<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, the very process of making the relevant factors of a decision explicit provides a firm, or at least transparent, basis for making choices</span></u>. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Alternative courses of action can be compared and assessed</span></u> in like terms. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Third, the transparency and discipline of the process of arriving at the initial strategy should heighten the decision-maker’s sensitivity toward changes in the environment that would suggest the need for adjustments to that strategy.</span></u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> <u>In this way, prediction enhances rather than</u> <u>undermines strategic flexibility</u></span>. This defence of prediction does not imply that great stakes should be gambled on narrow, singular predictions of the future. On the contrary, the central problem of uncertainty in planning remains that any given prediction may simply be wrong. Preparations for those eventualities must be made. Indeed, in many cases, relatively unlikely outcomes could be enormously consequential, and therefore merit extensive preparation and investment. In order to navigate this complexity, strategists must return to the distinction between uncertainty and risk. <u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">While the complexity of the international security environment may make it somewhat resistant to the type of probabilis</span></u><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">tic thinking associated with risk, a risk-oriented approach seems to be the only viable model for national-security strategic planning. The alternative approach, which categorically denies prediction, precludes strategy</span></u><u>.</u> As Betts argues, Any assumption that some knowledge, whether intuitive or explicitly formalized, provides guidance about what should be done is a presumption that there is reason to believe the choice will produce a satisfactory outcome – that is, it is a prediction, however rough it may be. If there is no hope of discerning and manipulating causes to produce intended effects, analysts as well as politicians and generals should all quit and go fishing.36 Unless they are willing to quit and go fishing, then, strategists must sharpen their tools of risk assessment. Risk assessment comes in many varieties, but identification of two key parameters is common to all of them: the consequences of a harmful event or condition; and the likelihood of that harmful event or condition occurring. With no perspective on likelihood, a strategist can have no firm perspective on risk. With no firm perspective on risk, strategists cannot purposefully discriminate among alternative choices. Without purposeful choice, there is no strategy. </span><br />

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">genetically engineered biological weapons</span>, many <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth</span></span>. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nuclear weapons</span></span>, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are easier to control. Biological weapons</span></span>, on the other hand, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated</span></span>. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. <span class="underline">Potentially worse than that, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">bio-engineered agents</span> by the hundreds <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation.

Scenario 2: Retaliation<br />
Large casualties from an unconstrained bio-attack will ensure nuclear retaliation<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Conley 3</span></span> (Lt Col Harry W. is chief of the Systems Analysis Branch, Directorate of Requirements, Headquarters Air Combat Command (ACC), Langley AFB, Virginia.

The number of American casualties suffered due to a WMD attack may well be the most important variable in determining the nature of the US reprisal. A key question here is <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">how many Americans would have to be killed to prompt a massive response by the U</span>nited <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">S</span>tates. The bombing of marines in Lebanon, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 each resulted in a casualty count of roughly</span> the same magnitude (<span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">150–300 deaths</span></span>). <span class="underline">Although these events caused anger and a desire for retaliation among the American public, they <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">prompted no serious call for massive or nuclear retaliation. The body count from a single biological attack could easily be one or two orders of magnitude higher</span></span> than the casualties caused by these events. Using the rule of proportionality as a guide, one could justifiably debate whether the United States should use massive force in responding to an event that resulted in only a few thousand deaths. However, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">what if the casualty count was around 300,000</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">? </span><span class="underline">Such</span> an unthinkable <span class="underline">result from a single CBW incident is not beyond</span> the realm of <span class="underline">possibility</span>: “According to the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">100 kg of anthrax spores delivered by an efficient aerosol generator on a large urban target would be between two and six times as lethal as a one megaton thermo-nuclear bomb</span>.</span>”46 Would the deaths of 300,000 Americans be enough to trigger a nuclear response? In this case, <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">proportionality does not rule out the use of nuclear weapons</span></span>. Besides simply the total number of casualties, <span class="underline">the types of casualties- predominantly military versus civilian- will also affect the nature and scope of the US reprisal action. Military combat entails known risks, and the emotions resulting from a significant number of military casualties are not likely to be as forceful as they would be if the attack were against civilians</span>. World War II provides perhaps the best examples for the kind of event or circumstance that would have to take place to trigger a nuclear response. A <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">CBW event that produced a shock and death toll roughly equivalent to those arising from the attack on Pearl Harbor might be sufficient to prompt a nuclear retaliation.</span> President</span> Harry <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Truman’s decision to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki- based upon a calculation that up to one million casualties might be incurred in an invasion of the Japanese homeland</span></span>47- is an example of the kind of thought process that would have to occur prior to a nuclear response to a CBW event. Victor Utgoff suggests that “<span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if nuclear retaliation is seen at the time to offer the best prospects for suppressing further CB attacks and speeding the defeat of the aggressor, and if the original attacks had caused severe damage that had outraged American or allied publics, nuclear retaliation would be more than just a possibility, whatever promises had been made</span></span>.”48 <br />

<span class="underline">The real reason for nuking Iran</span>, however,<span class="underline"> is</span> none of the above. It was spelled out with surprising candor in the Pentagon draft document &quot;Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations&quot; [.pdf] as one of several possible reasons geographic combatant commanders may request presidential approval for use of nuclear weapons: <span class="underline">&quot;<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">To demonstrate U.S. intent and capability to use nuclear weapons to deter adversary use of WMD.&quot;</span> </span> Yes, you read it right: <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The U.S. is prepared to break a 60-year-old taboo on the use of nuclear weapons</span> against non-nuclear countries – not because the survival of the country is at stake, not because the lives of many Americans or allies are at stake – <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">just to demonstrate that it can do it. </span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> <span class="underline">The U.S</span></span><span class="underline">. has maintained for some time now that it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">reserves the right to respond with nuclear weapons to attacks or intended attacks with WMD</span></span>, and that it intends to use nuclear weapons to destroy underground enemy facilities. It is argued that such statements have deterrent value, and that maintaining ambiguity as to what might trigger a U.S. nuclear attack deters countries from pursuing military initiatives that are contrary to U.S. interests. Nonsense. Those statements have no deterrent value because no one in his or her right mind would believe that the greatest democracy in the world would do such a thing. Unless the U.S. demonstrates, by actually doing it once, that it is indeed prepared to do so. How do you create the conditions to perform such a demonstration and avoid immediate universal condemnation? You declare Iran to be the second member of the &quot;axis of evil.&quot; You start a &quot;global war on terror.&quot; You invade the first member of the axis (Iraq) and put 150,000 U.S. troops at the doorstep of the second member, in harm's way – not enough troops to invade Iran, nor to prevent an Iranian invasion of Iraq after Iran is attacked. You strike Iran's facilities, using conventional and nuclear bombs, to deter Iran from retaliating with missiles with chemical warheads and from invading Iraq, thereby saving the lives of 150,000 American soldiers. You argue that Iran's chemical and nuclear facilities had to be destroyed to prevent terrorists using weapons from those facilities to attack the U.S. (Never mind that the nuclear facilities were just nuclear reactors, not nuclear weapons). You get Israel to pull the trigger, i.e., bomb some Iranian installations (as it did in Iraq at Osirak) to provoke an Iranian response. Now enter the world after the U.S. &quot;demo,&quot; according to U.S. planners: There will be no doubt that U.S. statements on the use of nuclear weapons will have deterrent value. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty will be amended to prohibit uranium-enrichment for all countries that do not do it already; violators will be nuked. North Korea will be forced to disarm under the now real and credible threat of massive U.S. nuclear attack. Any country suspected of pursuing nuclear weapons or any other military capability that could threaten the U.S. or its allies will be nuked. Russia, China, and all other nuclear countries will eventually be forced to disarm under the threat of massive U.S. nuclear attack. However<span class="underline">, the real world does not always follow the script envisioned by U.S. planners</span>, as the Iraq experience illustrates.

<span class="underline">A common misconception about nanotech is that it is a single technology. Unlike biotechnology (which focuses on genes and DNA) or information technology (which focuses on microchips and software), <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nanotechnology encompasses a collection of methods and tools</span> for dealing with all matter <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">at the nano scale</span>.</span> It is best thought of as a new approach to building things. <span class="underline">Working at <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the nano scale allows us to manufacture with</span> unparalleled <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">precision and efficiency</span>. Rather than mining tons of ore at a great cost to the environment to find a handful of diamonds, nanotechnologists can start with carbon and build a flawless diamond one atom at a time</span>. Because they are so precise, nanotech processes waste less material, consume less energy and produce better results. Nanotechnology is the frontier of innovation; given its potential, it is not surprising that it is the focus of a global scientific race. The prize for winning this race is leadership in the production of renewable energy, clean water, cancer cures and next-generation computing. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The U.S</span>. government <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">took an early lead in 2002</span> with the 21st Century Research and Development Act, which pledged $5 billion over four years to become a leader in nano science. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">That lead has</span> steadily been <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">eroded.

<span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The prospect of revolutionary advances in military capabilities will stimulate competition to develop and apply the new technologies toward war preparations, as falling behind would imply an intolerable security ris</span>k</span>. Indeed, it is plausible that <span class="underline">a <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nation which gained a sufficient lead in</span> molecular <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nanotechnology would at some point be in a position to simply disarm any potential competitors. If two or more technologically advanced nations or blocs exis</span>t in de facto confrontation, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">regardless of political differences or other substantial conflicts of interest, then competition to apply the advanced technologies could segue directly into an uncontrolled arms race</span></span> — unless restraints have been put in place before the new technologies can be applied.<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">A race to develop early military applications of molecular manufacturing could yield sudden breakthroughs, leading to the abrupt emergence of new and unfamiliar threats, and provoking political and military reactions which further reinforce a cycle of competition and confrontation</span>. </span><br />
With molecular manufacturing, international trade in both raw materials and finished goods can be replaced by decentralized production for local consumption, using locally available materials. The decline of international trade will undermine a powerful source of common interest. Further, artificial intelligence will displace skilled as well as unskilled labor. A world system based on wage labor, transnational capitalism and global markets will necessarily give way. We imagine that a golden age is possible, but we don't know how to organize one. As global capitalism retreats, it will leave behind a world dominated by politics, and possibly feudal concentrations of wealth and power. <span class="underline">Economic insecurity, and fears for the material and moral future of humankind may lead to the rise of demagogic and intemperate national leaders. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">With almost two hundred sovereign nations, each struggling to create a new economic and social order, perhaps the most predictable outcome is chaos: shifting alignments, displaced populations, power struggles, ethnic conflicts inflamed by demagogues, class conflicts, land disputes, etc. Small</span> and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">underdeveloped nations will be</span> more than ever <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">dependent on the major powers for access to technology, and more</span> than ever <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">vulnerable to sophisticated forms of control or subversion, or to outright domination</span>.</span> Competition among the leading technological powers for the political loyalty of clients might imply reversion to some form of nationalistic imperialism. Competition for control of newly-exploitable resources on Earth and in space may generate dissension and hostility even between democracies, erstwhile friends and allies, while providing an overt rationale for deploying competitive military forces.<br />
If nuclear weapons remain limited in number, advanced nanotechnology could facilitate extensive civil defense construction, and provide active defense and counterforce weapons, undermining the nuclear &quot;balance of terror&quot; and creating the appearance of a possibility of victory in a war between major powers<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. <span class="underline">From a purely military perspective</span></span><span class="underline">, in <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the absence of a &quot;balance of terror,&quot; a confrontation between more or less equally advanced terrestrial nanotechnology powers could be unstable to preemption</span> — in both of the traditional senses:</span><br />
<em>Arms race instability</em>. <span class="underline">A large imbalance in deployed hardware could allow one side to strike with impunity, and even a few-to-one imbalance could be enough to provide assurance of victory</span>. If military production is based on a self-replicating capital base with a short generation time, the danger of falling behind on an exponential curve, or the opportunity to trump, would create unprecedentedly strong pressures to initiate or join and to maintain or gain the lead in a quantitative arms race. Unprecedentedly large masses of military hardware could be produced in an unprecedentedly short time. <em>First strike instability</em>. Even if two sides are evenly matched, high levels of deployed armaments may be militarily unstable, in that a surprise attack could perhaps decimate the opposing force before it could respond. This is especially likely in co-occupied environments, i.e. space, the oceans, and along land lines of confrontation. Forces based in protected areas may remain survivable, but serious competitors would not cede vast stretches of &quot;no man's land&quot; to enemy control in advance of a fight, and whoever strikes first in the co-occupied environments may gain an irreversible advantage. The greater the density of interpenetrating forces, the shorter the strike time. Thus a crisis becomes progressively less stable as a buildup proceeds.<br />
A perfect balance of technical and material resources is unrealistic in any case, which leads to a new type of strategic instability: <em>Early advantage instability.</em> <span class="underline">If one has an early lead in a replicator-based crisis arms buildup, the fact that a competitor may have somewhat faster replicators or superior weaponry, or may have access to a larger primary resource base, provides another strong stimulus to an early first strike. Moreover, it is unlikely that one actually knows the performance of an enemy's weapons or production base, particularly after a long peace. Thus, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a runaway nanotechnic arms race may be a race to nowhere; there may be no further island of stable military balance out there, even if we could manage to avoid war along the way. A very rapid pace of technological change destabilizes the political-military balance</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Revolutionary new types of weaponry, fear of what a competitor may be doing in secret, tense nerves and worst-case analyses, the complexity of technical issues, the unfamiliarity of new circumstances and resistance to the demands they make, may overwhelm the cumbersome processes of diplomacy and arms control, or even of intelligence gathering and assessment, formulation of measured responses and establishment of political consensus behind them</span>. A runaway military technological revolution must at some point escape the grasp of even wise decisionmakers. An increase of nuclear arsenals, deployment in more secure, covert basing modes, and development of new delivery systems designed to penetrate defenses, would prolong the reign of nuclear deterrence and postpone the day of possible vulnerability to nanotechnic aggression.</span> Thus a nuclear power or potential nuclear power, especially one that was behind in the technology race, might want to retain its nuclear options or even expand its nuclear arsenal. Advanced nanotechnology should also facilitate a possible nuclear rearmament to levels manyfold higher than those of the Cold War. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Thus it is possible that the result of a nanotechnic arms race will be rampant nuclear proliferation and the expansion of major nuclear arsenals to warhead counts in the hundred thousands or millions — A new &quot;balance of terror,&quot; but note that a balance is not necessarily stable.</span> </span><br />

Increasing H-1B visas for STEM jobs is awesome – massively boosts innovation, jobs, and long term economic growth<br />

The Obama campaign called for “comprehensive immigration reform that improves our visa programs to attract some of the world's most talented people to America.”<span class="underline"> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In past years, the annual cap</span> of 85,000 H-1B visas</span> – including 20,000 slots for foreigners holding master's degrees or higher training from American universities – <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">was met within days of the application period</span> opening.

There exists a positive relationship between the presence of foreign workers and increased job opportunities for Americans. And results indicate that both international graduate students and skilled immigrants have a significant and positive impact on innovative activities in the US as proxied by future patent applications as well as on future patents awarded to university and nonuniversity institutions. Thus, an increase in the H-1B visas quota for holders of advanced degrees could lead to a significant increase in employment opportunities for Americans as well as a boost to innovation-driven long-run economic growth. <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">PROPOSAL Support relief from H-1B caps for foreigners holdin</span>g</span> master's <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">degrees</span></span> or higher training from American universities <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM</span>)</span>.

A World Bank Research Policy Working Paper (Chellaraj, Maskus and Mattoo, 2005) that looked at total patent applications, patents awarded to U.S. universities, and patents awarded to other U.S. entities (each scaled by the domestic labor force) estimated that both international graduate students and skilled immigrants have a significant and positive impact on future patent applications.

INCREASE IN EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICANS AND EXPANDED SIZE OF OVERALL JOB MARKET IN THE US. <span class="underline">The non-partisan</span> National Foundation for American Policy <span class="underline">(NFAP)</span> used a regression model that controls for both general market conditions and firm size and <span class="underline">found that that <span style="background-attachment: initial;

Hypothesizing about government is key to political change<br />
David E. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">MCCLEAN</span></span>, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2001</span></span>, “The Cultural Left and the Limits of Social Hope,” Am. Phil. Conf., www.american-philosophy.org/archives/past_conference_programs/pc2001/Discussion%20papers /david_mcclean.htm<br />
<span style="font-size: 6.5pt;">Yet for some reason, at least partially explicated in Richard Rorty's Achieving Our Country, a book that I think is long overdue, leftist critics continue to cite and refer to the eccentric and often a priori ruminations of people like those just mentioned, and a litany of others including Derrida, Deleuze, Lyotard, Jameson, and Lacan, who are to me hugely more irrelevant than Habermas in their narrative attempts to suggest policy prescriptions (when they actually do suggest them) aimed at curing the ills of homelessness, poverty, market greed, national belligerence and racism. I would like to suggest that it is time for American social critics who are enamored with this group, those who actually want to be relevant, to recognize that they have a disease, and a disease regarding which I myself must remember to stay faithful to my own twelve step program of recovery. The disease is the need for elaborate theoretical &quot;remedies&quot; wrapped in neological and multi-syllabic jargon</span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">. These</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">elaborate theoretical remedies are more &quot;interesting</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">,&quot; to be sure, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">than</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> the </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">pragmatically settled questions</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">about what shape democracy should take in various contexts, or whether private property should be protected by the state, or regarding our basic human nature</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> (</span><span class="underline">described</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, if not defined (heaven forbid!), </span><span class="underline">in such statements as &quot;We don't like to starve&quot; and &quot;We like to speak our minds without fear of death</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot; </span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">and &quot;We like to keep our children safe from poverty&quot;). As Rorty puts it, &quot;When one of today's academic leftists says that some topic has been 'inadequately theorized,' you can be pretty certain that he or she is going to drag in either philosophy of language, or Lacanian psychoanalysis, or some neo-Marxist version of economic determinism. . . .</span> <span class="underline">These <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">futile attempts to philosophize one's way into political relevance are a symptom of what happens when a Left retreats from activism and adopts a spectatorial approach to the problems of its country. Disengagement from practice produces theoretical hallucinations</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;</span><span style="font-size: 6.5pt;">(italics mine).(1) Or as John Dewey put it in his The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy, &quot;I believe that philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a historical cud long since reduced to woody fiber, or an apologetics for lost causes, . . . . or a scholastic, schematic formalism, unless it can somehow bring to consciousness America's own needs and its own implicit principle of successful action.&quot; Those who suffer or have suffered from this disease Rorty refers to as the Cultural Left, which left is juxtaposed to the Political Left that Rorty prefers and prefers for good reason. Another attribute of the Cultural Left is that its members fancy themselves pure culture critics who view the successes of America and the West, rather than some of the barbarous methods for achieving those successes, as mostly evil, and who view anything like national pride as equally evil even when that pride is tempered with the knowledge and admission of the nation's shortcomings. In other words</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the Cultural Left</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, </span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">in this country,</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">too often dismiss American society as beyond reform and redemption</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">And Rorty correctly argues that</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this is a disastrous conclusion</span></span><span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">, i.e. disastrous for the Cultural Left. I think it may also be disastrous for our social hopes, as I will explain</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Leftist American culture critics might put their considerable talents to better use if they bury some of their cynicism</span> </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">about America's social and political prospects </span><span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and help forge public and political possibilities</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">in a spirit of determination to, indeed, achieve our country - the country of Jefferson and King; the country of John Dewey and Malcom X; the country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin, and of the later George Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater. To invoke the words of King, and with reference to the American society, the time is always ripe to seize the opportunity to help create the &quot;beloved community,&quot; one woven with the thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that shoots for nothing less than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both same sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be able to be part of the same social reality, one wherein business interests and the university are not seen as belonging to two separate galaxies but as part of the same answer to the threat of social and ethical nihilism.</span> <span class="underline"><span style="background-attachment: initial;

but more important</span></span> <span style="font-size: 7.0pt;">to the prospect of our flourishing - questions such as &quot;How is it possible to develop a citizenry that cherishes a certain hexis, one which prizes the character of the Samaritan on the road to Jericho almost more than any other?&quot;

Local solutions inevitably fail-only speaking in the dominant language can ever successfully change international politics. <br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">George </span><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Monbiot</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, journalist, academic, and political and environmental activist, </span><span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2004</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, Manifesto for a New World Order, p. 11-13 </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The quest for global solutions is difficult and divisive. </span><span class="underline">Some members of this movement are</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> deeply </span><span class="underline">suspicious of all institutional power</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> at the global level, fearing that it could never be held to account by the world’s people. Others are concerned that a single set of universal prescriptions would threaten the diversity of dissent. </span><span class="underline">A smaller faction has argued that all political programmes are oppressive</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">: our task should not be to replace one form of power with another, but to replace all power with a magical essence called ‘anti-power’. </span><span class="underline">But</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> most of the members of this movement are coming to recognize that </span><span class="underline">if we propose solutions which can be effected only at the local</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> or the national</span><span class="underline"> level, we remove ourselves from any meaningful role in solving precisely those problems which most concern us. Issues such as</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> cli­mate change, international debt, nuclear proliferation, </span><span class="underline">war, peace and the balance of trade between nations can be addressed only globally or internationally. Without global measures and global institutions, it is impossible to</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> see how we might distribute wealth from rich nations to poor ones, tax the mobile rich and their even more mobile money, control the shipment of toxic waste, sustain the ban on landmines, prevent the use of nuclear weapons, </span><span class="underline">broker peace between nations or prevent powerful states from forcing weaker ones to trade on their terms. If we were to work only at the local level, we would leave these, the most critical of issues, for other people to tackle. Global governance will take place </span><span class="Emphasis2">whether we participate</span><span class="underline"> in it </span><span class="Emphasis2">or not</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. Indeed, </span><span class="underline">it must take place if the issues which concern us are not to be resolved by the brute force of the powerful</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. That the international institutions have been designed or captured by the dictatorship of vested interests is not an argument against the existence of international institutions, but a reason for overthrowing them and re­placing them with our own. It is an argument for a global political system which holds power to account. </span><span class="underline">In the absence of an effective global politics</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, moreover, </span><span class="underline">local solutions will always be undermined by communities of interest which do not share our vision. We might</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, for example, </span><span class="underline">manage to persuade the people of the street in which we live to give up their cars</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> in the hope of preventing climate change, </span><span class="underline">but unless </span><span class="Emphasis2">everyone</span><span class="underline">, in all communities, either shares our politics or is bound by the same rules, we simply open new road space into which the neighbouring communities can expand. We might declare our neighbour­hood nuclear-free, but unless we are simultaneously work­ing, at the international level, for the abandonment of nuclear weapons, we can do </span><span class="Emphasis2">nothing</span><span class="underline"> to prevent ourselves and everyone else from being threatened by people who are not as nice as we are</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.

Of all the weapons of mass destruction, the <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">genetically engineered biological weapons</span>, many <span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">without a known cure or vaccine, are an extreme danger to the continued survival of life on earth</span></span>. Any perceived military value or deterrence pales in comparison to the great risk these weapons pose just sitting in vials in laboratories. While a &quot;nuclear winter,&quot; resulting from a massive exchange of <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">nuclear weapons</span></span>, could also kill off most of life on earth and severely compromise the health of future generations, they <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">are easier to control. Biological weapons</span></span>, on the other hand, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">can get out of control very easily, as the recent anthrax attacks has demonstrated</span></span>. There is no way to guarantee the security of these doomsday weapons because very tiny amounts can be stolen or accidentally released and then grow or be grown to horrendous proportions. The Black Death of the Middle Ages would be small in comparison to the potential damage bioweapons could cause. Abolition of chemical weapons is less of a priority because, while they can also kill millions of people outright, their persistence in the environment would be less than nuclear or biological agents or more localized. Hence, chemical weapons would have a lesser effect on future generations of innocent people and the natural environment. Like the Holocaust, once a localized chemical extermination is over, it is over. With nuclear and biological weapons, the killing will probably never end. Radioactive elements last tens of thousands of years and will keep causing cancers virtually forever. <span class="underline">Potentially worse than that, <span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">bio-engineered agents</span> by the hundreds <span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">with no known cure could wreck even greater calamity on the human race than could persistent radiation. AIDS and ebola viruses are just a small example of recently emerging plagues with no known cure or vaccine</span>. Can we imagine hundreds of such plagues? <span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">HUMAN EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE</span></span>.<br />
