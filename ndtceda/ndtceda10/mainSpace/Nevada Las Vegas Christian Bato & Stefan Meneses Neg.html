Violation: The Affirmative Focuses on the theoretical process of disruption of heteronormative discourse through US immigration policy.<br />
<br />
We Have a Couple Net Benefits to This Interpretation:<br />
<br />
First is Critical Pedagogy: Debating the Process of Politics is not Enough – the Only Way to Test the Viability of Methodology is to Look at the Outcomes Rather Than the Goals of Politics<br />
<br />
These Calls That Reorient Social Norms Fundamentally Alter Policy – Ignoring This Fixture in Debate Posits Their Aff as Nonfalsifiable and Does Not Truly Test the Nature of Policy<br />

<u>Economic development has been the most AND</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;It's Time For A Change!&quot;</span><br />

Believing the discursive is co extensive of the social is flawed-it dematerializes power by decoupling domination from exploitation and viewing power as a diffuse practice. The call to focus on symbols places consumption as a method of resistance-it is how we consume and understand symbols that is the key. This ignores that every capitalist transgression has been rooted from production, not consumption. <br />

The alternative is to reject the affirmative for an unconditional fidelity to a Universal struggle for political economic emancipation.
