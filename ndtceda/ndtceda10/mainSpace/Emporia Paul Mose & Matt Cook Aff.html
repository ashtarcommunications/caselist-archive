<br />
SUFFERING OF THE ILL IS UNIQUE- CONFRONTATION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT THE SHARING OF PAIN BETWEEN NURSES AND THE ILL- THIS GIVES VOICE TO THE MARGINALIZED- WITHOUT NURSES PATIENTS EXPERIENCE SELF FRAGMENTATION AS THE CONFRONTATION IS TOO OVERWHELMING TO EXPERIENCE ALONE <br />

<br />
THIS EXPERIENCE PROVIDES AUTHENTICITY TO LIFE- WITHOUT SUCH A CONNECTION THE MEANING OF LIFE BECOMES MATERIAL AND DELUSIONAL- THE INTERCONNECTED ENCOUNTER WITH FEAR RESULTS IN AN EMPOWERING HOPE- WE CANNOT CONTROL WHEN WE WILL DIE OR THE TIMES WE WILL FEEL PAIN IN OUR LIFE, BUT COMING TO TERMS WITH THE DEPENDENT NATURE OF BEING REMOVES LIMITATIONS AND ENABLES MEANINGS TO BE ASSIGNED TO LIFE THAT TRANSCEND CONSUMPTIVE OBJECTS <br />

We read the full version of the advantage. The full version is all of the ev listed above in addition to these cards THIS ETHIC OF CARE CAN ONLY BE CULTIVATED BY CREATING A MORE CULTURALLY DIVERSE NURSING COMMUNITY- GIVING OTHERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN ALLOWS A NURSE IDENTITY TO BE FORMED WHICH ELIMINATES MEDICAL INDIFFERENCE <br />

<u>THE NURSE/PATIENT</u>  RELATIONSHIP IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER- IT IS BODILY AND INTIMATE WHICH MAKES HOPE AND COMFORT POSSIBLE<br />

<br />
CARE IS A TWO WAY STREET- BOTH PATIENTS AND NURSES SUFFER- RELIEF IS EXTENDED TO BOTH PARTIES <br />

<br />
HEALTH CARE TODAY TREATS PATIENTS LIKE NUMBERS- NURSES REPRESENT A BREAK FROM THIS VIEW AND ARE THE CRUCIAL TO COMPETENT CARE <br />

<br />
OBSESSION WITH SAVING LIVES AND FINDING CURES REPRESENT A BIOMEDICAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH MAKES SUFFERING IMPOSSIBLE TO RESOLVE- DEATH IS INEVITABLE- IT’S JUST A QUESTION OF THE QUALITY OF LIVES WE ARE ABLE TO LIVE- RESOLVING UNNECESSARY SUFFERING MUST TAKE PRIORITY <br />

<br />
THIS CONFRONTATION WITH OUR FINITUDE ENABLES LIFE- IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER LIFE HAS VALUE OR NOT, BUT RATHER IF IS AUTHENTIC OR INAUTHENTIC- NURSING REPRESENTS A UNIQUE SITE WHERE WE COME TO ACCEPT THE PROCESS OF DEATH AND THE TRUE NATURE OF CARING CAN BE REVEALED- THIS PURGES FEAR AND ANXIETY AND ALLOWS THE ONLY REAL SECURITY TO COME INTO BEING <br />
