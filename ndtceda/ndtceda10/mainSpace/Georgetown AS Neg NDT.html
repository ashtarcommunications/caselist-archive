Nair 6/6/10 <br />
Yasmin Nair is a Chicago-based writer, activist, academic, and commentator. Which mostly means that she struggles to pay rent while living the glamorous life of a freelance writer. Her work appears in Windy City Times, where she is a columnist, reporter, photographer, and book reviewer. Her work has also appeared and/or appears in venues like Discourse, GLQ, make/shift, Time Out Chicago, Bitch magazine and Maximum Rock'n'Roll. Her writing and organising address neoliberalism, inequality, and the politics of rescue and affect; the immigration crisis; queer politics and theory, and the contours of a ridiculous gay movement that pretends that the right to marry, the right to kill, and hate crimes legislation actually constitute some kind of leftist agenda. <br />
She is part of the editorial collective of Against Equality (www.againstequality.org) and a member of the Chicago grassroots organisation Gender JUST (Justice United for Societal Transformation). <br />

1. <u>Decisionmaking</u>: Linking the ballot to a <em>should</em> question teaches the skills to organize pragmatic consequences <em>and</em> philosophical values into a course of action.<br />
2. <u>Preparation and clash</u>: Changing the question now leaves one side unprepared, resulting in shallow, uneducational debate. Requiring debate on a communal topic forces argument development and develops persuasive skills. <br />
Debating within the parameters determined by the topic creates radical agonistic democratic politics. The disregard of rules turns adversaries into enemies and games into conflicts. Vote negative because they’re not playing.<br />
