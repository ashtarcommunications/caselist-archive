Topicality<br />
Our interpretation- “Expanding beneficiary eligibility” means removing direct restrictions on who may receive the visa<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Boswell 2010</span></span> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(Richard, Professor of Law, University of California, Hastings College of the Law, Symposium: Immigration Law and Reform: Article: Crafting an Amnesty with Traditional Tools: Registration and Cancellation, Harvard Journal on Legislation, Winter, 47 Harv.

<br />
Violation- the aff doesn’t remove a current restriction<br />
<br />
Reasons to vote<br />
Predictability- statutory restrictions are literally the only way we can predict who can apply for what visa- if you let them arbitrarily add a group of people to a visa unrelated to its requirements the NDT will be nothing but waves of Iranian physicist affs for all the different visas<br />
Extra-T- even if you interpret their new path to the visa as removing all of the other restrictions on the new group of people, they are IMPOSING another requirement on those people, which is anti-topical- reject the whole aff in order to make the 2NR manageable<br />
Ground- we should get “current restrictions good” ground- you will be giving the aff “new restrictions good” advantages we won’t be able to find answers to<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Visas should be made fully tradable between states, distributed in proportion to past immigration levels, and issued with a quota of 140,000. The fifty state governments of the United States should expand beneficiary eligibility for employment-based visas to include qualified F-1 visa holders who graduate from an appropriately accredited U.S. university who pass appropriate security screening measures and who are offered jobs in the United States aerospace industry.

Our Interpretation- The literature treats the “beneficiary of the visa” differently from the petitioner- you can only change requirements of who’s getting it- not who can petition for it<br />

“Beneficiary eligibility” is what you need to do to get the visa if someone petitions for you. The plan might affect someone’s eligibility, but it’s that of the petitioner, not the beneficiary- here’s evidence contextualizing that distinction- this is literally one of Emory’s aff T cards, maybe not even underlined differently<br />

VAWA 1994 and VAWA 2000 are AND the structure of the U visa.<br />

Effects- changing the petitioner process might result in more people being able to get the visa- but that doesn’t mean what THEY had to do to get the visa changed- forcing us to evaluate the effects of the plan eliminates any restriction on what the plan can do<br />
<br />
Legal precision- the actual immigration process treats “beneficiaries” and “petitioners” differently- enforcing that distinction is key to predictable and useful education on the subject<br />

The United States Federal Government, through the appropriate branch and procedures for that act as per the advocacy of Endelman and and Mehta, should:<br />
- ensure non-visa based pathways to entry, work and travel including parole entry and reentry, parole in place, deferred action and annual authorizations of advanced parole and employment authorization documents for persons and relevant derivative beneficiaries who have not been granted visas solely because the United States Federal Government has not expanded eligibility for H-4 and CR-1 visa holders to include self-petitioning for IR-1 visas.<br />
- allow provisional submission of I-485 status adjustment, with ancilliary benefits, without a currently available final priority date and freeze the age of derivative children upon filing<br />
- allow status adjustment for all parolees without any barriers that are not generally applicable to those with non-parole status<br />
