<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>The modern age is characterized by a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempts to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal “Real” world toward which our apparent world aspires. Enter the affirmative. In the modern drive toward certainty and security and in an attempt at renouncing disorder and insecurity, the plan labors to mold and order the world to make it duplicate our idealized image of the Order.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world order. It is not a coincidence that Breaking New occurs at every fifteen minutes because international politics are unpredictable. The insecurities cited by the affirmative are not unique; international terrorism is an ever-present threat, a SARS outbreak is just around the corner, killer bees are infesting our neighborhoods and there might just be poision in our children's halloween candy. The uncomfortable yet irresistible truth is that uncertainty and risk are part and parcel with human life. Rather than coming to terms with this, the affirmative encourages us to stay glued to the television screen, stocking up on duct tape and water. At issue here is not just life itself but what makes life valuable. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affirmative's world of paranoid tiptoeing.</strong></span><br />

The 1AC is a typical response to the issue of immigration and remains profoundly silent on the question of the very land subject to access and migration towards. The plan action serves as a mask for the state, making it appear benevolent, even as its existence is contingent upon a continuing legacy of colonization that guarantees continued international exploitation and environmental degradation, turning the case. <br />

The Alternative is to reject the Affirmative and pursue indigenous land return as a first priority. This act of impossible realism solves the case—Colonization is the root cause of oppression, environmental exploitation and war. Only a return to an indigenous politics can remedy the ills of colonialism.<br />

Resisting this reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale.<br />

Our alternative is to completely withdraw from the ideology of capital – this is essential to destroy the fetish that allows capital to survive.<br />
