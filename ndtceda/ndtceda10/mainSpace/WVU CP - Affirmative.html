 Science can not foresee political events<br />

 Observation One is Inherency <br />
<strong>Sex Trafficking affects millions of people, mostly women and girls and makes upwards of 10 Billion dollar a year industry.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="color: #333333;">Current T-Visa system fails to effectively challenge human trafficking problems in the United States. It mostly leads to criminalization and deportation of those who have been trafficked into the United States. </span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="color: #333333;">Despite actions by many international organizations and worldwide efforts to halt human-trafficking, it is still on the rise. Millions of people are sold into this form of modern-day slavery with little to no hope of escaping. </span></strong><br />

Thus we propose the following plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should expand eligibility requirements for T visas by removing the “severe” requirement and the “mandatory” law enforcement requirement.<br />

Observation Two is the Harms <br />
Harm one is Capitalism <br />
<strong>Western Capitalism and sex trafficking are interlinked and the rise of one will lead to the rise of the other. The rise of globalization has created the perfect environment for the trafficking of humans across borders, and the profits gained by sex trafficking has allowed capitalism to grow exponentially.</strong><br />
<br />
Siddharth Kara, 2009 (Page 3-4)<br />
Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery<br />
<br />
We must challenge globalization if we are going to be able to stop sex trafficking and end these modern day form of slavery. <br />
Siddharth Kara, 2009 (Page 24)<br />
Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery<br />
<br />
<strong>Capitalism is not good. Put away your space wars and hypothetical war scenarios, Capitalism and the globalization have increased poverty levels, and civil strife, on top of the expounding the ability for sex trafficking to happen. Modern day slavery is hands down the most important impact in this round.</strong><br />
Siddharth Kara, 2009 (Page 25)<br />
Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery<br />
<br />
<strong>Globalization and human trafficking are interlinked Breaking down trafficking breaks down capitalism, meaning if we win any risk that removing restrictions for T-visas will be able to halt on instance of human trafficking we will be able to start the method to dismantle the Western capitalist system.</strong><br />

<br />
Harm 2 is Deportation <br />
The “severe” requirement and the “mandatory” law enforcement requirements often lead to deportation of those trafficked into the United States. <br />

<br />
<em><strong>Deportation will lead to the increased risk of sex trafficking, therefore the affirmative needs to take a stance to keep those who are trafficked into this country to ability to not be sent back to the places where they were orgininally trafficked.</strong></em><br />

<em><strong>SENDING THOSE WHO WERE TRAFFICKED BACK HOME CREATES A REPETIVE AND VISIOUS CYCLE.</strong></em><br />

<br />
<em>Harm 3 is Dehumanization</em><br />
<em><strong>Human trafficking is slavery, people are bought and sold and forced to work for little or no pay. Not only are they forced to work without pay most are sold into unimaginable conditions.</strong></em><br />

<em>Observation Three is Solvency</em><br />
<em><strong>Our solvency comes through a multifaceted approach. We combine our awareness through speech acts in this round as well as a policy approach both of which are necessary to really begin to halt sex trafficking. Bringing awareness to the issue is the first key step to curtailing sex trafficking. Our speech acts are a way to recognize the problems of sex trafficking and putting a halt into this form of modern day slavery. Though it may seem unlikely our voices and our education can begin to challenge these forms of modern day slavery and actually lead to substantial change.</strong></em><br />
<em>Siddharth Kara, 2009 (Page 41-42)</em><br />

<br />
<br />
<em><strong>To solve the instances of sex trafficking there must be a multi-faceted approach to understanding sex trafficking and beginning to halt it. Our plan is the best way to approach the resolution as a means to solve a large global issue.</strong></em><br />

<br />
<em><strong>The “severe” necessary to get a T-Visa only perpetuates this form of modern-day slavery. Without removing this criterion we will always be unable to halt this form of enslavement.</strong></em><br />
