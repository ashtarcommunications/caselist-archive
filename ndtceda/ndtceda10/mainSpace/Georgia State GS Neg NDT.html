 Solvency<br />
The affirmative’s giving is narcissistic rather than genuine. Polysemy is simply used to generate popularity for the authors<br />
Ceccerelli 1998, Polysemy: “Multiple Meanings in the rhetorical criticism <em>Quarterly Journal of Speech, V</em> 84 #4 P396<br />
In contrast..selling the text<br />
The strategic deployment of a polysemic text i.e. the affirmative’s advocacy statement, is designed to promote convergence rather than resistence<br />

Ceccerelli 1998, Polysemy: “Multiple Meanings in the rhetorical criticism <em>Quarterly Journal of Speech, V</em> 84 #4 P396<br />
While McKerrow’s..of a text<br />
Reading polysemy as having infinite interpretive meaning is wrong<br />
Ceccerelli 1998, Polysemy: “Multiple Meanings in the rhetorical criticism <em>Quarterly Journal of Speech, V</em> 84 #4 P396<br />
Likewise…but finite meanings<br />
No Solvency—Polysemy is about interpretations, polyvalence is about judgement. By rendering a judgement of the resolution, i.e. that it is bad and leads to forced labor, the affirmative can’t access the interpretative benefits of polysemy<br />
