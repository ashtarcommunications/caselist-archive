<strong>Contention One is the Advocacy:</strong><br />
<strong>We affirm the schizoanalytic politics of the 1AC as a means of political strategy but reject the use of a government based plan of action.</strong><br />
<strong>The 1AC simultaneously defends two interpretations of political strategy. There is a plan-oriented pragmatic strategy which surrounds the one sentence traditional plan text. There is also a bottom-up movement which takes the form of rhizomatic politics described in the 1AC Conley evidence. We defend the micropolitical process as described in their 1AC Conley evidence and reject the goals-oriented form of politics which constructs the plan.</strong><br />
<strong>This is sufficient to solve, here is their Conley evidence in context:</strong><br />
Conley in 2006 (Verena Andermatt, professor of literature at Harvard, “Borderlines; Deleuze and the Contemporary World, 95-100)<br />
<strong>Note: this is the same card in the 1AC, but highlighted differently.</strong><br />
<strong>Over the last few decades, AND any generalized transformation would be impossible.</strong><br />
Disconnect yourself from the state, from collectives, from everything bigger than our agency. It is only when desire is confined and controlled, added to some larger pool, that we lose sight of our ability to form unique judgments and come to unique conclusions. Recognizing this individualism is necessary to challenge fascism<br />
<strong>Deleuze and Guattari, 1987 [A Thousand Plateaus pg 158-159]</strong><br />
<strong>We have come to the gradual AND and I have believed in them.”</strong><br />
Contention Two is the Net Benefits<br />
Link 1 is the Fixidity of the Plan – Rhizomatic politics form possibilities but the plan is a certainty – regardless of the process which results in the plan, it stands as a transcendent monument to the future goals of the movement. Because the plan dictates what the possible outcomes of rhizomatic politics can and cannot be, it has already sacrificed the ability to think creatively which is necessary to overcome the states attempt at counter-revolution<br />

<strong>What this type of radio achieved AND to outline projections of societal change.”</strong><br />
Link 2- It’s basically a prisoners dilemma – the state will adapt and follow your politics. It is worthless to challenge the state in a race to control – they have the lead and will copy our strategies before they can become successful. Their political strategy is doomed to failure.<br />

<strong>After the first four races in AND in the merits of their course.</strong><br />
Link Three is the Agency Trade-off DA: their focus on the government as the site for transformative politics trades-off with immediate micropolitical activism. Waiting for the rev to gain momentum ignores the power we already have to create change. Your role is to dismiss the promise of future change to affirm already existing struggles<br />
<strong>Deleuze and Parnet 87 (Gilles and Claire, profs of philosophy: Dialogues II: p. 146-147)</strong><br />
<strong>What characterizes our current situation is AND every level, in every place.</strong><br />
Link Four is Goals versus the Process - The status quo is paranoiac even in its attempt at counter culture. Status quo methodology confines experimentation to only processes with set goals in mind, destroying these movements from the beginning. We must instead abandon these final goals and embrace free thought.<br />

2NC, Wayne State, UNT Quarters<br />
2NC Advocacy Overview<br />
The 1NC Conley evidence discusses a series of movements which already exist in the status quo. These are the pro-rights, pro-queer, pro-humanist movements which defend an undermining of the dominant political order. Conley calls these movements becomings – that is, ways of ontologically restructuring being such that we are outside of the grasp of the dominant image of the middle class white male. This is a subversive form of political activism which moves outside of the state’s ability to impede progress. We affirm these movements as part of an age of becoming – we affirm the Rhizomatic politics discussed in the Conley evidence as a means of making already existing movements more effective. We are another latch onto this process. Another node. Another line of flight away from fascism. We affirm this process of being outside – of no longer trying to be inside, and escaping reconstitution. We affirm the unmitigated and uncontrollable chaos of Rhizomatic politics as a form of revolutionary energy to liberate both the self and the preconscious. <br />
Focusing on the micropolitical is key to reengage agency<br />
<strong>Colebrook 2002 (Claire, Understanding Deleuze, Pg. xxxviii)</strong><br />
<strong>Human freedom became the problem. AND effects, and organises our bodies.</strong><br />
2NC Alt EXT – BwO<br />
Extend the 1NC Deleuze and Guattari 87 evidence - Even if in the abstract the rhizomatic politics of the 1AC are good, we have the best piece of comparative link evidence on the distinction between the 1AC advocacy and the Alternative. They affirm the free space created by the Body Without Organs – a hypothetical space of existence where there are no pre-determined connections and no organization. This metaphor of the body without organs stands as a signifier for the potential of truly FREE politics. <br />
The distinction is the stranglehold the 1AC places upon this plane of freedom. The physical plan text confines infinite potential by bottle-necking it into the pragmatic realism of the plan. The problem is not that they are too unpredictable, it’s that they are not unpredictable ENOUGH. <br />
Instead of giving the Body without Organs a face and a purpose, we should strive to maintain its creative freedom. Affirming the free space created with the alternative is not a neutral act – we should learn from disconnected figure. The political strategy of the alternative understands that we should never reach a point of full separation, rather we should understand the possibility of complete freedom, and use those lessons to inform individual empowerment<br />

In its most elemental state it AND mollusc lives in its shell. ‘<br />
<br />
Link 1 EXT – Fixidity of the Plan<br />
Extend the 1NC Goddard evidence – the only successful challenge to the state must come in for the form of invisible groundswell. We cannot have fixed locations, identities, OR DEMANDS. The presence of the plan means no matter how subversive, no matter how revolutionary, and no matter how creative their iteration of schizoanalytic politics could be, their movement is always already confined by the fixed goals of the 1AC plans prescription for change. Never forget that the state exists and enjoys its power – fighting the state and trying to change it will necessarily result in violent backlash against their movement, turns the case and proves an invisible violence net benefit to the alternative.<br />
Our link argument has 2 parts. The first is one of fixidity. We cannot begin our engagement with politics via a pre-determined plan of action. This guts solvency and leaves us powerless to adapt to specific situations, turns the case<br />

<strong>Claire: If you think about AND notion of redefinition that is inbuilt.</strong><br />
The second part of the link is visibility – once the state knows your plan of attack cooption is an inevitability. The only successful attacks against the state require invisible and unknowable challenges to state hegemony. Even if their politics could create change it would be rubber-stamped by the state and rendered always-already an empty signifier creating only enough change to be completely worthless. The visibility of the plan negates revolutionary potential.<br />

Link 2 EXT – Game Theory<br />
The affs description of their political process ignores the states ability to fight back. Their strategy for change assumes a static conception of the battle between state fascism and liberatory rhizomatic politics. The state and capitalism are not frozen in carbonite, they are organic systems capable of absorbing challenges against them. We should assume the response of the state before we make our move. The state will copy any strategy aimed at challenging it and conform accordingly. Attacks against the state will fail and be quickly reabsorbed.<br />
Our Dixit and Nalebluff evidence is better than their link defense because it applies rational game theory as a model for understanding political struggle. Game theory is a preferable way of understanding political strategy because it takes into account the reaction of the state. They lead to form of tunnel-vision politics which can only account for actions in a static vacuum. Even if our 1NC evidence is only a metaphor, we should draw from that metaphor and apply it to the specific context of the status quo.<br />
Here is contextual framework evidence to support that <br />

<strong>Introduction What Is Strategic Behavior? AND ways strategic thinking remains an art.</strong><br />
This they cannot solve – the state’s ability to quickly adapt to our strategies means it will always maintain its lead. For every Jon Stewart there are twenty Glenn Becks, and there is a strange pattern of tanks and S.W.A.T. teams showing up at protests.<br />
It is hopeless to combine the creation of new forms of political subjectivity with demands upon the state. They let the state set the agenda which dooms failure because it leaves their protest beholden to the state. Instead of trying to control and repress the state, we should build outside of it<br />

<strong>Cracks break with the logic of AND the social synthesis of capitalist society.</strong><br />
Link 4 EXT – Goals Oriented Politics<br />
We should be willing to experiment – the plan acts as a guiding presence which keeps the revolutionary potential of Rhizomatic politics confined and controlled. They will say we can try new things, but only if they can result in the holy truth of the plan. Feel free to change things up as long as you don’t stray too far. Enjoy thinking creatively as long as it benefits the movement. This form of affecting change mirrors the rigidity of the scientific method which securitizes the purity of its field by negating freedom of experimentation. Instead we should affirm the faceless, formless potential of the rhizome to create entirely new political formations.<br />
Directing our policies towards the state ultimately undoes the good from experimental politics and recreates oppression. Instead we must abandon the seeking of the state.<br />

2NC Link – Plan<br />
The plan is a form of transcendent ethics which disconnects agency from action – the 1AC understanding of agency creates a slave-ontology which replicates oppression and prevents liberatory politics<br />
