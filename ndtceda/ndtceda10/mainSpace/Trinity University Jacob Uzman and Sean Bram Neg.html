C. vote negative – topicality tells the negative what they should and should not be prepared to debate.<br />
1. limits – section 212 of the INA governs admissibility and includes over 50 different categories which are each potential affs. Combining that with the many different requirements within each visa makes the topic impossible especially because the two sets of law are completely distinct.<br />
2. precision – our evidence draws clear distinctions between eligibility and admissibility, reject any evidence that casually uses the words interchangeably, otherwise the meaning of the resolution is impossible to predict <br />

 Text<br />
The United States Federal Government should establish an independent Standing Commission on Immigration of nonpartisan economists charged with the mandate of establishing a sealed-bid, single-price auction system for the distribution of tradable visa permits to employers wishing to sponsor employment-based visas for noncitizens that hold advanced degrees in science or technology from accredited universities in the United States. Auctions should take place quarterly, with an initial yearly allocation of 345,000 visas, and include a resale market for visa permits. The initial non-disclosed reserve price for visa permits should be $10,000. Subsequent allocations of visas should rise proportionally when the average price of permits was above $10,000, and fall proportionally when the average price was below $10,000, in the prior auction. If the allocation of permits disproportionately favors large companies, an adequate number of permits should be set aside for small companies to bid. Employment-based visa holders should be eligible to purchase back their visa permit in the resale market.<br />
