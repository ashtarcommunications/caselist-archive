<br />
B- Violation<br />
<br />
They use normative arguments that don’t show the plan is probable.<br />
[In fact, their inherency evidence says it won’t pass, which negates!]<br />
<br />
C- Standards<br />
<br />
1. Predictability—USFG action can have infinitely many effects throughout the world, making it impossible for us to prepare for all normative implications.<br />
2. Learning—our interpretation ensures in-depth learning about how policies are implemented and why. This outweighs their learning claims since it constitutes 90% of policy-making.<br />

<br />
Further, we co-opt their offense since prediction skills are key to assessing the desirability of policies.<br />
3. Normative claims can’t be proven<br />

An agent can only justify a [...] confer upon them by adopting them.<br />

That means (a) their interpretation makes debate impossible by reducing it to warrantless assumptions, and (b) even under their interpretation, you negate on presumption since they can’t possibly prove the USFG [ought to] to anything.<br />

B. Violation—the affirmative does not raise the cap by 70,000 <br />
<br />
C. Reasons to prefer <br />
1. Predictable ground and limits---key to link ground and counterplan ground. Substantial is the only check in the resolution. Affirmative interpretation would explode the topic and make aff ground unpredictable. This would devolve into negative use of generics crushing topic specific education and clash <br />
2. Bright line——increase the numbers by 51% or more—solves judge intervention <br />
