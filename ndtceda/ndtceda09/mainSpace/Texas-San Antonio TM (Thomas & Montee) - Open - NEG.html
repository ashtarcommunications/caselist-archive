Two new neg arguments over the last couple tournaments<br />
<br />
One is criticizing the way affirmative’s make collective statements about how all people should support nuclear disarmament and relate to nuclear weapons in the same way.<br />
The links are collective “we” rhetoric homogenizes views<br />
And also that state action assumes a collective agency that erases difference.<br />

<strong>Broke a new Baudrillard Argument at Texas</strong><br />
<br />
The 1NC is a combination of fictional arguments and cards from the Post Modern Generator. The debate is presented in a way that mocks some traditional norms of debate. Cards are tagged in extensive jargon. We state that we defend the 1NC performance.<br />
<br />
The 2NC makes the argument that debate is a meaningless performance anyway, and the attempt to make it better or more pure contributes to a capitalist logic of exchange. The only way to give discourse any meaning is to hyperconform the structures of debate to reveal how silly they are.<br />
<br />
The argument’s specifics depend on the type of the affirmative. These cards have been present both times we ran it. There were a few others, but I don’t have the cites on my computer yet.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>The aff views language as a neutral conduit for thought when in fact it has been oversaturated with meaning and will be co-opted by the sign economy</em></strong><br />

Very standard Tickner stuff.<br />
<br />
<strong>Queer Theory</strong><br />
Similar links to what you would expect to see with Fem IR. &quot;Rational&quot; actors, pragmatic action, state links, threat construction.<br />
<br />
The alternative is a queer epistemology over the methodology of the 1AC. As done through queer pedagogical practices.<br />

The struggle for identity and recognition assumes that we are alienated subjects. This creates a violence relationship towards difference. Kelly Oliver. &quot;The Look of Love.&quot; Hypatia 16:3<br />
&quot;There is a powerful resonance...and an alien world..&quot;<br />
<br />
Leads to an assimilative type of relationship towards the other<br />

<strong>Rasch K</strong><br />
<br />
Wars are not fought because of friend/enemy distinctions, they are fought because of the absence of them. Political actions based on ideals of peace have continually produced only more war.<br />

Carl Schmitt and Martin Heidegger on the Line(s) of Cosmopolitanism and the War on Terror.” Conference on the International Political Thought of Carl Schmitt. September 9-11<br />
&quot;This section examines...no more resistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
The affirmative's call to erase enmity and conflict in the name of a universal humanity renders exclusions invisible and violence and warfare become unlimited. The alternative is to reject this universal call and embrace an agonistic model of politics.<br />
RASCH, 2005 Lines in the Sand: Enmity as a Structuring Principle'<br />

Focusing on nuclear weapons fails to prevent war while it obscures the political conflicts that motivate violence --- any of which risk escalating to world catastrophe<br />
Charles Derber, professor of Sociology at Boston College and William A. Schwartz, Member of the Boston Nuclear Study Group, The Nuclear Seduction, 1990, p. 1-2<br />
The right, the… provoke worldwide catastrophe.<br />
<br />
And their exclusive focus on nuclear weapons serves to obfuscate and naturalize more pernicious forms of state violence --- collapses the reformist potential of their demand<br />

Marshall Beier 6, Assistant Professor of Political Science, McMaster University, McMaster University, Disarming Politics: Arms, Agency, and the (Post)Politics of Disarmament Advocacy, Canadian Political Science Association, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2007/Beier.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2007/Beier.pdf</a><br />
Post-Politics and… politics of our moment.<br />
<br />
This outweighs and turns their case --- the focus on weapons at the expense of state violence more broadly ensures that the state will ignore their appeal while larger and deadlier weapons get built<br />
Brian Martin, associate professor in Science, Technology and Society at the University of Wollongong, Australia, Peace Studies, No. 3, June/July 1986, pp. 36-39, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/86ps.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/86ps.html</a><br />
Nuclear disarmament is…. of their policies.<br />

DE-EMPHASIZING THE US NUCLEAR ARSENAL IS A FORM OF ANTI-NUCLEAR imperialism. The US will gladly announce a de-emphasized nuclear posture in order to ensure continued military dominance. The impact is US military domination, belligerent nonproliferation pressure, and otherization<br />

The Obama administration is likely to continue … disarm remains in the distant future, unaddressed as a present imperative.<br />
