Admittedly, there is a paradox here, because credible deterrence requires the development of war-fighting strategies and tactics, otherwise a potential aggressor will naturally doubt one's military capability and political will. For the same reason, exercises must be regularly carried out and strategic nuclear submarine patrols continually and carefully managed. Yet there comes a point, which may not be precisely identifiable, where the development of a seemingly-aggressive war-fighting strategy begins to cause a potential enemy to doubt one's own good faith. At that point, when the other nation's perception is of an aggressive rather than defensive posture on one's own side, then no longer is the effectiveness of deterrence enhanced; and no longer can the deterrence policy properly be called just11. The central point here is that successful deterrence depends upon mutual perception, so, compared to traditional Just War thinking, there is a fundamental shift of emphasis in Just Deterrence towards mutuality and reciprocity. In seeking a defensive deterrence posture, a distinction must be made between a defensive strategy and aggressive-seeming tactics. The strategy is to be pursued by the nation politically and militarily, in a way which prevents a political enemy from feeling threatened. Yet part of an</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><u>effective deterrence policy will include the posession of weapon systems which are clearly capable of counter-attack</u></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> (</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">in addition to strategic nuclear weapons),</span><span style="font-family:  Times  New Roman;"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><u>though their deployment is not meant as a provocative act.</u></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In deterrence, as in war, it is difficult to refute Clausewitz when he states that,'. . . defence without an active purpose is self-contradictory both in strategy and in tactics'12. Thus a</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><u>compromise may have to be reached between demonstrating a defensive posture to a potential enemy, and yet at the same time indicating to him (in order to enhance deterrence) a counter-attack capability</u></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. </span><span style="font-family:  Times New  Roman;">This element of compromise ('trade-offs' in contemporary jargon) affects the way in which many Just Deterrence criteria would have to be applied; but it is especially acute in the matter of a defensive posture, encouraging reconciliation</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.</span><br />

The affirmative’s depiction of the international system reflects an ontology of security that necessitates endless war –states must protect themselves from insecurity by violently managing the world around them<br />

The affirmative’s emphasis on quick-fix solutions ignores the root cause of their harms and ensures error replication – temporarily suspending our calculative thought is critical to re-engaging the ontological question<br />
