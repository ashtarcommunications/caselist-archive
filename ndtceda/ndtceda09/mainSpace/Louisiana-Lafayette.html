<br />
The use of the term theatre in regards to nuclear weapons is an ocularcentric imperialist mode of thinking which turns us all into spectators allowing our reality to be constructed through the nuclear eye – this is a mode of thinking devoid of ethics and only serves to enlist us all as passive participants in the war project –<br />
Marranca ‘ 82 (Bonnie, co-editor of performing arts journal, Nuclear theatre, Jstor)<br />
<br />
Theatre is an outmoded term – for today it is Nintendo warfare – human agency has been eliminated for the cold calculating eyes of the suicidal machine, which uses speed to control Time – Rendering us all under the techno strategic gaze of the new god<br />
Dasgupta ’91 (Gautam co-editor of PAJ publications, The Eyes of War, Performing Arts Journal Jstor)<br />
<br />
The nuclear missions referring to nuclear weapons as theatre create the modern reality that nuclear war is nothing more than a spectacle – it exists just as much in its representation to instill terror as it does to actual destroy populations – Creating a system which is more about controlling perceptions through speed and reducing human reflection and politics into a system of computer automation –<br />
<br />
Virilio 84 (Paul, war and Cinema – p. 1-3)<br />
<br />
The reliance upon the controlling of perception has reduced the world to what Heidegger refers to as a world picture – in which reality has been frozen and enframed so that it may be managed and controlled – this reduces the entire world to a target where what can be seen is only an object to be destroyed – creating the conditions for extermination<br />

<br />
Despite the idea that the technological eye is scientific, neutral and objective – the information which is gathered via the techno eye – only authorizes destruction -<br />

<br />
War as a spectacle to control perception erases Time and destroys the politics of reflection –<br />
James 7 (Ian James is Lecturer in French and Fellow of Downing College at the University of Cambridge. Paul Virilio p.<br />
<br />
Plan: the United States federal government should reduce and restrict all the nuclear theatre missions.<br />
<br />
The 1ac is an act of halting the instaneous speed which comes from military theatre – Our argument is not that the current missions are bad and need to be changed but that referring to those missions as theatre only accelerates the world destroying politics and human reflection taking the decision out of the hands of humans and instead allows the automation of destruction.<br />
<br />
VIRILIO AND LOTRINGER IN 2004 [Paul and Sylvere, Pure War<br />
<br />
We are the only political act capable of challenging the nuclear monarchy through questioning the essence of speed and nuclear technology. We do not claim to be able to avert nuclear war or get rid of any technology or even deterrence – instead if we insist on blowing ourselves up it will be because we have thought it over and not because a computer made the decision on our behalf -<br />
<br />
Potentially Virilio/Lotringer 87 (A Review Play on Paul Virilio/Sylvere Lotringer, Pure War Author(s): Silvia Federici and George Caffentzis Source: Social Text, No. 17 (Autumn, 1987), pp. 97-105)<br />
<br />
We are a direct response to the globalization of Time which comes through our over reliance upon speed…If the nuclear missions are good and should be reinstated that is fine but the decision will be made after reflection…. Only this act can make time for politics by allowing local time to matter -<br />
