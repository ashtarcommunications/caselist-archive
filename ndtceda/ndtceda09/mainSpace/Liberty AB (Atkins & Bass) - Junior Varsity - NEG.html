<br />
Disclosure K:<br />
Affirmatives that veer outside the boundaries of the topic must be disclosed in advance in order to give the negative the ability to prepare for a productive discussion. This means more than a cursory notification of the subject of the aff within 24 hours. A productive discussion requires the sharing of complete citations for evidence proffered as well as disclosure far enough in advance so that the negative can prepare for a productive debate and conversation about the affirmative.<br />
There are two impacts to our argument- first is informed decision-making: <br />
Debates where the neg lacks adequate preparation precludes an informed discussion that rigorously tests the efficacy of the aff. This outweighs all other impacts and is a prerequisite for voting for one team’s arguments or advocacy over the other’s- we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously testing it because you don’t know if you’re voting for a methodology that improves or worsens the world.<br />
<br />
AND- Their approach ensures there’s no gains from argumentation- debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion <br />
Shively, former Texas A&amp;M political science assistant professor, 2000 <br />
[Ruth, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, edited by Portis, Gundersen, and Shively, “Political Theory and the Postmodern Politics of Ambiguity,” 181-2, accessed 2007ish] <br />
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative… some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second impact is the possibility of change-the aff destroys possibility of political change by not allowing interlocutors to join the debate and buy into the affirmative’s political project. The criticism demonstrates the opportunity cost of engaging in the conversation over race in a certain way- they created the material conditions of a conversation framed in an adversarial format. <br />
<br />
The aff collapses deliberation- agreement on the fundamentals of the discussion is essential to prevent political debates from devolving into irresolvable ideological disputes.  <br />
Portis, Gunderson and Shively, Texas A&amp;M political science professors, 2000 <br />
[Edward Bryan, Adolf G., and Ruth Lessl, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, 2-3, accessed 2007ish] <br />
By extension, partisan divisions based upon competing …might be assessed and alternative positions evaluated. <br />
<br />
Specifically, a pre-condition to dealing with race is that the each side have the opportunity to rigorously test and carefully scrutinize the other’s arguments. The impact is the impossibility of better and more productive conversation about race and white supremacy. <br />
Walsh, University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor, 2008  <br />

Does this solution, which diverges from … has to involve the scrutiny of all participants.<br />
<br />
Black/White Binary Bad:<br />
The 1AC entrenches the black-white binary- cursory acknowledgements of a broader problem is insufficient- the aff marginalizes non-black minorities <br />
Perea, University of Florida law professor, 1997  <br />
[Juan, California Law Review, &quot;The Black/White Binary Paradigm of Race,&quot; 85 Calif. L. Rev. 1213, l/n, accessed 2-21-10, mss] <br />
B. Describing the Binary Paradigm of Race <br />
Paradigms of race shape our understanding of race and our definition … &quot;those that will not fit the box are often not seen at all.&quot; n29 <br />
<br />
This outweighs and turns the case- the black-white binary prevents coalitions and severely limits our understanding of racism <br />

[Juan, California Law Review, &quot;The Black/White Binary Paradigm of Race,&quot; 85 Calif. L. Rev. 1213, l/n, accessed 2-21-10, mss] <br />

<strong>Displaced Ethics</strong><br />
Victims and violence are not the only products of our increasingly traumatic modern world. Indeed, the process of speaking out and against sources of violence is the defining theme of our age. These discussions continually circulate towards the discussion of particular institutional practices and their mediation of our relationships.<br />
In essence, the questions most analyzed in the context of these discussions is not how can we assert ourselves as ethical individuals in the world, but instead what particular renegotiations of institutional practices provide us the opportunity to do so.<br />
The Affirmative poses the question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves with the reorientation of our collective political spheres takes precedent and in the process produces these ethics and our relationship with others merely as a background for political transformations. The affirmative makes the question not how much how we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationships which makes genuine ethical engagement impossible.<br />
Zupančič, 2000<br />
(Alenka, Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy @ the Slovene Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, p 10-11) cnb<br />
<br />
In other words, one cannot attain the realm of the ethical by means of a … rather, at the very act of desiring — it refers to the faculty of desire as a priori.<br />
<br />
The Affirmative will respond that the plan and the political plays no prominent role in the posture of the<br />
1AC. This, however, is the premise of our whole argument. Their belief that the political must remain in the background nonetheless, in order to generate change, is the ultimate sell-out of their ethical commitment. This act in and of itself is unethical because it admits from the get-go that the ethical posture alone is insufficient absent its capacity to generate change within the domain of institutional politics<br />
Thurschwell, 2003<br />

<br />
Thus, as Derrida puts it, &quot;ethics enjoins a politics and a law ... . but the political … presentation, all concepts&quot; n28 - which is to say, determined on the basis of something that resembles pure faith.<br />
<br />
The Belief that our activisms must inevitably, inexorably respond to the political conditions of our time through the leveraging of particular institutional appeals is precisely what nullifies our ethical potential. No matter the force of its opposition, the connection of transformation with an appeal to our institutions, mediates our relationships in such a manner that ethical transformation outside this frame of mediation becomes impossible.<br />
Hershock, 1999<br />
(Peter D., Project Fellow at the EastWest Center, Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Hawaii, &quot;Changing the Way Society Changes: Transposing Social Activism into a Dramatic Key&quot;, Journal of Buddhist Ethics 6, p 158-160, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.pdf</a>) cnb<br />
<br />
I have argued at some length (Hershock, 1999) that evaluating technologies on the …co-existence and for preserving “fair” definitions of ‘being right’ and ‘being wronged’.<br />
<br />
If the mediation of our ethics is the source of our ethical impoverishment and the corruption of our relationships, it’s time to withdraw from this framework of mediation. We ask you to affirm the ethical commitment of the 1AC in its immediacy. Suspending the wall that mediates our relationships constitutes the only genuine ethical act.<br />
Santilli, 2003<br />
(Paul, professor of philosophy @ Siena College, “Radical Evil, Subjection, and Alain Badiou’s Ethic of the Truth Event”, World Congress of The International Society for Universal Dialogue, May 22, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf</a>) cnb<br />
<br />
If we retain this original sense of “radical evil” as it appears in Kant’s … then, for both philosophers, we find no truth and no genuine morality.<br />
<br />
The displacement of our ethics onto external political institutions culminates in genocidal violence. Once we accept that our ethics are contingent on the political all atrocities becomes possible.<br />
Zupančič, 2000<br />
(Alenka, Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy @ the Slovene Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, p 96-98) cnb<br />
<br />
Another problem still remains, however: the question of the possibility … posit the ethical act as something which is in itself impossible, and exists only in it perpetual failure ‘fully’ to realize itself.<br />
<br />
For the affirmative, the ethical and the political are one in the same as inseparable. In essence, the political domain has become incomplete without ethical intervention and ethical intervention has become insufficient without political input. It is this logic that is responsible for the corruption of our ethics. Reading ethics through the lens of politics ignores ethical possibilities around us all the time. The affirmative builds a wall between these ethical possibilities, insisting that they are only possible when our political gestures are transformed.<br />
Žižek, 2001<br />
(Slavoj, Professor at the Institute for Sociology (Ljubljana) &amp; at the European Graduate School, Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?, p 160-163) cnb<br />
<br />
The problem here is: is not Lacan’s ‘ethics of the Real’ – the … Thing, thus excluding herself from the community regulated by the intermediate agency of symbolic regulations.<br />
<br />
The affirmative use of the political to answer the call of ethics causes the political to make itself indispensable in a never ending cycle of control—legal institutions thus co-opt social activism and shift unique individuals to the position of generic citizens, eliminating the relationships which provide the very meaning to life.<br />
Hershock, 1999<br />
(Peter D., Project Fellow at the EastWest Center, Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Hawaii, &quot;Changing the Way Society Changes: Transposing Social Activism into a Dramatic Key&quot;, Journal of Buddhist Ethics 6, p 158-160, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.pdf</a>) cnb<br />

The trouble is that, like other technologies biased toward control, the more successful legislation …, a societal depletion of our resources for meaningfully improvised and liberating intimacy with all things.<br />

<br />
Their symbol of Western liberalism makes all violence possible, demanding freedom to assert our own boundaries and creating legal rationalization and preservation of individual selfishness—thus salvaging such institutions as slavery in new and more invisible institutions that mediate and devastate our relationships<br />

For the social activist, independence and freedom are inconceivable without secure boundaries between who we ‘are’ and who and what we ‘…freer than ever before, we — our marriages, our families, our communities — are not.<br />

The question of ethics cannot be posed when it concerns the political or political action—our alternative speech act of messianic promise provides the foundation that allows ethics to exist<br />

I would not call this attitude utopian. The messianic experience of which … be posed&quot; by Agamben as a question that also concerns the political and political action.<br />

The affirmative method of displacing our ethics onto political institution allows us to shirk our responsibility for ethical actions and prevents us from becoming truly ethical subjects<br />

<br />
If, however, we accept Kant’s position, another trap soon present’s …, but I only did what the Other wanted me to do, so go and talk to It if you have any objections.<br />
<br />
The ethical self can only be so when free, and can only be free when rejecting that which is ‘ours’ and embracing the alien nature of abstract duty over comfortable actions<br />
Zupančič, 2000<br />
(Alenka, Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy @ the Slovene Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, p 23) cnb<br />
<br />
The defining feature of a free act, on the contrary, is precisely that it is entirely foreign …founds on it the autonomy and freedom of the subject.<br />

Because ethics cannot be separated from any aspect of being, it is impossible to consider ontology before ethics<br />

<br />
First, two key definitions and an important ... the B-29 that weaponized Little Boy and Fat Man.<br />
<br />
B. Violation: The plan is not a decrease and limit on the deterrent purpose of nuclear weapons of real worth- it merely codifies an already existing law into international law AND this change only affects nuclear devices not nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to vote negative:<br />
<br />
1. Predictable limits- we shouldn’t have to debate cases we are less prepared for- debatability is less important than predictable limits and informed decision making- EVEN IF the CTBT is timely and grounded in the literature each word in the resolution has value- even if just one word or phrase precludes the CTBT it’s a deterrent to research it as much as topical cases which makes debate unfair.<br />
Future weapons<br />
<br />
2. Substantial- only the neg interpretation gives real meaning to the word substantial which is key to avoid quasi-inherent affs. The CTBT is only quasi-inherent- testing is illegal and we’ve already signed it- customary international law binds the US to the treaty now. Quasi-inherency kills disad ground- it problematizes impact turning case and opens the floodgates to allow other quasi-inherent affs like ban future nuclear weapons and no nuclear bunker busters.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Extra-topical- even if the aff wins a counter-interpretation that banning testing reduces the role of nuclear weapons, the mechanism is extra-topical. All the advantage ground stems from the international mechanism not the topical action- its an independent voter because it destroys predictable limits AND its an especially bad form of extra-T because its impossible to counterplan out of.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1NC- ASPEC</strong><br />
<br />
A. Violation – The Affirmative fails to specify an agent of action. Rather they just say “United States Federal Government.”<br />
B. Failure to specify is illegitimate and a voting issue.<br />
1. Ground – Specifying an agent is critical to Disads relating to the specific agent of action and Counterplans to use a different agent. The agent must be named in the plan to ensure that Counterplans compete and to maximize the value of pre-round preparation, which is essential at the beginning of the year when strategies are not fully developed.<br />
2. Moving Target – Failure to specify an agent in the plan text allows the affirmative to shift out of 1NC arguments by allowing new 2AC clarification about the agent of action. This makes it impossible for the negative to debate because the AFF could always change their plan after they heard the 1NC arguments.<br />

Orientalism is the narcissistic locating of the so-called “Orient” as the mirror in which the “Occident” sees itself as the great power—if they are not weak, we cannot be strong—the use of the mirror drives the ambition behind all oppression and all violence. Napoleon and Mussolini show us that one form cannot be disconnected from another—to dominate the “Orient” is to dominate everything.<br />
