<strong>Buddism</strong> <br />
<strong>First note that desire creates the illusion of the self and the suffering that defines the human condition. Our only capacity is thus to affirm the extermination of this desire in the face of perpetual death and an impermanent reality.</strong>  <br />
Jonathan <strong>Dollimore 1998</strong>(Death, Desire and Loss in Western Culture, p 54-56.)<br />
<strong>We reject the notion of the United States federal government as an external entity distinct from ourselves — overcoming the assumption of difference is a key first step to a nondualistic framework.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Loy</strong>, David. <strong>1996</strong> (“Beyond good and evil? A Buddhist critique of Nietzsche.” <em>Asian Philosophy</em>, 09552367, Mar1996, Vol. 6, Issue 1)<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">We United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal. We’ll clarify </span></strong><br />
<strong>As long as we have desire in our hearts, we are just like Don Quixote</strong>  <strong>- blindly flailing at windmills while ignoring the fact that we have created the enemy we are fighting. This ego-driven ideology makes violence inevitable – there will always be another crusade. Only by turning inward and rejecting the desire to make ourselves permanent can we have peace and happiness in our hearts – which is the only thing that ultimately matters. Both a framework which envisions difference and one which seeks to overcome this violence replicates the harms</strong> <br />
Ayya <strong>Khema, 1994</strong> (Buddhist monk, “All of us beset by Birth, Decay, and Death.” <em>Buddhism Today,</em> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/003-allofus-5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/003-allofus-5.htm</a><br />
<strong>Our ethic of transcending desire comes first. Any political or alternative framework perpetuates a divisionary binary and makes all harms possible.</strong><br />
Bell <strong>Hooks</strong>, Buddhims and the Politics or Domination.Mindful Politics, 20<strong>06</strong> <br />
<strong>Finally, any reversion to political role-playing creates a discursive advocacy of desiring a solution to suffering— which is the only reason why the harms exist in the first place. Desire makes every impact inevitable.</strong>  <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Rahula, <em>What the Buddha Taught,</em> 29-30. </span><br />
<strong>First, don’t confuse our intentions—we recognize the impossibility of outright, systemic rejection of consumerist and self-centric ethics of desire. But our refusal to perceive the world’s ills as solvable through exterior actions entails a necessary first step to break a cultural addiction to desire and permanence.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Barnhill</strong>, David Landis. (Director of Environmental Studies and Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh) <strong>2004</strong> <br />
<strong>A rejection of this cycle of desire allows us to have an enlightened engagement with the world – a fundamental prerequisite to all other “action”</strong> <br />
Bret W<strong>. Davis, 2004</strong>(Department of Japanese Philosophy Kyoto University “Zen After Zarathustra: The Problem of the Will in the Confrontation Between Nietzsche and Buddhism” <em>The Journal of Nietzsche Studies</em> 28 (2004) 89-138, accessed through muse.edu)<br />
<strong>Additionally, our affirmation of a nondualistic framework does not entail engagement with the cycle of desire we critique. Rather, it is the lynchpin to unraveling a terminal replication of systematic violence. But even if we somehow entail greater suffering, our separation from desire means you still vote aff.</strong>  <br />
Wayne <strong>Alt, 2001</strong>(“There is no Paradox of Desire in Buddhism,” <em>Buddhism Today</em>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/013-desire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/013-desire.htm</a>)<br />
<strong>Any return to a paradigm of isolating negative harms for management or solution only seeks to institutionalize desire—overcoming this delusion of imminent impacts is key. &lt;</strong>maybe take out&gt;<br />
David R. Loy, 2007(Professor of Ethics/Religion and Society at Xavier University in Cincinnati, “The Three Poisons, Institutionalized” Tikkun, 08879982, May/Jun2007, Vol. 22, Issue 3) <br />
<strong>Last, put away your kritiks—our compounding of political action into discursive removal of the self into perpetual collective-becoming is the essential means to reactivating value.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Barnhill</strong>, David Landis. (Director of Environmental Studies and Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh) <strong>2004</strong>, “Good Work: An Engaged Buddhist Response to the Dilemmas of Consumerism” <em>Buddhist-Christian Studies</em>, 24.1, p 55-63.
