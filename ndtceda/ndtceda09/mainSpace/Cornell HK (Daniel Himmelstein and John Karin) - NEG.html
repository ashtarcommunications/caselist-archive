<br />
The whole complex ... a political problem.<br />
<br />
This mindless focus on the weapons as the problem that disables the movement - it highlights only a symptom of the larger issue, allowing token victories to be handed to the movement while leaving the larger structures of violence intact<br />

Limiting the missions of nuclear weapons merely rearranges how the weapons are used – but does not change the underlying political context that created these weapons<br />
