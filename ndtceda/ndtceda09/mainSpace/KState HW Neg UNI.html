Nuclear Orientalism Critique<br />
1. The aff prescribes an otherizing discourse that serves to relegitimate our position of power-this seeks to affirm our rationality while assuming the non-western world is driven by irrational impulses.<br />
Gusterson ‘99<br />

Thus in Western discourse…U.S. national security discourse.<br />
2. The alternative of renunciation is to reject the Orientalist discourse of nuclear apartheid and support the elimination of nuclear weapons based on their dangers alone.<br />

6. The impact is perpetual war—racist dichotomies create Otherization that normalizes us to violence-war becomes inevitable on all levels of society.<br />
Mendieta 2002<br />
Eduardo Mendieta, 2002 “To Make Live and Let Die-Foucault and Racism<br />
This is where racism…are biological in nature<br />
7. Disarming nuclear-charged words allows the rhetoric to reason with disarming and psyche-bending events of nuclear holocaust. Abstractions and euphemisms such as “clean bombs” and “collateral damage” provide a destructive leans that cleans up destruction and erroneously subverts meaning into peaceful ambitions.

Entering the world of defense…seems to be forgotten that even scalpels spill blood.<br />

Counter plan<br />
Text: (write the plan to remove all nuclear weapons from Europe)<br />
Observation 1-It is mutually exclusive-we do not re-enforce the naming of those terms.<br />
Observation II-It is a better strategy-utilizing the term tactical gives credibility to USE of the weapon-differentiating between types of nuclear weapons only fuels the nuclear establishment.<br />

May I just refer you to the…pardon me I mean Weapons of Mass Destruction<br />
<br />
Merely justifying the term tactical provides credence to military war planners who are attempting to justify the SAFE USE of the weapon<br />

<strong>Viewing nuclear war as inevitable in the squo justifies channeling resources to the military machine fostering a state of pure war that militarizes society- aff’s use of these fear tactics means we all become conscripted to the state as civilian soldiers without recognizing it- this turns the aff</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Similarly, reducing the problem to the existence of weapons legitimizes further sophistication- demands to strategically alter our nuclear posture results in developing new tools for the military to use, which means the aff is a bandaid on a bullet hole</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Calibri,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong>The looming mushroom cloud has set a precedent for evaluating conflict.
