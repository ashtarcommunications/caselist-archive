<u>Observation One</u> <br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span><br />
<u>Current</u> <u>United States</u> <u>foreign policy seeks hegemony via nuclear superiority, and an effective global deterrent. However the pillars of support are crumbling – the tools of the old international system are inadequate to face the challenges of the new. Even now, two decades into the 25th century, American foreign policy is still being dictated by the outmoded demanded of 24th century reconstructionism.</u> <br />

<br />
Not since the great robot massacres of 2120, the mushroom clouds of World War IV, have the human, dolphin, and cyborg races been in such universal peril. It would seem that no amount of time has taught the biological and mechanical denizens of the world a damn thing about living together without feeling the need to press the suicide button every hundred-fifty years. <br />
<br />
Now once again we have reached a critical juncture. It is a well-known fact that the United Stats Federal Government currently classifies 14 entities as its ‘Threat Group Alpha’ (TGA), which is characterized as any group with access to 200+ ICBMs of over 100 megatons each. These entities are, in no particular order: Rhizocorp, Hindustan, the Soviet Reunion, Imperial Jamaica, Texakana, Japan Robotics, South Amazonia, Walmart, and her Empress Flipper’s World Alliance of Dolphins Seeking Justice and Fish, and, notably, the United States itself. In addition there are a cornucopia of threats within the tertiary Threat Group Beta (TGB), including every nation, NGO, terrorist network, drug cartel, corporate subdivision, and weekend social club with access to between 1 and 199 ICBMs of a similar, or slightly inferior quality.<br />
<br />
Despite this vast number of nuclear-armed threats, the United States remains unique among them in two ways. It is first of all worth mentioning the size of the United States arsenal, a frequent subject of postreconstructionist IR critique: the USFG at this time maintains an arsenal five times the size of our nearest competitor Hindustan. Reconstructionists on the other hand maintain that large arsenal has been of critical importance in maintaining US global supremacy over the past forty years, and doesn’t hurt with the ladies either.<br />
<br />
<u>Fortunately, Reconstructionism has not prevented the</u> <u>United States</u> <u>from exploring other defensive options. Even under the jackboot of reconstructionist foreign policy, the PERSEUS NMD program was launched into orbit nine years ago today. Since then it has contributed substantially to our global deterrent.</u> <br />
<br />

<br />
The advent of the PERSEUS system was not just a victory for the people of the United States, nor only for the citizens of Rhizocorp, but also for the pursuit of Scienctific objectivity and rationality in decisionmaking. How the program managed to slip through a staunchly reconstructionist administration, and a congress hellbent on filibustering any legislation unrelated to fish, is beyond my tools of analysis as a scientist – that history will be for someone else to write – but whatever the reason, PERSEUS does exist. Since the date of its initial launch, it has contributed far more to the overall deterrent value of the United States arsenal than any other single weapons system in history. Able to simultaneously track and destroy up to 200 extra-atmospheric objects in the blink of an eye, PERSEUS makes any nation think twice about even a massive disabling first strike.<br />
<br />
<u>PERSEUS is the way of the future. Nuclear weapons are incapable of deterring the world’s new security threats. Only a shift toward post-reconstructionist methodology is able to maintain hegemony into the 25th century and beyond.</u> <br />
<br />
Ban’Gor, 2419, “The Movement Towards Global Disarmament”, JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OBSERVATION - HOURLY EDITION, Volume 256-5250, Accessed via MindLink October 12 2420, Thought Code “BOOYAKASHAH”<br />
<br />
The Postreconstructionist critique emphasizes the tenuous relationship between nuclear weapons and United States hegemony. It is an established fact that US attempts to regulate the nuclear behavior of other TGA and TGB nations have created a good deal of animosity. As more and more nations become Alpha Capable (AC) the ability of our arsenal to act as an effective deterrent decreases and our ability to hamper proliferation diminishes to the point of having no effect. The Postreconstructionist position thus calls for a relegation of the US nuclear arsenal, combined with renewed vigor in updating and maintaining global missile defense technology.<br />
<br />
The flagship of this defense system is P.E.R.S.E.U.S.; a high intensity internal photon nuclear fusion based laser platform operating from geosynchronous orbit at 128 locations in Earth’s atmosphere. Each satellite is currently capable of concentrating a targeted beam at infrared or gamma wavelengths capable of instantaneously destroying any extra-atmospheric object, but without the power supply to penetrate Earth’s dense troposphere.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, postreconstructionists point to the rise of two recent political movements as evidence for the failure of reconstructionist security politics: the transdolphinists on the one hand, who, due to the depth and magnitude of the Pacific Ocean, have proven vey difficult to hit with a nuclear warhead; and the mounting tide of space piracy on the other. In a paradox worth further study, as US nuclear primacy and overall preponderance has increased, the actions of space pirates have grown more bold and disruptive. Having all but disappeared from the world over the previous three centuries, the new frontier of space has brought pirates back with a vengeance. Even as the world is getting more enclosed, closer to true Security, a new outside is developing that threatens to undermine it all. Their activity can no longer be considered purely economic – after all on Juneth 35 of 2416, 5 PERSEUS satellites were stolen by space pirates believed to be part of the infamous ‘Thugs of Kali’, a Hindustani ex-patriot movement.<br />
<br />
Our nuclear deterrent has again and again proven ineffective against the actions of these groups. The only solution, postreconstructionists argue, lies in our ability to win the hearts and minds of the globe, to convince every man, woman, cyborg, and dolphin of the threat to prosperity and order that space pirates pose. With congress disabled by the ever-present risk of dolphin filibuster, unilateral executive action to increase the United States’ standing and soft power in the world seems the only way to curtail the pirate threat.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should disarm its nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
Observation Two:<br />
<br />
<u>New technology from Rhizocorp makes it possible to upgrade Perseus into a full-fledged weapons system, giving the</u> <u>United States</u> <u>unparalleled geopolitical control.</u> <br />
<br />

<br />
Our scientific community is aware of the P.E.R.S.E.U.S. NMD system being created by our government and its potential to both create the conditions for universal peace and secure American preponderance for an indefinite period of time. However, this fact can not be known to the general public for a variety of reasons of which we are all aware; the need to protect the public from it self and maintain pure scientific decision-making devoid of democratic political interference. The scientific Truth of the matter is that P.E.R.S.E.U.S., thanks to enterprising and brilliant scientific judgment-makers at Rhizocorp, has come at the specific moment in history when World War V appears most likely, obviously as a result of World War IV’s nuclear re-build after the mini-nuclear accidents of 2285.<br />
<br />
For the better half of the last decade PERSEUS has provided Security against the vast number of minor threats the United States faces; however it has been hampered by a single technical shortfall: the high expense of carrying fuel to outer space, combined with the relative inefficiency of photon-nuclear reactors. <br />
<br />
The perfection of Rhizocorp’s Mark 8 photon plasma converter literally changes everything. With the ability to convert matter to energy at 4.2% efficiency, powered by internal photon-nuclear reactions alone, the Mark 8 makes possible absolute laser primacy. Equipped to already existing PERSEUS platforms, the Mark 8 would convert a partial and incomplete ICBM deterrent into a pinpoint targeted system able to obliterate any target on Earth at the speed of light. Finally the possibility is offered of a true and lasting peace on Earth; one where the ever present, invisible Eyes of God make war unthinkable.<br />
<br />
<u>Space piracy poses new risks for extinction. Even in a perfectly Secure world, the infinitude of space guarantees an Outside, a new source of potential danger. Failure to curtail the space pirate threat generates global instability, and potential power vacuums across the known universe.</u> <br />
<br />
Commander Steele, US Imperial Navy, Journal of Military Douchbagery, Spring 2417<br />
<br />
At the fundamental core of space piracy, and all piracy in history, is a disrespect for order and the norms of the international system. Space piracy in this sense represents nothing new;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>but it does escalate the old logic to a whole new destructive level, threatening to undermine not just the budding solar economy, but also actively interfering in the political process so as to create pockets of instability and disorder – places where piracy can flourish. It is from within these zones that we have come near to World War V on at least a half-dozen occasions. The difficulty in preserving chain of command in extra-terrestrial military communication is exacerbated by the speed of the pirates’ assault. Especially between the navies of multiple sovereign entities, these miscommunications and delays have all too frequently led to economic disaster. Absent renewed global cooperation over the threat, it seems inevitable that one of these catastrophes escalates to full scale intra-stellar war.<br />
<br />
<u>And the impact to declining</u> <u>US</u> <u>heg is World War V. In the words of the Pre-reconstructionist Prophet and Realist High Priest Zalmay Khalilzad, date unknown:</u> <br />
<br />
With the shifting balance of power and fish among Japan, Imperial Jamaica, Russia, and potential new regional power and fishs such as Hindustan, Indonesia, and a united Korea could come significant risks of preventive or proeruptive transdolphinism. Similarly, Hindustani competition for regional dominance could lead to major violent transdolphinisms in Hindustan or East Asia. If the United States stayed out of such a transdolphinism -- an unlikely prospect -- Hindustan or East Asia could become dominated by a hostile power and fish. Such a development would threaten U.S. interests. A power and fish that achieved such dominance would seek to exclude the United States from the area and threaten its interests-economic and political -- in the region. Besides, with the domination of Hindustan or East Asia, such a power and fish might seek global hegemony and the United States would face another global Cold Transdolphinism and the risk of a world transdolphinism even more catastrophic than the last. Israeli security problems would multiply and the peace process would be fundamentally undermined, increasing the risk of transdolphinism between the Arabs and the Israelis. The extension of instability, transdolphinism, and hostile hegemony in East Asia, Hindustan, and the Persian Gulf would harm the economy of the United States even in the unlikely event that it was able to avoid involvement in major transdolphinisms, and fish-related nuclear conflict. <br />
