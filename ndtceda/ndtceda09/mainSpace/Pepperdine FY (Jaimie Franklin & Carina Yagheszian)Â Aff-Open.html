 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Women’s bodies are often the target of this eroticism, depicted as bombshells straddling phallic missiles, or more subtly as Mother Earth penetrated by scientific discovery and nuclear holocaust. In this symbolic system, nuclear holocaust is celebrated as the ultimate orgasm, eroticizing domination and legitimizing violence against women and the Earth.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Caputi,1993</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. (Jane. Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Gossips, Gorgons, and Crones: The Fates of the Earth. p.53-54</span></span><br />
But the eroticization and gendering of violence extends beyond cliché phallic symbolism. Images of the body are the hallmark of the weapons and war system itself, which posits weapons as bodies and bodies as weapons. This hyper-masculine aesthetic connects male sexuality with power, glorifying rape and sexual violence.<br />

These symbols are characterized by constructions of idealized masculinity and femininity, based in heteronormative standards that require the suppression and destruction of queer identities. This strand of violent, hyper-masculinity reinforces a static and narrow identity, which justifies the destruction of racial and queer bodies.<br />

How we represent the body in our curriculum directly affects how we engage one another’s bodies materially. The nuclear body creates an idealized white male heteronormaitve aesthetic, further negating the existence of the Other. A pedagogy of embodiment reconceptualizes difference and breaks down hegemonic constructions of identity.<br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
Therefore, Jaimie and I affirm a critical public pedagogy of embodiment to disrupt the role of the Bomb in violently gendering bodies. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our act of culture jamming is a pedagogical practice of rewriting patriarchal discourse and challenging passive spectatorship of the nuclear body. A bodied curriculum breaks down homogenized aesthetics of the body, creating a relationship of inter-embodiment among participants. </span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Bomb is the central site to challenge patriarchy. While it has radically altered our existence, it also illuminates the utter failure of violent hyper-masculine culture. Challenging the nuclear narrative sparks a radical departure from the status quo.<br />

Chapter One: Sexbombs<br />
<br />
Nuclear rhetoric is marked by sexually violent imagery that double as pornographic glorifications of the phallus.<br />
Caputi, 2004 (Jane. Professor of Women’s Studies and Communication at Florida Atlantic University. Goddesses and Monsters: Women, Myth, Power and Popular Culture. p. 245-247)<br />
<br />
Nuclearist culture creates and sustains a symbolic system in which bombs are sexy and nuclear weapons are extensions of the penis. These images and rhetoric posit nuclear blasts as the ultimate orgasm, eroticizing domination and legitimizing violence against women and the Earth.<br />
Caputi,1993. (Jane. Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Gossips, Gorgons, and Crones: The Fates of the Earth. p.53-54<br />
<br />
Chapter Two: Bodies as Weapons<br />
<br />
Our war culture constructs weapons as bodies and bodies as weapons, systematically gendering the war system through Western mass media and culture<br />
MYRTTINEN 2003 (Henri. “Disarming Masculinities.” Women, Men, Peace, and Security. Accessed via Google Scholar)<br />
<br />
The body is our basic framework for internalizing knowledge, meaning and truth. Cultural and national style is marked on our bodies and internalized to be expressed in our relations with others and the material world around us.<br />
Mann in 07 (Bonnie. “How America Justifies Its War: A Modern/Postmodern Aesthetics of Masculinity and Sovereignty”)<br />
<br />
Thus, we stand resolved that we should disarm the technostrategic and sexualized rhetoric of the bomb.<br />
<br />
The Bomb is a cultural paradox that can be utilized for radical change. While it has radically altered our existence, it also illuminates the utter failure of masculinist domination. Rendering the nuclearist narrative obsolete can reconceptualize the reigning narratives.<br />
Caputi,1993. (Jane. Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Gossips, Gorgons, and Crones: The Fates of the Earth. p.29-30)<br />
<br />
The political is grounded in aesthetics used to construct meaning and identity. The successful production of war depends upon the successful production of an aesthetic of war. Only our exposure and rejection of the nuclear aesthetic can solve.<br />
Mann in 07 (Bonnie. “How America Justifies Its War: A Modern/Postmodern Aesthetics of Masculinity and Sovereignty”)<br />
<br />
The system of nuclear icons is embedded in a system of power. These icons produce truth, objectify of the Other, and reinforce dominant narratives in order to justify state action and violence.<br />
