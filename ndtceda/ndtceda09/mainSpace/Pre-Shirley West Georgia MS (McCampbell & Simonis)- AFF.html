1AC <br />
Planning for the use of nuclear weapons on proliferators has been occurring since the end of the Cold War. An ever-increasing list of targets, justifications, and the erosion of the taboo makes nuclear weapons use inevitable.  <br />

We must be cautious in the face of benevolent justifications. The role colonialism plays in destroying the vast majority of the planet requires its rejection, it is the deciding factor in contemporary war<br />

Nuclear planning behind a veil of secrecy and the nuclear apartheid are two sides of the same coin. Public debates about nuclear hypocrisy threaten the entire imperial system by opening a space for criticism.<br />

This is the only 1AC we have read:<br />
<br />
Cohn 87 provides some insight on the logic of defense intellectuals:<br />
<br />
“Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals.” Signs. Vol 12, No 4, Within and Without: Women, Gender and Theory, (Summer 87) p 693<br />
<br />
“there was no evidence that any feminist critiques had ever reached the ears, much less the minds, of these men. [. . .] A professor’s explanation of why the MX missile is to be placed in the silos of the newest minuteman missiles instead of replacing the older, less accurate ones, was ‘because they’re in the nicest hole—you’re not going to take the nicest missile you have and put it in a crummy hole.’ Other lectures were filled with discussion of vertical erector launchers, thrust to weight ratios, soft lay downs, deep penetration, and the comparative advantages of protracted versus spasm attacks—or what one military adviser to the National Security Council has called “releasing 70 to 80 percent of our megatonnage in one orgasmic whump.” There was serious concern about the need to harden our missiles and the need to “face it, the Russians are a little harder than we are.” [. . .]<br />
<br />
Why do these discussions and framings go unquestioned? Diana E. H. Russell , liberationist and feminist writer, argues that “before people will be moved to action, they have to get in touch with. . . feelings about the issue, but they also have to feel that what they do can make a difference.” “We can be. . . effective in pointing out the connections between the masculine mentality and the nuclear mentality. . . but first we must deal with our own resistance to working on the nuclear issue.”<br />

<br />
The same forces of discourse that dominate the high politics of state security operate in the debate community. Debate is a unique forum and we’ve been invited to compete and legitimate our concerns. We come to the debate with an opinion but here like in International Relations the agenda was set before we even got a chance. Cohn and Ruddick explain the framework of dominant masculinity:<br />
<br />
Carl Cohn and Sarah Ruddick. 2003. “A Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction.” 22-24, 14-16, 18-19<br />
<br />
<br />
“The final question asks us… silencing power of gendered national security discourse.”<br />
<br />
Author of Getting Off, Robert Jensen paints a picture of the state of “dominant masculinity in the United States today. It is the masculinity of a mob, ready to rape.” “Men’s bodies are pressed against each other as each one vies for the best view of the woman’s breasts, vagina, and anus. Many of the men are using cameras, camcorders, or cell phones to record the scene.”<br />
<br />
Cohn and Ruddick further describe the “realist consensus” that maintains the nuclear weapons arsenal by coding certain perspectives as feminine and using that as a basis for exclusion. (cite above)<br />
<br />
“Within the logic of deterrence theory and proliferation discourse, the phenomenon of WMD proliferation is understandable in two main ways.… Feminist perspectives suggest that that danger only appears so self-evidently greater than the danger of having WMD if you discount as “soft” serious attention to the costs of development and deployment”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
“In the case of the nuclear crisis, feeling about it may be an even more serious obstacle than recognizing it.” (Russell p. 310).<br />
<br />
<br />
We do not defend a United States federal government policy in the 1ac because we recognize such as incomplete and temporary. The crisis of nuclear weapons is a crisis of culture, exemplified through oppressive, masculine politics but the problem is in the polity.<br />
<br />
We read a quote from Russell—“In the case of the nuclear crisis, feeling about it may be an even more serious obstacle than recognizing it.” (Russell p. 310, cited above).<br />
We read a quote from Jensen.<br />
Robert Jensen. 2007. Getting Off: Pornography and the End of Dominant Masculinity. 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
We choose to frame our discussion of gender with knowledge of the resolution because the forms and expressions of structural violence that result from dominant ways of knowing keep producing the same result; “systematic exploitation and degradation of human lives—and of our ecological support system”, “a partial and distorted picture of reality and a contributor to creating the very circumstances it purports to describe and protect against” (Cohn&amp;Ruddick 03, cited above).<br />
<br />
Peterson 92 [V Spike, polsci@UAZ, Gendered States, ed Peterson]<br />
“I respond to these questions by exploring how situating gender and states in relationship to each other “systematically” reveals their relationship to structural violence and its reproduction…. This is to query ways of being and knowing; to privilege questions of “who we are,” how we learn to know who we are, and how particular identities—who and what we identify with—shape political possibilities.”<br />
<br />
<br />
2AC Plumwood evidence:<br />
Plumwood 1993 (Val, feminism and the Mastery of Nature, pg 64-5)<br />
“the current wave of diffidence about endorsing the identity ‘woman’, or any feminine-associated charictaristics and gender ideals, is in part a reaction against the cultural feminist proclivity towards a too sweeping affirmation of the feminine, and its focus on affirming a singular ‘authentic’ woman identity as a basis for polical action…. Thus, it creates the illusion that empowering the feminine must involve a contradiction”<br />
