<span class="TagsCites"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">We begin with the logic of deterrence where the role of nuclear weapons seeps into the cracks of all daily life, paralyzing us with the role rather than the actual nuclear blast. Nuclear annihilation is only used as a pretext in order to maintain the balance of the status quo.</span><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">Baudrillard ‘94</span></span> <span style="font-size: 9.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">(Jean, 1994. Simulation and Simulacra. Pg 8. Columbia University Press.)</span><br />
The apotheosis of simulation: <span class="underline"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">the AND </span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">… terror is the terror of balance. </span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br />
</span><br />
Status quo policies of nuclear deterrence are part and parcel of the simulated form of social relations. Power, violence, subjectivities; all fall under the law of the market. Rather than us calling on a change to nuclear weapons strategy, nuclear weapons call on us to engage the world politically.<br />

Thus Baudrillard is analysing <span class="underline"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">a social AND </span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">… </span></span>in the dominant discourses about genetics.<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br />
</span><br />
This totalitarianism manifests in pure subjectivity confined not to a life mimicking a prison cell but a life of endless possibilities defined by the self. Rather than view the freedom inherent in servitude, we ask questions like, “what can I do to make the world better” so we come up with plans and strategies such as removing tactical nuclear weapons from Europe. This places us in a state of self hatred.<br />

<br />
<br />
This self hatred creates a world of commiseration and suffering through the exchange of guilt for pain.<br />
<span class="cite">Baudrillard ‘94</span> (<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Jean,</span> September 28, &quot;No Reprieve For Sarejevo&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/baudrillard/baudrillard-no-reprieve-for-sarajevo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/faculty/baudrillard/baudrillard-no-reprieve-for-sarajevo.html</a>)<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">The problem lies</span></span> indeed <span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">in the AND …</span></span>, protectionism, discrimination and control.<br />
<br />
Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
Rather than understand the resolution as a choice that each debate team should make regarding nuclear weapons we should view it as a denial of subjectivity. We affirm the resolution the way that we obtained it. In this light we reject the resolution as an affirmation of subjectivity for a strategy of becoming object.<br />
<br />
<br />
Becoming object is to find freedom in a destiny defined by the other. We find strength in servitude because it rescues us from the guilt that comes with our life and death choices.<br />
<span class="cite">Baudrillard 1993</span> ( Jean. “The Transparency of Evil.” Pg 167-8)<br />
At all events, <span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">it is AND </span><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">… form of that sign or event.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br />
</span><br />
Our affirmation is one of appearance and disappearance; a rejection of individual values and desires. As soon as we affirm the resolution we subtly disappear within the confines of the masses freeing us from the life/death choices offered by subjectivity. In this way we can be happy within these debate walls.<br />
<span class="cite">Pawlett '07</span> (William, Jean Baudrillard: Against Banalit y. Pg 119-20 Sociology and Cultural Studies, University of Wolverhampton, UK)<br />
Baudrillard introduces two new terms to AND … in greater detail in Chapter 8.<br />
<br />
So we end with the crossroads. Critical thought, (role playing, switch side debate), all believe we are masters of the universe, able to construct the world in our own image. This is a banal strategy. The world thinks us, the object thinks us. Our fatal strategy places us in the grips of radical uncertainty putting us back on the path of our material destiny.<br />

<span class="underline"><span style="background: aqua; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-highlight: aqua;">Critical thought sees itself as holding AND … to put an end to it.</span></span>
