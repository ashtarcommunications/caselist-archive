Unlike the missions discussed thus far…while not threatening Russian central nuclear systems.<br />
<br />
Deterrence<br />
Impact- Deterrence is critical to prevent global nuclear instability- only credible nuclear deterrence contains expansionist Russia, aggressive china, rogue proliferators and assures key allies<br />
Lerner et al, 2009 (Ben, Director of Policy Operations at the Center for Security Policy and Editor-in-Chief of this Briefing Book, The New Deterrent Working Group- Hon. Henry F. Cooper, Hon.

The scheduled expiration of the 1991…seek independent nuclear arsenals.<br />

The plan ends the credibility of a disarming first strike<br />

Text: The United States federal government should<br />
-expand military-to-military exchanges with Russia at operational facilities to include notification of satellite launches and divulging of information concerning procedures for control, doctrine and technologies of command and control architecture<br />
-offer Russia early warning data to create a joint data exchange center<br />
-expand the cooperative threat production program with Russia<br />
-install launch warning sensors on the United States arsenal and offer to provide the same for Russia<br />
-offer Russia to forgive all of their debt owed to the United States in exchange for the establishment of a fund to rebuild russia’s nuclear infrastructure.<br />
-substantially increase funding for the prospective budgets of U.S. space missions including but not limited to the operationally responsive space<br />
-the department of defense should double the salaries for qualified space professionals<br />
-offer china resumption of laboratory to laboratory exchanges.<br />
<br />
The formation of a joint data exchange center solves accidents, relations and avoids the link to our deterrence and crisis instability arguments- comparative evidence proves the counterplan is the best option<br />

Conclusion In light of these various…end up being more dangerous than helpful.<br />

The CP sets a precedent for cooperation between the US and China- this solves their internal links to cooperation from the 1AC<br />

The CLL, however, provides…international proliferation regimes.<br />
