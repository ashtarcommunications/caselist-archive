IN THE AGE OF DISCURSIVE IMPERIALISM AND THE ACCELERATING DRIVE FOR PURE EXTERMINATION OF THE PERIPHERY - RADIOACTIVE COLONIZATION IS USED AS A MEANS OF ONGOING GENOCIDE AGAINST INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. THEIR DISCURSIVE CONSTRUCTION IS SYMPTOMATIC OF THE TECHNO-STRATEGIC GAZE WHICH WARNS OF A UNIQUE NUCLEAR WAR WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSCURING AND LEGITIMIZING THE ONGOING DESTRUCTION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ALREADY PUSHED TO THE BRINK OF ABSOLUTE GENOCIDE<br />

 [Read the plantext unaltered as the CP text.]<br />
We disconnect the plan from the affirmative as an author. This allows us to break down the notions of causality, linearity, ownership, and stasis in the text and celebrate the infinite multiplicity and play of meaning.<br />
Roland Barthes. “The Death of the Author.” Image-Music-Text. 1977.<br />
The removal of the Author … reason, science, law.<br />

<h2 id="toc6"><a name="Kato-Give back the land."></a><strong><u>Give back the land</u>.</strong></h2>
 Newsflash: The land we are standing on is not our own. We are the biproducts of an ongoing genocide against native Americans that is predicated off of the theft of those lands. Any action taken that does not resist occupation is complicit with it. Thus we offer the following counterplan: we should banish the United States from the planet.<br />

<h2 id="toc7"><a name="Kato-Mixed Scanning"></a><strong><u>Mixed Scanning</u></strong></h2>
 The negative’s burden is to scan the affirmative from multiple standpoints: Ontological, political, or epistemological. This is key to better policy making. It avoids the blindspots of routine policymaking.<br />

Mixing of detatched and general is key, neither extreme is appropriate.<br />

 The affirmative is unbelievable, the latest Gallup poll shows that 73 percecnt of Americans are unable to believe this shit.<br />
The Onion. October 7, 1998. Issue 34.10.<br />
According to the latest Gallup Poll … “Shit no,” Pritchard replied.<br />
<br />
Further, the aff’s bullshit is produced by media outlets that create self-fulfilling prophesies out of their impacts in order to keep us all glued to the television. Our alternative is to call the bluff of the 1AC and do nothing in the face of their bullshit. This pushes the media system to the limit, collapsing its power.<br />

<h2 id="toc9"><a name="Kato-Gregorian calendar"></a><strong><u>Gregorian calendar</u></strong></h2>
 Counteradvocacy – we advocate the entire 1AC sans the dates in their citations. The 1AC’s use of the year dates sustains the hegemonic Gregorian calendar. This form of time is patently unworthy.<br />

<h2 id="toc10"><a name="Kato-Nuclear “weapons” PIC"></a><strong><u>Nuclear “weapons” PIC</u></strong></h2>
 The language of “nuclear weapons” is inaccurate because nuclear things have no bearing in war, viewing nuclear things as weapons whitewashes their catastrophic nature.<br />

The orientation of American … competing normative perspectives.<br />
<br />
Normativity reduces the world to language games, thus desensitizing us to the pain and death that the 1AC speak of. This makes activism into a vacuous routine.<br />

The affirmative’s devaluation of the physical world leaves their life empty and meaningless. The role of the ballot is to affirm life. Our alternative is to live dangerously and embrace life in its totality.<br />

The interregnum is a direct answer to their affirmative which posits United States supremacy and liberal capitalist democracy as the only game in town. This is a metaphysical thinking that views the world from above or at the end in order to colonize and control all beings – reducing radical difference to standing, disposable reserve<br />
