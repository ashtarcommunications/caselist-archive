Observation 1: The logic of possession<br />
<br />
The existence of a nuclear arsenal enframes humans as means to an end, turning humanity into a calculable resource and the entire world into standing reserve—all things and all people can be owned and used as we see fit<br />
<br />
Anthony Burke, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at UNSW, Sydney “Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason” 10:2 | © 2007 Theory and Event. Johns Hopkins University Press. Project Muse 9/30/2008.<br />
<br />
Oppenheimer -- who resolutely opposed the development …human lives are reduced to tools, obstacles, useful or obstinate matter.<br />
<br />
This logic of calculability makes our extinction inevitable. Any atrocity or oppression can be justified.<br />
Michael Dillon — senior lecturer in politics and international relations @ University of Lancaster — 1996 Politics of Security: Towards a political philosophy of continental thought, pg. 26<br />
<br />
Everything for example, has now become possible. But …through strategic discourse - even if the details have changed.<br />
<br />
The continued possession of nuclear weapons requires us to justify their need by numbing ourselves to the suffering caused by nuclearism. The result is a paralysis of the mind that leaves us insensitive to human death.<br />
<br />
Robert jay Lifton, professor of psychiatry and psychology, City University of New York, Greg Mitchell, former editor of Nuclear Times Magazine, TECHNOLOGY REVIEW, August 1995, p.58<br />
<br />
An important, but largely unexamined, dimension … cordon sanitaire has been the official policy of the American government.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the nuclear arsenal requires us to devote massive amounts of resources to the maintenance of nuclear weapons. This devotion to the military industrial complex is the precise logic that causes nations to divert money to defense contractors that should be used to address systemic oppression.<br />

Nuclear weapons intersect with race issues …, not enough money for education and training.<br />

<br />
Since the Second World War, five hundred million … a far greater pull on political will than the needs of the alleviation of suffering and poverty.<br />
<br />
The problem doesn’t depend on the number or quality of the weapons, nor does it depend on the character of the people who hold them—we must reject the very existence of nuclear weapons<br />

The third strategy would be renunciation. This … that solution, and the greater courage we show in doing so, the safer we will be. [1981:62, quoted in Lichterman, Cabasso, and Burroughs 1995:22-23]. <br />

Observation 2: The unintended consequences of possession<br />
<br />
Humans and nuclear weapons can’t coexist. We isolate 2 reasons<br />
<br />
Reason 1: Radiation<br />
<br />
The maintenance of nuclear weapons requires a broad support infrastructure that exposes the population to high levels of radiation<br />
Physicians for Social Responsibility, 2008<br />

<br />
Evidence has accumulated of major health, …human and environmental toll for a very long time. <br />

Additionally, ocean radiation will contaminate humans and spread through the food <br />

From an environmental perspective, issues arise with regard to nuclear … or contained in fuel or weapons aboard sunken submarines breach their containment.<br />

The resulting genetic damage will lead to the extinction of all life on the planet<br />
Caldicott, Founder and President of the Nuclear Policy Research Institute, ‘94<br />
(Helen, Nuclear Madness: What You Can DO, pg. 21-22) cmt<br />
<br />
As a physician, I contend that nuclear technology … unless we bring about a dramatic reversal of the world’s pronuclear policies. <br />
<br />
<br />
Reason 2: Accidental Detonation<br />
<br />
The risk of accidents involving TNW’s is high – only half of the bases pass the safety inspection tests<br />
CND 05 <br />
(Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, “US tactical nuclear weapons in Europe,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf</a>.) JBA<br />
<br />
CND is very conscious of the danger of accidental … Surety Inspections hit an all-time low, when only half of the inspections resulted in a pass<br />
<br />
Specifically, these safety tests said even lightning strikes could cause the weapons to explode<br />
Kristensen consultant to the nuclear program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, 05 <br />

Some might argue that, because World War III …a sequence of events that spirals out of control. <br />

B. Education – CTBT is the most timely affirmative with the biggest lit base. It’s essential to any discussion of the NPT because it’s an unfulfilled obligation under that treaty, which makes it the core of the topic.<br />
