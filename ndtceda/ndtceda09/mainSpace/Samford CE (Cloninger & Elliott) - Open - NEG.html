“Role/Missions” Violation Shell (1/2)<br />
A) Negative Interpretation: Roles are the purposes assigned to nuclear forces--all deal with using weapons to deter acts of aggression—our interpretation is the plan text must specify a deterrence role for nuclear weapons which the plan reduces:<br />
<br />
U.S. Defense and Energy Departments, 2008<br />
National Security and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century, September, http: www.defenselink.mil/news/nuclearweaponspolicy.pdf, pp. 3-4<br />
<br />
Within this more flexible portfolio...endanger international order.<br />
<br />
(--) The missions of the arsenal are to deter nuclear, conventional, and WMD attacks:<br />
Kathleen Bailey, 2007 ((Dr. Kathlenn C. Bailey et al., Senior Associate, NIPP and member, USDS International Security Advisory Board, WHITE PAPER ON THE NECESSITY OF THE U.S. NUCLEAR DETERRENT, National Institute for Public Policy, August 15, 2007, p.1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nipp.org/Adobe/Deterrence%20Paper%20-%20version%202.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://nipp.org/Adobe/Deterrence%20Paper%20-%20version%202.pdf</a>, accessed 5-25-09.)<br />
<br />
During the Cold War...employ other weapons of mass destruction (WMD).<br />
<br />
B) The Violation: The plan text doesn’t reduce a deterrence based function of our nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
C) Standards:<br />
1) Limits: The AFF opens the door to changing elements of nuclear weapons without changing their fundamental role—examples include painting nuclear weapons a different color or changing where they are located.<br />
2) Disad ground: Their interpretation allows for AFF’s that duck core negative ground like deterrence based disads.<br />
3) Field context: Our evidence comes from the Department of Defense and Department of Energy: this is how the US federal government defines the role of nuclear weapons.<br />
D) Voting Issue:<br />
Fairness, Education, and Ground.<br />
<br />
Restrict = Congress Only<br />
<br />
A) Negative Interpretation:<br />
In the context of nuclear weapons policy, restrict means binding legislation against the President—this is distinct from executive action which “refrains” from taking an action:<br />
<br />
Philip Anderson et al, 2007 (Nobel Laureate in Physics, one of 22 nuclear physicists who co-wrote this letter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=4743" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=4743</a>)<br />
As physicists, members of the profession...refrain from considering nuclear weapons use against non-nuclear adversaries.<br />
<br />
B) Violation: The plan doesn’t use binding legislation from Congress.<br />
C) Standards:<br />
1) Predictable Ground: The topic is potentially huge—the negative interpretation allows for the neg to have the predictable ground of binding legislation from the Congress.<br />
2) Field Contextual Evidence: Our evidence is from a group of physicists calling for action on nuclear weapons—better than mere dictionary definitions of restrict which de-contextualize the term.<br />
D) Voting Issue:<br />
Fairness, Education, and Ground<br />

Japan allied prolif:<br />
<br />
U.S. is sending a strong signal of commitment to the nuclear umbrella for Japan<br />
Kyoko Hasegawa (AFP), Jul 18, 2009, US, Japan agree to set up nuclear deterrence talks, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iHGcOM7BNNi0VFEaaiWpAchLq9iA" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iHGcOM7BNNi0VFEaaiWpAchLq9iA</a><br />
TOKYO — The United States on Saturday...senior position under President Barack Obama.<br />
<br />
Confidence in the US nuclear umbrella is critical to prevent Japanese proliferation—which risks a cascade of prolif and shattering the NPT:<br />
Richard Halloran, 5/27/2009 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/05/27/2003444613" rel="nofollow">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2009/05/27/2003444613</a>)<br />

Health Care Politics Disad<br />
<br />
A – Uniqueness: Health Care Reform Will Pass Now: Obama’s political capital is key to this effort:<br />
<br />
Norman J. Ornstein, 9-1-2009 American Enterprise Institute, Washington Post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/31/AR2009083102913.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/31/AR2009083102913.html</a><br />
<br />
While health reform is far from a done deal...The odds have been improved, not damaged, by the president's approach.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) The plan saps Obama’s political capital<br />
Deep cuts to the size &amp; shape of the arsenal will trigger intense opposition from powerful constituencies—putting health care at risk:<br />
THOM SHANKER &amp; LANDLER, 9/8/2009 (staff writers, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/world/09arms.html?_r=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/world/09arms.html?_r=1</a>)<br />
With the clock ticking on a year-end deadline...overhaul the health care system and address global climate change.<br />
<br />
C) Impacts<br />
1) The triggered public option will cause cost controls and solve the health care crisis:<br />
Collier, 9-8-09<br />
Roger, CEO of a national health care consulting firm, Health Care Blog, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thehealthcareblog.com/the_health_care_blog/2009/09/happy-trails-trigger.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehealthcareblog.com/the_health_care_blog/2009/09/happy-trails-trigger.html</a><br />
However, any trigger is probably better...below the projections of CMS actuaries.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Controlling health care costs key to the economy:<br />
Business Week 2008<br />
(“Want Real Stimulus? Try Universal Health Care,” 12-8, p. lexis<br />
America’s economy is buckling...economic growth in the coming years.<br />
<br />
D) Economic collapse causes global nuclear war<br />

North Korea Disad<br />
A)US is pressuring China and South Korea to enforce UN sanctions against North Korea—they are hesitant to do so in the status quo:<br />

<h1 id="toc3"><a name="Counterplans"></a>Counterplans</h1>
 <br />
Diversity Forums Counterplan:<br />
Our counter advocacy is that [essentially we discuss the affirmative advocacy in non-competitive diversity forums instead of the debate round].<br />
<br />
Discussion forums solve best- we should encourage community-wide forums to discuss their advocacy<br />
Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State<br />
University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”]<br />
<br />
Interjecting the personalized into debate rounds... however, are, in my opinion, enormous.<br />
<br />
Three net benefits-<br />
1. Alliance splitting- personalizing debate risks splitting alliances and fracturing solutions, causing backlash and resistance:<br />
Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State<br />
University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”]<br />
The purpose of this essay...wrought with frustrations, anxiety, resistance and backlash.<br />
<br />
2. Structural solutions- personalized debating blocks structural solutions- our counter advocacy solves better<br />
Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State<br />
University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”]<br />
To be sure, many have embraced...structural problems within the debate community.<br />
<br />
3. Debate rounds are bad forums- lack of time, moving advocacy target, and they deflect from community-wide discussions- turns the case<br />
Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State<br />
University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”]<br />
<br />
The second major problem with this turn...such as resource disparity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pictures&quot; Counterplan: We create a text with pictures only (example we put up a picture of a nuclear weapon with an X through it).<br />
<br />
Reliance upon the phonetic alphabet destabilizes the balance of human mental evolution, creating a destructive trend toward masculine values that subliminally reprograms the user.<br />
Shlain 98<br />
Dr. Leonard Shlain is a neurosurgeon at California-Pacific Medical Center and contributor to The Encyclopedia of Creativity, The Alphabet, Versus The Godess: The Conflict Between Word and Image, 1998, pg. 66-8<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious benefits…by the left brain within each individual.<br />
<br />
<br />
Left-brain rational functions denigrate natural relationships, risking planetary extinction. Only re-balancing our mental spheres can revitalize connections to the earth.<br />
Reuther, 1989<br />
Rosemary, Radford, Professor of Feminist Theology at Pacific School of Religion, “Toward an Ecological-Feminist Theology of Nature” in Healing the Wounds: the Promist of Ecofeminism ed. Judith Plant. P. 147-150<br />
<br />
Thus we have not so much the prolidge…livable and sustainable cosmos.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagining and privileging the counterplan through images cuts through left brain dominance and enables a fully integrated psyche.<br />
Shlain, 1998<br />
Dr. Leonard, neurosurgeon at California-Pacific Medical Center and contributor to The Encyclopedia of Creativity, The Alphabet Versus The Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image, 1998, pg. 4-5<br />
<br />
To observe an enthralled four-year-old mastering the letters of the alphabet…comprehension of written words emerges in a one-at-a-time fashion<br />
<br />
Nuclear Things CP/Kritik<br />
<br />
A) Banning the bomb will fail unless you disavow the language that authenticates the bomb’s power:<br />
Brien Hallett and Ralph Summy, 2003 (PEACE &amp; CHANGE / April 2003, accessed via Ebsco,<br />
Detooling The Language of the Master’s House: The Case of Those “Nuclear Things”)<br />
The tool of language helps to shape...nuclear power can be challenged radically.<br />
<br />
B) Link: Referring to nuclear weapons, bombs, and war justifies the utilities of nuclear things—turning their advocacy:<br />
Brien Hallett and Ralph Summy, 2003 (PEACE &amp; CHANGE / April 2003, accessed via Ebsco,<br />
Detooling The Language of the Master’s House: The Case of Those “Nuclear Things”)<br />
Despite the complexities that surround the “why” question...represents “the very epicenter of banality.”15<br />
<br />
C) The Alternative: Nuclear weapons could just as easily be classified as “things” this characterization challenges the utility of the things as instruments of war:<br />
Brien Hallett and Ralph Summy, 2003 (PEACE &amp; CHANGE / April 2003, accessed via Ebsco,<br />
Detooling The Language of the Master’s House: The Case of Those “Nuclear Things”)<br />
The question now is this...It hardly seems so.<br />
<br />
Japan/South Korea PIC<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should prohibit the use of its nuclear weapons against a country or organization which has not attacked the United States or its allies with nuclear weapons, unless Japan or South Korea is attacked with conventional, chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.<br />
Observation 1: Textually and functionally competitive: they make a universal pledge, we exclude Japan and South Korea.<br />
Observation 2: The Net Benefit: Asian Apocalypse:<br />
Removing the No First Use Pledge risks Japanese prolif—even if they are right about other allies they are wrong about Japan:<br />
The Stanley Foundation, 8/22/2008 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm</a>)<br />
Given the tradition of nonuse...defense and security commitments to Japan.<br />
<br />
A NFU undermines the US deterrent versus North Korea—our conventional forces are an inadequate deterrent in this situation:<br />
The Stanley Foundation, 8/22/2008 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm</a>)<br />
Nevertheless, before we adopt a NFU posture...to Tehran if that were needed.<br />
<br />
A strong deterrence posture is essential to stop a North Korean war—we need the visible ability to crush North Korea at a moment’s notice:<br />

Nuclear Fuel Bank Counterplan<br />
Text: The United States federal government should…<br />
*Provide full funding for an international nuclear fuel bank.<br />
Questions, ask.<br />
Observation 1: Not topical: zero to do with our nuclear arsenal.<br />
Observation 2: Solvency:<br />
A nuclear fuel bank can solve prolif and bolsters the NPT:<br />
Sen. Evan Bayh, 2009 (Senator from Indiana, 1/15/2009,<br />

) Waive US export controls on sensor and data processing to Russia<br />
) Fully fund the salaries for Russia personnel that develop and fabricate early-warning satellites<br />
) Fund the development, hardware, and other costs of Russian space launch vehicles designed to bolster Russia’s early warning system against missile launches<br />
) Share US early warning information regarding nuclear and ballistic missiles with Russia<br />
