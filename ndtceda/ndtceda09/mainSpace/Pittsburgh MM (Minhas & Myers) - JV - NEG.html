Counterinfrastructure targeting would target oil, thats their 1AC ev. Targeting oil refineries is bad because it disproportionally kills more civilians. Their author.<br />

The nuclear explosion casualty ...close to the facility.<br />
<br />
Striking oil wells would cause oil fires. Historically, theses cause massive environmental damage.<br />
El-Baz 03 (Farouk, director of the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University, April 4, “Making Science Radioactive -- With Host Ira Flatow”)<br />
The oil well fires, ... the sandy layer below.<br />

Diner 94 (Major David N. Diner , JAG – US Army, MILITARY LAW REVIEW, Winter 1994, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stormingmedia.us/14/1456/A145654.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stormingmedia.us/14/1456/A145654.html</a>)<br />

By causing widespread extinctions, ... edging closer to the abyss.  <br />

<h3 id="toc3"><a name="Pitt MM-Navy-Consult Japan"></a><strong>Consult Japan</strong></h3>
<br />
Text: The United States federal government will enter into prior, binding consultation with the Government of Japan over the substantive mandates of the affirmative plan and will implement the results of the consultation.<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION ONE: Non-Topical<br />
<br />
Consultation violates the word resolved from Webster’s dictionary in 2000 which means “A fixed purpose, determined,” because plan passage is reliant on the results of consultation, making plan action conditional.<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION TWO: The net-benefit<br />
<br />
After the DPJ’s landslide victory, relations between Japan and the US remain high, but Japan wants to be treated as an equal partner in the alliance.<br />
Klug, September 2 (Foster, AP writer, “US diplomats say US-Japan alliance to stay strong,” Salon.com, September 2, 2009)<br />
<br />
The Obama administration ...  Japanese diplomatic policy.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
And Japan wants consultation on US nuclear weapons system deployments and use<br />
CSIS, August 26 (“The Japanese Umbrella: Assurance vs Deterrence,” Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, Project on Nuclear Issues, August 26, 2009)<br />
<br />
Japan is comfortable ...  commitment to Japan’s defense<br />
<br />
<br />
Prior, binding consultation is critical to revitalizing the alliance<br />
Mochizuki, 1997 (Mike, Senior Fellow in the Brookings Foreign Policy Studies Program, Spring 1997, The Brookings Review)<br />
<br />
As the US-Japan alliance ...  major West-European allies.<br />
<br />
<br />
A strong US-Japan alliance solves multiple scenarios for nuclear war<br />
Armitage, 2000 (Richard, Deputy Secretary of State, 10-11-00, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/inss/press/Spelreprts/SRJAPAN.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/inss/press/Spelreprts/SRJAPAN.HTM</a> “The United States and Japan: Advancing Toward a Mature Partnership”, ACC: 9.11.04, p. online)<br />
<br />
 Major war in ... global security strategy.<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION THREE: Solvency<br />
This solves case—Consultation with Japan allow us to deter China and guarantee Japanese security assurances. <br />
CSIS, August 26 (“The Japanese Umbrella: Assurance vs Deterrence,” Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, Project on Nuclear Issues, August 26, 2009)<br />

<br />
There can be no moral justifications for war, only existential threats can justify killing<br />
Slomp, 2006 (Gabriella, University of St. Andrews, “Carl Schmitt’s Five Arguments against the Idea of Just War,” Cambridge Review of International Affairs, Vol. 19, No 3, September 2006, pg. 436-437)<br />
<br />
The first argument ...  endangering someone else’s (Schmitt 1996, 49).<br />
<br />
<br />
Just war theory demonizes the enemy by making them morally ugly. This makes war more violent.<br />
Slomp, 2006 (Gabriella, University of St. Andrews, “Carl Schmitt’s Five Arguments against the Idea of Just War,” Cambridge Review of International Affairs, Vol. 19, No 3, September 2006, pg. 437-438)<br />
<br />
The second argument ... ues that historical evidence shows that one’s belief in having justa causa induces one to consider the enemy as evil and exempts one from following jus in bello.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just war theory allows both sides to claim the right to moral virtuousness. This is the structure of civil wars, which necessarily result in the annihilation of the enemy.<br />
Slomp, 2006 (Gabriella, University of St. Andrews, “Carl Schmitt’s Five Arguments against the Idea of Just War,” Cambridge Review of International Affairs, Vol. 19, No 3, September 2006, pg. 438-440)<br />
<br />
Schmitt’s claim that ... reality of war’ (Luban 1980, 172).11<br />
<br />
<br />
The conventions of war-as-war require the abandonment of just war principles. To regulate the rules of war, it is necessary to disavow a just cause for a war. The alternative solves by embracing a juridical right to war that explicitly rejects the moral precepts of war.<br />
Slomp, 2006 (Gabriella, University of St. Andrews, “Carl Schmitt’s Five Arguments against the Idea of Just War,” Cambridge Review of International Affairs, Vol. 19, No 3, September 2006, pg. 440-442)<br />
