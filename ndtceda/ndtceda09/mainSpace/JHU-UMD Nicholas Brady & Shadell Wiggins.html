<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Debate is my home, your home, and is the home to thousands of students across this country. The tournament is the ritual we perform where university classrooms and auditoriums are transformed into home for debaters. but like every home in this world that is ordered by white-supremacist-classist- patriarchy, Black bodies do not quite belong. Our Black bodies are marked as other in these spaces. In white-supremacist-classist- patriarchy every space is saturated in its discourse and determined by its ideology, norms, and practices.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>White-Supremacist-Classist- Patriarchy Is recognition of the intersectionality of oppression and how that interectionality remains a global ordering system that must be resisted.</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>white-supremacist-CLASSIST- patriarcHy defines itself in the technocratic conquering and control of bodies and nature.</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THE TECHNOCRACTIC ORDER OF WHITE-SUPREMACY-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY defines ANYTHING THAT IS NOT PERFECT STABILITY – INCLUDING NATURE OR BLACK BODIES – AS A THREAT TO BE DESTROYED. THIS DESIRE FOR CONTROL AND PEACE HAS CREATED THE ONLY TRUE METHOD FOR APOCALYPSE: THE NUCLEAR BOMB.</strong> </span><br />

[Daniel C, &quot;The Nuclear Horror&quot;, A Shuddering Dawn, pg. 113]<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>This DESIRE FOR CONTROL AND STABILITY created THE IDEOLOGICAL APPARATUS THAT DOMINATES AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY. APOCALYPSE MANAGEMENT IS A SYMPTOM OF WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY THAT IS THE REASON FOR ALL FORMS OF WARFARE AND CONFLICT</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>POLICY DEBATE IS A SPACE ORDERED BY WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST PATRIARCHY. THE NORMAL POLICYMAKER FRAMEWORK IS A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT BELIEVES THE ONLY IMPACT THAT MATTERS IS APOCALYPSE. THROUGH ITS NORMS, VALUES, AND PRACTICES, DEBATE EDUCATES THE NEXT LEADERS OF THE REAL WORLD TO PERPETUATE, MANAGE, AND REFIY OPPRESSION</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>WISE IN 2007</strong> [Tim Wise, &quot;White Like Me&quot;, pg. 32-33]<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">THEREFORE, WE ARE RESOLVED THAT THE DEBATE COMMUNITY SHOULD TRANSFORM ITS FRAMEWORK IN ALL ROUNDS TO WHO BEST PERFORMS A CONSISTENT ADVOCACY TO LIBERATE THE OPPRESSED</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>OUR DEMAND FOR A LIBERATORY FRAMEWORK FOR DEBATE IS OUR PLAN TEXT.</strong> <strong>Our DEMAND is a re-imagining of the game itself FROM STRICTLY POLICY DEBATE TO A SPACE FOR LIBERATORY PEDAGOGY.</strong> <strong>COMMUNITY IS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE STATUS QUO THAT IS RULED BY WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY AND FEAR. VOTING FOR OUR DEMAND BREAKS PAST FEAR AND CREATES A COMPETITIVE COMMUNITY THAT EDUCATES STUDENTS IN AN HONEST SPACE TO GAIN A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF OPPRESSION, POWER, AND LIBERATION NECESSARY TO MAKE A COMMUNITY OF LOVE THAT PRODUCES THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS WHO WILL TRANSFORM AND DEFEAT WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY.</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THIS IS FROM ALFRED IN 2004</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">[Taiaiake Alfred, Member of the Mohawk Tribe, Educator, Lecturer, Activist, “Warrior Scholarship: Seeing the University as a Ground of Contention”, <u>Indigenizing the Academy</u>, pg. 90-91]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THE CRITICAL FIRST STEP TO DISARMAMENT IS NOT POLICY, BUT IS THE CREATION OF SPACE WHERE ISSUES OF LIBERATION ARE CENTERED. NUCLEAR WEAPONS – LIKE OPPRESSION – CANNOT JUST BE OUTLAWED, BUT HUMAN BEINGS MUST LIBERATE THEMSELVES FROM THE SYSTEMS OF DOMINATION THAT NECESSITATE THEIR EXISTENCE. OUR LIBERATORY DEBATE EDUCATES THE NEXT LEADERS TO LIBERATE SOCIETY FROM OPPRESSIVE SYSTEMS, THEREFORE OUR DEMAND FOR A NEW DEBATE ALLOWS FOR DISARMAMENT IN THE REAL WORLD</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>DEBATE UNDER THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK PRODUCES THE NEXT LEADERS, MANAGERS, AND BUREAUCRATS OF WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY. THE ONLY WAY TO PRODUCE TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERS IS TO CHANGE THE FOCUS OF DEBATES TO ISSUES OF POWER AND LIBERATION</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>MILLER IN 2006</strong>  [Joe, <u>Cross-X</u>, pg. 466-467]<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>the ballot is the material method for TRANSFORMING THE DEBATE COMMUNITY. THE DEBATE COMMUNITY WILL NOT CHANGE UNLESS THE GATEKEEPERS ALLOW IT TO CHANGE. as a judge, you are a gatekeeper and VOTING AFFIRMATIVE IS A FORM OF SUPPORt for changing debate</strong></span><br />
