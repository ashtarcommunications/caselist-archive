Cohn  87 provides some insight on the logic of defense intellectuals: <br />
“there was no evidence that any feminist critiques had ever reached the ears, much less the minds, of these men. [. . .] A professor’s explanation of why the MX missile is to be placed in the silos of the newest minuteman missiles instead of replacing the older, less accurate ones, was ‘because they’re in the nicest hole—you’re not going to take the nicest missile you have and put it in a crummy hole.’ Other lectures were filled with discussion of vertical erector launchers, thrust to weight ratios, soft lay downs, deep penetration, and the comparative advantages of protracted versus spasm attacks—or what one military adviser to the National Security Council has called “releasing 70 to 80 percent of our megatonnage in one orgasmic whump.” There was serious concern about the need to harden our missiles and the need to “face it, the Russians are a little harder than we are.” [. . .]<br />
<br />
Why do these discussions and framings go unquestioned? Diana E. H. Russell , liberationist and feminist writer, argues that “before people will be moved to action, they have to get in touch with. . . feelings about the issue, but they also have to feel that what they do can make a difference.”  “We can be. . . effective in pointing out the connections between the masculine mentality and the nuclear mentality. . . but first we must deal with our own resistance to working on the nuclear issue.”<br />
<br />
The same forces of discourse that dominate the high politics of state security operate in the debate community. Debate is a unique forum and we’ve been invited to compete and legitimate our concerns. We come to the debate with an opinion but here like in International Relations the agenda was set before we even got a chance. Cohn and Ruddick  explain the framework of dominant masculinity:<br />
The final question asks us to evaluate current or proposed treaty agreements concerning nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. We are offered a place at the negotiating table, a position few women, probably fewer feminists, have occupied. For feminists there are two questions: How should we respond to the invitation? And, what should we say about particular treaties if we accept? The second question is not one to which anti-war feminists have a distinctive answer arising from our tradition. It is the first question, whether to come to the table and how to act effectively once there, that traditionally and today preoccupies feminists. Peacemaking, like war, has been dominated by men. Few women have been asked to participate in negotiations; when asked, it has usually been late, after the agenda was already set. But women are now claiming their place in negotiations.45 They have participated in the struggles and have a right to be present; many feel that only they will represent women’s distinctive interests. Getting and accepting an invitation is only the first step in being able to participate effectively. Often women have to overcome outright hostility and ridicule from male participants. When they are treated with courtesy, they may still feel unable to express their concerns, and ignored or dismissed when they try. Even when present in large numbers, women may be unable fully to engage. In South Africa women were welcomed to the peace table, occupied half its seats, but no one had contended with the divisions of work and responsibility in their lives. When negotiations lasted well into the night, no one was taking care of their husbands and children; women who stayed became tense and preoccupied.46 Women’s difficulties participating in peace negotiations may be especially marked when the topic is weapons, a subject which, as we have said, is particularly liable to lend itself to abstraction. A report by a woman participant at biological weapons treaty negotiations sounds familiar themes. What counts as “reason” prevailed, what gets coded as “emotions” were excluded. Disturbing concerns, for example, with the effects of a vaccine on troops or the populace, were labeled “emotional.” Speakers engaged in “cool, detached reasoning about the possible uses of weapons against an adversary....’Useful’ in this context means ability to cause serious loss of life.” Talking about a vaccine’s negative effects was tantamount to “complaining,” “whining,” “carrying on.”47 In discussion of biological weapons, as in issues of proliferation, the dichotomous division between reason and emotion is entwined with a similar division between [Western] Self and [unruly] Other, a particular instance of self and other, Us and Enemy typical of peace and arms negotiation. “One test of belonging and being heard in this group was whether one accepted the nature of the source of the BW problem. Did one accept the identity of the adversary?” That identity was often described in racist terms – e.g., “[they] don’t value human life the way we do” – and these remarks elicited no comment.48 ‘To belong and speak and be heard’ would mean ignoring the rules and interrupting the cool detached voice of reason. Again the gender discourse system is at work, frustrating these efforts. An objection which acknowledges emotion, which talks about the fate of bodies or lives, becomes an “outburst.” Reason ignores them in order to continue the discussion of weapons and their effects. Outbursts are “feminine”; in the silence that follows an outburst anyone, male or female, can “feel like a woman.” The effect of gender discourse depends upon a person’s complex personal and social identities. But for a feminist, who aims to speak as herself-who- isa- woman, the accusation of “being a woman” or a wimp has to be poignantly inhibiting. For feminists struggling to participate effectively, the final insult may be the realization that the negotiations, especially if they are presented as inclusive and democratic, are more ritualistic displays than political action. “In reality, major decisions are made in secret in the capitals, based on calculations that seek military (and increasingly commercial) advantages.”49 In the words of a male political scientist: “arms control is war by other means.” Real power is always already somewhere else by the time a woman takes her place at the table.50 Should women then give up the effort to join in negotiations? It seems that many do. [They] “get intimidated, and don’t put up with it, so they step aside.”51 But other women in increasing numbers are resisting ridicule and discrimination in order to make their views known. There are many reasons, personal and social, why some women persevere where others do not. Cultural attitudes toward women vary; women are more easily heard when many women are present, especially if they are linked in alliances that include all parties in conflict. One reason that some women persevere is their belief that they have a distinctive perspective to bring to negotiation. Women participants in peace negotiations have said that they bring to the table an ability to experience of “the severe human consequences of conflict” and a commitment to expose the “underbelly of war.” They stress the importance of speaking openly about pain and fear and loss, of building trust among adversaries, of opening up difficult, divisive issues rather than cloaking them in rhetoric or postponing them. They are apt to “see more clearly the continuum of conflict that stretches from the beating at home to the rape on the street to the killing on the battlefield.” “They witness vivid links between violence, poverty and inequality in daily lives.” They define peace in terms of “basic universal human needs” but/and advocate practical solutions to the building of peace, focusing on ordinary safety, housing, education and child care.52 In sum, these women introduce a perspective that satisfies the criteria of the “feminine” as it functions metaphorically in gender discourse. The women only sometimes compare themselves to men, occasionally with some anger, more often speaking quietly of what they, women, are more likely, often, to believe and do. But it would be hard to accuse them of acting like a woman; and, if women are present in sufficient numbers, they may be less vulnerable to the silencing power of gendered national security discourse.  <br />

Author of Getting Off, Robert Jensen  paints a picture of the state of “dominant masculinity in the United States today. It is the masculinity of a mob, ready to rape.” “Men’s bodies are pressed against each other as each one vies for the best view of the woman’s breasts, vagina, and anus. Many of the men are using cameras, camcorders, or cell phones to record the scene.”<br />
<br />
Cohn and Ruddick further describe the “realist consensus” that maintains the nuclear weapons arsenal by coding certain perspectives as feminine and using that as a basis for exclusion.<br />
<br />
“Within the logic of deterrence theory and proliferation discourse, the phenomenon of WMD proliferation is understandable in two main ways. States either acquire WMD for purposes of aggression – i.e., to use WMD or to threaten their use in acts of aggression, intimidation and/or coercion against other states or populations within their own state. Or states acquire WMD to enhance their own security by deterring an opponent from attack. Within a strategic calculus, either is understood as a “rational” motivation for WMD possession, even if not everyone would view these reasons as equally morally defensible.<br />
Some in the security community have argued that this “realist consensus” about states’ motivations for development of WMD “is dange rously inadequate.” They argue that “nuclear weapons, like other weapons, are more than tools of national security; they are political objects of considerable importance in domestic debates and internal bureaucratic struggles and can also serve as international normative symbols of modernity and identity.”40 We agree, but would add that the understanding any of those motivations will be incomplete without gender analysis.<br />
We argue that gendered terms and images are an integral part of the ways national security issues are thought about and represented – and that it matters. During the Gulf War, for example, the mass media speculated whether George Bush had finally “beat the wimp factor.” When in the spring of 1998 India exploded five nuclear devices, Hindu nationalist leader Balasaheb Thackeray explained “we had to prove that we are not eunuchs.” An Indian newspaper cartoon “depicted Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee propping up his coalition government with a nuclear bomb. ‘Made with Viagra,’ the caption read.”41<br />
Feminists argue that these images are not trivial, but instead deserve analysis. Metaphors which equate political and military power with sexual potency and masculinity serve to both shape and limit the ways in which national security is conceptualized.42 Political actors incorporate sexual metaphors in their representations of nuclear weapons as a way to mobilize gendered associations and symbols in creating assent, excitement, support for, and identification with the weapons and their own political regime. Moreover, gendered metaphor is not only an integral part of accomplishing domestic power aims. The use of these metaphors also appropriates the test of a nuclear weapon into the occasion for reinforcing patriarchal gender relations. <br />
 That a nation wishing to stake a claim to being a world power (or a regional one) should choose nuclear weapons as its medium for doing so is often seen as “natural”: the more advanced military destructive capacity you have, the more powerful you are. The “fact” that nuclear weapons would be the coin of the realm in establishing a hierarchy of state power is fundamentally unremarked, unanalyzed, taken for granted by most (nonfeminist) analysts. Some anti-war feminists, by contrast, have looked with a historical and post-colonial eye, and seen nuclear weapons’ enshrinement of as the emblem of power not as a natural fact, but as a social one, produced by the actions of states. They argue that when the United States, with the most powerful economy and conventional military in the world, acts as though its power and security are guaranteed only by a large nuclear arsenal, it creates a context in which nuclear weapons become the ultimate necessity for and symbol of state security. And when the US or any other nuclear power works hard to ensure that other states don’t obtain nuclear weapons, it is creating a context in which nuclear weapons become the ultimate arbiter of political power.43”<br />
<br />
MORE COHN&amp;RUDDICK, from page 14-16<br />
<br />
In addition to being economically costly, nuclear weapons development has medical and political costs. In the US program, many people have been exposed to high levels of radiation, including uranium miners; workers at reactors and processing facilities; the quarter of a million military personnel who took place in “atomic battlefield” exercises; “downwinders” from test sites; and Marshallese Islanders.30 Politically, nuclear regimes require a level of secrecy and security measures that exclude the majority of citizens, and in most countries, all women, from defense policy and decision-making.”31 <br />
From the perspective of women’s lives, we see not only the costs of the development of nuclear weapons, but also the spiritual, social and psychological costs of deployment. One cost, according to some feminists, is that “Nuclearisation produces social consent for increasing levels of violence.32 Another cost, for many, is that nuclear weapons create high levels of tension, insecurity and fear. As Arundhati Roy puts it, nuclear weapons “[i]nform our dreams. They bury themselves like meat hooks deep in the base of our brains.”33 <br />
Further, feminists are concerned about the effect of nuclear policy on moral thought, on ideas about gender, and how the two intersect. Nuclear development may legitimize male aggression, and breed the idea that nuclear explosions give a ‘virility’ to the nation which men as individuals can somehow also share. <br />
“[T]he strange character of nuclear policy- making not only sidelines moral and ethical questions, but genders them. This elite gets to be represented as rational, scientific, modern, and of course masculine, while ethical questions, questions about the social and environmental costs are made to seem emotional, effeminate, regressive and not modern. This rather dangerous way of thinking, which suggests that questions about human life and welfare are somehow neither modern nor properly masculine questions, or that men have no capacity and concern for peace and morality, can have disastrous consequences for both men and women.34”<br />
All in all, we find the daily costs of WMD development and deployment [insert: are] staggeringly high – in<br />
and of themselves sufficient to prevent deterrence from being an ethical moral option. <br />
A so-called “realist” response to this judgement might well pay lip-service to the “moral niceties” it embodies, but then argue that deterrence is worth those costs. Or, perhaps to be more accurate, it might argue that the results of a nuclear attack would be so catastrophic that the rest of these considerations are really an irrelevant distraction; deterring a WMD attack on our homeland is the precondition on which political freedom and social life depend, and so it must be thought about in a class by itself.<br />
We make two rejoinders to this claim. First, we note that in the culture of nuclear defense intellectuals, even raising the issue of costs is delegitimized, in large part through its association with “the feminine.” It is the kind of thing that “hysterical housewives” do; something done by people not tough and hard enough to look harsh “reality” in the eye, unsentimentally; not strong enough to separate their feelings from theorizing mass death; people who don’t have “the stones for war.” Feminist analysis rejects the cultural division of meaning which devalues anything associated with women or femininity. It sees in that same cultural valuing of the so-called “masculine” over the so-called “feminine” an explanation of why it appears so self-evident to many that what is called “military necessity” should appropriately be prioritized over all other human necessities. And it questions the assumptions that bestow the mantle of “realism” on such a constrained focus on weapons and state power. Rather than simply being an “objective” reflection of political reality, we understand this thought system as 1) a partial and distorted picture of reality, and 2) a major contributor to creating the very circumstances it purports to describe and protect against.<br />
Second, just as feminists tend to be skeptical about the efficacy of violence, they might be equally skeptical about the efficacy of deterrence. Or, to put it another way, if war is a “lie,” so is deterrence. This is not, of course, to say that deterrence as a phenomena never occurs; no doubt one opponent is sometimes deterred from attacking another by the fear of retaliation. But rather deterrence as a theory, a discourse and set of practices underwritten by that discourse, is a fiction.<br />
Deterrence theory is an elaborate, abstract conceptual edifice, which posits a hypothetical relation between two different sets of weapons systems – or rather, between abstractions of two different sets of weapons systems, for in fact, as both common sense and military expertise tells us, human error and technological imperfection mean that one could not actually expect real weapons to function in the ways simply assumed in deterrence theory. Because deterrence theory sets in play the hypothetical representations of various weapons systems, rather than assessments of how they would actually perform or fail to perform in warfare, it can be nearly infinitely elaborated, in a never ending regression of intercontinental ballistic missile gaps and theater warfare gaps and tactical “mini- nuke” gaps, ad infinitum, thus legitimating both massive vertical proliferation and arms racing.<br />
Deterrence theory is also a fiction in that it depends upon “rational actors,” for whom what counts as “rational” is the same, independent of culture, history, or individual difference. It depends on those “rational actors” perfectly understanding the meaning of “signals” communicated by military actions, despite dependence on technologies that sometimes malfunction; despite cultural difference and the lack of communication that is part of being political enemies; despite the difficulties of ensuring mutual understanding even when best friends make direct face-to- face statements to each other. It depends on those same “rational actors” engaging in a very specific kind of calculus that includes one set of variables (e.g.,<br />
weapons size, deliverability, survivability, as well as the “credibility” of their and their opponent’s threats), and excludes other variables (such as domestic political pressures, economics, or individual subjectivity). What is striking from a feminist perspective is that even while “realists” may worry that some opponents are so “insufficiently rational” as to be undeterrable, this does not lead them to search for a more reliable form of ensuring security, or an approach that is not so weapons-dependent.<br />
Cynthia Cockburn, in her study of women’s peace projects in conflict zones, describes one of the women’s activities as helping each other give up “dangerous day dreams.”35 From a feminist anti-war perspective, having WMD as deterrents is a dangerous dream. The dream of perfect rationality and control which underwrites deterrence theory is a dangerous dream, since it legitimates constructing a system that only could be (relatively) safe if that perfect rationality and control were actually possible. Deterrence theory itself is a dangerous dream because it justifies producing and deploying WMD, thereby making their accidental or purposive use possible (and far more likely) than if they were not produced at all, nor deployed in such numbers. “Realists” are quick to point out the dangers of not having WMD for deterrence when other states have them. Feminist perspectives suggest that that danger only appears so self-evidently greater than the danger of having WMD if you discount as “soft” serious attention to the costs of development and deployment.<br />
<br />
“In the case of the nuclear crisis, feeling about it may be an even more serious obstacle than recognizing it.” (Russell p. 310). <br />
We do not defend a United States federal government policy in the 1ac because we recognize such as incomplete and temporary. The crisis of nuclear weapons is a crisis of culture, exemplified through oppressive, masculine politics but the problem is in the polity. Policy- pick- me- ups necessitate the exclusion of personal gender analysis and thus our stance as feminists forces debaters to take seriously the role of gender in debates about nuclear weapons by demanding and defending the necessity of a discussion of the “thoughts, ideas, and fantasies” which support our current condition. We insist that such an analysis is only possible after first confronting personal barriers to feeling, because when we don’t, “when we accept the idea that there is something called masculinity to which we should conform, we exchange those aspects of ourselves that make life worth living for an endless struggle for power that is illusory and destructive both to others and to ourselves” (Jensen).<br />
<br />
We choose to frame our discussion of gender with knowledge of the resolution because the forms and expressions of structural violence that result from dominant ways of knowing keep producing the same result; “systematic exploitation and degradation of human lives—and of our ecological support system”, “a partial and distorted picture of reality and a contributor to creating the very circumstances it purports to describe and protect against” (Cohn&amp;Ruddick 03).<br />
<br />
Peterson 92 [V Spike, polsci@UAZ, Gendered States, ed Peterson]<br />
    I respond to these questions by exploring how situating gender and states in relationship to each other “systematically” reveals their relationship to structural violence and its reproduction. This essay has so far illuminated both the insecurities constituted by historical processes of state making and, more specifically, their implications for women’s systemic insecurity. Rethinking world security requires, in part, this more accurate understanding of existing insecurities: it requires politicizing structural violence as historically constituted—as contingent rather than natural—and specifying some of its implications and consequences. This understanding confirms that structural violence can be changed and identifies some of the changes necessary to pursue world security. But rethinking world security also requires more accurate understanding of the identities and ideologies that (re)produce and ,significantly, depoliticize structural violence and its insecurities. This is to query ways of being and knowing; to privilege questions of “who we are,” how we learn to know who we are, and how particular identities—who and what we identify with—shape political possibilities.&gt;<br />
