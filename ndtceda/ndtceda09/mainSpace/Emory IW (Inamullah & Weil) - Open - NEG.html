Text:<br />
-The United States federal government should limit the Global Strike mission for nuclear quick-reaction strikes to preemption of adversary nuclear weapons in response to raised alert status during a conflict and preemption of adversary biological weapons in response to offensive preparations during a conflict. The United States should declare publicly that it maintains a nuclear strike option for those two scenarios, but will rely on conventional weapons for other Global Strike targets.<br />
-The United States federal government should procure necessary F-22 Raptors to raise the fleet size to 250.<br />
-The United States federal government should procure a fleet of 60 Airborne Aircraft Carriers developed from converted Boeing 747s.<br />
-The United States federal government should authorize increased funding for research and development of low-yield nuclear weapons designed from conversions from existing warheads and designed for defeating CBW agents and hardened bunkers. The United States federal government should use these warheads for the Global Strike mission for quick-reaction strikes.<br />
-The United States federal government should increase STRATCOM’s budget to allow for increased training of both nuclear and conventional bombers. The United States federal government should end the nuclear Global Strike mission for three squadrons of B-52 bombers and all squadrons of B-2 bombers. The United States federal government should make the fourth B-52 squadron dedicated to the Global Strike mission for nuclear quick-reaction strikes.<br />
-The United States Federal Government should fully fund development of new aerial and satellite gradiometry methods including quantum gradiometry for the detection of hardened and deeply buried targets and should deploy these capabilities on several independent and dedicated satellites.<br />

Perry &amp; Scowcroft, 2009 (U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy, Independent Task Force Report, No. 62)<br />
“DeCommissioning and Dismantling Nuclear Weapons Reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons means considerably more than transferring deployed nuclear warheads from military units to a secure storage facility. Eliminating the destructive potential of the weapon requires a systematic process to decommission and dismantle retired devices. This process proceeds through several stages: decommissioning the weapons and transferring it to storage or reserve status; dismantling the weapon, including separating high explosives from the nuclear material and destroying the fusing and weapon housing; storing and breaking up the plutonium pit and other nuclear material components, such as highly enriched uranium in the secondary thermonuclear part of the weapon; and ultimately transforming the plutonium and other weapons-usable fissile material in reactors or other devices to make them unusable in nuclear weapons.<br />

Conventional deterrence insufficient --- causes rogue states to doubt our credibility and encourages CBW use.<br />

Credibility is determined by two factors: whether the adversary ... attack but also biological and chemical attacks against U.S. interests.<br />

Sagan's argument suffers from two problems ... solely on a conventional deterrent threat will be inadequate.<br />

3. Option to use nukes doesn’t bind us to use them --- we can adapt our response to circumstances.<br />

At the same time, declaratory policy should ... ambiguity so U.S. leaders can flexibly tailor their response to fit the specific circumstances.<br />

4. Leaving open the option of nuclear strikes or conventional strikes is key to deterrence and doesn’t lock us into use.<br />
