<br />
The Cartesian conception of the sovereign self, that is the self-I-Eye of the United States, in relation to the other is a self referential epistemology/ontology that sets into place and orders the idealized self in relation to the monstrous other creating not only the justification but the moral obligation for policy-makers to go war.<br />

<br />
Modern Warfare is not a divergence from the normal antipathy toward violence but is the end result of the epistemological primacy of preemption as a mode of thought and action linking the pursuit of war and the pursuit peace together.<br />

<br />
Epistemologically foreclosing the production of knowledge within the circuitry of war and peace consolidates the omnipotence of the all seeing sovereignty of the United States and precludes the potential of the other’s existence as anything but a target in the visual field of the atomic bomber.<br />

<strong>The debate community came together - topic papers were written and read – deliberation was done and the votes came in… and we “chose” the nuclear weapons topic... as a community - then the topic committee gathered and this is what they said -</strong> </span><strong>Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal. – Well this is our response…<br />
<br />
We read the contemporary historic moment within debate, the topic paper, and the resolution, in the light of the Arguments made by William V. Spanos in his 1993 critique of the Humanist educational/pedagogical theory and practice. Specifically Spanos makes the argument, in the introduction of the book</strong> <em><strong>The End of Education: Toward Post-Humanism,</strong></em> <strong>that contemporary educational theory is rooted is the violent ontology of western metaphysics and the disciplinary mechanisms of domination and control that seek to pacify the masses in the most efficient means possible creating docile and useful bodies for Western Imperialism.</strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />

 <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;">Chapter One – Structural Crisis </span><br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS;"><strong>Our argument is that the modern-world-system is in crisis. Immanuel Wallerstein sociologist and senior research scholar at Yale argues in the 2006 text</strong> <em><strong>European Universalism: The Rhetoric of Power,</strong></em> <strong>in among other places, that the modern-world system (i.e. the capitalist world order) is in a period of structural crisis and terminal decline. Marking the current period as one of transition and turmoil as the dominant social order of the last 500 years is coming to an end. Wallerstien’s central thesis is that the declining rate of returns on capital investment undermines the entire purpose of capitalism and thus places the system itself as well as the social and cultural institutions into a state of structural crisis. On pages 55-58 Wallerstein notes three trends that mark a rapid decline in the rate of returns (i.e. profits) making it impossible for capitalism to continue to exist as it as for 500 years. This is a result of the historic rise in the three types of production costs.</strong> </span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>Personnel/Labor costs that have risen because the organization of the labor force into unions and the increasingly limited capacity of capital to shift labor costs abroad as globalization has caused the saturation of global markets.</strong> </span></li><li><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>Input/Material costs are rising because the increasing cost of finite resources and the rise in the cost of socialized costs like the global warming which is not included in the cost of carbon emitting production process.</strong> </span></li><li><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>Taxation costs have increased because popular demand for socially available healthcare, education and retirement systems to provide services for all of society.</strong> </span></li></ul><br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>Wallerstein’s argument that Capitalism is in a state of structural crisis is further supported by Marxist Geographer David Harvey’s recent observation in an interview on April 2nd 2009 with Amy Goodman on the daily news show Democracy Now, that there are limits to growth and these are quickly being reached on the ecological, social and political fronts. Harvey specifically argues quote</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/4/2/marxist_geographer_david_harvey_on_the" rel="nofollow">http://www.democracynow.org/2009/4/2/marxist_geographer_david_harvey_on_the</a><br />
The way I see it... ...</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>a zero-growth economy.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><br />
<strong>David Graeber a former Colleague of Wallerstien’s at Yale, contends in a 2008 essay, “Hope in Common” that capitalism is collapsing for the simple reason that it is impossible to maintain a system of perpetual growth on a finite planet. Graeber also argues that faced with this prospect many hopelessly cling to capitalism knowing full well that it is doomed because a vast apparatus has been constructed to destroy any belief that another world is possible.<br />
Specifically Graeber says quote</strong><br />
“</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-weight: normal;"><u>If we really want to understand this situation, we have to begin by understanding that the last thirty years have seen the construction of a vast bureaucratic apparatus for the creation and maintenance of hopelessness,</u> a kind of giant machine that is designed, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">first </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-weight: normal;"><u>and</u></span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;"> foremost,</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-weight: normal;"> to destroy any sense of possible alternative futures. At root is <u>a veritable obsession</u> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">on the part of the rulers of the world with ensuring that social movements cannot be seen to grow, to flourish, to propose alternatives; </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-weight: normal;"><u>that those who challenge existing power arrangements can never, under any circumstances, be perceived to win.”</u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-weight: normal;"><u>He Continues by saying<br />
“To do so requires creating a vast apparatus of armies, prisons, police, various forms of private security firms and police and military intelligence apparatus, propaganda engines of every conceivable variety, most of which do not attack alternatives directly so much as they create a pervasive climate of fear, jingoistic conformity, and simple despair that renders any thought of changing the world seem an idle fantasy</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;">Maintaining this apparatus seems even more important, to exponents of the “free market,” even than maintaining any sort of viable market economy. How else can one explain, for instance, what happened in the former Soviet Union, where one would have imagined the end of the Cold War would have led to the dismantling of the army and KGB and rebuilding the factories, but in fact what happened was precisely the other way around? This is just one extreme example of what has been happening everywhere.</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;">”</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-weight: normal;"><br />
<br />
<u>And finally he concludes quote<br />
“Economically, this apparatus is pure dead weight; all the guns, surveillance cameras, and propaganda engines are extraordinarily expensive and really produce nothing, and as a result, it’s dragging the entire capitalist system down with it, and possibly, the earth itself.”</u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>The Global Economy is in Structural crisis because the Declining rate of return, the limits to growth and because wasteful production only creates further inefficiencies in the system by creating more costs than benefits.<br />
This Means the collapse of capitalism is inevitable and any effort to maintain the system is futile because as the limits to growth, are being socially, politically, ecologically and culturally exceeded, the result is symptomatic crises arise throughout the globe.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;">Chapter Two – Symptomatic Crises<br />
<strong>Our argument is that as capitalism exceeds its socio-cultural-political and ecological limits the result is the proliferation of symptomatic crises.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>An example of the unending cyclical crises that mark the contemporary global condition can be found in the</strong> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>IMF</strong> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>Working Paper “Systemic Banking Crises: A New Database”</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf</a><br />
<strong>Which indicates that between 1970 and 2007 there have been 42 Banking Crises.<br />
<br />
Another example is the global Food Crisis. Specifically as the rate of return declines in agricultural production and as corporations try to squeeze as much profits as possible out of food production the result is a world of cyclical famines and a structural condition of food crisis causing 1 billion people to be at risk of starvation.<br />
<br />
This phenomenon can be seen throughout society as the contradiction of capitalism erupt in the Financial Crisis, the health care crisis, the education crisis, the housing crisis, the Climate crisis, Global Poverty, Social Unrest, Anti-Globalization Protests etc.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><br />
<strong>Noam Chomsky argues that across the globe there are at least 6 crises currently unfolding, and that all of them have their root in the decision making model of the state corporate leadership of neoliberal capitalism. The Crises that Chomsky identifies as symptoms of the current Neoliberal effort to maintain the capitalist Hegemony are the Global Financial crisis, the Global food crisis, the Cultural crisis of privileging militarism and corporatism over all other social goals, The crisis arising out the US ever expanding War on terrorism, the Climate crisis and finally Chomsky concludes by saying quote:</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-weight: normal;"><u>“Now, of all the crises that afflict us, I think</u> my own feeling is that <u>this growing democratic deficit may be the most severe. Unless it’s reversed</u>, Arundhati Roy’s forecast might prove accurate, <u>and not in the distant future. The conversion of democracy to a performance in which the public are only spectators might well lead</u> to—<u>inexorably to</u> what she calls <u>the ‘endgame for the human race.’”</u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>Since the 1970s the state corporate elite have tried to maintain the capitalist world order that they benefit from by imposed neoliberal policies that have produced an unending cycle of crises throughout society.<br />
As crisis is becoming the defining condition of our times the global polity is increasingly governed by the dynamics of crisis and by the “crisis managers” who manufacture and manipulate them.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;">Chapter 3 – Crisis Managers<br />
<strong>The argument we will be making here is that the Current policy making paradigms that dominate the political spectrum both Liberal and Conservative reproduce a crisis manager mentality.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>Specifically the Neoliberal Policy making paradigm of the last 30 years is founded on a strategy of manipulating crises in order to implement unpopular policies based on a fundamentalist market ideology</strong></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;">[Klein “The Shock Doctrine” 2007 p.6-7].</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt;"><strong>For instance in introducing Naomi Klein and her Book the Shock Doctrine Award winning Journalist and host of Democracy Now Amy Goodman said quote</strong> </span><br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><strong>As an example of how Neoliberalism creates and manipulates crises, later in the same interview Klein said the following about New Orleans in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina quote</strong><br />
<u>So</u> you... ... <u>radical privatization.</u><br />
<br />
<strong>This is also true of the neoconservative policy making perspective as typified by Samuel Huntington and the Bush Administration of the previous 8 years. For instance William V. Spanos writes in</strong> <span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><strong>American exceptionalism in the age of globalization: the specter of Vietnam,</strong> <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;"><strong>on page 237 quote</strong>, </span></span><br />
in the process... ... deepen conflict.<br />
<br />
<strong>Policy making currently takes place in climate of crisis. Far from offering solutions to the problems that these crises present, the dominant policy-making paradigms both manufacture and manipulate crises as a way of maintaining their own power and extending the hegemony of capitalist order. This means that current approaches policy making are inadequate and should be rejected and their cultural reproduction as methods of deliberation abandoned.</strong><br />
<br />
Chapter 4 – Debate – Crisis Manager 101<br />
<strong>Traditional Debate education reproduces the crisis manager mentality of contemporary policy making paradigms criticized above. Thus traditional debate is a cultural and epistemological technology that reproduces a specific type of subject with a specific way of thinking about the world.<br />
For example Roland Greene and Darrin Hick have argued in the 2005 essay Lost Convictions that the traditional debate has been defended on the basis that it is a cultural technology for re-assigning individuals personal conviction to the perfomative embodiment of free speech. And that this commitment free speech contributes to formation of American Exceptionalism and the Excpetional American.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">(Ronald Walter &amp; Darrin, “LOST CONVICTIONS Debating both sides and the ethical self-fashioning of liberal citizens”, Cultural Studies Vol. 19, No. 1 January, pp. 100 MAD)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">Day also demonstrated his commitment to free speech more radically than Schlesinger by abandoning Schlesinger’s deployment of ‘clear and present danger’ as an external value to regulate the reasonableness of speech. Yet, </span><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">Day’s defence of debating both sides elides the national particularity of how </span><span style="color: black; font-weight: normal;">free speech was being put to work in the global struggle between liberal democracy and totalitarianism. One way that Cold War liberalism helped to transform the national particularity of the United States into a universal form of liberalism was through the constitution of free speech as a democratic norm. As a cultural technology debating both sides contributed to American</span></u><span style="color: black; font-weight: normal;"> <u>exceptionalism by transforming students into the concrete embodied performers of the universal norms of free speech. In other words, by instantiating a desire for full and free expression, the pedagogical technique of debating both sides became a mechanism by which the student-debater-citizen becomes an exceptional ‘American’ the bearer of universal norms of liberal democracy.</u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><strong>Traditional debate also trains the participants in the crisis management techniques of the “dominant political culture” that William Spanos criticizes above.<br />
Specifically debate teaches us to analyze massive amounts of data about the most pressing global problems of day and boiling them down into a single one sentence policy prescription. The result is not well round and educated politically active individuals but rather a mass of citizens well trained in myopic policy making who can identify immediate problems and their immediate “solutions” but have become blind to the complexities and structural conditions that give rise to the symptoms that piece meal policy making can never address. In the end the skills we learn in debate don’t help us become capable of creating new political possibilities and new social relations but instead equip us to become crisis managers – those who can order and manipulate crises for their benefit.</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-weight: normal;">Thoughts. Provocations. Explorations. </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>Forms of investigation and social research that expand possibilities for political action, proliferating tactics of resistance</u> through the constituent power of the imagination. <u>Walking we ask questions, not from the perspective of the theorist removed and separate</u> from organizing, <u>but</u> rather <u>from within and as part of the multiple and overlapping cycles and circuits of struggle.</u> For the removed theorist movements themselves are mere abstractions, pieces of data to be categorized, analyzed, and fixed. <u>The work of militant investigation is multiple, collectively extending forms of antagonism to new levels of understanding, composing flesh made words from immanent processes of resistance. Far from vanguardist notions of intellectual practice that translate organizing strategies and concepts for populations who are</u> seemingly <u>believed to be too stupid</u> or unable to move beyond trade union consciousness, <u>it is a process of collective wondering and wandering that is not afraid to admit the question of how to move forward is always uncertain, difficult, and never resolved in easy answers</u> that <u>eternally correct. As an open process militant investigation discovers new possibilities within the present, turning bottlenecks and seeming dead ends into new opportunities for joyful insurgency.</u></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong>Embracing our methodology means re-conceiving the pedagogical space and practice of debate. This is not some utopian disconnected call for revolution from the citadel of the Ivory Tower, but a practical methodology for activating the possibilities of resistance within debate by reframing the priorities we emphasis in our research and by using the spaces that we find ourselves in to develop strategies for how to most effectively resist corporatizaion and militarization of academic space and the inculcation of the Crisis-manager-Subject. Again Graeber and Shukaitis write quote</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS; font-size: 10.5pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>Research draws upon the</u> multivector <u>motion of the social worlds we find ourselves in, develops methods for further movement within that space</u>, whether it's using militant ethnography within the globalization in Barcelona as or applying autoethnographic methods as a homeless organizer in Toronto. As Graeme Chesters and Michal Osterweil describe, <u>it is a question of forging a space, ethic, and practice fitting for where we find ourselves, whether in a classroom or university space,</u> a social center, a factory<u>, or</u> knitting <u>outside the gates of a summit protest. There is no pure social space from which new practices and ideas will emerge from an ideal revolutionary subject</u> that we only need to listen to. <u>Our lives are constantly distributed across a variety of compromises with institutions and arrangements of power that are far from ideal. The question is not to bemoan that fate but rather to find methods and strategies of how to most effectively use the space we find ourselves in to find higher positions of subversiveness in struggle.</u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">In other words we can use the debate space as an opportunity to engage in politically relevant research for affecting change in our lives while coming together to form collectives and political unions that allow us to confront the challenges that face us as a unified front. This is a tangible political strategy that allows us to better understand the conditions we face, and the possibilities of struggle and resistance, while offering greater affinities through solidarity and support. Thank you. </span><br />

Critically,</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>this agoraphobia is not just shared by politicians</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">and professional journalist,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>but</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">in large measure</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>by the public itself.</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">The reason, I think, are not far to seek. </span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>While liberal democracies lack anything resembling the</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> Athenian</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>agora, they</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">certainly</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>do not lack equivalents to Roman circuses.</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">The ugly mirror phenomenon,</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>by which ruling elites encourage forms of popular participation that continually remind the public just how much they are unfit to rule,</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">seems, in many modern states to have been brought to a condition of unprecedented perfection. Consider here, for example, the view of human nature one might derive generalizing from the experience of driving to work on the highway, as opposed to the view one might derive from the experience of public transportation. Yet the American—or German—love affair with the car was the result of conscious policy decisions by political and corporate elites beginning in the 1930s. One could write a similar history of the television, or consumerism, or as Polanyi long ago noted, “the market.”</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><br />

<strong>Policy-making assumes a statist apparatus that imposes its will on the masses. Graeber ‘04</strong><br />
[David Graeber, lecturer, anthropology Goldsmiths College, University of London, Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology, 2004] </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Even more than High Theory, what anarchism needs is what might be called Low Theory: a way of grappling with those real, immediate questions that emerge from a transformative project. Mainstream social science actually isn’t much help here, because normally in mainstream social science this sort of thing is generally classified as “policy issues,” and no self-respecting anarchist would have anything to do with these.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>The notion of “policy” presumes a state or governing apparatus which imposes its will on others. “Policy” is the negation of politics; policy is by definition something concocted by some form of elite, which presumes it knows better than others how their affairs are to be conducted.</u></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>By participating in policy debates the very best one can achieve is to limit the damage, since the very premise is inimical to the idea of people managing their own affairs.</u><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The political orders that have emerged out of efforts to subordinate the peoples will to the coercive state apparatus legitimizes state violence and forms the historical basis for mass murder.</strong> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong>Graeber 2007</strong> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">[</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">David, lecturer, anthropology Goldsmiths College, University of London, </span><em><span style="font-weight: normal;">Possibilities: Essays on Hierarchy, Rebellion, and Desire. </span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;">“There Never was a West: or, Democracy Emerges From the Spaces in Between.”] P.366-67</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; font-weight: normal;">Jurists, meanwhile, have long been aware that</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;"><u>the coercive nature of the state ensures that democratic constitutions are founded on a fundamental contradiction</u>. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 7pt; font-weight: normal;">Walter Benjamin (1978) summed it up nicely by pointing out that any legal order that claims a monopoly of the use of violence has to be founded by some power other than itself, which inevitably means by acts that were illegal according to whatever system of law came before</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>The legitimacy of a system of law,</u> </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">thus, <u>necessarily rests on acts of criminal violence.</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;"> American and French revolutionaries were, after all, by the law under which they grew up, guilty of high treason. Of course, sacred kings from Africa to Nepal have managed solve this logical conundrum by placing themselves, like God, outside of the system. But as political theorists from Agamben to Negri remind us</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, <u>there is no obvious way for “the people” to exercise sovereignty</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">in the same way.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>Both the right-wing solution</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">(constitutional orders are</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;"><u>founded by</u>, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">and can be set aside by,</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>inspired leaders—whether Founding Fathers or Fuhrers—who embody the popular will), and the left-wing solution</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>(</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">constitutional orders usually gain their legitimacy</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>through violent popular revolutions) lead to endless practical contradictions.</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">I</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">n fact<u>,</u> as sociologist Michael Mann has hinted (1999), <u>much of the slaughter of the twentieth century derives from some version of this contradiction. The demand to simultaneously create a uniform apparatus of coercion within every piece of land on the surface of the planet, and to maintain the pretense that the legitimacy of the apparatus derives from “the people,” has lead to an endless need to determine who, precisely, “the people” are supposed to be.</u></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>In all the varied German law courts of the last eighty years—from Weimar to Nazi to communist DDR to the Bundesrepublik—the judges have used the same opening formula:</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">“In Namen des Volkes,”</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>“In the Name of the People.”</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">American courts prefer the formula “The Case of the People versus X” (Mann 1999; 19). </span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">In other words, <u>“</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>the people” must be evoked as the authority behind the allocation of violence, despite the fact that any suggestion that the proceedings be in any way democratic is</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">likely to be</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>greeted with horror</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">by all concerned. Mann suggests that</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>pragmatic efforts to work to out this contradiction, to use the apparatus of violence to identify and constitute a “people” that those maintaining the apparatus feel are worthy of being the source of authority, has been responsible for at least sixty million murders in the twentieth century alone.</u></span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;">Chapter #2 Debate and Democracy.<br />
<strong>T</strong></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong>hesis: Traditional Debate techniques have historically been mobilized within the United States as a means of reproducing a liberal elite necessary to the maintenance of the social and political order of Representative Democracy that we criticize above.<br />
The debate communities adherence to Switch side Debate and it’s requirement that individuals reassign their convictions to the process of debate by separating themselves from their own first order convictions, is part of an educational effort designed to legitimize the judgments of the expert class and consolidate power in the hands of a self fashioned liberal elite. Reproducing the vary type of democratic governance that legitimizes state violence and consolidates decision-making power in the hands of the few. Debate coaches Greene and Hicks ‘05</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">(Ronald Walter &amp; Darrin, “LOST CONVICTIONS Debating both sides and the ethical self-fashioning of liberal citizens”, Cultural Studies Vol. 19, No. 1 January, p. 119-20.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>It is the distance from the world engendered by debate as a cultural technology of moral development that requires closer investigation.</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">Writing at roughly the same time as the original debating both sides controversy appeared in the late 1950s, Raymond Williams (1958) feared that ‘any practical denial of the relation between conviction and communication, between experience and expression, is morally damaging alike to the individual and the common language’ (p. 304). Williams expressed concern that the very idea of the masses and the new jobs made possible by the expansion of the industries of communication relied on separating speech from conviction. In this way, the new symbolic workers of the cultural industry turn into sources of communication while losing their status as moral agents. Might these new jobs offered by the expansion of the post-war cultural apparatus offer us a clue about the effectivity of splitting speech from conviction? Pierre Bourdieu (1984) argues that</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>an important part of aesthetic education is the creation of a ‘distance from the world’</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>,</u> a distance that allows the subject to separate form and function.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>This distance from the world</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>,</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">according to Bourdieu, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>marks the effect of educational capital on the bourgeoisie and helps to reproduce class distinctions between the bourgeoisie and its others.</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">John Frow (1995) adjusts Bourdieu’s insight to argue that the specific fraction of the bourgeoisie made possible by this distance from the world is the knowledge class. This is so because </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>the ability to distance one’s judgment from one’s first order convictions secures the knowledge class’s professionalization</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>.</u> Bourdieu and Frow demonstrate how </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>a class interest finds its constitution in the ability to distance one’s self from the world; a class interest that authorizes a class’s judgment as worthy of recognition and authority</u>.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">From this perspective, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>debating both sides is part of the history of educational efforts to provide a specific class with the cultural legitimacy necessary to valorize their judgments about the world. The link between moral development and the game of debate to train students into their class roles as expert judges makes room for the reassignment of debating both sides to the globalization of liberalism as deliberative democracy.</u></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">In the contemporary field of political and social theory</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>Day’s universal norm of free and full expression and Muir’s investment in moral education work in tandem</u>.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">When we read Muir and Day alongside one another</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, <u>debating both sides transforms itself into a mechanism to generate the moral subject akin to the demands of a communicative ethics and a deliberative democracy</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>.</u>13 </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">De</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">bating both sides generates an ethical stance that allows debate to best secure the political norms of tolerance and pluralism while authorizing and legitimating moral and political judgments from the foundation of a dialogic encounter with other perspectives. </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>Muir’s defence of the ‘game status’ of debate emerging in the aftermath of the Cold War re-codes debating both sides as a game of freedom instantiating the moral education required for liberal citizenship.</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">Reading Muir alongside Dennis Day, we can appreciate the explicit transformation of debate into an ethical pedagogy. Debate training, without the requirement to debate both sides, locates the act of public argument too closely to the personal convictions of the speaker.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>The gap created by debating both sides between the embodied speech act and his/her convictions makes possible the emergence of debate as the proper method of adjudicating disputes in a democratic culture. Debating both sides transforms the student-debater by developing a post-conventional morality</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">_/ one</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> <u>capable of making moral judgments based on reason and not authority or personal convictions</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>.</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">In this way, the debating both sides controversy pre-figures how a deliberative theory of democracy requires a moral theory of the subject to prepare that subject for the transformational potential associated with the ‘gentle force of the better argument’.1</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><br />
And Traditional Debate techniques represent an epistemological technology that has historically been mobilized as a technique of subjectivization that produces a specific type of person trained in deliberative decision-making and thus capable of governing the world. This opens a field of intervention to transform the world one regime at time. Greene and Hicks Conclude, </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Ronald Walter &amp; Darrin, “LOST CONVICTIONS Debating both sides and the ethical self-fashioning of liberal citizens”, Cultural Studies Vol. 19, No. 1 January, p. 120-21.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>The ethical problematization of debating both sides suggests that the globalization of liberalism is not so much registered by universal norms of interaction as the circulation of techniques required for internalizing a series of ethical attributes conducive to democratic citizenship.</u></span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">Surely debate is not alone in the circulation of liberal attributes, one might suggest that teaching professional journalistic norms of objectivity and balance _/ norms operationalized by the attempt to offer ‘two-sides’ to every political issue _/ offers a functional equivalent to debating both sides. Increasingly, journalistic norms find uptake as a spectacle of partisan spin and the rhetoric of commitment, far away from the ethical pedagogy of debating both sides.</span> <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>A unique value of debating both sides is that it works as a technique of embodied speech performance.</u></span> <span style="font-weight: normal;"><u>To produce a liberal citizen requires more than the presentation of different points of view to a third party, it requires the empathetic advocacy of views that are not one’s own.</u> In a world increasingly dominated by fundamentalism (religious and otherwise) the development of a respect for pluralism, tolerance and free speech remains politically valuable. However, </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>the technical history of cultivating these norms must be evaluated if we might hope to govern ourselves differently</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 14pt; font-weight: normal;"><u>.</u></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"> <u>What this</u></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> paper <u>demonstrates is that debating both sides helps liberalism to produce a governing field between a person’s</u> first order <u>convictions and his/her commitment to the process norms of debate, discussion and persuasion. This field is then managed in and through the alteration of different communicative practices. The production and management of this field of governance allows liberalism to trade in cultural technologies in the global cosmopolitan marketplace at the same time as it creates a field of intervention to transform and change the world one subject (regime) at a time.</u></span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>The ethical problematization of debating both sides pre-figures the transformation of liberalism into a deliberative theory of democracy, one by which, communication becomes the field, instrument and object of cultural governance.</u></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Yet, the complex determinations of instantiating an ethical substance into the deliberative process points to how liberalism attempts to purchase its claim to universality by displacing an investigation into the technical domains of ethical-self fashioning. As such, <u>liberalism’s universal norms circulate in and through specific national and economic histories rewriting its moral geographies by separating those who need the universal norms of liberalism from those exceptional subjects that can embody those norms, judge how well others are inculcating those norms, and can govern the world.</u> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;"><br />
