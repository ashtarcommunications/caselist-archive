<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>PLAN:</strong> The United States federal government should eliminate all of the United States federal government’s devices referred to as nuclear weapons.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>The Overarching specter of nuclear apocalypse traumatically marks us all. Like the citizens of Hiroshima we wait, wondering when the blowback from our empires wars will hit home. The Bomb has already exploded, there is nothing else. Its damage has been strewn backwards in time in the form of perpetual terror.</strong><br />
<strong>Saint-Amour in 2k</strong><br />
(Paul, “Bombing and the symptom: traumatic earliness and the nuclear uncanny”, diacritics 30.4: 59-82)</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The people…restores a conventional temporal </span><br />
<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>The abstract desire to “survive” the bomb displaces the value to life—only a rejection of this nuclear blackmail can maintain meaningful existence.</strong><br />
<strong>Baudrillard in 89</strong><br />
(Jean. Cultural Theorist &amp; Professor @ The European Graduate School<strong>,</strong> America. P.42-43)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Everywhere survival has…l blackmail and life can go on.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>Nuclear weapons represent an ineffective attempt to deal with fear of the other. But terror terrorizes us into being terrorized-- and the cycle never ends.</strong><br />

(Ira, “Nuclear Weapons Are No Cure For American Epidemic Of Fear” Common Dreams, &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0806-05.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.commondreams.org/ views03/0806-05.htm</a>&gt;)</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Then you see the eerie contrast … national life. </span><br />
<br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>In a world of crisis driven politics there is always a new threat, a new looming catastrophe. The WMD harbored by Iran could just as easily be saucer shaped aliens, and the broader the definition of an enemy, the more justifiable destruction becomes. We must resist this illusion of controllable sacrifice.</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">According to Franz Hinkelammert…countries for four years</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>Our scholarship in this round matters—it’s a form of political agency. Our demand opens up new possibilities for action and change</strong><br />

(Pinar, Prof of International Relations, <em>Regional Security in the Middle East</em>, p.58-9)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Emphasising the mutually interactive relationship …constituting ‘threats to the future’</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>Your decision should consider politics as not only a discussion of ends, but means as well. A demand for withdrawal can resist the politics of crises and terror. The refusal to be terrorized shatters the ontological pretexts that underlie the fantasy of fear, destruction, and violence.</strong><br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>Resistance is possible- We must refashion politics to be a struggle to above all peace first.</strong><br />
