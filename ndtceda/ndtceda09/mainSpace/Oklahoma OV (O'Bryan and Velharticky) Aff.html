<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>It has been 18 years since the end of the Cold War. Why is the USFG still prepared to destroy the world at the push of a button?</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Media – Ending of <em>Dr. Strangelove, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb.</em> Directed by Stanley <strong>Kubrick, 1964.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>As witnessed through Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove our culture has absorbed the mushroom cloud into its identity. Even outside the subject of satire, it has become hip, acceptable, and cool. The Mushroom cloud has covered over the genocidal consequences of nuclear war.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Kitsch can be used for both commercial and political purposes. It can be used by any entity to create support for their ideology or policy agenda.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Political kitsch helps the masses cope with traumatic change. It makes real life violent objects – such as the atomic bomb – acceptable by reducing them to distant images and symbols.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>(Show Hiroshima images, and read deterrence cards)</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Our culture does not see the technicalities behind the proliferation and use of the atomic weapon. Only by exposing people to the images and facts that lie beneath the cloud’s veil can we experientially change public perception against the dangerous theory of nuclear deterrence.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> <strong>We must abandon nuclear deterrence. Nuclear deterrence has done nothing to prevent war. There is no justification for continuing to maintain a genocidal nuclear arsenal.</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Furthermore, continued reliance on a nuclear deterrent leads to societal anxiety which necessitates pre-emptive use – the very presence of nuclear weapons creates the conditions for a violent social pathology which incessantly creates enemies to be constructed and destroyed</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Our society has allowed mass destruction to become a normal occurrence within the status quo. We must take our focus off of the kitschy image of the mushroom cloud and look instead to the risks and consequences of continued nuclear war. If we do not put an end to the proliferation of nuclear weapons use then we risk inevitable genocide.</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;"><strong>We affirm: The USFG should end nuclear deterrence by officially committing to a “No-Use” policy.</strong></span>
