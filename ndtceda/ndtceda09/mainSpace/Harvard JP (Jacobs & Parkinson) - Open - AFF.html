 <strong>The counter-interpretation: arsenal is the establishment for the manufacture and storage of weapons</strong><br />
OED 1989<br />
Arsenal: A public establishment for the manufacture and storage, or for the storage alone, of weapons and ammunition of all kinds, for the military and naval forces of the country.<br />

The Oxford Essential Dictionary of the US Military 2001, Encyclopeida.com, 16 Aug 2009<br />
N? 1. A collection of weapons and military equipment sotred by a country, person, or group: Britain’s nuclear arsenal.<br />
2. A place where weapons and military equipment are stored or made.<br />
<br />
<strong>That’s the collection of NNSA nuclear complex sites</strong><br />

<strong>THERE ARE TWO IMPACT SCENARIOS:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>FIRST-U.S. Nuclear Retaliation</strong><br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was not widely reported, but in February… there is in military posturing.</span><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>THE SECOND IMPACT SCENARIO IS-Bluffing</strong><br />
<br />

Currently, <u>the U.S. maintains a position…</u> perhaps <span style="background-color: lime;"><u>overly sensitive to public opinion</u></span>.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>And, a failure to follow through with threatened retaliation would make multiple deterrence failures and collapse of leadership inevitable-bluffing outweighs resolve-best multivariate studies prove</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">If my theory is correct, <span style="background-color: lime;"><u>a reputation for honesty</u></span><u>…</u></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> reputation for resolve also does so.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>CONTENTION THREE IS SOLVENCY</strong> </span><br />

Potential for Destabilizing Reversal….and deeply than U.S. forces.<br />
<br />
This creates three scenarios for nuclear war: accidents, crisis escalation and pre-emption<br />

<br />
The shift in the nuclear balance…the United States (e.g., in Korea).<br />
<br />
And, whether the US intended to threaten Russia is irrelevant—the perception of current nuclear primacy increases the risk of great power wars, crisis escalation, and accidental nuclear war<br />
<br />
Schwartz 2006 (Benjamin, literary editor and the national editor of The Atlantic, “The Perils of Primacy,” The Atlantic Monthly, Jan/Feb, The Agenda)<br />
<br />
To be sure., America's emerging … scrutiny and debate to begin.<br />
<br />
Russia-U.S. nuclear war escalates-only scenario for extinction<br />
<br />
Nick Bostrom, PhD and Professor at Oxford, March, 2002 www.transhumanist.com/volume9/risks.html<br />
<br />
A much greater existential…humankind’s potential permanently.<br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY-Russia models U.S. dismantlement rates-fear of U.S. breakout capability precludes Russian dismantlement creating multiple scenarios for nuclear theft<br />
<br />
Jon Wolfsthal, deputy director for Non-Proliferation at Carnegie, 3 April 2002 (Nuclear Terrorism and Warhead Control in Russia, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=946" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=946</a>)<br />
<br />
The catch is that, if…early stages of deployment.<br />
<br />
And, Russian nuclear security is a joke – weapons are highly vulnerable to terrorist theft<br />
<br />
Allison, 2004 (Graham, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Prof of Government at Harvard, former assistance Sec. Of Defense for policy, Nuclear Terrorism, p. 9-10)<br />
<br />
The imminence of this threat…know that I don't know.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Moreover, lax security means transporting a nuclear weapon would be easy<br />
<br />
Allison, ‘4 (Graham, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Prof of Government at Harvard, former assistance Sec. Of Defense for policy, Nuclear Terrorism, p. 10-11)<br />
<br />
Third, terrorists would not … smuggle in a nuclear bomb.&quot;<br />
<br />
BUT-Dismantling retired weapons would solve:<br />
<br />
First-Upload Potential.<br />
The massive backlog of nuclear weapons awaiting dismantlement gives the U.S. an unparalleled upload potential for massive and rapid arsenal breakout.<br />
<br />
Bukharin 2002 [Oleg Bukharin Research Scientist at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School “A Breakdown of Breakout” Arms Control Association October 2002]<br />
<br />
Despite Russia’s larger … of concern to the Russians.<br />
<br />
Settling the upload would lay the ground work for resolving all nuclear reduction disputes.<br />
<br />
Ria Novosti 2009 (“An in-depth look at the Russian press,” 4-22, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Russia ready for nuclear…seriously complicate the talks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Second-Arms control.<br />
As long as the U.S. maintains thousands of weapons in storage to be dismantled status quo reductions in arsenal size are little more than changes in paperwork.<br />
<br />
Jim McBride, Morris News Service, 20 October 2006 (Nuclear Security Administration proposes wider role for Pantex, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/102006/sta_102006110.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/102006/sta_102006110.shtml</a>)<br />
<br />
The NNSA wants to keep… in the warheads themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately, accelerating dismantlement would boost our arms control credibility, assuaging fears of a new arms race.<br />
<br />
Walter Pincus, WPost Staff Writer, 4 May 2006 (U.S. to Step Up Disassembly of Older Nuclear Warheads, washington post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050302136.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050302136.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Members of Congress have been…in the last few years.&quot;<br />
<br />
That’s key to prevent multiple scenarios for nuclear escalation<br />
<br />
Blank 2009 (Stephen J, Strategic Studies Institute’s expert on the Soviet bloc and the post- Soviet world since 1989 “RUSSIA AND ARMS CONTROL: ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION?,” March, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf</a>.)<br />
<br />
Even if one is skeptical … if not nuclear proliferation.<br />
<br />
Third-Transparency.<br />
Now is a key time-Russia is cautiously optimistic about trusting Obama; future U.S. actions are key to build confidence<br />
<br />
Russia Today 1 April 2009 (Cool Russian Optimism towards USA, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://russiatoday.com/Politics/2009-04-11/Cool_Russian_optimism_towards_USA.html" rel="nofollow">http://russiatoday.com/Politics/2009-04-11/Cool_Russian_optimism_towards_USA.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Moscow is optimistic about… said the Russian Foreign Minister.<br />
<br />
And, a fulfilling dismantlement obligations would solve Russian perception of verification and U.S. implementation of arms reductions<br />
<br />
William Perry and Brent Scowcroft et al. 2009 (Former Secretary of Defense U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy under Nixon and Ford and Former Secretary of Defense Under Clinton, Council on Foreign Relations Task Force Report No. 62, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/pbei/cfr/0016410/f_0016410_14193.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/pbei/cfr/0016410/f_0016410_14193.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
A proper assessment of progress…setting an international standard.<br />
<br />
The plan solves: backlogs contribute to a perception of covert arms racing; accelerating the rate of dismantlement reassures other powers<br />
<br />
Thomas D'Agostino, director NNSA, 9 May 2007 (The Reliable Replacement Warhead and the Future of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Program, Remarks at National Defense University, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bits.de/NRANEU/docs/speech_DAgostino_NDUHillBreakfastSeries-09May07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bits.de/NRANEU/docs/speech_DAgostino_NDUHillBreakfastSeries-09May07.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Our near-term strategy includes…programs of North Korea and Iran.<br />
<br />
FORTUNATELY-creating a smaller more credible arsenal is able to walk the line between reassuring allies and dissuading potential nuclear adversaries<br />
<br />
William Perry 2009 (Former Secretary of Defense U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy under Clinton, America's Strategic Posture, United States Institute of Peace Press, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usip.org/files/America's_Strategic_Posture_Auth_Ed.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.usip.org/files/America's_Strategic_Posture_Auth_Ed.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
President Obama has stated… only as a defensive last resort.<br />
<br />
FINALLY, only dismantling nuclear weapons solves-the plan is necessary to reassure adversaries and allies of the benign yet credible U.S. arsenal and ensure that nuclear accounting errors won’t continue<br />
<br />
Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, 2 May 2007 (Estimates of the US Nuclear Weapons Stockpile, FAS Strategic Security Blog, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/05/estimates_of_us_nuclear_weapon.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/05/estimates_of_us_nuclear_weapon.php</a>)<br />

Dismantling the nearly 4,900… about US long-term intentions.
