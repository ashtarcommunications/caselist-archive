The last fifty years have seen a move to the latest phase of capitalism which allows a more intense and definitive extermination of the periphery through the production of the ultimate means of destruction in our time, nuclear weapons.<br />
Kato, 1993<br />
The vigorous invasion of the logic… Nations almost on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
The current intellectual terrain of the nuclear landscape does not hold a space for those who already experience the ongoing violence of nuclear weapons. Our remapping of the nuclear terrain is an attempt to escape the current globalists techno-strategic discourse that may find ways to reject the idea of nuclear weapons, but would still in the end only result in a world that continues to ignore and exterminate the periphery. Our 1ac is pre-requisite to any discussions about the nuclear process. Absent a remapping of the nuclear landscape debates from our current locality would only continue the ideological reification of the violence.<br />
Kato, 1993<br />
Let us probe further into… Third World, Fourth World, and Indigenous Peoples.<br />
<br />
Our affirmation is an attempt to remap the nuclear landscape of debate by inserting into the debate over nuclearism an alternative way of seeing the landscape. Our affirmation is flying the flag of “Support Shashone Land Rights” Kuletz, 1998 <em>The Tainted Desert</em><br />
Despite tensions, marginal spaces…the view from Yucca Mountain.<br />
<br />
Our remapping the nuclear landscape opens up intellectual space for escaping the ideology of deterritoriality which is locked into a false sense of inevitable destruction for the periphery because of the desire for continued advancement of industrialization. Our affirmation is proof that it is not inevitable, but a path people choose to take.<br />
Kuletz, 1998 <em>The Tainted Desert</em><br />
Naming and mapping the nuclear landscape…as a form of cultural imperialism.<br />
<br />
We affirm the resolution:<br />
“Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or restrict the role and missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal” …. in an attempt to remap the nuclear landscape bound within the resolution.<br />
<br />
Our affirmation is an attempt to forge that productive link between the struggles of the periphery that requires an abandonment of discourses rooted in technosubjectivity.<br />

Plan: The missions utilizing the United States federal government's nuclear arsenal should be reduced to zero.<br />

&quot;The American mission in Saigon........ruled and exploited the Vietnamese people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons have changed warfare from practice to doctrine. The emphasis on perception and process defined not only how wars would be fought, but also the horizon of international politics and social lives in general. In a world where war is omnicide, we are all living according to nuclear doctrine.<br />

(Rey, Andrew W. Mellon. Professor of the Humanities and Professor of Modern Culture and Media Studies, Comparative Literature, and English, The Age of the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative Work, Duke University Press, pg 33-34)<br />
&quot;The dropping of the atomic bomb....visibility and control&quot;<br />
<br />
America is a way of thinking which reduces the Earth and all within it to an end of calculation, placed aside on standing reserve, disposable. The American end of history discourse in the post cold war era represents the interregnum.<br />
Spanos 00<br />
William V., America's Shadow, pg 191-193<br />
&quot;The euphoric annunciation....tasks not impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
U.S. nuclear weapons policy is designed to foster control, not of international politics, but of global ideology. Our nucleaar policy defines certain things as worthy goals, like safety and security, but does so at the exclusion of glabal environmental, economic, and social/humanitarian needs. These now-invisible costs are mounting toward a global crisis making wa and irreversible environmental damage inevitable.<br />

(Rey, Andrew W. Mellon. Professor of the Humanities and Professor of Modern Culture and Media Studies, Comparative Literature, and English, The Age of the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative Work, Duke University Press, pg 30-33)<br />
&quot;Wherever we have the world picture...level of visibility&quot;<br />
<br />
Current attempts to create a peaceful global order are draped in a rational and benign garb which depoliticize the violent knowledge production inherent in the creation of the world as a mere object to be organized in accordance to enlightened principles.<br />

&quot;Once the relations among........rational story&quot;<br />

The ontologic of America is to genocide anything that does not surrender to its ordering.<br />

&quot;Vietnam, we've all been there.........and thus to its universal authority&quot;<br />
<br />
The nuclear predicament can only be understood in terms of ontology- it's a necessary prerequisite to any understanding of the current condition.<br />
Santoni 85<br />
(Prof of Philosophy Denison. Ronald Nuclear War Philosophical Perspectives pg 153-154)<br />
&quot;The origins of the arms race... means the extinction of all life&quot;<br />
<br />
The attempt to secure our world leads to an endless spiral of violence- only prioritizing ontology can remedy violence.<br />
