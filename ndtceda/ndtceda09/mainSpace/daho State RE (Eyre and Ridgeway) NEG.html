Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense during much of the Vietnam war, once wrote: &quot;we can now understand these catastrophes for what they were: essentially the product of a failure of imagination&quot;. The 1AC's sterilized imagination of a world without violence perpetuates a dream of harmony that represses fundamental aspects of our psyche. Problems can not be solved at the same level of thinking that created them. Their refusal to confront the inherently violent aspects of human nature ensure that these parts of our humanity will manifest themselves in even greater atrocities. Hillman continues...<br />

<br />
The affirmative can not be characterized as the elimination of weapons. Policies will never be passed, nuclear weapons will never be dismantled. War is an inherent part of the human condition. It is archetypal. We love this part of us, this panic, this madness, something inside us revels in the midst of destruction, this love of live made stronger in the throes of eath. We are born to war, born with chaos and carnage inside. This is a pattern of behavior that stretches across the whole of human history; a fire in the human soul that can not be extinguished. Hillman writes...<br />

<br />
The anti-nuclear imaginings of the 1AC is another way for sovereignty to create a new, benign warfare justified by the principles of anti-weapons rhetoric. The 1AC reinforces values that become the new basis for humanitarian warfare. Hillman writes that &quot;our hatred of war makes us use violence even against war itself. Wanting to put a stop to it was a major cause of...Truman's decision to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a bomb to 'save lives', a bomb to end bombs&quot;. Repressing the desire for war only erupts in the delusional use of war, it makes it more violent and dominating. Only by coming to to see war as thinkable and by entering into it can we break the delusion of war waged in the name of peace. Hillman explains...<br />

<br />
We need war. It fills our lives with meaning; the mundane can not coexist with the terror of war, it vanishes, washed away by the adrenaline and blood and screams of battle and in that instant we love our lives more deeply and completely than we ever thought we could. Hillman elaborates...<br />

<br />
Rather than trying to overcome ourselves in the world, rather than trying to solve a problem of our humanness, we must investigate the origins and impulses and foundations of war to come to a better understanding of our own primordial and archetypal connection to war. This is the only way to solve nuclear war.<br />

<br />
The 1AC is an example of how their imaginations actually play out. We make the world through our imaginations, which weuse to suppress or justify archetypal desires. The case is just a sympathetic narrative meant to soothe troublesome aspects of the psyche. If we want to truly understand our relationship to the phenomenon of warfare we must use our imagination to aesthetisize war; to realize the romanticism of battle, to acknowledge our love affair with violence. James Hillman writes...<br />

<br />
The question remains: which is better psychologically? Acceptance or repression? Our argument is that repression fails. Instead of fearing weapons, we should recognize our obsession with them; we should enter into our love with them. Hillman explains...<br />

<br />
The alternative is to EMBRACE WAR, ENTER INTO IT. Pacifist horror must be set aside. We must engage in war, not in the name of peace, but for the sake of war itself. When we gaze across the battlefield, across the carnage, the death and decay and destruction, we recognize the feelings these sights stir inside of us as what they are: a love of war.<br />

<br />
The 1AC's condemnation of nuclear weapons is characteristic of repressed nuclearism--their refusal to confront their desire to experience the bomb ensures new and more violent modes of nuclear politics.<br />
<br />
Chaloupka, '92 (Knowing Nukes: The Politics and Culture of the Atom, William Chaloupka, professor of political science at the University of Montana, pg. 61-63)<br />
<br />
There's a fascination with the bomb underneath the surface of their fear--this repressed infatuation with nuclear weapons makes nuclear suicide inevitable. Only by exploring this fascination; by changing the context within which we understand nuclear weapons, can we hope to avert our own impending destruction.<br />
