 One – the K <br />
1NC <br />
The 1AC is the classic debate metaphysics of attempting to reduce as many effects to as few causes as possible by establishing the essential properties of agents through the assignation of particular characteristics of motivation. This reliance on pre-established reductionist theories of reality make their explanations of the world useless for policy and likely to produce more harm than good <br />
Srnicek 10 “conflicting networks” Journal of critical globalization studies issue 2 <br />
“this leads us to the issue of interactions … interacts with the local”<br />
<br />
The 1Ac constructs causual attractors as transcendent deterministic telelogies through the framing of status quo inevitability of conflict. This fails to recognize that those causes themselves are contingent productions of complexity, overlooking the systemic processes that constitute discreete identities such as nation-states or foreign military establishments in the first place and which inform their courses of action more than the properities or stated motivation upon which the 1ac claims rely on <br />
Srnicek 10 “conflicting networks” Journal of critical globalization studies issue 2 <br />
The actual is perhaps the simplest … that we turn now.<br />
<br />
This argument mistakenly assumes an artificial distinction between theory and political praxis. Our analysis of how the owlrd works represents a condition of possibility for understanding the world as immanently negotiable and thus clears a path through causal determnism for social change <br />
Srnicek 10 “conflicting networks” Journal of critical globalization studies issue 2 <br />
With our overvoew of assemblages… avoid this hindrance<br />
<br />
<br />
The practice of reading impact cards is itself a form of falsely imposed order: each impact card is an abstract relation which attempts to characterize the production of conflict around certain immutable conditions which guarantee its production. This khalizad card is sa metaphor for a different instances of conflict that can be produced from the same essential conditions, that’s why people keeep reading it year after year as if nothing has changed in the world because the same bare causal elements of possibility of a faulure or credibility of the US global military deployments can still be conceived o as a trigger for conflict. This causal essentialism prevents close analysis of the immanent dymanics that produce conflict as unique historical contingencies <br />
Srnicek 10 “conflicting networks” Journal of critical globalization studies issue 2 <br />
A macro-functionalist analysis would see… within their own particular boundaries<br />
<br />
<br />
The 21ac recapitulates the age old mistake of understanding political causality as a stable, linear series of events rather than the emergent phenomena of a complex system. Their focus on grand narrative schemes as the predictable causes for catastrophic geopolitical events ignore their non-linear production of those events outside of the anticipate drealm of narratively structured causes. This oracular hubris makes the advantage claims of the 1AC little more than worthless media coverage- even policy debate’s America Key supercrush Niall Ferguson agrees<br />

Policy or qritqal as debaters we are a community of researchers and our ciriticms calls into question the connection between researched information and actual reality. Oir alternatives engagement with the onotology of complexity is necessary to reframe our approach to prpblems ot allow our theories to quickly change not absed on the falsely essential properties of discree immitable entities (nation states, terrorist groups etc) but informed by the complex processes that give rise to those entities. Current conceptual formulae are unable to accommodate complexity: the conceptual transformation si macropolitical make or break<br />

Organized warfare is a form of non-linear chaos: only explanations that take the relations of chaotic elements in a system into account will be able to properly analyze conflict scenarios<br />
Weeks 1 “chaos complexity and conflict”<br />
If one can agree that the concept of warfare… so we will not do it here. <br />
<br />
Link extension – the 1ac causal focus on human intentions obscures the way that htose intentions are formed by complex systemic interactions with material objects and the way that technical capacity limits and enables what they perceive as ‘choice’<br />
