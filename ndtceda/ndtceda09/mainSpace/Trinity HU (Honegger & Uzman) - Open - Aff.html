 <strong>Our universities have been colonized, allowing inaction in the face of genocide. False rationalizations about the infallibility of our leaders and our reliance on nuclear weapons allow militarized myths to pervade academia, becoming truths. We deflect our complicity in weapons production, because we reason that we cannot PERSONALLY change the militarized landscape of academia. This inaction only makes nuclear weapons use more likely.</strong><br />
