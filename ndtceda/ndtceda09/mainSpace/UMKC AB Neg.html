Furthermore, that system makes true peace impossible – ongoing violence has already been discounted as inevitable simply because it falls outside of the traditional state apparatus<br />

Additionally, structural violence poses a much greater threat to our security than traditional war; the deaths each year are equivalent to more than a hundred nuclear detonations<br />

Capitalism 1NC<br />
Violence and antagonism in the socio-political is inevitable – at the center of all of our interpretations for the world and facile means of finding our reason for being there is a lack. Rather than confront it the human psyche chooses to cover it up or attempt to eliminate it. This disturbance is itself violence.<br />

Global capitalism proliferates with the expansion and support of the war on terror and the identification of “rogue” states that threaten international order. The affirmatives participation in this process results in endless war and domination of the third world by military and economic restructuring organizations.<br />

K turns and outweighs the case the justification for Nuclear Weapons existence is grounded in global class struggle. This has been the basis of every major conflict in the 20th century. Even if reductions occur they would be hijacked by capital as leverage to exploit other nations and provide new opportunities for capitalist expansion only the alternative can solve.<br />
