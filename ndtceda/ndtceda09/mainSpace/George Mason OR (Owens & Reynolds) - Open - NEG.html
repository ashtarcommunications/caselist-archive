Pandora’s box has been opened- nuclear weapons and their magic are<br />
here to stay- even in a world of disarm- ability to re-arm and<br />
mistrust will still exist<br />

A nation that wishes..... to seek nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Violence is an inevitable part of our psyche, any attempt to remove it<br />
is absurd. Violence on an international level is beyond our scope as<br />
individuals to control; the only thing we can do is seek to limit its<br />
role.<br />

<br />
Nuclear weapons uniquely change the psychological terrain of violence<br />
and war; the non-adaptability of nukes is the only thing that can<br />
restrain our collective pre-disposition towards violence- and prevent<br />
the Avada Kedavra curse of humanity.<br />

2NC Deterrence K Cards<br />
( ) We have a moral obligation to step away from the politically correct antinuclear policies. Now is the key time to recognize the necessary protection provided by nuclear deterrence. Nukes deter massive conventional wars.<br />

<br />
That’s right. You and those you love are… your deterrent, now would be a good time to say so.<br />
<br />
Lets look at the numbers- simple strategies with modern conventional weapons can- and have- wreaked havoc well beyond a nuclear attack. Also- how many people have died from nuclear weapons? 200’000? And conventional? Oh, 216 million.<br />
