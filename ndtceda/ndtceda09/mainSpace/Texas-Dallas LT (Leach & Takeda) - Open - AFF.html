<strong>We begin this discussion of nuclear weapons with the reading of a familiar childhood artifact which acts as a metaphor for the contemporary problem of nuclear weapons. This is from Dr. Seuss’s The Butter Battle Book, originally published in 1984…</strong><br />
<br />
[Theodore Seuss <strong>Geisel</strong>, The Butter Battle Book, Random House, 19<strong>84</strong>, available online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.angelfire.com/tn2/minsrecipes/ChildrensCookBookNook/ButterBattle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/tn2/minsrecipes/ChildrensCookBookNook/ButterBattle.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
On the last day of summer,<br />
Ten hours before fall,<br />
…<br />
“Be patient,” said Grandpa.<br />
“We’ll see. We will see…”<br />
<br />
<strong>Like the boys in the back room in the Butter Battle, nuclear discourse in the United States is founded on the imperialist urge to dominate. This nuclear imperialism is rooted in the technostrategic discourse whose homogenizing view leads to the destruction of difference and legitimates exploitation. This view marginalizes alternative forms of knowing and informs the entirety of American culture.</strong> <strong>The debate community is part and parcel with this system of exclusion as debate arguments and research practices create a false sense of omnipotence about global politics – this vision is predicated on a uniquely western vantage point that continues the suppression of difference</strong><br />

As I have argued, </span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><u>the objectification of Earth from the absolute…discourse, recapture the classic teleological narrative of the linear &quot;progression&quot; of capitalism</u></span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Unraveling technostrategic discourse is vital not only to resist the closing of political discourse and the extermination of the periphery, but also to reformulating debate and debate research practice. We must resist both policy experts’ narrowing of global space and time and the debate community’s neautralization of space space through the technosubjectivization of the globe which is predicated on a belief in western omnipotence</strong><br />

“Be patient,” said Grandpa.<br />
“We’ll see. We will see…”<br />
<br />
<br />
Like the world Dr. Suess creates in the Butter Battle, the ending of the nuclear age is still open, but also loaded. Although a nuclear shoot-out has not yet occurred, it hangs over us as an ever-present possibility. As long as nuclear weapons remain a part of our security policy, they will pose a threat to human survival and the earth’s ecosystem – reconceptualizing our relationship to nuclear weapons and to warfare is key to undermining the social systems that perpetuate the risk of nuclear war<br />
<br />
Lifton &amp; Falk ’82 [Richard, Professor of Psychology @ City University in NY, Jay, Professor of Politics at Princeton, The Indefensible Weapons.]<br />
<br />
If moderate postures (that is, as a weaponry of ultimate recourse …prospect of a major military defeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, these social systems are propped up by strategic nuclear discourse and the securitizing ideology of deterrence, creating a worldview that makes nuclear extinction inevitable.<br />
Hilgartner, Bell and O'Connor ‘82<br />
<br />
[Stephen, Associate Professor and Chair of Science &amp; Technology Studies @ Cornell, Richard C, Rory, Nukespeak: Nuclear Language, Visions and Mindset, 1982 p 209]<br />
The world of nuclear warfare…all the hostages will be destroyed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This securitization seeps into all aspects of life through deterrence, manifesting as a total warfare in which all knowledge is colonized by war preparedness. Technical expertise and weapons modernization only magnify the problem, because they require increasingly advanced and destructive technology, which in turn requires greater militarization of the scientific sector<br />
