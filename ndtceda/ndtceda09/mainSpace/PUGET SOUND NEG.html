<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">FRAMEWORK</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />
A. Interpretation: Debate should be a site for contest over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a predictable plan of action and defends that their policy should be adopted by the USFG.<br />
Our interpretation is the most predictable given the wording of the resolution.<br />
1. The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon—the USFG is the<br />
agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters<br />
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing 2k<br />
Use of a colon…colon with a capital letter.<br />
<br />
2. Resolved proves the framework for the resolution is to enact a policy.<br />
Words and Phrases 1964 Permanent Edition<br />
Definition of the word “resolve,” given by Webster is “to express an opinion or determination by<br />
resolution or vote;… by Bouvier as meaning “to establish by law”.<br />
<br />
3. ‘Should’ denotes an expectation the aff will be enacted.<br />
American Heritage Dictionary 2k<br />
Used to express probability or expectation<br />
<br />
4. The USFG is the government in Washington D.C.<br />
Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2k <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://encarta.msn.com" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com</a><br />
“The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington DC”<br />
<br />
C. Our interpretation is better -<br />
1. Ground - the aff will always win that the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract—we can only debate the merits of their framework if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Carr professor of human rights at Harvard, 2k4 Lesser Evils p. 20-1<br />
As for moral perfectionism, this would be the doctrine that a liberal state.... thus respect for one right might lead us to betray another.<br />
<br />
And, without predictable ground debate becomes meaningless and produces a political strategy wedded to violence that fails to achieve productive change<br />
Shively, Prof Politics at Tx A&amp;M, 2k4 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p 182)<br />
The point may seem trite, as surely the ambiguists would agree that basic terms …Such agreements are simply implicit in the act of argumentation.<br />
<br />
4. Grammar – our reading of the resolution is the only predictable way to develop an interpretation because it is based off of grammatical rules and definitions. Grammar is the only way to prevent arbitrarily limited and unpredictable interpretations.<br />
<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness and jurisdiction.<br />
It comes before all other arguments in the round because we shouldn’t be<br />
forced to develop a strategy against non topical cases.<br />
<br />
The fairness of the affirmative’s advocacy must precede consideration of its<br />
merits or else all contestation is meaningless<br />
Shively, Prof Politics at Tx A&amp;M, 2k4 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p 180)<br />
The ambiguists must say &quot;no&quot; to—they must reject and limit—….. In other words, ontestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
