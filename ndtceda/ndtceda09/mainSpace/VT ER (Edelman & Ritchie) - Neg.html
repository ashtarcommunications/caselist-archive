<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">A. Our argument is that the Affirmative is grounded in a notion of security that is nothing more than nihilism. We need to first evaluate the ontological and epistemological dimensions of this concept that warrants the Affirmative claims. The Aff’s reliance on causality and the reason of political science is saturated with fear of the unknown. This worldview strips life of its value and and posits security as an unproblematic, self-perpetuating truism.<br />

B. Life is interpretive… it’s all a series of illusions… the problem with nihilism is that its practitioners portend that the illusion can produce or reflect truth or reality. This act is life-negating… an expression of </span><span style="font-family: Times;"><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">ressentiment</span></em></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> against chaos. There is no ethics in a world where we negate life to survive.<br />

<br />
C. All of the Aff’s impact claims about widespread destruction, and even the possibility of extinction, are links. Independently, this turns the case because the logic of security produces the threat of extinction in the first place… In other words, as long as we rely on the logic of the Aff, extinction is inevitable.<br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">Using the term “nuclear weapons” has two consequences: 1) it strengthens a discourse that makes the aff’s impacts inevitable; and 2) excludes the possibility of abolition, granting “nuclear things” a role in global power politics. Changing the language of the Affirmative opens the possibility for complete abolition.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;">Refocusing the debate on nuclear atrocity through the language we use is key to preventing those atrocities, which would cause extinction.<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;">Using terms such as nuclear things solves the case and the net benefit – reframing nuclear things as useless changes the power perspective of the object.

<span style="display: block; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; text-align: left;">Our arguments will be about the confluence of the Aff, the topic, and debate culture.<br />
We live and debate in a culture obsessed with speed. The exploding nuclear weapon is a sign that ushers in great peril; it confronts us with the idea that, in an instant, life on the planet could cease to exist. It is a limit experience whose manifestation initiates and perpetuates the advancement of real-time technologies to keep up with the obsolescence that the bomb has forced on our language.<br />
We are confronting the very end of time itself, and the bomb is the crude signal of what may come. But we should treat the bomb and its explosion as just a sign. That’s all it really is in debate. We understand that our language and our activity lack the sophistication and position to actually avert a nuclear war, so we simulate it. And as we simulate it, we demonstrate the way that the economy of speed (initiated by nuclear weapons) permeates all aspects of life. We push for the Wiki to be updated and archived, so we can instantly react. Tournaments use the CAT system; we get pairings in email on our phones; judges submit online ballots. People flow in Excel to make the written transcript as complete and seamless as possible. But flowing is just keeping up with speed. Many people spread to win. They launch as much offense as possible to overwhelm counterattacks. And now we’re trending to paperless debating… where the archive meets delivery; where judge philosophies sometimes offer no mercy for file transfers that exceed or steal prep time. And the topic is nuclear weapons!… the ideal fusion of technical nuclear policy with debate impacts. This is not just about “going fast” or about who’s winning the arms race of research… this is about speed as a temporality… a way of being. In this framework, the only relevant impact lies in our refusal to recognize this cultural turn and consider its risk.<br />

Junger’s quasi-hegelian… … thus political transformations.<br />
<br />
We think that the debate round presents a unique opportunity to rupture the economy of speed… to let go of the idea that we can manage the future or prevent the past from repeating itself. We choose to accept the impossibility and contingency of the future. Consider the Negative to be that which comes in advance of change. There is an important difference between a programmed future (where people contend that the need for change and resolving the future must be paramount) and a future which is “to come”… We think programmatic futures foreclose contingency and are the engine of the liberal-capitalist mission of the West. The danger in this speed-centric evolution is that it threatens to eradicate the conditions of possibility for being human… it destroys the very possibility of democracy and justice. The Negative in this debate is the anticipation of change… the eschewing of calculated and visible change … We think programmatic change flattens time and space, positioning them as a grid on which action is possible… and we rupture its seamlessness… we are not resistance, but rather its possibility.<br />
