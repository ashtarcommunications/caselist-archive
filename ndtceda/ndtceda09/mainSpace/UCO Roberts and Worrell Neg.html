<strong>Native Struggle is first priority to all other social issues. The argument that natives were sexist or racist or militaristic is non-responsive. They are much better than their oppressor could ever be.<br />

<strong>The impact of our argument is more than just the fear of the continuation of our loss of culture and genocide. The collective survival of all life on the planet is at stake with our alternative.<br />

<br />
<strong>The epistemic memory of America has been impaired- the spectre of the annihilation of Native Americans has haunted our memories until recently when it was believed that our memory was corrected because of the focus defeat of the Nazi's and the Vietnamese. This forgetting has allowed for genocidal violence to be conducted on the spectral other for centuries and that makes spectral violence inevitable.<br />

Ward Churchill<br />
<br />
We must embrace the call for impossible realism of the US off the planet as a first priority. In order to call for liberation from the colonial yoke of Imperialist thought we must start by decolonizing our own minds. To challenge imperialism abroad we must start be challenging our imperialism here at home. It is the call to return the land which allows for the imagining of liberation of those who fall victim to the illegally occupied power of the US. Any form of social change is impossible in a world in a world in which we allow for the colonization of Natives to continue.<br />

 Politics as the affirmative understands it and responds to it does not exist. Modernity’s emphasis on technology and speed has destroyed a traditional understanding of the locus of politics which now takes place in the sphere of communication itself.

Consequently, there is no way for us to generate stable and predictable offense. Without plan focus, they would always leverage an artificial ground advantage—even if there are impact turns to the critiques, we should not have to be prepared to run them against their aff; and, in any case, they will always be better prepared to debate their own unpredictable drivel than we will.</strong></span></span><br />
