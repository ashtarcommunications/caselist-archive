Plan Text: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce and restrict the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal by adopting a policy of nuclear no first use.<br />
<br />
Advantage: Nuclearism<br />
<br />
Underview: Speed Bad<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation One: Inherency</strong><br />
1. The dramatic end to the cold war in the late 20th century erased the notion of possible global nuclear destruction from our collective consciousness. For most American citizens Hiroshima and Nagasaki are ancient, the Cuban missile crisis is the subject of a popular movie, and Dr. Strangelove is not and has never been an accurate portrayal of high level government policy.<br />
These assumptions are perilously inaccurate. Several countries still posses the capability to destroy all life on the planet and many of them, (the US included) maintain a right of Nuclear First Use, or the right to use nuclear weapons as an offensive weapon of war.<br />
Mendelson 2006. “Delegitimizing Nuclear Weapons”<br />
2. Such a policy elevates nuclear weapons to the heart of our national security strategy necessitating a continued reliance on them blocking th path to global disarmament.<br />
Mendelson 2006. “Delegitimizing Nuclear Weapons”<br />
3. The concept of Nuclear Umbrella is only a mask for the genocidal system perpetuated by nuclearism.<br />
Lifton and Markusen 1999. Genocidal Mentality<br />
4. This approach has come to be called Nuclearism. Such an ideology implies a fetishistic worship of nuclear weapons that serves to mask their destructive implications and human costs.<br />
Lifton and Markusen 1999. Genocidal Mentality<br />
<br />
Plan Text: Thus we propose the following plan: the USFG should substantially reduce and restrict the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal by adopting a policy of nuclear no first use.<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation two: Harms</strong><br />
1. The view of nuclearists is bad.<br />
KRIEGER 2000.<br />
2. Psychic Numbing is inherent I both nuclearism and the genocidal mindset.<br />
Nandy 1998. The Epidemic of Nuclearism.<br />
3. Nuclearism deprives life of meaning<br />
Nandy 1998. The Epidemic of Nuclearism.<br />
4. The violence of nuclearism is the most destructive of our time. Such violence is not limited to the domain of international nuclear policy- it infests all aspects of our social and political existence, making genocidal violence imminent.<br />
Lifton 1995.<br />
5. Most insidiously nuclearism locks humanity into a perpetual state of fear and anxiety making a truly ethical politics impossible<br />
Lifton 2001 Illusions of the Second Nuclear Age<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Three: Solvency</strong><br />
1. An explicit nuclear no first use policy would resolve the inherent contradictions of US nuclear posture and enable a global shift away from the dominant nuclearist mindset<br />
Mendelson 2006. Deligitimizing Nuclear Weapons.<br />
2. Governmental actinoa affirm he desirability of a world without nuclear weapons and take incremental steps to attain that goal will serve to begin a trasition away from the dominant nuclearist mindset that will ultimately produce a world free of nuclear weapons.<br />
Kissenger 2009. Our Nuclear Nightmare.<br />
3. This will give rise to a new global consciousness that will replace nuclearist rationality and turn enemies into friends.<br />
Lifton 1990. The Genocidal Mentality.<br />
4. To some, this approach may seem like an apology for the status quo nuclearist practices. However, we need to remember that no effective resolution takes hols instantaneously. Pragmatic political strategy- like the one embodied by the plan- is the most effective way <strong>to move society form the way it <em>is</em> to the way it <em>ought</em> to be.</strong><br />
<br />
Kampelman 2006. We should, So we Can: Life Without the Bomb<br />
<br />
5. Rethinking the role of nucvlear weapons in our society is necessary, but insuffiecient- such an approach must be coupled with incremental and institutional reforms like the plan in order to achieve a world without nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Daalder &amp; Lodal 2008. The Logic of Zero.<br />
6. Critique of nuclear weapons resucues reason from the clutches of the technocratic state- we should not accept the instrumental ratinoalisty behind their legitimacy.<br />
Kovel 1983. Against the State of Nuclear Terror.<br />
7. Recognition of the threat of nuclear weapons unites people in a vital social act and compels an important recognition of the value of humanity.<br />
<br />
