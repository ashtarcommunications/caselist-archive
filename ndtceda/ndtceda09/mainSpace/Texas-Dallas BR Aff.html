2ac second strike pic<br />
other countries would have to assume second strike counterforce would be used for first strike counterforce- force structures are perceived by foreign governments<br />
Stephen Cimbala 1994 “Military persuasion: deterrence and provocation in crisis and war”<br />
It is also possible…as opposed to others.<br />
2nd strike implies first strike undermines crisis stab<br />
Marc Trachtenberg “History and Strategy” p38 1991<br />
What did all this amount to?...the problem of stability<br />
Perception is that capability is a self fulfilling prophecy and making trust impossible<br />
Jack Snyder “The origins of offense and the consequences of counterforce” p 183<br />
A second approach is Sagans…to avoid feeling such fears<br />
Zero practical difference between the CP and the SQuo maintaining second strike counterforce risks disarming preemption<br />
Robert C Aldridge 1983 “First strike: the pentagons strategy for nuclear war”<br />
More importantly, despite all the talk…launch a preemptive first strike.<br />

Yet should a leader choose…under effective international verification<br />
Winners win<br />
Mark Pascal 10-5-09 “Obamas only priority get reelected”<br />
Many political leaders incorrectly…dissipate valuable political capital<br />
Try or die<br />
Julian Borger 9-23-09 “Obama pledges cuts in the nuclear arsenal”<br />
Obama has just said…These are strong words.<br />
