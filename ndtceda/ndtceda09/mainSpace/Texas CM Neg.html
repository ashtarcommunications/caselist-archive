<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>“The Haunting” Hiroshima K</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We begin with a fragment of memory FROM AUGUST 1945…<br />
A person was stripped of skin... In the eyes of these individuals, the names of those responsible for the war have not yet been disclosed)&quot;<br />
[story from Matsuda, a hibakusha, found in Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p.127-130]<br />
<br />
That comes from the testimony of a Hiroshima witness named Matsuda. It is excerpted from a book that tells the story of a man who refused to stop talking about Hiroshima. Matsuda’s story reflects his rage as he slowly died over decades from the after-effects of Hiroshima. The powerful rage of his memory continues to haunt his audiences, provoking powerful reflections on life and death, war and peace.<br />
<br />
Yoneyama, Associate Professor of Japanese Studies &amp; Cultural Studies @ UCSD, 1999<br />
[Lisa, Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p. 132-135]<br />
These reactions suggest...through what I experienced.&quot;<br />
<br />
We have turned away from hiroshima to contemplate the apocalype. we find it easier to conceive of nuclear weapons through the lens of massive nuclear conflict than confont the meaning of our grandparents’ crimes. it is precisely because of this reluctance that we must return to hiroshima.<br />
Foard, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Arizona State University, 1997<br />
[James A., “Imagining Nuclear Weapons: Hiroshima, Armageddon, and the Annihilation of the Students of Ichijo, School Journal of the Amencan Academy of Religion ]<br />
From virtually the moment that Americans... a cultural construct rather than a self-evident fact.<br />
<br />
Before you decide whether the aff is a good policy, you must first decide whether you want to be a policy-maker.<br />
The affirmative is determined to plunge into a future of peace and prosperity, a world that has no room for the dead victims upon which it is built. But the dead are still with us as long as we can tell their stories. While Matsumi died decades ago, we hoped that remembering his story allowed a brief a moment of ethical identification—vote neg to embrace symathy with the dead.<br />
Yoneyama, Associate Professor of Japanese Studies &amp; Cultural Studies @ UCSD, 1999<br />
[Lisa, Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p.143-147]<br />
Social and cultural systems have constantly...that constitute the heterogeneous and contradictory structural elements of one's positionality.<br />
<br />
Before you decide to vote for a policy, you must first make an ethical decision about what sort of judge you want to be. In this debate, we ask you to set aside a policy-making role and use your ballot to acknowledge unconditional responsibility to the ethical call of history in Mitsuda’s story.<br />
Davis, 2001<br />
[Walter A., Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative, p. xvii-xx]<br />
4. History, I will argue, contains the same powerThe two works dialectically depend upon and complete one another.19<br />
<br />
Your role in this debate is to decide whether you want to be the sort of judge demanded by the 1AC, or if you prefer to be the sort of audience called forth by the alternative.<br />
Greene, Assistance Profession Communications @ UT-Austin, 1998<br />
(Ronald, Argumentation and Advocacy, Summer, p. 20-21)<br />
In Scott’s hands rhetoric becomes a particular form of human action with ethical consequences. ...Black's gloss of Marx but the implications of turning to Booth and Marx to ground the concept of the second persona.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our net benefit is critical geopolitics</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While the aff will frame our distinction as trivial – it really is these littlest of details which determine our everyday language – the definite article “the” before United States federal government perpetuates geopower in that it fixes identity to a cartographic inscription of the state</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Nigel Thrift 2000</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“words function to bring about geopolitical change and it is not…geopower ferments and sometimes boils over.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Geopower is at the heart of the imperial nation-state – Iraq is simply an imaginary cartographic inscription – an arbitrary area of land set aside for conquest – in the same regard all genocides ,war, and other forms of violence are the inevitable result of this violent cartography.</span><br />

The aff adopts a heroic perspective by promising to save our dying civilization from its own destructive impulses. This attitude reinforces our denial, and we must instead embrace the horror of the impending collapse to reclaim meaning in this dying world<br />

 Ghost of Hiroshima/ Haunting K (on wiki: CSFU finals v Iowa)<br />
New cards:<br />
The 1ac reduces Hiroshima to a mythological forewarning of the dangers of city busting. This attempt to salvage meaning out of meaningless suffering is a coping mechanism that forestalls a more detailed and tragic exploration of our obligation to the multiplicity of bomb dead<br />

You cannot adopt a view from nowhere matsuda’s ghost haunts this debate but do does the ghost of the affirmative’s own ethical location. Who is this we that speaks the 1ac? How are they ethically implicated as debaters and American academics? Matsuda’s narrative calls you to recognize your ethical location a possibility foreclosed by the seamless anonymous of we policy debate<br />
