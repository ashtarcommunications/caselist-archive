TOPICALITY - ARSENAL<br />
A) neg interp – arsenal is an establishment, not the munitions produced<br />
American heritage 2009<br />
“a governmental establishment” “other war material<br />

Reasons to prefer – each word is key<br />

Etymology historic origin proves neg is accurate<br />
Online etymology dictionary 2001<br />
“word origin &amp; history – arsenal 1506” “is from 1579”<br />
<br />
That’s an independent voting issue<br />

Each word is key – topic wording outweighs<br />
<br />
Using the phrase is not the same as defining the phrase<br />
<br />
Common usage is a poor standard for topicality – increases ambiguities and instability<br />
Attig 2003 “general reflections on the concept of common usage”<br />

The aff is analogous to the nuclear freeze movement which chose its goal by using the lowest common denominator in order to appease a larger group of people, this movement was coopted by capitalists by becoming a lightning rod that channeled oppositions to the arms race into useless electoral and legislative proposals<br />

Anti-Nuclear Nuclearism<br />
<br />
Plan is anti-nuclear nuclearism – emphasizing reductions while de-emphasizing the disarmament of current powers<br />

The Obama Administration is likely… belligerent nonproliferation regime…unaddressed as a present imperative.<br />
<br />
This reinforces existing US military supremacy and the use of nukes against rogues and terrorists<br />

Arms control is certainly not the answer…problems of our time.<br />

The counterplan is key to a successful NPR, which will shape all of our nuclear weapons policy, now is the key time to act, Using Presidential Directive allows Obama to do the plan while engaging in the NPR process, which is the only way to solve case by preventing military circumvention<br />
