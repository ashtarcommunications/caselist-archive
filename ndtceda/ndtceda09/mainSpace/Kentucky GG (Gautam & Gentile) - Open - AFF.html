<br />
Contention One: Same As It Ever Was….<br />
<br />
The Nuclear Weapons Topic is okay but I liked it much better when it was called the Mid-East Topic….or the China topic….or the Courts topic…or the Ag topic….<br />
Okay that’s a lie, no one liked the Ag topic….but when are we are not debating about nuclear weapons -- or more specifically nuclear wars – and the chance they will bring about human or even planetary extinction? In a very real sense policy debate has become exclusively nuclear-orientated – every issue of public policy viewed through the lens of how it relates to the always already imminent (and, yet, somehow unique) nuclear apocalypse. After September 11th, an escalation in the discourse of nuclear terror went orbital – the threat of superpower war and nuclear proliferation was magnified by the fear of a terrorist acquisition of nuclear weapons – while at the same time the nuclear weapons complex wants to normalize or make the existence of this weapons a banality of life – this discursive tension is an effective strategy to maintain the relevance of nuclear weapons in current national security policies<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 329-331)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not just a scare tactic and these nuclear weapons are do not exist in a vacuum – we participate in an activity that rewards those with the biggest impacts – we obsess over body counts and collect nuclear war scenarios from policymakers so that one day we might be successful enough become part of the nuclear glitterati and get our CSIS internship…<br />
But our sub-culture is not alone - we are merely a microcosm. We live a culture that preserves nuclear weapons as an essential part of its heritage – the bomb is a organizing principal in 21stAmerican life<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 17-18)<br />
<br />
<br />
This obsessing of the bomb through radioactive nation-building has its costs – for the activity, we obfuscate the central questions of each topic – whether we should have agricultural subsides is decided not by questions of economics or food security in themselves but only expressed as a function of how many nuclear wars they access. Many of us have spent most of the summer teaching high school students not about the chronic problem of poverty and homelessness in the US but how the states counterplan and politics will peel off those issues so we can focus clearly on the impact calculus. Just as we ignore the in-depth debates about these (quote-unquote) Real World issues because of the looming threat of war, the nuclear weapons complex uses the threat of impending war to silence opposition in the public sphere to nuclear weapons production and creates them as objects of banality to make invisible the systemic damage the nuclear weapons complex does on a daily basis in the United States.<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 25-26)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it is a question of those who are allowed to speak about and “know” nuclear weapons – to produce knowledge about nuclear weapons and nuclear policy - and the marginalization of those who are most directly affected by the nuclear economy: those who experience the environmental consequences of the ongoing Manhattan Project. Closing off who is authorized to speak in the debate over nuclear weapons policy promotes and polices a norm of secrecy that forecloses any meaningful way to democratically engage nuclear weapons<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 336-337)<br />
<br />
<br />
The screening out of marginalized nuclear experience is prime example of a disinterested knowledge of the Other that is the enabling mechanism for the destruction of that alterity. All quote unquote pragmatic nuclear solutions attempt to fill in the blind spots in our map of all human interaction ensures that we can only see these marginalized voices as the targets of the bomb<br />
Rey Chow, Humanities and Modern Culture &amp; Media Studies at Brown University, 2006 (The Age of the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative Work, 40-1)<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Time Isn’t After Us<br />
We must interrogate the repressed spaces of the nuclear project. This allows us to fully examine the local effects of nuclear weapons complex and fundamentally rewrite the story of the nuclear age to include those that have been displaced to margins of nuclear history.<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 3-5)<br />
<br />
Engagement with the symbolic elements of the Bomb is crucial – yes the genie is out of the bottle but that doesn’t mean that the genie has control over the production of nuclear truth – judges should be provided with a package of strategies to intervene in the apolitical construction of agency that current constraints engender.<br />
Chaloupka 92 (William, Professor of Political Science @ Colorado State, Knowing Nukes: The Politics and Culture of the Atom, pg. 137-138)<br />
<br />
And voting affirmative is critically to reorienting the scope of the nuclear weapons debate within our activity – we can choose to view the question of nuclear weapons from a vantage point of nuclear freemasonary and trust in their rituals, expert knowledge and strict secrecy – or we can break with the past and recognize our mutual interest with downwinders – the collection of groups that live in fallout zone of ever expanding nuclear economy. Because of Policy Debate’s unique position in relation to the actual decision-makers of real world, policy engagements like the 1AC are a VITAL avenue of communication between those future policymakers and the public that offers the possibility of a more genuine democratic engagement.<br />
Kinsella and Mullen 07 (William J., Associate Professor of Communication @ North Carolina State University and Jay, Professor of History @ South Oregon University, “Becoming Hanford Downwinders: Producing Community and Challenging Discursive Containment,” Nuclear Legacies: Communication, Controversy, and the US Nuclear Weapons Complex, ed. Taylor, Kinsella, Depoe, and Metzler, pg. 99-101)<br />
<br />
While there will always be shortcomings within any political system, the best thing that democracy can do is constantly re-imagine itself to be more inclusive of new members – nuclear criticism provides a strategy to provide the necessary pre-conditions for an unrelenting democratic engagement<br />
Peterson 07 (Tarla Rai., Boone and Crockett Chair of Wildlife and Conservation Policy @ Texas A&amp;M University, “Response: Nuclear Legacies and Opportunities for Politically and Ethically Engaged Communication Scholarship,” Nuclear Legacies: Communication, Controversy, and the US Nuclear Weapons Complex, ed. Taylor, Kinsella, Depoe, and Metzler, pg. 252-253)<br />
<br />
Finally, whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, we are all implicated in the violence perpetuated by the nuclear weapons complex. Instead of giving into the ultimately hollow impulse to “change the world,” you should use the ballot as a means of initiating a change in yourself. Only by centering our interrogations at the level of our lived experience can we make possible modes of relating to each other which do not fall back into the pattern of violent ordering.<br />

The 1AC is an act of resistance against limiting nuclear politics exclusively to the realm of international relations – studying the effects of the bomb on everyday national life is necessary to expose the normalizing effects of the Bomb and highlights the diverse experiences of nuclear citizens that challenge notions of a stable and all-encompassing national security strategy.<br />

<br />
To put it another way, we must interrogate the repressed spaces of the nuclear project. This allows us to fully examine the local effects of nuclear weapons complex and fundamentally rewrite the story of the nuclear age to include those that have been displaced to margins of nuclear history.<br />

<br />
The Nuclear Weapons Topic is okay but I liked it much better when it was called the Mid-East Topic….or the China topic….or the Courts topic…or the Ag topic….<br />
Okay that’s a lie, no one liked the Ag topic….but when are we are not debating about nuclear weapons -- or more specifically nuclear wars – and the chance they will bring about human or even planetary extinction? In a very real sense policy debate has become exclusively nuclear-orientated – every issue of public policy viewed through the lens of how it relates to the always already imminent (and, yet, somehow unique) nuclear apocalypse. We may be using all this nuclear jibber-jabber to deal with our collective fear of mortality, but it’s more than that. After September 11th, an escalation in the discourse of nuclear terror went orbital – the threat of superpower war and nuclear proliferation was magnified by the fear of a terrorist acquisition of nuclear weapons – while at the same time the nuclear weapons complex wants to normalize or make the existence of this weapons a banality of life – this discursive tension is an effective strategy to maintain the relevance of nuclear weapons in current national security policies<br />

<br />
This is not just a scare tactic and these nuclear weapons are do not exist in a vacuum – we participate in an activity that rewards those with the biggest impacts – we fetishize body counts and collect nuclear war scenarios from policymakers so that one day we might be successful enough become part of the nuclear glitterati and get our CSIS internship…<br />
But our sub-culture is not alone - we are merely a microcosm. We live a culture that preserves nuclear weapons as an essential part of its heritage – the bomb is a organizing principal in 21stAmerican life<br />
<strong><u>Masco 06</u></strong> (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, <em>Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico,</em> pg. 17-18)<br />
<br />
<br />
This fetishizing of the bomb through radioactive nation-building has its costs – for the debate community, we obfuscate the central questions of each topic – whether we should have agricultural subsides is decided not by questions of economics or food security in themselves but only expressed as a function of how many nuclear wars they access. Many of us have spent most of the summer teaching high school students not about the chronic problem of poverty and homelessness in the US but how the states counterplan and politics will peel off those issues so we can focus clearly on the impact calculus. Just as we ignore the in-depth debates about these (quote-unquote) Real World issues because of the looming threat of war, the nuclear weapons complex uses the threat of impending war to silence opposition in the public sphere to nuclear weapons production and creates them as objects of banality to make invisible the systemic damage the nuclear weapons complex does on a daily basis in the United States.<br />

<br />
Ultimately, it is a question of nuclear citizenship – of those who are allowed to speak about and “know” nuclear weapons – to produce knowledge about nuclear weapons and nuclear policy - and the marginalization of groups who are most directly affected by the nuclear economy: those who experience the environmental consequences of the ongoing Manhattan Project. Closing off who is authorized to speak in the debate over nuclear weapons policy promotes and polices a norm of secrecy that forecloses any meaningful way to democratically engage nuclear weapons<br />

<br />
The screening out of marginalized nuclear experience is prime example of a disinterested knowledge of the Other that is the enabling mechanism for the destruction of that alterity. All quote unquote pragmatic nuclear solutions attempt to fill in the blind spots in our map of all human interaction ensures that we can only see these marginalized voices as the targets of the bomb<br />

Engagement with the symbolic elements of the Bomb is crucial – yes the genie is out of the bottle but that doesn’t mean that the genie has control over the production of nuclear truth – judges should be provided with a package of strategies to intervene in the apolitical construction of agency that current constraints on nuclear citizenship engender.<br />

<br />
And voting affirmative is critically to reorienting the scope of the nuclear weapons debate within our own community – we can choose to view the question of nuclear weapons from a vantage point of nuclear freemasonary and trust in their rituals, expert knowledge and strict secrecy – or we can break with the past and recognize our mutual interest with downwinder communities – the collection of groups that live in fallout zone of ever expanding nuclear economy. Because of Policy Debate’s unique position in relation to the actual decision-makers of real world, policy engagements like the 1AC are a VITAL avenue of communication between those future policymakers and the public that offers the possibility of a more genuine democratic engagement.<br />

<br />
While there will always be shortcomings within any political system, the best thing that democracy can do is constantly re-imagine itself to be more inclusive of new communities and dissenters – nuclear criticism provides a strategy to provide the necessary pre-conditions for an unrelenting democratic engagement<br />

<br />
Finally, whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, we are all implicated in the violence perpetuated by the nuclear weapons complex. Instead of giving into the ultimately hollow impulse to “change the world,” you should use the ballot as a means of initiating a change in yourself. Only by centering our interrogations at the level of our lived experience can we make possible modes of relating to each other which do not fall back into the pattern of violent ordering.<br />
