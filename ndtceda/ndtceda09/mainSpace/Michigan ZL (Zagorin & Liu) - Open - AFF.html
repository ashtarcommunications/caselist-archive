Second, repeal of Chinese No First Use, If China moves or even modifies it’s No First Use Doctrine the end result would be multiple nuclear wars – the end of Sino-US relations and all cooperation conservative overreaction and total destruction of leadership and arms control, would result in horizontal and vertical proliferation, arms racing, war over Taiwan, and accidental wars - it’s the worst of all worlds and turns all the DA impacts<br />

 <br />
Cast adrift in a amidst the seas we float an absurd life-raft kamikaze spectacle, a speck of yellow rubber amidst the frothing black waves and can we really expect anything after the next crest? We have never labored <em>for</em> the sea and its churning depths are reciprocally indifferent, no different are our precious lives than so much drift wood, equally to be dashed to pieces against the sharp rocks or to be deposited exhausted onto a beach of soft coral sand still warm from the day’s sun, and to wake up to a new mystery of life. But though we may leave the sea to return to our safe homes we have changed very little; the wave-structure of uncertainty is pervasive throughout our psychological realities, and one day we wake up stolen away by the kidnapping Fates only to be cast adrift once again and find ourselves lost at sea, drowning in our own irrepressible tides that thrust upon us the hospitality of their dark depths, that grab us by the hand and lead us down their nightmare-slippery stairwells spiraling towards death. How shall we mourn the dead sailor who we will all one day become? <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;"><br />
</span><br />
Petronius replies: <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;"><br />
</span><br />
&lt;&lt; “Think of it,” I exclaimed sadly. “Somewhere in this world some wife perhaps sits waiting for that man, never doubting his return. Or somewhere a son to whom this storm at sea has no meaning yet. Or a father perhaps; but surely, surely there ws someone whom he kissed goodbye when he sailed away to death. But drowned! To think our every human hope must someday come to this, this corpse of great ambitions, this poor drowned body of our dreams! O gods, and was this once a man, this thing that floats now merely?”<br />
Up unto now I thought I was mourning a stranger, some man I never knew, but at that moment the surf dropped the body on the beach, face up, its every feature distinct and I recognized the face of Lichas. The very man, Lichas himself, once so formidable, so terrible and relentless in his hatred of me, now tossed up by the sea almost at my feet! Fighting my tears no longer, I wept openly, unashamedly, and beat my breast in a frenzy of grief.<br />
“Where are they now,” I cried, “all your anger and your greatness? But two little hours ago you boasted of your pride of power and your manhood’s strength and yet, what are you now? Food for the fish, for every crawling creature in the sea. Of all that mighty ship you once commanded, not one poor saving spar is left you in your utter shipwreck. And yet we scheme and hope, stuffing our foolish hearts with dreams, scrimping and saving, hoarding the wealth we win by wrong, planning our lives as though we had a thousand years to live! Why, why? One little day ago this man too looked over his accounts and reckoned up his worth; he too had fixed the day on which he thought his ship would dock. And now, O gods, how far he lies from his destination! Why, doom is everywhere, at any time. And other things betray, not just the sea alone. Look how the soldier’s weapons fail him. You see the consummation of your every hope, and what happens? The great house you built falls in, crumbles, buries you in the rubble of your dreams. The man who had no time to lose falls from his chariot and loses his time forever. The glutton chokes to death; the miser starves of his own stinginess. Why, if you calculate our changes in this life, what do they cry but death? Shipwreck is everywhere. But I hear someone object: those who drown at sea die unburied. Lord, lord, as though it mattered how this deathbound flesh should die! Fire or water or wear and tear of time, what does it matter? Death or death: the end is always the same. But objections again: wild beasts may mutilate the body. And so? Is the fire that someday cremates your corpse more friendly? Gentle fire, the cruelest death to which an angry master can sentence his slave? Why, what madness al this frantic pother is, these great efforts to annihilate our bodies completely, so they won’t be mutilated after death! &gt;&gt;[[#_ftn1|<span>[1&quot;/&gt;]<br />
</span><br />
We in debate hold onto our own arbitrary formulas of certainty that we believe infuse our activity with vitality, where in reality they are merely the patchwork of a lifeboat lost at sea that constantly appears to be coming apart at the seams. We have built an activity out of logical artifice, frames of reference for competition designed to established norms and inject them with moral meaning: this right, that wrong, this good, that bad and so on. This process of coding debate through morality is the same impossible task of preserving the body for perfect immolation: why need the holy object of sacrifice be pure? This type of naive devotion to eternal purity becomes truly pathetic in the face of the waves crashing down around us. There has never been a question of <em>if</em>, debate <em>will</em> change because like the sea itself change is the character of its very structure, and just as in life we must use debate to abandon form and become students of the mind, as Chuang Tzu elucidates: <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;"><br />
</span><br />
&lt;&lt; Once a man receives this fixed bodily form, he holds on to it, waiting for the end. Sometimes clashing with things, sometimes bending before them, he runs his course like a galloping steed, and nothing can stop him. Is he not pathetic? Sweating and laboring to the end of his days and never seeing his accomplishment, utterly exhausting himself and never knowing where to look for rest— can you help pitying him? His body decays, his mind follows it—can you deny that this is a great sorrow? Man’s life has always been a muddle like this. How could I be the only muddled one, and other men not muddled?&gt;&gt;[[#_ftn2|<span>[2&quot;/&gt;]<br />
</span><br />
Those who struggle in their lifeboats must be realists in order to avoid being pathetic, in order to refuse being reduced to merely the thrust of their inept wills, the sum of their inadvertent consequences and perverse mistakes. How little in this life do we intend that actually takes place? Our disposition towards the swelling sea is a grim sense of this reality approaching us, washing over us, taking us further. And by the twist of fates, we wake up, sick with our own monstrosity, sick with guilt over foiled plans and the repression of our liberated futures, sick with our own betrayal of the chaotic world.<br />
We wake from the dreams of our own uncontrolled insanities to find ourselves still dreaming new illusions of control, illusions of stability, of peace, of justice, of right and wrong and good and evil locked in unending hatred of the of the solar matador’s mocking temptations, that makes our will charge flailingly pell-mell upon the innocent sky that shrieks in terror and flees over the horizon, leaving us alone to die in gasping darkness. This moment of wakefulness is the negative epiphany of utter humility, where the structures of oppression and control are illuminated as a treason against the Sun, against the uncertainty of the chaotic world and a vision that waking up adrift on a life raft lost at sea we can somehow continue building our castle ramparts from the crashing waves. Gordon narrates:<br />
<br />
<u>I have a</u> recurring <u>dream: I am lost at sea. Murderous waves crash down</u>, a gale howls. Barely able to stay afloat, I thrash about, panic-stricken. <u>Without direction, I have no idea how to get to safety. The feeling is utter chaos</u>. Desperate, <u>I’m bailing like a mad­man, trying to empty the ocean with a bucket.</u> I am, as Alice would say, running twice as hard as I can to stay exactly where I am. Through my confusion and despair, I hear whispered words, “Lord help me for my boat is so small and your sea is so immense.” This is the point when <u>I inevitably wake up.</u> Naturally, <u>I am greatly relieved that it has only been a dream, until it dawns on me that there’s not much difference between my dreaming and waking life. Making my way through the day, I am indeed overwhelmed by a sea of detail that I can’t ever seem to get a handle on</u>—family, finances, health, job—<u>all the variables of my life rushing toward me in flood of chaotic uncertainty. This is not my beautiful life. Where are the security and order that was promised me? All my carefully constructed truths, everything I have counted on and identified with, seems suddenly false or lost or changing</u>. And when I pick up the morning newspaper, there’s more. <u>Not only my life but the whole world seems to be deconstructing. I’m back in my dream—drowning in a sea of uncertainty</u>. Having practiced for many years as a psychotherapist, I have good reason to believe that I am not alone in my <u>anxiety</u>; it <u>is com­mon to a great majority of those of us living in the modern industri­alized world.</u> In Care of the Soul, one of the most widely read books of the past decade, psychologist Thomas <u>Moore</u> (1992) <u>lists empti­ness, a loss of core values, and the general malaise of meaningless­ness as hallmarks of our culture. It is hard to deny Moore’s asser­tion. Only pick up a copy of Time magazine or turn on the TV. Everywhere we look, images of discord and dissent remind us that the political, economic, and social structures we once held as invio­lable are rapidly eroding. Our typical response to chaos is an instinctual drive to</u> impose order and regain control<u>. Our fear of uncertainty often impels us toward irrational and sometimes bizarre behavior. As in my dream where I am trying to empty the ocean with a bucket, such neurotic activity does little to assuage our anxiety and may even serve to increase it</u>. And neither should we imagine that only individuals can be affected in this way. <u>Stalinism, Nazism, McCarthyism, and fundamentalism of all stripes are examples of the kind of irratio­nality of which institutions and governments are capable in the name of order.</u> Rollo May (1977) stated that <u>totalitarianism “may be viewed as serving a purpose on a cultural scale parallel to that in which a neurotic symptom protects an individual from a situation of unbearable anxiety”</u> (p. 12). His further statement that <u>“</u>people grasp at political authoritarianism <u>in the desperate need for relief from anxiety”</u> (May, 1977, p. 12) suggests that <u>perhaps,</u> in the end, <u>it is precisely our resistance to chaos and uncertainty and our almost pathological need to impose order where there may</u>, in fact, <u>be none at all</u>, <u>that is the cause of so much of our dis-ease</u>. I am reminded of the words of systems theorist Kenneth Boulding, who warned that <u>we always “run into the temptation of imposing an order on the universe which may not really be there”</u> (Stamps, 1980, p. i).]<br />

We refuse to impose false order onto the rushing waves of chaos, nor do we feel obliged to plan our own futile future, for as Petronius says: “There is little point in expecting much of your own projects, when Fate has projects of her own.” Plans are not predictable loci of definite action, but rather false blueprints for impossible buildings that exist in the nowhere continuum of the future that cannot be specified before it is accomplished. Nuclear weapons are exactly such false blueprints, built and sealed in silos to decay for fifty years as their plutonium cores break down and dissipate, as their radioactivity infects the world with vibrant mutation and poisons our blood with leukemia and death. We will affirm the resolution as an affirmation against the plan of nuclear weapons as eternal, as the irrevocable flux of their radioactive decay transmitting a micropolitics of dissolution for the oppressive structures that crush the life out from the assemblages of all vital materials. Like all best laid plans of mice, men and universes, we must love the quixotic fate of the nuclear weapons becoming, as they will return to the swirling particles in the manifold ocean of strange waves of flux and adrift alone, lost at sea.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 13.0pt;"><br />

The nuclear discourse of these hysterical academics is the modern day equivalent of playing with toy soldiers except that the territory of the battlefield has now become virtual. There is nowhere to outflank your enemy or organize troops into formation; the nuclear battlefield is conducted in the space of representation, ordering and re-ordering the phalanxes of imagined mushroom clouds aesthetically around the invisible enemy. Like Professors Frank and Steve, it is our sterile sequestration in the academic sphere that cause our longing to playing with “real shit” and ultimately represents a retreat into apocalyptic nonsense as our imaginations endlessly re-enact the playful catastrophes in a futile attempt to escape from our truncated realities: the elevator door has opened and we find ourselves choked with the sulfurs of our own present Hell.This juvenalia of desperate imaginations are an endless replication of subjectivity into a million miniaturized apocalypse figures: individuals are transformed by the massnuclear annihilation into a generic “us against us” that erases humanity<br />

This reproducibility of subjectivity is re-enacted in the simulation of nuclear war games where our forces are set on alert against a horde of mythical invented enemies that enter arrive from the digital imaginations of military planners to become complicit with academic constructions of violence. Armies are constantly mobilized for the war that will never happen, however it is paradoxically this mobilization that creates the condition for real-world atrocities<br />

Danger and fear are not apolitical—the hysteria of frustrated meaninglessness towards the unknown through academia and university spaces like this debate round generate a feeling of entertainment that creates the illusion that we are spectators of political action as we might be spectators of a horror movie. We therefore become passive and cede our agency to the violence of the state<br />
