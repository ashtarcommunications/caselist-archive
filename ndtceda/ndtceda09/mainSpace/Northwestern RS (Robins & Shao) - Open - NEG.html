<strong>1) Reduce and restrict a mission by eliminating one or more of the current missions for nuclear weapons, or<br />
2) Reduce and restrict the role – by rejecting the importance, of nuclear weapons in meeting security challenges</strong><br />
Brooks 08 (Linton F. Brooks, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and an advisor to two of the Department of Energy weapons laboratories, has over four decades of experience in national security, including service as assistant director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, chief U.S. negotiator for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, director of defense programs and arms control on the National Security Council staff , and a number of Navy and Defense Department assignments as a 30-year career naval officer, 12/08, Taking Disarmament Seriously: Prospects for Changing Strategic Doctrines, Prospects for Changing Strategic Doctrines, Nuclear Challenges and Policy Options for the Next U.S. Administration, Jean du Preez, Editor, Occasional Paper No. 14)<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">One commonly advocated step to...justify the risk of nuclear elimination.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Reducing and restricting the role requires asset substitution</strong><br />
Sokov 08 (Nikolai N.

<br />
<strong>B) It’s impossible to reduce and restrict the mission of deterrence while nuclear weapons still exist – affs should focus on reducing the role of nuclear weapons in warfighting missions</strong><br />
Sokov 08 (Nikolai N. Sokov, senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, worked at the Ministry for Foreign Aff airs of the Soviet Union and later Russia, participated in negotiations on Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties I and II, as well as in a number of summit and ministerial meetings, 12/08, Prospects for Changing Strategic Doctrines, Nuclear Challenges and Policy Options for the Next U.S. Administration, Jean du Preez, Editor, Occasional Paper No. 14)<br />
One can differentiate between two …these warfighting missions.<br />

<strong>Asset substitution is the only way to actualize a restriction of role</strong><br />

To reduce the nuclear threat it faces…first strike against enemy nuclear forces.<br />

<strong>Ascribing a precise meaning to reducing the role is key to meaningful discussions of nuclear weapons policy – vague terminology is used to avoid real debate</strong><br />
