Reductions should be irreversible – weapons must be rendered irrevocably unusable to be out of the arsenal<br />

AND<br />
&quot;advantageous.&quot;<br />
Unfortunately, an arms control a-la-carte strategy will not work - the non-proliferation regime functions only as an integrated whole. Provocative U.S. actions, such as the deployment of national missile defense, could well set in motion a chain of events that diplomacy will be powerless to stop. Only by expanding the resources devoted to international negotiations and leading by example in reducing nuclear dangers can the United States hope to prevent a nuclear tsunami from sweeping out of Asia.<br />
<br />
Engaging in bilateral negotiations within a legal framework is the only way to solve – these talks will allow for cooperation on international security issues such as the NPT, Iran, and rogue states. Any non-legal method will breed uncertainty between the two countries hindering chances at cooperation.<br />
