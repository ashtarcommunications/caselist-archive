Catch Phrase K<br />
This year's topic calls out to debaters, hailing them, asking them to situate themselves within the discourse concerning the U.S. nuclear arsenal and to provide a response. To be affirmative requires the debaters to accept the hail, to be ideologically interpellated as subjects within the framework of understanding that this nuclear discourse allows. The debate over 'nuclear weapons' has been framed in terms of power politics instead of their devastating consequences. The rhetorical implication of phrases like 'nuclear weapons' and 'nuclear war' is to make serious opposition impossible. Until we challenge the language of 'weapons,' debates over particular courses of policy action are irrelevant.<br />
Hallet and Summy 2003 [Brien and Ralph, Prof. of Peace Studies and Prof. of Political Science, &quot;Detooling the Language of the Master's House,&quot; Peace and Change 28.2 p 236-41<br />
<br />
Peace is a state of mind--accepting the framing of 'nuclear weapons' discourse participates in a violently genocidal mentality. Even if you agree that the Plan is a good idea, you should still vote negative to refuse placing it under the rubric of 'nuclear weapons.' This is the only way to refuse the hail of the resolution<br />
