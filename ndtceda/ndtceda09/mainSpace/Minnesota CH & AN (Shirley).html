The United States Congress should initiate and the states should ratify a constitutional amendment vesting warmaking authority in the Congress. The United States Congress should<br />

Consult and engage the Joint Chiefs. • Their advice and support is essential to conduct- ing a posture review and effectively communicating the results to the American people and Congress. The JCS are in all likelihood prepared to accept potentially significant changes in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, but their support should not be taken for granted. It is essential that they be actively consulted and brought into the review process.<br />
