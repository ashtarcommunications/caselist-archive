Buddhism CP – “we affirm through contemplative action that…”<br />
<br />
To act in a meditative mode called contemplative action means that it is not the results of the action that matters it is the process in which we approach the action that can provide us with human liberation by the simple act of acting.<br />
Hahito 2005 Hooked; Buddhist Writings on Greed, Desire, and the Urge to Consume. P.42-43.<br />
Let me illustrate how this……. Fullness of being.<br />
<br />
<br />
The current epistemological approach to the world is rooted in scientific knowledge that demantds a dualistic understanding of the world – this negates our ability to comprehend the interdependence that exists<br />
Hahito ibid<br />
Pp 44-45<br />
The realization that &lt;&lt;we are the world” can bridge……….and the whole of nature in its beauty. 12<br />
<br />
It is through our lack of understanding interdependency that our ego created selves emerge, these ego selves are the root why we suffer in the first place, understanding interdependency is critical to promote human liberation<br />
Brown 95 The Myth of Absurdity: a critical examination of albert Camus’ The myth of Sisyphus from a Buddhist perspective. Thesis @ St. Mary’s Nova Scotia pg 51<br />
Because the Buddha’s experience…….. Truth of the Cessation of Suffering.<br />
<br />
Through our understanding of interdependency and our radical embracement of the way the world is now through our contemplative action affirms ones ability to achieve human liberation because of the new relationship established with the inevitable suffering that our life will incur which is the most important thing even more important than nuclear war<br />

<br />
This is not to say that we can solve all of the world’s suffering. We acknowledge that suffering is an inevitable part of life, but through understanding our interdependency and accepting the way the world is now allows us to reform the relationship we have to that suffering.<br />
Bortholin 2005. Matthew. The Dharma of Star Wars. Pp20-23.<br />
Recognizing that suffering is an undeniable fact of life…..take the time to carefully examine it.<br />
<br />
&lt;explanation of how they have an intention&gt;<br />
<br />
Having an intention for why an action is taken is what creates the dualistic mindset that justifies the existence of the ego “I” self – this turns the 1AC<br />
Loy 88<br />
David. Non Duality; A Study in Comparative Philosophy. Pg. 96-97<br />
<br />
Intentions are at the root of all suffering and conflict<br />
Davis explains in 2004.<br />
Zen After Zarathustra: the Problem of the Will in the Confrontation Between Nietzsche and Buddhism, <em>The Journal of Nietzsche Studies</em>. 2004<br />
Tanha, in fact, is one of several “voluntaristic metaphors” that characterize…… nations and countries, arise out of this selfish “thirst.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s fear of destruction of our planet represents a fear of death. By rejecting death you are rejecting life; they are two sides of the same coin. This creates a duality between life and death that reinforces the separations created by names and labels, turning the case.<br />
Loy Explains<br />
Sakyamuni Buddha declared that he taught only the fact of our dubkha……. Implies a death-in-life.<br />
<br />
Your sense of urgency to do something now will only create more suffering in the moment and create a never ending cycle where all we do is suffer<br />
Bortholin 05 Dharma of Star Wars pp 12-13.<br />

As with many questions, the answer begins with “It depends…” …. Contain alternative means for them to earn a living.<br />
<br />
Suffering has no external cause, it is within each of us, just as Luke had to face himself in the cave on Dagobah, we must face ourselves, and be mindful, and understand how suffering originates because this is where the majority of suffering comes from; ourselves<br />
Bortholin 05 (ibid) p. 25-26.<br />
When the Buddha looked deeply he discovered …. In reality Luke is battling himself.<br />
<br />
Viewing the world as separate and divided is based upon a thought that utilizes negative difference which prevents a view of interdependency and ensures extinction<br />
McPhail 1996. Mark. Zen in the Art of Rhetoric; An Inquiry into Coherence. pg 23-25.<br />
I began to believe that the problem of race, …… Each part is considered to be essentially independent and self-existent.<br />
<br />
The Quest for knowledge only ensures conflict – knowledge can’t be used correctly because of the dualistic understanding of the world.<br />
Hahito. Hooked; Buddhist Writings on Greed… (ibid) p 38-39.<br />
A second area of craving is the desire to know more. ….. I seek my own happiness.<br />

1. must change the methodology – we are creatures of habit if you keep using the methodology we criticize then the perm can’t create a new worldview.<br />
Chodron. Thubten. Buddhism for Beginners Pp 27-28<br />
2. Links to “urgency” link<br />
3. perm’s severance of the reps of the 1AC, reps key<br />
4. Karma is the developed tendencies we’ve created over the years – as long as the aff links the perm only ensures that problems isolated in the links will become stronger and more common – the alternative alone ensures that we cultivate awareness and positive dharma.<br />
