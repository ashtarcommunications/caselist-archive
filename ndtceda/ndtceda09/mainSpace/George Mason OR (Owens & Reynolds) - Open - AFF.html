 OBS 1 THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
Humanity’s development through time has created an unstable environment that throws us into a longing for Eden.  The role of nuclear weapons is to achieve our dream of timelessness by becoming our Alpha and the Omega. They are the deity which steers our destiny as it wishes, toward an inevitable Apocalypse that will occur at the will of the Bomb.  We are helpless to its symbolism that tells us the end is already here.<br />
Chernus 1986 (cochair of the religion peace and war group of the american academy of religion) Dr. Strangegod p25-8<br />
<br />
Although there are other signs of society’s quest for ritualistic doom, the Nuclear Armageddon is the most concrete embodiment of humanity’s fatalistic self-extinction.  This creates, AND reinforces worship of and acquiescence to the Bomb in both religious and secular society.  The public sphere’s emphasis on the Bomb as a necessary tool of strategy has only made things worse.<br />
Wojcik 1997 (Associate Prof of English and Folklore at the U of Oregon, PhD from U of California LA) The End of the World as we know it p99-103<br />
<br />
<br />
 Current political dialogue only reinforces the current role of nuclear weapons.  Even the quest to reduce emphasis still reveres their awesome and God-like power. The government relies on the logic that the Bomb is the solution to its own problem, that deterrence will somehow eliminate our dependence.<br />

The Bomb will never be relinquished as the ultimate solution to our international troubles because it symbolizes our goals as a nation.  Its existence as the definitive power and freedom mandates an enemy after the same goals, bringing us to neverending war.  Even if the plan fails, we are in no more danger than the SQ.  Avoiding the link to the disad is only a band-aid solution to a deeper problem.  Plan is our ONLY hope.<br />
Chernus 1986 (cochair of the religion peace and war group of the american academy of religion) Dr. Strangegod p32-5<br />
<br />
<br />
Our aspiration to meet God and know limitless Truth leads us to death as we attempt to break the barriers between reality and the cosmos.  The search for death lives in all of us and is inescapably ground into the foundations of our national and local politics.  It does not matter whether or not the Bomb CAN bring the Apocalypse because the Apocalypse is already upon us so long as we adhere to the religion of the Bomb.<br />
Chernus 1986 (cochair of the religion peace and war group of the american academy of religion) Dr. Strangegod p16-9<br />
<br />
In addition to the psychological state of extinction, a literal form of suicide is inevitable in order to release our frustrations and take back final control over our numbed existence.<br />
Chernus 1986 (cochair of the religion peace and war group of the american academy of religion) Dr. Strangegod p124-7<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
OBS 2 TAKING BACK OUR LIVES<br />
We advocate deemphasizing nuclear weapons not because we are in awe of what they are or what they do, but because of what they have become in the mind of society.  Eliminating the role of the US nuclear arsenal clears the air so we can take back our lives.  We will no longer be pawns of a nuclear God, but a society with a future and the ability to feel again.  We cannot afford to make compromises.  Any concession to the Bomb is 100% concession.  The purpose of fiat is to create a political container for our plan where we can immediately envision the effects.  This will guide further policies.<br />
Chernus 1991 (same quals) Nuclear Madness p287-90<br />
<br />
<br />
Humanity gets its feeling of agency from vicariously living through the Bomb because the USFG’s “experts” show us that’s how it should be.  Only a top-down approach solves.<br />
Chernus 1986 (cochair of the religion peace and war group of the american academy of religion) Dr. Strangegod p56-8<br />
<br />
It’s tempting to vote for the comfortable short-term impact calc arguments, but trusting the traditional realist modes of politics without question is a religious ritual of re-establishing our current logic.  Each time around the cycle makes our situation more dangerous.<br />
