Defcon. A most interesting game. A full scale simulation of nuclear war through vector graphics. The players all role play nuclear powers engaging in nuclear war. As defcon counts down the players build up their nuclear arsenal and plan the total destruction of their opponent. At defcon 1 everything goes off. Missiles are launched everywhere by players trying to hurt their enemy more than they get hurt. By endgame, one player is completely dead. The other is…mostly dead. Afterwards, every player gets a “score” based on how many they killed and how many, if any, survived. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>It’s a win but not a good win. The “win” is that the people under your control get to survive and recover from the effects of nuclear war. That’s if people survive. The only real way to win is not to play. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Debate. A most interesting game. A simulation of nuclear war through arguments by “experts”. Players simulate actions by powers and possible nuclear wars. As the debate progresses, debaters build up their nuclear arsenals and plan the total destruction of their opponents. By the rebuttals, everything goes off. Arguments are launched everywhere to destroy their opponents and their nuclear arsenals. By endgame, one player’s world is completely dead. The other is…mostly dead. Afterwards, the debaters are given a “score” and a “win”. It’s a win but not a good win. The debaters win that their world has more survivors after their nuclear wars are prevented. But massive amounts of people still die and the existing world is much worse for the survivors to live with. The only real way to win is not to play. </span></strong><br />
