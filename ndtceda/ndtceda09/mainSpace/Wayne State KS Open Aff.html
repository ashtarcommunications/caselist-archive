What this suggests is that $3-a-gallon gasoline is going to look like a bargain in the not-very-distant future…high-stakes game of fossil-fuel poker are going to be those that take their chips and walk away the soonest.<br />
China and India may be in a better position to do that than the United States, many of whose leaders seem determined to keep their foot on the gas until the nation drives off a cliff. Because their sudden lurch toward economic maturity is coming in a time of increasingly scarce and expensive energy, rather than during a fantasy era of cheap and seemingly limitless fuel, the nascent economic superpowers of the East are being forced to confront the era of limits before they've become as powerfully wedded to excess as the West.<br />
