<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">In 1944, von Neumann and Morgenstern published their seminal work on game theory—they used applied mathematics in economics to determine strategic behavior.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">By the start of the cold war and the nuclear age, game theory was popularized as America’s “secret weapon”: political scientists used game theory to determine how to interact with other states and how to maintain America’s advantage over the Soviet Union.<br />
Belletto 09. Steven Belletto, Assistant Professor at Lafayette College and specialist in Cold War literature, “The Game Theory Narrative and the Myth of the National Security State,”</span> <em>American Quarterly</em> <span class="apple-style-span">(2009): 333-357.<br />
“As the cold war…against the Soviets.”</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Game theory in international relations is different—it uses mathematical models to predict how states will act and whether it is more beneficial to cooperate or defect. The outcome of state interactions is determined by each state’s assumptions about the interests of the others. Game theory assumes that divergent interests create conflict, and it requires states to treat each other as enemies.<br />
Wendt 99. Alexander Wendt, Ralph D. Mershon Professor of International Security at the Ohio State University,</span> <em>Social Theory of International Politics</em><span class="apple-style-span">, 1999, p.331-332.<br />
“Power relations play….they will make”</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">In nuclear weapons policy, the problem of assuming other states are enemies is especially telling. For example, conflict over the size of a weapons arsenal, the management of rogue nations, and military aid has prevented any substantial U.S. or Russia nuclear arms reduction. The United States refuses to reduce its nuclear arsenal any further than Russia promises to reduce its.<br />
New York Times 09. “U.S.-Russia Nuclear Agreement Is First Step in Broad Effort.”</span> <em>New York Times</em><span class="apple-style-span">, 7 July 2009, Lexis.<br />
“The progress reflected…2,000 to 3,000 warheads.”</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">The insistence on a negotiated and reciprocal arms reduction is part of our larger diplomatic strategy:</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Negotiated diplomacy is based on game theory’s assumption that the international system is comprised by actors with divergent interests naturally resistant to cooperation. Not only is this assumption a construction, but it ensures state conflict to the point of making nuclear conflict thinkable.<br />
Fierke 98. KM Fierke, Lecturer at Queen’s University</span><em>. Changing Games, Changing Strategies</em><span class="apple-style-span">. p. 135-138</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">The impacts are manifold:<br />
First, the assumption of bargaining ensures conflict.<br />
Lebow 98. [Richard Ned Lebow, the James O. Freedman Presidential Professor of Government at Dartmouth College and a Visiting Fellow at the University of Cambridge. He has his own Wikipedia page.] EJIR 4(1):31-66<br />
“I begin by…to influence them.”</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Second, it guarantees war and institutional violence.<br />
Bagshaw 04, Dr. D.M. Bagshaw, researcher and practioioner in conflict mediation, Group for Mediation Studies, University of South Austrlia, “Verbal Abuse and Adolescent Identities: Marking the Boundaries of Gender,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unisa.edu.au/hawkeinstitute/cpcm/documents/dale%20bagshaw%20thesis.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.unisa.edu.au/ hawkeinstitute/cpcm/documents/ dale%20bagshaw%20thesis.pdf</a><br />
“In common with….and reproduced an interaction.”</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Third, our nuclear weapons policy is based on the idea that some nations are competent enough to have nuclear weapons while others are not. This discourse is part of a larger production of otherness and racist ideology that seeks to create the fantasy of the perfect America through the demonization of others.<br />
Gusterson 99, Hugh Gusterson, Professor of Anthroplogy and Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, &quot;Nuclear Weapons and the Other in the Western Imagination.&quot; Cultural Anthropology 14(1):111-143 (1999)<br />
“Thus in Western…institutions and states.”</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">The plan solves:<br />
First, by unilaterally eliminating its nuclear weapons arsenal, America would change the rules of the game.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Actors can change how they interact with each other by changing their assumptions. This is empirically proven by the largest change in the history of international politics: the cold war ended because Reagan and Gorbachev decided to see the other actor as cooperative, not conflictual.<br />
KM Fierke 98, Changing Games, Changing Strategies pg. 20-24</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Second, a unilateral elimination of nuclear weapons is</span> <em>self-binding behavior</em><span class="apple-style-span">. By eliminating its nuclear weapons, America imposes a visible sacrifice on itself. Anarchy is what states make of it, and this self-binding behavior forms collective identities among states paramount to international cooperation.<br />
Wendt 99. Alexander Wendt, Ralph D. Mershon Professor of International Security at the Ohio State University,</span> <em>Social Theory of International Politics</em><span class="apple-style-span">, 1999, p.359-363.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Third, it is because states can work to change their assumptions, especially in rational choice and game theory, they we can change the international system’s culture.<br />
Wendt 99. Alexander Wendt, Ralph D. Mershon Professor of International Security at the Ohio State University,</span> <em>Social Theory of International Politics</em><span class="apple-style-span">, 1999, p.371-372.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">Four, international cooperation is key to solving climate change, terrorism, and to curb negative social externalities. The plan overcomes the “self-help” state behavior characteristic in the nuclear age.<br />
