<br />
<strong>On argumentation and debate:</strong>  <br />
<br />
Id - Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari use botanical terms as metaphors for our thought processes, discourse and methods of rhetoric. One term is the root: which has one seed, one plot of ground and one plant that arises from it linearly, with one connective stem. The other is a rhizome: a botanical marvel which can grow any plant of a broad genus type, can span tens of miles, with entries, exits, hubs and nodes, unpredictable and always lodging through farmland for more fertile room to grow. On page 23 of their book “A Thousand Plateaus”, Deleuze and Guattari use the term &quot;rhizome&quot; to describe theory, research and epistemology that they define as &quot;a centered, nonhierarchical, non-signifying system without a General and without an organizing memory or central automation, defined solely by a circulation of states” The model of thought for rhizomatics pertains to micro-politics which is exactly what intercollegiate debate is. <br />
<br />
Ego - A rhizomic theory of rhetoric and epistemology is more simply defined by what it is opposed to: it is contrary to a Aristotelian model of telos or teleological rhetoric, the problem-solution model that allows for one line of flight, one mode of thought and all information and knowledge produced from which follows a single starting point. Rhizomic rhetoric and thought represents a critical but reasonable leap in coping with the loss of a certainty base against which to compare, judge, and value knowledge, as we seem to be so comfortable with in our international decision making and policy creation in the halls of Washington as well as debate classrooms. “This form is particularly apt as a model for academic disciplines, like public debate, which are on the bleeding edge where the knowledge strives to be fluid,” says O’Leary and Leslie in their 1998 article <em>Rhizomic Rhetoric: Cultivation of Differences</em>. <br />
<br />
<strong>In the Context of Nuclear Weapons:</strong> <br />
<br />
Ego - Let’s talk about how rhizomic rhetoric model applies to a more focused discussion, not <em>of</em> nuclear weapons but of <em>how</em> <em>we speak of</em> nuclear weapons? <br />
<br />
Id - <em>We as debaters:</em> could there have been a better topic this year than nuclear weapons? Last year we turned arguments about wheat, corn and rice into thermo-nuclear disaster, as we always do with bad DAs, by stringing loose improbable internal links into a forced and empirically false narrative. <br />
<br />
So finally, after long, mind-numbing years of Khalilzhad and Mead and numerous nuclear wars for asinine reasons we actually get to talk about these weapons, these artisans of mass destruction that we use in numerous forms of utility – in a year where the federal government will be discussing some of the most monumental areas of its nuclear arsenal such as the START II treaty and CTBT ratification – finally we debaters, the academia, hopeful future lawyers, professors, policy-makers and whatever else, get to talk about nuclear weapons. <br />
<br />
Ego - <em>We as the United States Federal Government</em>: as mimicking policy-makers we should take into account the role of the USFG in this discussion about discussion and the way we engage in it and towards nuclear weapons. <br />
<br />
In an article by Brian Palmer of the European editorial magazine International Slate, Palmer approached the question: how many nukes does it take to defend America? His topic of discussion was a meeting on July 7<span style="position: relative; top: -3pt;">th</span>, 2009 between President Medvedev of Russia and President Obama. During this meeting Obama had a radical idea: for both Presidents to sit in a room separate from each other, speaking to the other President’s cabinet. Each President would then answer and justify the question: how many nukes does my country need?<br />
<br />
Obama’s first reaction was that the question must first be turned over to U.S. Strategic Command where military planners apply them to hypothetical conflicts with six different adversaries: Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Syria, and a non-state actor resembling al-Qaida. Obama’s magic number after long deliberation turned out to be between 1,500-1,675 nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Medvedev’s answer: “We do not <em>need</em> any nuclear weapons.” As if to say, if not for the United States’ impossible and insatiable need to secure themselves, Russia would not even have a nuclear stockpile any longer. “I have a population of starving children and unemployed men, what good do weapons meant to destroy us all do me? Us? Anyone?” His extensive deliberation led him to this number: 0. <br />
<br />
The two met a few hours later to go over their individual conversations. Medvedev said his number. Obama laughed. Medvedev laughed too. If for nothing else, to not make the conversation awkward. Obama gave his number and so the conversation turned to ‘pragmatics’ and ‘minimum deterrence levels.’ Thus, a rhizome with unseen and otherwise unexperienced revolutionary potential was closed off. This is the real world, internationally pragmatic possibility of rhizomatic thought. And it all starts with our discussion of these weapons. Our ability to open and close those lines of flight. <br />
<br />
<strong>Now, a couple Impacts:</strong> <br />
<br />
Id - <em>Flawed Policy Makers and The Death of Democracy – Rhetoric</em>:<br />
<br />
In his Fall 1998 article for Argumentation and Advocacy ('Pedagogical Possibilities for Argumentative Agency in Academic Debate'. p44.), Gordon Mitchell explains how the sterile laboratory model of the status quo argumentation methods desensitizes participants to human suffering and enslaves the activity of rhetoric as well as our activity of intercollegiate policy debate within a spectator-mentality. And that this “sense of detachment associated with the spectator posture is highlighted during episodes of alienation in which debaters cheer news of human suffering or misfortune.&quot;<br />
In other words, our current root/radicle model of argumentation leads to bad policy makers and in turn violent and ill-formed international policy. For reference see the last 65 years. <br />
<br />
Jurgen Habermas sees the status quo capacity of communicative institutions to sustain themselves and their control over knowledge by manufacturing legitimacy through strategic communication as a development that profoundly transforms the political dynamic – in particular, Habermas worries that “communicative actions are being curtailed by a restriction on content, on form, even on failure. And in this distorted space for public discussion... we put a monopoly on argumentation and subvert critical deliberation by members of an enlightened, debating public.” And we all know that a free space subverted from new form is one that is not really free at all. <br />
<br />
Ego - <em>Micro-Fascism and the R Word – Discourse and Argumentation:</em><br />
<br />
Above, Mitchell and Habermas come close here to mentioning fascism. We, per Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus, define fascism as an ideal system of total power which emphasizes strict regimentation and seeks to suppress all criticism and new forms of thought. On the governmental level, this historically equates to ultra-conservative dictatorships which use left-wing propaganda, and while this is true we also believe that when we focus too much solely on the state, it can also blind us to the larger and perhaps more insidious impact of micro-fascism, or what we are defining as the micro-political groups and gestures that sustain and prop-up fascism in our molecular spheres of discourse, such as this room and this debate. <br />
<br />
Or as D&amp;G say, “it’s too easy to be antifascist on the molar level, and not even see the fascist inside you, the fascist you yourself sustain and nourish and cherish with little actions, both personal and collective. <br />
<br />
Id - Id - Furthermore, Wayne Brockreide in his article <em>Arguers As Lovers</em> posits that those who engage in argumentation can be lovers, seducers or rapits. Unfortunately he goes on to say that “argumentative situations structured in gamelike ways to give each person an equal opportunity to argue may be termed rape. The adversary system in all its glory manifests rape when one adversary sees another as an object or as an inferior being and when he intends to destroy that opponent with overwhelming certainty and no intent for collaboration or dialogue. Such a relationship often exists in the courtroom, in a political campaign, etc. Another place to find the rapist's attitudes and intentions in the adversary situation is in intercollegiate policy debate.” He says the volume, violent card slamming, yelling stances, cross ex language and Oedipal obsession with axiomatic win-lose records is symptomatic of this relationship of domination, in rhetorical terms. <br />
<br />
<strong>Framework/Role of the Ballot:</strong> <br />
<br />
Ego - The role of the ballot is simple. This debate is about the best methodology to solve the harms of the affirmative. There are at least two reasons why we should prefer the negative approach: <br />
<br />
First: Because we contend that the affirmative’s approach is flawed because it locates their criticism of the USFG in terms of technology, speed, calculation of human life and false representations of the way the brain, sovereign nations and normal systems work, all without criticizing the way we talk about and think about the use and role of those nuclear weapons. We think that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal. We identified two specific problems (not the only, but two important ones nonetheless) with the affirmative approach to nuclear weapons – that we insist on treating them in terms of their usability instead of their eradicability, and that we engage them as questions of future harm instead of questions of current death – that we talk about nuclear weapons so we can use them to prevent death in the future, instead of eliminating them to stop the deaths they are causing now. <br />
<br />
Id - Second: Because our methodology is more effective and functions as a better method of knowledge creation. The affirmative approach insists on using one way of looking at nuclear weapons, one conception of debating them in policy terms within a two hour time limit, one single progression of threat progression and substitution, no real dialogue, no consensus, no actual questioning. We should instead use a rhizomatic approach to method – where we have multiple ways of entering the debate, discussing both our, the folks in this room, relation to nuclear weapons and how we talk about them as well as our, the United States Federal Government, relation to nuclear weapons, how we talk about them in foreign policy. Both are connected – we argue we have to change how we think about and talk about nuclear weapons as a reason why the affirmative’s approach to why USFG should change their policy is ultimately ineffective. <br />
<br />
Ego - And now the big question: Framework<br />
<br />
We are not saying that we shouldn’t discuss policy – rather, we are saying that a focus on purely rationalistic, linear lines of flight in argumentation over nuclear weapons still maintains the mentality that forecloses options to solve these problems, and recreates the flawed epistemology that leads to the same policies happening over and over again while we ignore the lives lost in the past, the status quo and inevitably in the future as a result. We should not necessarily pass one specific plan such as De-Alert because using a specific policy towards a determined end is a replication of status quo knowledge production and prevents a rhizomatic understanding of our nuclear policy.<br />
<br />
Id - Additionally, Deleuze argues in his essay “Toward Freedom” on pages 255-256 of the Deleuze Reader that all questions, even uniquely political ones insides the trenches of the most neo-conservative war hawk think tanks, are questions of structure and discourse – questioning race, ethnicity, region, age, sex and gender, national State policy, global economy and action, how we frame those things, how we approach those questions, are precurors to any meaningful action, and any drive to change – it is only through addressing questions of structure and method – how we discuss and frame change – that we can work to, as Delueze says, “trace out a plane of consistence” to undermine the dominant structures of the current world and find a better more peaceful path, if indeed it's peace that we seek. <br />
<br />
Ego - Finally, as Michel Foucault explains in his preface to Deleuze and Guatarri’s book, the everyday speech acts in which we engage questions of our lives, be they large scale policy deliberations or small individual acts like debate rounds, must be framed in terms of an ethical art of living. We must both challenge the fascism that works on grand scales – the Hitlers and Mussolinis obviously – but also the fascism that lurks within us all in our speech acts and our approach to the problems we face. And that without ethics and some form of it impacting the way we speak, how we present information and engage in deliberation, we can't even hope to create good policy. <br />
<br />
Id - For these reasons, we think that the United States Federal Government, Calvin, myself and the affirmative team should not reduce the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal in the way the affirmative suggests we should and should think about nuclear weapons differently and explore all options in its search for the best ethical course of action.
