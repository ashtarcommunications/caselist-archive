Observation one is Inherency</span><br />
<br />
<strong>The US used DU in the war against Afghanistan in a way to ensure a silent genocide.</strong><br />

“The US war in Afghanistan made it clear … from which I know we will not escape.&quot; </span><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;"><br />
<strong>While the US continues to deny that DU was ever used in Afghanistan, a German military manual proves US use of DU in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</strong><br />

“A military manual that was handed over to German campaigners … until NBC security troops can rule out any threat.”</span><br />

<strong>Israel, with the help of the IAEA, has used DU supplied by the US in Syria</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-weight: normal;">“The Foreign Ministry, in a carefully worded statement approved at the highest levels …to cooperate with this investigation is redundant.”</span><br />
<br />
<strong>It is this use, attitude, and response to DU by the US that has fueled genocides</strong><br />

<br />
&quot;”In this context, continuous nuclear cooperation of United States, …. security that would lead to a catastrophe.” </span><br />
<br />
<strong>By denying its use of DU, continuing to manufacture its DU, and ignoring the resulting ongoing genocide, the US is supporting genocide by remaining complacent and not acting to stop it – US leadership is key to action</strong><br />

<br />
“But this is not the whole picture. Actions are also omitted, … by which I mean the bystander who decides to remain inactive.” </span><br />
<br />
<strong>You weigh this impact before utilitarian claims since the intentions and guilt inherent in genocide must be weighed more heavily to prevent genocide from becoming a business-as-usual event</strong><br />

<strong>Genocide attacks social vitality and destroys cultural meaning – it makes both life and death meaningless.</strong><br />

<span style="font-weight: normal;">“From an ethic of care perspective, there are numerous options available to prevent genocide… of care and result in broadening demands of American politicians.”</span><br />

<strong>Leadership from the government can motivate the American public to put more pressure on politicians to stop genocide, helping to create new mechanisms to hold policy-makers accountable</strong><br />

<strong>THUS, WE STAND RESOLVED THAT…<br />
The United States Federal Government in order to substantially restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal should ban the use and deployment of its Depleted Uranium munitions.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
Observation 2: Ethics of Care<br />
<br />
<strong>First, the liberal state is critical to ethics because it creates systems of justice and ethics to prevent transgression. In order to create a universal ethical obligation we need to engage with the state and constantly improve the power in state politics.</strong><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS';"><br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">“We should also say that all those who attack us …. Levinas calls for the liberal state.”</span><br />
<br />
<strong>And, the kritik reduces ethics to “the same” by presenting an ontological framework. This destroys infinite responsibility and therefore they cannot access ethical relations crucial to it. Our advocacy is the only one which universalizes ethics.</strong><br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">“How is it possible to break the stranglehold of ontology? …. for everyone and for each one, and I more than others.’”</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, our ethical responsibility to the Other outweighs all other considerations, which means you vote aff.</strong><br />
