Uses case to critique nearly everything—DAs based on value systems, causes to securitize everything in name of security, few cards read<br />

<strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Answers to Major Case Arguments </span></em></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Answer varied based off the case argument but essentially created distinctions between the case and what the 1NC argument was making— </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1NC and block had Nuclear Fear Good, Calculations Good, Sassurian Language Bad, Nietzsche = Atrocity, We should still act even if violence is inevitable </span><br />

<strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> 1AR Strategy Notes </span></em></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Went for three main arguments across the flow— </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">1. No reason to vote Neg—justification for stopping death = value system that is arbitrary </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Securitizing causes impacts—causes irrational fear of the other, means violence is inevitable </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Violence Inevitable—can’t stop it, means only a reason why the Aff is good </span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Arial;">Intro from aesthetics of ruins</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">P 432 “weapons that can destroy…you decide”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Nuclear buildup structues itself around the notion of a threat out there that we must protect ourselves against, a dangerous other who wants to do us harm. During the cold war this image was that of Russia eagter to destroy, not just everything we hold valuable and good, but the country as well. With theend of the cold war a new threat has presenced itself, the image of the terrorist. This new enemy is invisible however, always lurking and waiting for our mistakes ready to strike. The united states becomes viewed as merely looking to defend itself, removing any check on its power.<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;">“every power structure has to rely…the real criminal”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The world is will to power and nothing besides. The image of the dangerous other we must protect ourselves against is a power seizure, it is the realization of only one possibility and only one explanation of the world. Instead of accepting this as moral law, we should see it for what it is, what we all are, merely an expression of one will to power</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Ciano aydin Nietzsche on reality as will to power: toward and organization struggle model the journal of Nietzsche studies 22 spring 07<br />
“we can begin with some…always remain possible”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The logic of MAD is the logic of ressentiment par excellence, it attempts to make us feel secure without ever reaching us there, doing nothing to remove the dangers of threats themselves. The strange and alien become identified as evil, labeled a threat that must be dealt with. This strikes at difference itself. Deterrence strikes away at all that makes life worth while</span><br />

“one must begin with nietzsche’s idea….calculation of risks and benefits”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">THE USFG SHOULD PERMANENTLY DISARM THE UNITED STATES’ ENTIRE NUCLEAR ARSENAL</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">OUR BUILDUP OF WEAPONS IS ROOTED IN A NOTION OF DEFENSE. THIS CRETS A NEVER ENDING CYLE OF PROLIFERATION AS WE SECURITIZE LIFE IN THE NAME OF SAFETY. Instead we view disarm as a break away from the system, casing the sword down shattering it once and for all, only out of a height of feeling.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Nietzsche human all to human aphorism 284 1878<br />
“the means to real peace…and from up high”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Nuclear weapons are a part of a larger system to approach to conflict itself. Assumed to keep us safe, small scale disasters that are unimaginable under mad become incomprehensible. In fact it is the very notion that nuclear weapons deter conflict that results in grander events of violence.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">James der derian national security: an accident waiting to happen, predicting the present 27:3 2k5<br />
“it often takes a catastrophe…total war by other means”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Disarm may make us more safe to break away from the web of bureaucracy and demonization, but we don’t really care about that. Our claim is not that somehow extinction is immoral, but rather that our focus should instead be on the affirmation of life itself. The number of threats we can imagine is never ending, and our responses similarly. Rather the value of the aff is the opening up of vulnerability, the acceptane of the contingency and disorder inside of the world. This reclaims life for ourselves</span><br />
