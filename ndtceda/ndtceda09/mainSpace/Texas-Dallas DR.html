<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Role of the ballot is the evaluation of policy simulation and to maximize the lives saved. We should never sacrifice individuals for abstract market values – hoever, attempts to preserve lives gives equality to all rational beings – that’s key to value to life</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">David Cummiskey 1996 Kantian consequentialism p 145-6</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the next section I will defend…sacrifice some to save money</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Existence comes first</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Existential risks are distinct from global…how much we discount future benefits</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Death precedes all other impacts it ontologically destroys the subject and prevents any alternative way of knowing the world</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Contrary to those accounts, I would…source and condition of all human possibility</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Political engagement in potentially flawed discourses is paramount – refusal to directly engage admittedly corrupt politics mirrors the practice of german leftists in the 1930s- a practice that directly led to the rise of Hitler</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Wallace in 96 “Truth power monks and technocrats: theory and practice in international relations” p 307-9</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Short of that ambition to communicate…of civil society rather than to undermine it</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Second a good theory is complete…to biased inferences about other factors</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Textual approaches to the nuclear referent deny nuclear war’s empirical potentiality, leaving no grounds upon which critics and policymakers could formulate arguments to prevent those conflicts from being realized – the nuclear referent is not just something we talk about but also something that can and will occur unless we have the ability to do something about it</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Solomon 88 discourse and reference in the nuclear age p 27-31</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is difficult to argue with this…can be objectivity calculated and known</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There is nothing abstract about the consequence of this paralysis- rejection of totality as the basis for politcs indefinitely suspends leftists resistance to nuclearism ensuring totalitarian genocide and nuclear annihilation because they are too afraid to get their hands dirty to actually try to combat violence</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Solomon 88 (above) 236-65</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our bet against totality is thus…the other risking a nuclear war</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Your argument is self serving idle chatter – inability to start with the view of the policymakers leavers your argument incapable of a politics that transforms policy leading to extinction</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Blight 88 “can psychology help reduce the risk of nuclear war? Reflections of a little drummer boy of nuclear psychology” p 15-6</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now one might conjecture that what…civilization and even the human race</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Predictions prevent extinction – they inject flexibility and notions of fallibility into policy</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">CAP K</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The affs resistance is another tool for sustaining late capitalisms hegemony. Their critique of the liberal subject is no longer appropriate – but the call for a flexible institutional site to express different identites, representation and experience allows for cap to work through the conflict among identities in a safe space while subverting the universal struggle against class inequality</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Adam Katz “postmodern cultural studies: a critique” 96</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As I suggested earlier then postmodernism…more up-to-date forms of authority</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Nevertheless a new deal, even if..is such a burning house</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The alt is to reject the failed politics of the aff to reinvigorate the class struggle against capitalism. Only the alt focus on material transformation can cut capitalism off at the knees and emancipate the human race</span><br />

The Ethos of Militarism__** **As war has become the organizing principle of society and politics merely one of its guises, the state has been transformed. Neoliberalism has become weaponized and complex technologies of control have been mobilized to marginalize dissent and debate. The university has become an intense site for the transmission of militarist values, symbols, and behaviors.** **Giroux, Pf. Global TV Network Chair in English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, ‘08** (Henry A., Theory, Culture &amp; Society//, 25(5), DOI: 10.1177/0263276408095216, __http://tcs.sagepub.com/cgi/ content/abstract/25/5/56__) **This topic is consistent with that process of militarization. Among the techniques of militarization is the promotion of a rhetorical strategy whereby modern warfare has increasingly become characterized by a transference of agency from individual people to weapons themselves, impersonal scenario planning, or chains of command function to make nuclear war thinkable by reframing mass killing as a bureaucratic task. This dehumanizes participants in war and legitimizes their use by maintaining a military chokehold over all things nuclear.** Edward **__Sciappa__**. Assistant Professor of Speech at Kansas State University. “The Rhetoric of Nukespeak.” Communication Monographs. 56: September 19**__89__**. pp. 253-272 **Technocratic nuclear discourse is discursive discipline - determining who may and may not speak, privileging expert rationalities, and providing for false dichotomies between the “technical” and “public” spheres. Fear of nuclear war enables the creation of a hermetically sealed, self-referential, exclusive discursive community that functions to protect the state from dissent by ensuring that only those who speak in the language of the state will be heard.** **__Kinsella ’05__** [William, Associate Professor at North Carolina State University, Interdisciplinary Program Director—Science, Technology and Society, “One Hundred Years of Nuclear Discourse: Four Master Themes and Their Implications for Environmental Communication”, in The Environmental Communication Yearbook by Susan Senecah, pg.52-54] **The primary function of nuclear weapons is rhetorical – and nuclear weapons serve to discipline the populace and maintain an elite hold on power. Unpacking this question regarding a kind of rhetorical manipulation that prevents debate about the legitimacy of state practices is *the* essential issue for debaters to discuss. As a community based around fighting for the conditions to speak, debate and be heard, this issue is paramount.** **TAYLOR, Asst. Pf. of Communications @ UC Boulder, ’07** (Bryan C., //Presidential Studies Quarterly 37, no. 4 (December), p. 667-) **Our bodies have become the battleground upon which militaristic forces deconstruct agency. This discursive boundary drawing is a form of torture. Nuclear weapons become a rhetorical device in a discursive economy designed to make political subjects speak the language of the state or be dismissed and remain silent. This game of discursive loaded dice transforms political subjects into objects that are parrots of the state. In this dynamic, our bodies become obedient instruments of national security rhetoric – literally “speaking” the power of the state through our behavior. Nuclear discourse’s use of one’s body to substantiate the power of another is torture.** **__Grimes, ’05__** [Charles, Asst.

Gunter Lewy, writing in 1961 reminds us of the missilier’s peculiar ethical position, the genocidal stakes of the issue, and the virtue of disobedience.** **__Lewy__****,** Pf. of Political Science at Smith College, **__’61__** (Guenter, “Superior Orders, Nuclear Warfare, and the Dictates of Conscience: The Dilemma of Military Obedience in the Atomic Age”, American Political Science Review, Vol. 55, No 1, March, 1961, pp 3-24) **Observation 3: The Ethos of Freedom** **Just as all policy debate is necessarily a persuasive act towards a change from the status quo, The 1AC is a persuasive act toward the question of whether the missilier should break with the status quo and choose not to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons. Our arguments persuade you to affirm the figure of the disobedient missilier. Affirming the figure of the disobedient missilier who would refuse to turn the key is a resistance to militarism’s rhetorical techniques. It is a re-establishment of ethical agency through the re-situation of the “meaning” of the body through an act that is a communicative gesture. The gesture reverses the dynamic of torture by refusing to substantiate the power of nuclear security discourse. It is not without consequence. Affirming missilier’s disobedience in the face of the disciplinary forces of the nuclear complex is a recognition and transgression of its normalizing limitations that is irreducible to political success or failure. Rejection of consent to nuclear murder through an act of disobedience communicates the &quot;ethos of freedom,&quot; the epitome of caring for others through care of self.** **Foucault, '84** (Michel, &quot;The ethic of care for the self as a practice of freedom&quot;, interview Jan. 20 1984, conducted by raul fornet-betancourt, helmut becker, alfredo gomez muller. translated by j.d. gauthier, s.j.
