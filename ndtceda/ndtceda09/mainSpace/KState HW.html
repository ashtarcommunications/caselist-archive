<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">First is the topic </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The topic is a call asking us to determine the worth of nuclear weapons. Affirmatives brand advantages and impacts in the tone of Russia MisCalc, Iranian prolif, and China mediation, each of which outweigh the rest of your impacts, thank you very much. With internal links to Georgian Instability and INDO/PAK war which of course kills every last one of us. Even terrorism advantages are just wolves in sheep’s clothing. This theory distinguishes the topic’s presence in the realm of distinct, defined and isolated event. It assumes the inevitability and omnipresence of militarism and reduces thought to honed-down group-think. This trains us to really believe that when we sign a ballot, we do save lives. In reality it fuels the contemporary war machine. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">And realism is the loser’s game that divides the world into us and enemy, creating a constant state of war. This pessimistic self-fulfilling prophecy uses fear as a justification for violence. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><br />
<br />
</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Next is the resolution </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The United States federal government should eliminate the missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Second, planning is a modern strategy of patriarchal power over space and time - planning in the form of the resolution actively transforms fleeting intentions of altruism into substantial structures of imperialism - stopping the possibility for alternate lines of flight and cementing hierarchical organizations of life</span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">. </span><br />

<em><u><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">In the disciplinary ...</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Myth shares the same concern. </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The cultural production of nuclear war planning escapes the conscious until subjective truth becomes objective reality. There is no questioning the nuclear war event as something we must constantly and actively prepare for. However, the nuclear war impact and nuclear war proper betray us. While supposedly protecting us, it is solidified as the abusive Father that we cannot escape. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">What is the difference between the two previous cards above? The first was a call to substantially reduce nuclear weapons, and it is therefore topical. The second talked about domestic violence, </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">something approximately 2.1 million people in our priviledged country experience EACH YEAR.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span> Topicality guides our decision on what and how to speak—leaving the untopical behind and undiscussed. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Furthermore, roleplaying the topic as the state trains us to recreate normative legal thought, reinscribing the policy of the sovereign without changing it. This makes us not only servants to the system but also makes us defenseless to the State because t</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">he state anticipates and coopts internal reforms. Minor ruptures and emancipatory policies are part of how statist logic works. The promise of autonomy is appropriated to form a more insidious, oppressive sovereign. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">And the state falls victim to the antiquated patriarchal standards of modern IR—the ability to define being as illegitimate and legitimate only gives further credence to state and gendered violence, making nuclear war inevitable. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 11pt;">Gender is not the assumption that theoretical categories of being are transposed onto a sexed body, or, in other words, that men are warriors and women are peaceful: rather, it is the suggestion by a sovereign that one must be dominant, masculine, and patriotic to be ‘good’ or ‘righteous’. IR props up the false binary of good and evil, war and peace, masculinity and femininity, and patriotism and terrorism. This patriarchal control ensures short-term wars and makes extinction an inevitable part of realist logic of the squo. </span></strong><br />

Albert Einstein once spoke:<br />
any intellectual fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.<br />
Albert Einstein and his pacifism were fused together with the fallen grace of humanity<br />
The a-bomb was their love child.<br />
A love child predicated upon the fact that love meant MAD, mutually assured destruction, them, damn, commies (I am one in my dissent)<br />
Dissolution of a solution, absorbed within selfish devaluation of the human and nonhuman<br />
Being, all seeing.<br />
<br />
A spectacle, a flash, a mushroom that does not sustain life but rather denies an Event.<br />
Posturing of the bomb for nurturing of a particular and patriarchal branch of the human spirit<br />

“In truth, the bomb … national vernacular by 1947.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Lifton tells the story of Asahara, a man who drained ‘peaceful nuclear’ rhetoric from his goblet, swallowed and waited for the power of the a bomb to detonate within him<br />
<br />
But he was told of the power and attempted to attain it. Acquiescing to the flow of hydrogen because, to maintain security and safety, so should we all<br />
<br />
Wagering a soul for a power which will subsume his. Because / Why? Because simply the power is dangled and has promised a revolution<br />
<br />
I image myself to be a warrior of understanding. The medallion hanging around my neck, draping across my breast, a symbol of life and femininity<br />
The symbol of women attached to the ever thirsty circle-split form of peace.<br />
I figure the fathers of the bomb have also furthered the fathering of me in time, being space,<br />
Genetically we were both born out of an era of revolution<br />
The revolution of the phallus.<br />
Little boy was the name of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima<br />
Nagasaki felt the awe-inspiring girth of Fat Man<br />
The world had not opened its flesh to either<br />
And 340,000 lives were taken in this act of forced violence.<br />
Impenetrable land was penetrated, denying entrance is irrelevant.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contention one is topicality </span></strong><br />

Kato discusses and Jane Caputi reiterates the annihilation of the spirit of being that is NOT discussed in the realm of nuclear annihilation talks, Mutually Assured Destruction, the Bay of Pigs incident etc.<br />
but rather in the heinous previous and currently ongoing genocide of indigenous cultures, not only within a Superpower’s own boundaries, but outside of playground too.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observation 2 Political is Personal </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />
There is no winning of a war that devalues human life, exterminates it and causes harm. There is just a stopping of the violence against being<br />
<br />
But the resolutional discussion of the bomb-with-a-capital-B is irresponsible and denies the war of the worlds<br />

“Within twenty-four hours…are children under five.”<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">And we reference Cuomo – War as an Event.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our argument: moments of centering (we cite the plan, the nuclear phallus, nuclear weapons) cause a hero worship. If we choose not to engage in hero worship we are cast out and removed from dominant discourse. This is not only politically asphyxiating but is the reason why patriarchy, hierarchical value structures and ontological violence occurs.<br />
