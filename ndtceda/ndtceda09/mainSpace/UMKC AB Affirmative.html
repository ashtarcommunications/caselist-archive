 We live in an existential state of vulnerability – we are always already open to a sudden and unexpected address from outside of ourselves – this inherent openness and susceptibility to corporeal violence is not something that is willed or chosen but an inevitable part of the human condition<br />

Nuclear Weapons are a prime example of this quest for invulnerability – Although they have allowed us to feel relatively secure they have displaced vulnerability on a global level – beneath this nuclear umbrella value to life is pre-determined where any invocation of insecurity is used to justify violent attempts to protect ourselves <br />

Observation One: Men and their Missiles<br />
In the status quo discussions of nuclear weapons only focus on matters of hardware and statistics at the expense of questions regarding the cultural assumptions that are used to justify the bombs existence – this is the product of a patriarchal militaristic state that constantly seeks hierarchal dominance through processes of dehumanization and otherization – this worldview see’s war as an inevitability and uses it to justify a global arms race to build bigger and more powerful weapons – this sacrifice of the feminine locks us into a closed set of possibilities that constantly reproduces the violence of the status quo and will only culminate in extinction<br />

<br />
<br />
This system of patriarchy turns nuclear weapons into masculine symbols of power and likens questions of disarmament to weakness and femininity – this has created a global hierarchy of power fueled by a militaristic drive to eliminate insecurity by eliminating the feminine itself <span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><br />

Observation Two: Vulnerability<br />
The US should pursue unilateral reductions in nuclear weapons, even if it is gradual. Fears of other states reacting are rooted in the notion that not having nuclear weapons is a sign of vulnerability and femininity. Rejecting this flawed view of international relations is necessary to prevent the inevitable disasters that nuclear weapons bring.<br />
<span class="cite">Cohn and Ruddick in 2003</span>(Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, Sara, Professor Emerita of Philosophy and Feminist Studies at Lang College of the New School for Social Research “A Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction”, Boston Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights Working Paper No. 104)<br />

<strong><u>&quot;dream” that nuclear weapons inspire</u></strong></span>. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Attempts to erase vulnerability and deny disorder are founded on the fantasy that the world can maintain orderliness—they inevitably incite a violent response. We should instead be mindful of and embrace our vulnerability to violence in order to craft more responsible political solutions that do not incite violence.<br />

<br />
<br />
Retaliation makes violence inevitable—it creates a cycle of violence wherein retaliation is met with further retaliation. This increases the likelihood of violence as a reaction to conflict and results in masculine domination. The plan’s suspension of response is an act of vulnerability—this creates an international politics of mutual understanding and nonviolence.<br />

Observation Three: Ethics<br />
<span class="cite">This development of nuclear weaponry exacts violence against entire populations especially women. Nuclear development also genders nuclear weapons fetishizing them and turning all ethical questioning into a feminine characteristic that should be rejected in exchange for the masculine ideas of rationality.<br />
