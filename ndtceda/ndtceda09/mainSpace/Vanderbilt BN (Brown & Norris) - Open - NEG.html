 Russia doesn’t have LOW—they have a ride it out policy<br />
Ford<br />
Chris “Dilemmas of Nuclear force de-alerting”<br />
<br />
To be sure, there are some suggestions….riding out an attack rather than launching in response to “use or lose” considerations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No risk of Russian unauthorized launch now—command and control is tight<br />
Karas 1<br />
Tom<br />
<br />
The U.S. and Russia attempt to place multiple levels of control…in the former Soviet Union. See Blair, The Logic of Accidental Nuclear war (Washington DC The Brookings Institution, 1993) p. 107<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
De-alerting nukes removes them from the national control system—this leads to unauthorized launch<br />
Karas 01<br />
Tom<br />
<br />
On the other hand, even at low alert levels the risk….the political or military figures in regional control could still use them<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No risk of a response to an early glitch<br />
Wolff 9<br />
Amy, June<br />
<br />
Moreover, analysts argued that, if the United States removed its weapons…little reason to believe this was the beginning of a broader war.<br />
