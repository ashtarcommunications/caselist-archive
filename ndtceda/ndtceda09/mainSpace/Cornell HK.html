 XT- not going for it all impacts stem off of disarm<br />
<br />
K- they attempt to validate the repression of the squo- the state maintains authority by them refusing to identify with it<br />
<br />
Govt uses weapons to control people because it makes them feel good- state will use other types of weapons to oppose post plan<br />
<br />
Instead of rej. Authority we should demand the use of nuclear weapons- thus we access <br />

Perm do both- they are a call for disarm they are opposite action <br />

 <strong>Their politics of difference leads to a new racism when whites lash out to deny their guild</strong><br />
<strong>Steele 90</strong> – Shelby, prof of English at San Jose State, “Content of our character: a new vision of race in America” pp. 143-147<br />
‘most of the white students…have the wrong “difference.”’<br />
<br />
<strong>Their focus on a singular race or black identity institutionalizes a politics of difference that ignores similarities and therefore encourages racial tensions and justifies white supremacy</strong><br />

<strong>Whiteness is a pleasure – the 1AC masks this pleasure by presenting whiteness as a form of cultural location</strong><br />
<strong>Farley 97</strong> – Anthony Paul, “The Black Body as Fetish Object” Oregon L. Rev. 76 Fall 1997<br />
<br />
<strong>The racist institutions criticized by the 1AC are the result of our pleasures – by asking you to reject us, the aff is playing the role the color line has trained them for – we are the sum of our training</strong><br />
<strong>Farley 97</strong> (above)<br />
<br />
<strong>Admitting that performances of being black are victims is so painful people are seduced into their victim identities – this perpetuates the color line</strong><br />
<strong>Farley 97</strong> (above)<br />
<br />
<strong>Their ambiguous demand is the way the color line masquerades equality – it is the most effective mask for equality because even equality is a signifier to be interpreted by the dominant society, in this instance the debate community. Fetishizing the elimination of whiteness from institutions is one way the color line makes people focused on the system – what they ignore is that the system is a rigged game – their prayer for an end to whiteness will be answered in the white over black framework they condemn</strong><br />
<strong>Farley 04</strong> “The apogee of the Commodity” DePaul L. Rev. spring 2004<br />
<br />
<strong>Performance of color is a form of torture in itself – denies the pain associated with being marked as black and white under the guise of natural. Calling for the end of whiteness based on race performance is a way that the color line denies the pain it inflicts</strong><br />
