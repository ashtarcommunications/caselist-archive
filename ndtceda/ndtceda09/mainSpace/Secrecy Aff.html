<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>First, A highly controversial decision to publish documents detailing the plan to allow use of nuclear weapons to preemptively strike targets was cancelled. This does not mean the program was cancelled; merely that public disclosure of the program was cancelled. There are still plans to allow the US to preemptively attack certain targets.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The Nuclear Information Project in 2006</strong><br />
A Project Directed By Hans Kristenson, (co-authors the World Nuclear Forces for the </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sipri.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__SIPRI Yearbook__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> (Sweden) and the </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.org/issues/nukenotes/nukenote.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__Nuclear Notebook__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> in the </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">//__Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists__//</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Kristensen has more than 15 years experience in using the Freedom of Information Act) “The American Federation of Scientists “Pentagon Cancels Controversial Doctrine” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nukestrat.com/us/jcs/canceled.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nukestrat.com/us/ jcs/canceled.htm</a></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Second, This new doctrine dramatically expands the role of nuclear weapons allowing for preemptive strikes against &quot;rogue&quot; groups. It also expands the role and mission of nuclear weapons away from mere deterrence to battlefield destruction of targets</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Arms Control Association, Sept. 2005</strong><br />

<br />
<a name="0.1__Toc240422834"></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Third, the doctrinal shift resulted in a new global strike plan for the use of nuclear weapons in regional scenarios. This global strike plan allow for the pre-emptive use of nuclear weapons in regional scenarios against rogue states and non-state actors.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Finally, The nuclear option is currently the only executable component of the Global Strike Plan</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Thus the Plan:</strong> The United States Federal Government should eliminate any expansion of the role or missions of nuclear weapons that was part of the 2005 revisions made to the Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations</span><br />

<strong>Advantage I. Secrecy</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The decision to remove from public view the expansion of the role of weapons is rooted in the government’s penchant for secrecy within the nuclear weapons system.</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Secrecy within politics is a social process that defines what is considered inside and outside of the web of legitimacy. It defines the conditions of access and denial within political institutions</strong></span><br />

Judith, Cornell Peace Studies Program, “Secrecy and Knowledge Production” </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Secrecy excludes individuals from taking part in participatory democracy. It functionally eliminates the ability for effective criticism of institutions.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The justification for secrecy is often rooted in the desire for security. Citizens accepts government secrecy as long as that secrecy offers protections for an unpredictable and chaotic enemy. This drive for protection is the root of militarism.</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>This Destruction of Democracy and blind acceptance of secrecy prevents citizen challenges of hegemonic military and economic dominance. The impact is total war.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>First, the IAC speech act is important. Challenging the secretive nature of nuclear programs creates cracks and fissures within the hegemonic discursive order. This action can create progressive social change</strong>.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Exposing the secrecy is a response against militarism that focuses on Hope, not fear --- It is the only thing that can challenge the depoliticization of the public sphere</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The IAC is an act of revealing the secrecy within the status quo nuclear policy. The action is necessary to ensure human agency. Human agency is critical to a responsible and effective contribution to the political. The most important aspect of the IAC is its resistance to the nuclear complex accomplishing victory through secrecy and the denial of human agency</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Exposing the impact that secrecy has on participatory democracy and human agency opens up space to challenge militarism.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Giroux 4</strong> [Henry A., PhD, Professor of Education at Boston Univesrity, &quot;War on Terror, The Militarising of Public Space and the Culture in the United States, Third Text, Vol. 18, Issue 4, 2004. 211-221]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Finally, the IAC speech act is important to challenge the discourse of fear and secrecy. Resistance of systems of exclusion encouraged by secrecy and social rules is a necessary prerequisite to progressive politics.</strong> </span><br />
