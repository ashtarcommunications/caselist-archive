<br />
Unfortunately, “research” is not like the “searches” which characterized the Ancient African scholars who devoted their scientific endeavors to the pursuit of “Truth”. ….. The models constitute the definition' of what to look for. In sociology, the model is the underlying theory of society; in educational and psychological research, it is the underlying theory of man or mind.<br />
<br />
<br />

Quantitative focus = white paradigm<br />

<br />
Another assumption of the traditional Western model or conceptualization of the normal human being that guides research activity is the idea that what is real or knowable is material, quantifiable and directly observable. ….. &quot;Non-whiteness,&quot; communalism, cooperation, femininity would all be in some way viewed as deviant or at best, nonnormative.<br />

<br />
Khun (1970) asserts: “for a time paradigms provided model problems and solution to the community of (scientific) practitioners.” The paradigm that has operated throughout much of the Euro-American history of social science has been the affirmation of the normality of the male, Caucasian of European descent and his relative superiority to other peoples. ….. The way a person frames a question determines the limits within which his answer can possibly fall.<br />

<br />
The method confirms the model; then the model is perpetuated in the modalities of implementing tbe research findings. The modalities are the ways in which the research findings are implemented. …..Denial of the African American's humanity simply confirms the original thesis that being human means that one is necessarily a male, Caucasian of European descent.<br />

<br />
The new paradigm should offer a balance between the materialistic preoccupation of the Western or traditional Eurocentric ….. personal 'Worldview,' his concept of' Nature,' etc., indicate what possibilities there might be that research results may be unwittingly filtered through unsuspected or unacknowledged prejudices.<br />

<br />
Racial ascription is the common denominator that is systematically woven through the international fabric of human life on this planet. Thus, understanding the depth, ….. Rather than test children's knowledge of alien environmental artifacts to determine intelligence, they could be tested on their knowledge of indigenous cultural artifacts.<br />

<br />
The African American model in its holistic approach encourages methodologies that look at people in a non-fragmented way. McGee and Clark(1973) observe: The Western inability to synthesize body (material) and mind (spiritual) has led some respected scientists to make the absurd comment that black people in America are &quot;good&quot; in athletics but poor in thinking. Such scientists fail to recognize that to have a good body means that one has a good mind and vice versa; one cannot exist without the other. If the body is poor, the mind is also, and vice versa. The second issue of methodology is the &quot;how&quot; or types of research procedures that appropriately address the model. There are four (4) general types of research which are most relevant to an African American paradigm: (1) theoretical, (2) critique of falsification (deconstruction) research, (3) ethnographic and (4) heuristic (construction or reconstruction) research. ….. advancing us in the light of the model of enhanced human growth described in the research model that we described above.<br />

Intitutions are key<br />

<br />
The final modality of our research ….All of these modalities provide the ultimate objective of augmenting and institutionalizing the African American paradigm rooted in nature and respect for humankind.
