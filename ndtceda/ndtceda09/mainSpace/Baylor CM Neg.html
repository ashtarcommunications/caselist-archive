 Aff has zero evidence that cooperation solves warming or that carbon emissions would solve<br />
<br />
Careful management of threats is manufactured through rhetoric—public debate doesn’t solve—this turns the case<br />
Taylor 9 (Bryan “A Hedge against the Future”)<br />
More recent, a second body of work has… towards the credibility of risk managers<br />
<br />
Apocalyptic thinking is useful in questioning whether the ends being pursued by society are actually valuable<br />
Warren 8 (Beckett “Dawn of a new apocalypse: engagements with the apocalyptic imagination in 2012 and primitvist discourse”)<br />
The apocalyptic imagination informs radical… attempts to change what we believe<br />

<strong>Security</strong> K<br />
The aff’s calls to security only feeds the aporias by which security apparatuses continuously order and problematize life<br />
Dillon and Reid 2K (Michael and Julian Alternatives vol. 25, issue 1, spring, EbscoHost)<br />
As a precursor to global governance… is variously (policy) problematized by it.<br />
<br />
Chinese threats are grounded in US primacy’s demand of securitazation—this logic creates a cycle of endless intervention<br />
Pan 4 (ChengxiN, Alternatives 29 Pages 310-313)<br />
In 1630, John Wintrhop… recognize its autobiographical nature<br />
<br />
Alt—vote neg to reject security. Only totally eschewing the logic of security solves<br />
Neocleous 8 (Mark “critique of Security” pg 185-186)<br />
The only way out of such a… brave enough to return the gift<br />
<br />
Security causes the emergence of destructive states of exception that becomes indistinguishable from the forms of violence they seek to prevent<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Citizenship is a universal concept that obscures hidden investments in identity. This only serves to bolster racism and patriarchy<br />
Thorton 99 </span></span><br />
“citizenship is a classic example of a…reality of most women’s lives.”<br />
<br />
Conceiving of the US as a nation that thinks, acts, or behaves in some cohesive manner only covers up historical atrocities and reinforces the states control over identity and space<br />
Shapiro 97<br />
“It is important to recognize… understandings of selves and others”<br />
<br />
Nation state politics makes all ethics impossible. It causes the destruction ad oppression of marginalized nonstate people by damning them to our centers of power<br />
Shapiro 97<br />
“Apart from its immediate legitimation….of writing another one, a process without limit”<br />
<br />
ALT: Vote negative to use your ballot as an act of resistance against the representational violence of the 1AC Our resistance of conceptual mastery and unmapping of state cartographies and static identity sotries facilitates perpetual global encounters with alterity<br />
Shapiro 97<br />
“more generally the struction of pas, violent…unreflectively within the already said.”<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">We must remember that ultimately nothing is ever produced–we must let the US nuclear scientists believe they are producing something-the more they do, the more the world is allowed to escape it’s grasp.<br />
Baudrillard</span></span><span style="color: black;"> 88, Ecstasy of Communication <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://richardpayton.pbworks.com/ECIntro" rel="nofollow">http://richardpayton.pbworks.com/ECIntro</a></span><br />
“under these circumstances only few things” and “pleasure which accompanies it”<br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">State and political power are only rejuvenated with acts of resistance such a strategy will inevitably fail, for there is no longer the political will they assume. Only a strategy of becoming more positive than positive produces and upheaval which can reverse the baneful destiny of democracy.<br />
Baudrillard</span></span><span style="color: black;"> 2008, Present Considerations: The uncertainty of all value systems, journal of Baudrillard studies<span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol5_1/v5-1-article2-petit.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol5_1/v5-1-article2-petit.html</a></span><br />
“Petit: does this repentance condemn” and “baneful destiny of democracy lie”<br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The embedded artifact of calculative thought proved the ultimate ruse against the eclipse of being and allows for all worldy mysteries to be maintained. This position of affection, a radical illusion of pure technicity, proves shelter for the world to withdraw against the demands for its revealing as standing reserve.<br />
Baudrillard 1993</span></span><span style="color: black;"> Paroxysm–the perfect crime <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cul-studies.com/old/asp/LIST2.ASP?id=2922" rel="nofollow">http://www.cul-studies.com/old/asp/LIST2.ASP?id=2922</a></span><br />

<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Deterritorialization of identity reifies a capitalist ideology of market exchange, deterritorialized otherness merely replicates the destruction<br />
Baudrillard</span></span><span style="color: black;"> 2008, simulacra and simulations <span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.egs.edu/faculty/baudrillard/baudrillard-simulacra-and-simulation-14-the-animals-territory-and-metamorphoses.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.egs.edu/faculty/baudrillard/baudrillard-simulacra-and-simulation-14-the-animals-territory-and-metamorphoses.html</a></span><br />
“that animals wander is a myth” and “spaces of insurmountable reciprocity”<br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Aff’s desire for an unmediated existence turns liberation into a duty-when we are answerable only to ourselves we lose the symbolic freedom provided by control and mediation<br />
Baudrillard</span></span><span style="color: black;"> 2005 Intelligence of Evil (can't find page, but you should read the whole book anyway)<br />
“freedom a dream! Everyone” and “nor of moral and psychological law”<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"><br />
Alienation has adv. Thier Masco ev says self alienation reached such a degree that it experienced it’s own destruction—in other words that alienation folds over onto itself-reversiblie. Walter benjamin-accepted alienation, unlike Heidegger and walked around malls, immersed in spectacle of modern society. Always better to be controlled by someone else than oneself to escape alienation-entire movement for emancipation and liberation only interjects more forms of control<br />
Baudrillard</span></span><span style="color: black;"> 1983 Transparency of evil, pg 167-168<br />
“at all events it is better” and “that which we have to seduce”<br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">No hope to escape depoliticization-only possible political strategy left is one which pushes depoliticization to its maximum proliferation-we must assume the position of the depoliticized masses. The affirmative strategy is one which attempts to reinvest the world with meaning-to return the social to the field of politics-only concedes the reality principle of western metaphysics<br />
Baudrillard</span></span><span style="color: black;"> 1983, In the shadow of the silent majorities, 30-48<br />
“the mass realizes that the paradox” and “for any useless and absurd purposes”<br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">We control UQ on power relations and subjectivity neither are real or have power until you concede to the truths and reality claims that give them power. Alt only reifies the reality of the real, the responsible subject of power.<br />
Baudrillard</span></span><span style="color: black;"> 1990, seduction 97-99<br />
“In the last instance” and “ reviving the illusion of power”<br />
