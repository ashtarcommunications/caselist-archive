 Omelas Story at Beginning<br />
<br />
“With a clamor of bells” and “the ones who walk away from Omelas.” *1<br />
<br />
Planet Earth is beginning to look a lot like Omelas to the nuclear weapons states (NWS).  The citizens of these states are happy and joyous, rejoicing in the pristine eloquence of the nations they have created.  They are secure from enemies, militaries, crime, and guilt.  The story represents our collective ability to bracket certain groups in society (those who should not possess nuclear weapons) based on the threat of catastrophe.  Our affirmative is not only about the political consequences of our nuclear weapons policy, but also about the way the policy and the missions of nuclear weapons are framed.  Our argument is that this framing structures the very fabric of our existence.  We become unable to create new forms of ordering the world.  A society without violence and into the void of happiness and joy is not possible as long as the weight of our nuclear missions hang above us like the parabolic Sword of Damocles, that at any minute can drop and destroy everything we have worked for. Caitlin Ward, Vincent Parascandolo and Lourdes Villanueva*2 explains how this internalization of fear destructs identity and causes every situation to be viewed through a lens of catastrophe.   The goal of this world framing is to create a normalized community of nations.<br />
<br />
“On July 16, 1945” and “Why is that never discussed?” she asked.”  <br />
<br />
This normalized community, like the community of Omelas, has several goals.  One of which is to ontologically construct the way our identity functions.   Elimination is an inevitable result of this process.  The will to radical securitization, as indicated by Michael Shapiro *3 represents a deep seeded desire for ontological completion, a need to define oneself in terms of particular policy prescription.  In the context of our story people construct this identity on the basis of the excluded non-nuclear powers.  In the context of nuclear weapons policy other nations have become forced to structure their policies and lives around the global goal of accepting only the declared nuclear powers as legitimately owning and threatening the use of nuclear weapons.  This desire for a coherent national identity is more important than the political implications of the 1AC:<br />
<br />
“…what is represented as quest for accomplishing political “ and “a violent confrontation with an enemy.” <br />
<br />
The desire to manifest threats, to map and know the world geopolitically despite the cost is part of an active nihilism.  A way of knowing the world that mandates new fears to be eliminated.  A way of knowing that creates a hatred and invariably draws us closer together.  Perhaps we do not directly interact with the people constructed as enemies.  That said, we are aware they are there.  We are forced to remember our enemies through projected nuclear simulations, through violent forms of science, and through a lack of discussion about our role in nuclear weapons policy.  Instead of forgetting about our enemies and releasing their control of us we are forced to remember.  Indeed, this drive to remember our fears is what prevents our ability to overcome our drive to control the globe.  The memory that any second we could be destroyed by a nuclear weapon or through a failure to develop a new weapons technology creates a forced choice.  Some of us choose to go back to our home, our utopias, convincing ourselves that we really are special, we really do need nuclear weapons but others don’t.  After all, it is not our place to continuously criticize global structures of control.  Those of us that choose not to go home wander endlessly, perhaps to another country or another community.  It is not important.  Whether we stay and do nothing or run away, as long as we allow these nuclear policies to remain in place it becomes impossible to actualize true human freedom.  A freedom in which relationships are not mediated by continual ethical domination. <br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons remind us that anyone can be dangerous.  No longer must we only fear international terrorism, organized crime, environmental degredation, sexual slavery, faltering economies, racism, poverty, AIDS, world hunger and swine flu we must also worry about what every country is developing in their basement and whether they are being influenced by our strategies of deterrence.  The mission of our nuclear weapons converts the population into an object subject to managerial control.  We become responsible for enforcing the policy of non nuclearization and as Alain Badiou*4 explains this forces us to live a life free of its excess:<br />
<br />
“…Ethics is the ideology of this insularity” and “whose other name is: death drive. “<br />
<br />
The fundamental premise of this policy is that the government must avoid disaster of any flavor.  In our endless pursuits to calm our fears we create an existence in which the drive to be safe overrides the drive to live.  No where is this more clear than in the current mission of our nuclear weapons arsenal.  Don’t create nuclear weapons.  Don’t pursue nuclear technology.  Don’t even think about trying to become like us.  Alenka Zupancic*5 explains the way this policy forces us to exist:<br />
<br />
“An emblematic contemporary ﬁgure of this” and “most trivial and daily level of our lives”<br />
<br />
Not only is life dangerous, it is also limited.  Life is inherently about conflict.  Why do we run from this?  Why do we act as if we are only a little safer, a little more protected, that we alone can escape on a ship of immortality.  As a way of giving up and embracing our inability to manage and control the world we stand resolved that: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce and restrict the missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
This affirmation embraces the totality of life.  It is the recognition of the fundamental agonism and pain of existence.  Our affirmation is what creates an existence of meaning as opposed to the one based entirely on the have and have nots of the nuclear game.  The affirmation that someday you will die is based on the notion that we must cease to make decisions based entirely on death avoidance.  It affirms exactly what the mission of our nuclear weapons policy seeks to deny……the idea that life is not free from conflict. <br />
