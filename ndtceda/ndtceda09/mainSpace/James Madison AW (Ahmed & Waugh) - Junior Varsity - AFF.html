1) Testing is on the rise now- other countries are waiting on U.S. ratification of the CTBT in order to bring the treaty and its inspections regime into force<br />
<br />
The Economist, 6/4/09. “Making a Start”<br />
<br />
But some things … not in the mood.<br />
<br />
2) And despite Obama’s spring pledge at Prague, the U.S. has yet to ratify the CTBT. The votes just aren’t there and there has been no rush to push the treaty in the status quo<br />
<br />
PONI 9/10/09. Project on Nuclear Issues blog. “Top Chef CTBT,” Center for Strategic and International Studies. /sal<br />

Advantage – Iran/NoKo<br />
<br />
Advantage <u>) is Iran and North Korea:<br />
<br />
1) The CTBT is at the heart of America’s disarmament hypocrisy as a result the U.S. has alienated diplomatic talks with so-called “rogue states”<br />

<br />
Advantage - Iran Module<br />

Our first internal link is Iran:<br />

a) Iran is willing to negotiate over its nuclear program now- it’s time to finally seal the deal<br />
<br />
BBC News 9/8/09. “Iran 'to submit nuclear package'” /sal<br />
<br />
Iran is preparing … its peaceful use.<br />
<br />
b) The specter of Iran’s nuclear weapons program has set the world on high-alert. A Middle East arms race has resulted, causing destabilizing, fast proliferation. This makes nuclear war inevitable.<br />

Advantage – North Korea Module<br />

The second choice is …second-class nuclear power.<br />

d) And a strike on Korea will lead to a regional nuclear war that will draw in the U.S.<br />

Chol, ’02 (Kim Myong, PhD in Political Science and Executive Director of the Center for Korean-American Peace. “The Agreed Framework is Brain Dead,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/0212A_Chol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/0212A_Chol.html</a>)<br />

<br />
Advantage – Multilateralism<br />
<br />
Advantage _) is Multilateralism:<br />
<br />
1) Multilateralism is down now- the U.S. economic crisis has turned political attention inward as international obligations are put on the back burner<br />
<br />

2) CTBT ratification will be seen as a signal that the U.S. is committed to multilateralism<br />

First, a pledge …so much promise.<br />

3) Multilateral cooperation leads to the end of nuclear war, and prevents the impacts to escalating environmental destruction<br />

Advantage – India-Pakistan<br />
<br />
Advantage</u> ) is India-Pakistan:<br />
<br />
1) India is warming up to the CTBT now, but U.S. leadership on ratification is key to get India to actually sign it<br />

2) Despite its harsh rhetoric, Indian leaders will not prevent the CTBT entry into force. Pakistan will follow India’s ratification<br />

<br />

At the time … of Republican loyalty.<br />
<br />
3) CTBT ratification slows down the ongoing Indo-Pak arms races and limits the chances for and lethality of any exchange<br />

<br />
<br />
The CTBT is … possible nuclear testing.<br />
<br />
4) A full scale India-Pakistan nuclear war would break-out with other nations being drawn in causing extinction.<br />

Plan Text<br />
<br />
Thus, we offer the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and support its provisional ratification. Funding and implementation are guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />

The post-Bush political climate is the critical time; the other entry into force states will follow the U.S.’ lead<br />

Q: What is the … toward nuclear disarmament.<br />
<br />
U.S. ratification is THE litmus test for global nonproliferation efforts by creating a strong international norm. In particular, it will strip any benefit of a nuclear program for states like North Korea and India<br />

Provisional ratification bolsters the legal authority of the treaty and will bring non-signatories in during the transitory stage<br />

<strong>2AC to T</strong><br />
<br />
1) No ground loss- the CTBT is the heart of the nuclear literature. If the negative cannot find links to many o their core disads then they are not looking hard enough<br />
<br />
2) The testing moratorium will not hold up in the status quo<br />
Ferrara 2009<br />
(Peter, The American Speculator, July 8)<br />
“Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and scholar Richard Perle… especially in light of our testing moratorium”<br />
<br />
3) The fact that testing can occur at any moment means that we are just as topical as No First Use and a dozen other affs on this topic. Just because we are not using Nuclear Weapons in these ways in the status quo does not mean they are not fulfilling a role or a mission<br />
4) There is no definition of role. The new policy context post the Cold War proves there is not a concensus on a single role of the nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
Turpen 2009<br />
(Elizibeth, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stimson.org/print.cfm?pub=1&amp;ID=746" rel="nofollow">Http://www.stimson.org/print.cfm?pub=1&amp;ID=746</a>, Retaining Nuclear know-how, February 9)<br />
“Our Nuclear arsenal and the scientific infrastructure… applicable to contemporary national security challenges”<br />
5) Counterinterpretation: There are non-deterrent roles to nuclear weapons<br />
Ross 2009<br />
(Andrew, The role of nuclear weapons in International Politics: A Strategic Perspective, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/1405.200905.ross.nuclearweaponsintlpolitics.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fpri.org/footnotes/1405.200905.ross.nuclearweaponsintlpolitics.html</a>)<br />
“Non-Deterrent Roles Nuclear Weapons have had a truncated…Moscow treaty range of 1,700-2,200 warheads.”<br />
6) We <a class="wiki_link" href="http://meet.wikispaces.com/The">Meet:The</a> Heart of the US not signing the CTBT is the idea that the nuclear weapons are a status of symbol for the US and we are concerned about others developing them.<br />
<br />
<br />
7) We Meet: The refusal to sign the CTBT rests on the idea that we might test in the future. These tests serve as a discouraging influence to our enemies. Nuclear weapons tests play a role because they remind others of our military power<br />
Krepon, 2009<br />
(Michael, President Emeritus of the Henry L. Stimson Center, Better Safe than sorry: The Ironies of living with the Bomb, p. 94)<br />
“Despite years of living dangerously, close calls and accidents…war-fighting instruments under wraps”<br />
<br />
8)Reasonability- The CTBT prohibits ALL nuclear Explosions. If that is not a topical aff than nothing is.<br />
<br />
9) Cannot examine missions without looking towards the future uses of our nuclear weapons.<br />
Oelrich 05<br />
(Ivan, “Missions for nuclear Weapons after the Cold War”Federation of American Scientists)<br />
<br />
10)We meet: We stop all future testing, and all nuclear explosions, this means that we reduce both missions and roles. If we are either a role or a mission we are topical.<br />
<br />
11) Mission is not a stable term, but is instead contingent on current political situations. The CTBT is the most talked about issue in nuclear policy. Current proposals are a better limit.<br />
Oelrich 05<br />
(Ivan, “Missions for nuclear Weapons after the Cold War”Federation of American Scientists)<br />
“This study examines currently proposed missions for… Because no one is proposing them today.”<br />
<br />
12) Their Interpretation is overlimiting- focusing every debate on issues of deterrence destroys all the multiple uses of nuclear weapons in our foreign policy.<br />
<br />
13) Err Aff on topicality. You should accept a reasonable interpretation, not the most limiting. Competing interpretations are bad for debate because they lead to a race to the bottom rather than facilitating discussion, especially on this topic where there are no stable, contextual definitions of mission or roles<br />
<br />
14) Don’t vote on potential abuse- there is no way to quantify potential abuse. If they cannot explain how our aff leads to the abusive scenarios that they isolate then there is no reason to reject the aff in the debate<br />
<br />
15) We outweigh their potential abuse arguments – Their Interpretation limits out multiple affs at the heart of the topic while all they can isolate are ridiculous affirmatives with no Literature base
