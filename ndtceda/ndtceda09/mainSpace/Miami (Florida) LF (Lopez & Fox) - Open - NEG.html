<strong>Understanding violence as an aberration, or as an event that occurs outside of the sphere of our personal influence, guarantees our complicity with continued violent world orderings.</strong><br />

<strong>Our alternative of local analysis is the only way to understand our own complicity in the production of violent world orders. It politicizes the way we think, and hence opens a space for understanding the will to violence that traditional analyses of what we ought to do cannot.</strong><br />
