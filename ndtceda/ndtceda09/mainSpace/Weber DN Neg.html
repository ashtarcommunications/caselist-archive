<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">And, to truly understand the nuclear issue, we must expose its mythology. The 1ac reinforces the belief that all of science is morally neutral. This lack of moral character is responsible for the destruction of Hiroshima and the belief that America determines its own history and therefore controls the life of creation. It is this form of nuclear policy that is a policy of violence.</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">And, it is our obsession with the bomb and its possibility to destroy us all that renders us blind to the destruction that is going on all around us. Violence takes place everywhere all over the world, but goes unseen. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">And, the aff is rooted in </span>apocalyptic humanism. Its obsession with our survival has forced us to ignore what makes our lives and deaths worthwhile and such a secular age is doomed wage wars even more dangerous than the ones before them.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>And, the constant accusations of apocalyptic threats are a ruse created to unify populations in a fear that eliminates any alternatives to current political arrangements where any theological understanding is occluded. Such nuclear sovereignty puts us is a false dilemma, to either bomb or be bombed, either commit acts of terror or be terrorized.</strong><br />

<strong>And, this fear of dying feeds the political and economic structures that justify the devaluation of all life.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">The violence of the 1ac is inevitable in the current world that we live in. Only the hope in God’s providence can we navigate the inevitability of human violence. The current world justifies this violence due its inevitability and feeds in to the false theology of human control and that claims we can solve this violence through the plan action. </span></strong><br />

 <span style="font-family: Georgia;">Part One: Living the dream<br />
In every debate dream I’ve ever had I begin with prep time beyond all waking bounds. Sometimes hours, sometimes days. As I begin to prep for my speech I realize our evidence is somewhere else, sometimes I know and sometimes I don’t, but what matters is that I can’t reach it. Unlike Tony’s talking cube there is no narrator of my dream’s lesson. I wander desperately through mazelike halls looking for my evidence. The timer running down in my hand to an hour….then a half hour…..then mere minutes. I, of course, never find the evidence, but my panic dissipates. I start as a man on a mission, and I end as a right good pilgrim on a dream journey. I meet people, sometimes strangers, sometimes old friends and enemies, sometimes the dead, and each of them speaks to me, events occur without reason, but not without logic, every event makes sense simply because it has happened. Such is the logic of dreams. We cannot organize these events, or even usually remember them. We can only listen to our dreamworlds, learn from them. Our dreams reveal the truth of our waking. For all that we try to organize the events of our life into a coherent whole, life itself escapes all explanation. We can make and unmake our own stories, instead stubbornly, the world and our personhood are not our creation. There is no otherwise, no alternate history, no revision. The world and we simply are what we are.<br />
McCarthy in 1998 </span>(Cormac [author and National Book Award winner and the National Book Critics Circle Award winner] <em>Cities of the Plain,</em> p. 281-89) The world of ... make its appearance.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Part two: The world and our remembrance<br />
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, as it was in the beginning, it is now and ever shall be a world without end. Amen.<br />
We constantly deny this truth. We behave as if the world had an end. We try to act wisely on our own behalf, we interpret and manipulate, predict and gamble and each of these escape our grasp in a thundering wave of unforeseen consequences. We think that events have some life in our narration of them, that by rejecting violence and death we can overcome it, but the ground we stand on is already stained with the blood of the ancients. The world has no end either in time or purpose. To the world sand blowing across a desert today is the same as an army marching across it three thousand years ago. Everything is simply movement within its hallowed spaces. In the midst of this endless world we are remembered only by God, who will never forget us, no matter how much we desire to lose ourselves in the boundless spaces of the material.<br />
McCarthy in 1994 (Cormac, <em>The Crossing,</em> pp. 147-148) After many a youthful ... fled nor hid from.<br />
<br />
And, the world’s bloody history, our complicity and involvement in our land’s violence is unavoidable. In response to it we cannot trust ourselves and our desires, but only the dead. The dead are still with us, still a part of us, and they speak to us with voices of truth and charity.We need the help of the dead. We need to listen to the dead, to cherish them and nurture them within us.<br />
McCarthy in 2005 <span style="font-weight: normal;">( Cormac, <em>No Country for Old Men,</em> pp. 284-285) </span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">So I went out ... Well, that's enough of that.<br />
<br />
<strong>Part Three is the triumph of life over death:</strong></span></span><br />
<strong>The Apostle Paul instructs us thus:</strong><br />
<strong>Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall rise again incorruptible. And we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption: and this mortal must put on immortality. And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>And, It is not the events of our life arranged at intersections of personal choice that matter. The dice aren’t loaded, but there is only one result. What has happened has happened and is absolute. Every event and thing exists outside of the instance of our encounter with it, and every human’s death is not hers alone, but is representative of every other individual’s death. The world is inescapable, events are inescapable, history is inescapable. Most of all, death is inescapable and ineradicable. But death has lost its sting.Jesus has stood in the dock for us, has taken our place, and now we stand with him. We sing those church hymns. This is the choice, not a throw of destiny, but a choice that we have made within the world’s history, within the bloody history of Christianity, within our own history and the wrongs we have done to others. We stand with Christ who stood with us. We hear his tale and we continue on our pilgrimage to the final reward. We live in a dream that is the most real of all. We believe that He has made us to shine like the sun and holds us in the palm of his hand.</strong><br />
