In 1945, the War Department of the U.S. federal government released a document prepared by Professor H.D. Smyth detailing the administrative history of the Atomic Bomb Project. The “Smyth Report” stands as the first “state history” of the American nuclear weapons arsenal. In the General Summary, Smyth points to a radical ambivalence that struck at the heart of the project. Those on the project understood the need to stop Germany and Japan in World War II, but they were also terrified of implications that the atomic bomb would have for humanity as a whole. Smyth writes:<br />
13.2. <span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A weapon has been developed ...</span></span> be informed if they are to discharge their responsibilities wisely. <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span><br />
<br />
Instead of confronting and dealing with this emotional ambivalence, the nuclear establishment has fetishized the bomb, producing a vicious cycle of psycho-social coping strategies. Either we tend to view the bomb as a banal object unworthy of our attention or we are terrorized by its apocalyptic threat, which we externalize onto a foreign other. This erases the internal politics and effects of the US arsenal that has installed nuclear terror at the center of the American nation-building project. Joseph Masco, a professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago, explains:<br />
Given the scale of this transformation, ...<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> inchoate and easily directed.</span></span> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn2|[2]]]</span><br />
<br />
The nuclear arsenal is America’s privileged national fetish. It has become central to our nation’s self-identity because it displaces and embodies our innermost anxieties, allowing us to gain symbolic control over what would otherwise be terrifying ambiguities about the legitimacy of our own power. Masco continues:<br />
To describe nuclear weapons as ...provides powerful modes of circulation.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn3|[3]]]</span><br />
<br />
Part of the coping strategy has been the aestheticization of the American arsenal within the nuclear science establishment. No longer sublime objects provoking visceral feelings of vulnerability and terror, our arsenal has been beautified in the virtual reality of the new testing regime. This separates the technology from its embodied effects, eliminating the possibility for ethical response. Masco writes:<br />
The question SBSS ultimately ...technoaesthetic spectacle par excellence.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn4|[4]]]</span><br />
<br />
There is no “use value” to nuclear weapons. Fetishization has locked policy-makers into the mindset of the 1950s and made it impossible for them to confront the fundamental security paradoxes of the bomb. This blocks the imagination of policy alternatives more appropriate to our time. Anne Harrington de Santana, a political scientist from the University of Chicago, notes:<br />
Nuclear weapons ...<span class="Underline"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">... our imagination of the policy alternatives.</span></span> <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn5|[5]]]</span><br />
<br />
<br />
The emotional ruins of the Cold War continue to frame current nuclear politics. Fear is used to mobilize public support for perpetual war and the exportation of death on a global scale.<br />
Reclaiming the emotional history ...defined by the once and future promise of nuclear ruins. <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn6|[6]]]</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Dana and I are resolved that in order to substantially reduce and restrict its nuclear weapons arsenal the United States federal government should imagine there’s no nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
<br />
The call to “imagine there’s no nuclear weapons arsenal” is a new ethical imperative that smashes the illusion of wholeness that nuclear weapons are claimed to provide. It drives a hole through the transcendentalism of the nuclear nation-building project and provides the basis for a new ethics that recognizes the “not all” of being. Joan Copjec, a professor of English at SUNY Bufallo, explains:<br />
With history, we said. Fredric Jameson is... to other people or to the Other. <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn7|[7]]]</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Our affirmation is an attempt to find new ways of imagining governments that open up ethical responsibility. We recognize that an ethical politics may not seem possible within the confines of our current political environment. However, such an imagining opens the possibility for changing our ideas, actions and fantasies. Kelly Oliver, a professor of philosophy at Vanderbilt, writes:<br />
At this point we might ask how we can...policies but also in our cultural imaginary. <span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn8|[8]]]</span><br />

We affirm this performative repeition of the words of the topic by the Iranians for peace as a way to disclose the barbarism that lies at the heart of the American nuclear discourse. To be clear: we affirm the speech act of the resolution.
