 The affirmatives attempts at knowing and mastering the world inherent in their discussion about nuclear weapons continues to extend into the realm of existence. Based on a resentment and fear of an unknown possibility of nuclear use, they seek to control and order the fate of humanity to eliminate this uncertainty by trying to guarantee our survival, making the state the sole arbiter in deciding the fate of everything on the planet. Existence and an appreciation for life can only emerges from acceptance of life’s uncertainty and precariousness.<br />
<br />
Kateb 92 (George, “The Inner Ocean: Individualism and Democratic Culture. Pg 145-147)<br />

<br />
The affirmative has failed to learn the lessons of history. The use of Nuclear policy as a means of reducing danger and uncertainty only results in further need of intervention in an increasingly chaotic world. The weapons and their mission of violence are only possible because of this continued reliance on a rationalist methodology that seeks ultimate control threatening the very essence of all things natural and at the very least the entire planet.<br />
<br />
Burke 06 (Anthony, Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at UNSW, Sydney “Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason.” Theory and Event. 10:2)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only way to rediscover an appreciation for existence is to let go. Frustrating as it may be we must abandon the notion that we are masters of our destiny and instead let things be if in the face of the affirmatives threats. Only accepting life on life’s terms can we challenge the mindset of control that makes destruction of everything inevitable. It is only when we are reminded of the planet’s and our precarious existence<br />
<br />
Kateb 92 (George, “The Inner Ocean: Individualism and Democratic Culture 148-150)<br />

The rejecting the nuclear terror shatters resignation.<br />
