 No accidental launch – signal delay, hot line diplomacy, and assassination check.<br />
Walsh 85 – former Air Force lieutenant colonel (Edward, Nuclear War: Opposing Viewpoints, p 50-1)<br />
What about an accidental.. to a retaliatory holocaust.<br />
<br />
No blind launches.<br />
Pavel Podvig, PhD in political science and researcher at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, November, “Reducing the Risk of Accidental Launch Time for a New Approach?”<br />
Historical data on false.. sensors that prevented escalation.<br />
<br />
Miscalc can’t cause war.<br />
Mueller 88 – Professor of political science, ohio state (John, “The essential Irrelevance of Nuclear Weapons, International Security 13.2, jstor, AG)<br />
Wars are not begun.. world affairs since 1945.<br />
<br />
Intervening actions check escalation – history proves states anticipate escalation risk.<br />
Trachtenberg, 2k – History professor, Pennsylvania (Marc, The “Accidental War Question)<br />

Hiroshima K –<br />
We begin with a fragment of memory from August 1945…<br />
[Story from Mitsuda, a hibakusha, found in Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p. 127-130]<br />
A person was stripped.. not yet been disclosed.<br />
<br />
That comes from the testimony of a Hiroshima witness named Mitsuda, a man who refused to stop talking. The powerful rage of his memory continues to haunt his audiences.<br />
Yoneyama, Associate Professor of Japanese Studies and Cultural Studies @ UCSD, 1999 [Lisa, Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p. 132-135]<br />
These reactions suggest an.. through what I experienced.<br />
<br />
We have turned away from Hiroshima to contemplate the apocalypse.<br />
Foard, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at ASU, ’97 [James A., “Imagining Nuclear Weapons: Hiroshima, Armageddon, and the Annihilation of the Students of Ichijo, School journal of the Amencan Academy of Religion]<br />
From virtually the moment.. a self-evident fact.<br />
<br />
Before you decide whether the aff is a good policy, you must first decide whether you want to be a policy-maker.<br />
Yoneyama, Associate Professor of Japanese Studies and Cultural Studies @ UCSD, 1999 [Lisa, Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p. 132-135]<br />
Social and cultural systems.. revealing in this regard.<br />
<br />
In this debate you must set aside your policy-making role and use your ballot to acknowledge unconditional responsibility to the ethical call of history in Mitsuda’s story.<br />
Davis, 2001 [Walter A., Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative, p. xvii-xx]<br />
History, I will argue.. and complete one another.<br />

 Technostratgic discourse co-opts thinking<br />
Cohn 90, senior researcher at the center for Psychological Studies in the Nuclear Age in Cambridge (Carol, “Clean Bombs, Clean Language”, <u>Women, Militarism, and War,</u> edited by Belthke Elstain and Sheile Tobbias pg 33-56<br />
Learning to speak the language reveals something… the militarization, of our own thinking<br />

 <strong>Framework</strong><br />
Competing predictions must be evaluated under the following probability condition—only a claim plus warrant plus strong data should be given a default near 100% probability, else its weak data<br />
Strong data requires the following- large sample size, explicity citation of data and quantification of research methods<br />
Rosekind 9 (Mark “Scientific and Medical Evaluation of Flight Time Limitations”: Invalid, Insufficient, and Risky Alertness Solutions/ January)<br />
While the extensive scientific…. Addressing all of the questions posed<br />
<br />
Vote neg on presumption—weak data should be given no priority over the squo<br />
Zellner 7 (Journal of Econometrics Volume 136, Issue 2, February 2007, Pgs 331-339<br />
One the relation of science and econometrics… no effect unless shown otherwise<br />
<br />
Use your ballot to vote negative to create a new education space is a piror condition for peace<br />
Coulomb 8 (PACIFICISM IN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Defence and Peace Economics, 2008 Vol. 19(5) pp. 373-386<br />
In this article… so much for war and so little for peace.<br />
<br />
Strong date key to IR policymaking<br />

Insurgency coming now<br />
The Invisible Committee 9 (The Coming Insurrection, pg 4-10 online)<br />
Everyone agrees. It’s about to…. How to find each other?<br />
<br />
Single issue politics ignores root harms—ensures error replication<br />
The People 82 (Socialist Labor Party’s monthly journal, “Why Capitalism Can’t Freeze the Arms Race” April)<br />
For one thing, even if it could … the Middle East and other parts of the world<br />
<br />
The left is the key agent of change<br />
The Invisible Committee 7 (“The Call” pg 11-15)<br />
The Left is periodically routed… that we must attack<br />
<br />
Vote negative is affirmation of revolutionary potentiality<br />
The Invisible Committee 9 (“The Coming Insurrection” p. 95-98<br />
We can no longer even see… and Limoges was liberated.”<br />
<br />
The Alternative—our alternative is to reject the affirmative. The aff will amount to nothing more than a facile call to action which reproduces order<br />
Zizek 4 (Iraq: the borrowed kettle)<br />
Phenomena such as these give us a clear…. For which there is no external guarantee<br />
<br />
2NC A2 Perm<br />

The Invisible Committee 7 (“The Call” pg 11-15)<br />
