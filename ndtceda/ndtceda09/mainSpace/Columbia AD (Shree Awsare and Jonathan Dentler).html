FATALITY! 1AC<br />
Chapter 1: The Empire of the Good  The topic paper calls upon the debate community to reduce its “apathy” towards nuclear weapons by being “relevant” and decoding the resolution’s fundamental Truth. Nuclearists and their opponents align themselves to this metaphysical quest to re-establish a lost center to humanness.<br />
<br />
Chaloupka 92 (William, Prof/Chair of Poli Sci at CO State, “Knowing Nukes: The Politics and Culture of the Atom.” U of Minn Press, xiii-xv<em>shree)<br />
<br />
In the chapters that follow, I intend to …it fails to represent the entire territory. It is a trickster's map.<br />
<br />
Nuclearists attempt to rouse the indifferent masses of the debate space into fearing the bomb because they place value in an obsessive desire to survive<br />
Baudrillard 89 (Jean, Prof of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at European Graduate School, America, p 42-4</em>shree)  Everywhere survival has become a burning issue, … and a political fact of the utmost importance.<br />
<br />
The demarcation between life and death is constructed—the nuclear establishment’s exile of death is the ultimate exclusion that condemns life to degradation  Baudrillard 93 (Jean, Prof of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at EGS, The Symbolic Exchange and Death, p 126-7<em>shree)  Foucault's analysis, amongst the masterpieces of this genuine …away, would be nothing more than a survival determined by death.<br />
<br />
<br />
Orienting debaters towards anti-nuclearism is the flip side of the same coin. Their metaphysical blackmail portrays the fatal strategy of the object as the incarnation of Evil while glorifying the strategy of the subject of knowledge and power that establishes critical distance and intervenes in the nuclear scene. But, it isn’t the subject that wills the world into existence but rather the object that seduces it—privileging the subject fails and fuels self-hatred through repression.   Baudrillard 90 (Jean, Professor of Philosophy of Culture and Media Criticism at the European Graduate School, Fatal Strategies, p. 111-13</em>shree)<br />
“Only the subject desires; only the object seduces.” We have always …has collapsed; the solidity of desire has become myth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Subjective illusions like agency and responsibility are invoked to persuade the debate community to break free of the power of the nuclear establishment and to dissuade it from engaging in the evils of ivory-tower spectatorship. But this turns liberation into a duty—when we are answerable only to ourselves we lose the symbolic freedom provided by the voluntary servitude of gaming.<br />
Baudrillard ‘5 (Jean, Prof of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at EGS, Intelligence of Evil, p 50-5<em>shree)  Freedom? A Dream! Everyone aspires to it, or at least … of master and slave: in gaming no one is free, everyone is both the master and slave of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
The subjects’ drive to purify us of Evil by making us answerable only to ourselves breeds ressentiment because we confine ourselves to a victim economy and wallow in misfortune  Baudrillard ‘5 (Jean, Prof of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at EGS, Intelligence of Evil, p 151-4</em>shree)  A victim economy, a political economy of misfortune: a positive tradeable stock, …Never explain, never complain.<br />
<br />
<br />
The quest to annihilate Evil replaces difference with the image of the same and leads to the destruction of everything  Baudrillard 96 (Jean, Professor of Philosophy of Culture and Media Criticism at the European Graduate School, The Perfect Crime, p. 112-4<em>shree)  In German, there are two apparently synonymous terms …virtual masters – of this world, but the object of that mastery, the finality of that mastery, have disappeared.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shree and I affirm—  Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
Chapter 2: Artifice<br />
It’s impossible to have an instrumental affirmation of the resolution—even if its meaning is linear and fixed in the short-term, in the long-term it is oversaturated with meanings and can’t have a particular trajectory <br />
Baudrillard 81 (Jean, Professor of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at the European Graduate School, Simulacra and Simulation, p. 16-17)<br />
<br />
Watergate was thus nothing but a lure held …one party nor of another. It traverses all discourses without them wanting it to.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rule of symbolic exchange is to return the world and language as we received it: enigmatic and aphoristic. Instead of imposing truths upon the resolution as subjects, we affirm as objects seduced by the resolution. Our affirmation of the resolution is meaningless and thus participates in the very form and intelligence of evil  Baudrillard ‘5 (Jean, Prof of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at EGS, Intelligence of Evil, p 207-13</em>shree)  It is probable that we have all been everywhere, in dreams, in an …the world, by the elimination of whatever obstacle may be between the image and the gaze.<br />
<br />
<br />
Subjectivity and power relations aren’t inevitable—neither are real or have power until you concede to the truth claims that give them power  Baudrillard 90 (Jean, Prof of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at EGS, Seduction, p 48-9<em>shree)  In the last instance, behind the apparent stasis of … and Foucault's text should be criticized for failing to do it and, therefore, for reviving the illusion of power.<br />
<br />
Instead of falling back on transcendental values by attempting to resuscitate the political in the debate space, evaluate arguments by determining the mode of existence that serves as their principle<br />
<br />
Smith ‘7 (Daniel, Assoc Prof of Philosophy at Purdue, “Deleuze and the Question of Desire”, Parrhesia, Number 2, p 66-78</em>shree)<br />
<br />
Now according to Deleuze, this immanent approach to the question of ethics …between noble and base modes of existence, in Nietzsche; or between passive and active affections, in Spinoza).<br />
<br />
<br />
No risk of co-option—our discourse can’t be mobilized because we are de-linked from the social<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 83 (Jean, Prof of Phil of Culture and Media Criticism at EGS, In the Shadow of Silent Majorities, p 26-8<em>shree)  Basically, what goes for commodities also goes for meaning. For a long time capital only had to …effects of power and of the social, the latter like constellations fluctuating around this imperceptible nucleus.</em><br />

<br />
There is a specter haunting debate- every year we try to ward it off- it is the fear that inspires us to continue to produce research- it colonizes our minds. That specter is nuclear war. But amidst the flurry of Khalilzad cards, sometimes it seems like we’ve forgotten that nuclear war has already happened, and IS happening. It happens in the ways that we debate, the discourses that we produce through normalized rhetorical practices. These practices center on the instantiation of a metaphysics of presence, by which we mean the notion that as unitary subjects within the debate space we can find truth on the basis of things like community norms, speed, judge objectivity, and expertism.<br />
<br />
The topic has no inherent meaning, it is a body without organs. Our reading of it is that we should disarm the weaponization of debate practice through an examination of ways that we are subjectified in and through debate. This is because debates within macro- structures like the state and military about security are the expression of micro-discourses of security on the local level. No discursive realm is closed off from other realms where discussions and debates happen- For example, military minds have libidinal connections to family dinner tables which have connections to work places which have connections, perhaps, to this very debate space. Deleuze and Guattari write that,<br />
“fascism is inseparable ... both personal and collective.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[file:</span>/C:/Users/Shree Awsare/Documents/Harvard 1AC.doc#_ftn1|[1]]]<br />
<br />
With this in mind, the question the 1AC asks of us is this- how do axiomatic debate practices constitute us as subjects? Furthermore, how do these complex assemblages of subjects resonate together into the macro-political structures of the national security apparatus?<br />
Lets discuss a history of the advent of the nuclear age, as it relates to contemporary debate practice.<br />
On August 6th and 8th, 1945, the United States dropped two atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing thousands of people. But this event was not merely a catastrophe characterized by meaningless death; rather, it was the instantiation of a long sought-after dream of a secure and sterilized form of international relations. This mentality of retrenchment and containment echoes well what Nietzsche wrote of human being afflicted by ressentiment, whose “soul squints,” whose “spirit loves hiding places, secret paths and back doors,” and to whom, “everything covert entices him as his world, his security, his refreshment.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[file:</span><em>/C:/Users/Shree Awsare/Documents/Harvard 1AC.doc#_ftn2|[2]]] The suffering and contingency of the apparent or affective world was denied by these policy makers, attributed to evil “agents” and causes of suffering, who could then be scape-goated as the enemy. The apparent world is held hostage to the “real world” where security could be experienced, and infinite cleansing of the community is the path to achieving this utopic state. This seems to be the state of the debate community all too often, as certain styles are deemed inappropriate and violently excluded through apparatuses like framework. Like the situation of nuclear aparheid, the debate community has its others. A good example in light of recent history are debaters who choose to engage in alternate styles of debate, who may not have access to the same training in debate dromology and expertist vernaculars. The debate community has often pre-emptively attacked these arguments with framework and SPEC arguments, unable to confront its difference.<br />
Yes, the Russian bear, and anyone else who challenges our rhetorical practices and “way of life,” must cower before the nuclear might of the United States!! Similarly, debate has become a game of logistics where teams have to build up their arsenals of arguments- more tubs, more evidence! Debaters have to hone these weapons and continue to modernize their delivery systems- the newest disad, the best “experts,” the fastest speed-reading. Debate as pure militarized logistics. Dominant rhetorical practices in debate like speed and self-contained speeches are another way of creating a sterilized environment centered around pure logos. These practices are geared less to facilitate contestation and struggle than to create a delimited space where arguments collide but do not interact. In other words, a sterile situation of deterrence rather than a vital struggle over values and strategies.<br />
<br />
Virilio coins the term dromology, which may be thought of as the techniques of governmentality that operate according to a logic of differential mobility, incarcerating or accelerating different bodies and things in order to produce order and security from the raw material of a chaotic world.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[file:</span></em>/C:/Users/Shree Awsare/Documents/Harvard 1AC.doc#_ftn3|[3]]] Europeans with boats could navigate the smooth spaces of the world’s oceans in order to subjugate the relatively immobile native peoples of the New World. With the advent of nuclear missiles that could travel around the globe at thousands of miles per hour, speed has reached unheard of heights, holding the possibility of a securitized world tantalizingly within view. Debate operates according to its own forms of dromology. Speed is symptomatic of debate as pure logocentric information exchange and to annihilate the affective dimensions of rhetoric. The flow then becomes the magical artifact by which the judge can divine the metaphysical truth of who won the arguments in the debate round. The judge becomes the pure fascist subject- positioned outside of the debate round, without feelings, emotions, pleasures, or pains. Just as the European’s speed and mobility earned them the right to carry their truths into the dark recesses of the map, beyond the edges of civilization, speed in debate is driven by various logocentrisms by which the debate round is decided. It correlates to the idea that more words and more arguments equals more truth. Speed subjectifies us by centering the debate on conscious, logo-centric argumentation at the expense of the more unconscious, affect-driven aspects of debate that can be gained through poetic reflection and more welcoming rhetorical strategies.<br />
<br />
[Jonathan talks about his experiences in debate]<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: 12pt;">We suggest that a better way to structure the space and time of the debate round would be based on a rhizomatic model characterized by discussion, rather than an arborescent one, based on polemics and logocentrism. Some ways that this could happen include the inclusion of experiential learning rather than exclusive focus on experts represented by institutional privilege. There should be more dialogue in debate, and so we will be structuring our rebuttals as discussions as much as possible and using prep time to continue cross examination. We would further like these discussions to include the judge- keeping the judge outside of the debate as a God-figure looking down on it to ascertain truth views the judge solely in their capacity as pure logos and ignores the constitutively fractured nature of the subject. The way that the judge both experiences and evaluates the round is paramount. Rather than reading dozens of cards shadow-extended by a 2nr that used dromology to attain an advantage, we think that the judge should flow in a more rhizomatic way, perhaps in paragraphs. Rather than stacking up cards and recreating the debate after it occurs, we suggest that the judge take account of the affective dimension of rhetoric and cross-x in deciding who did the better debating. This could be thought of as acknowledging a poetic dimension to debate rather than thinking about it as a logocentric or calculative game. The rebuttals should be structured as discussions where limits are not set in stone but where each we respectfully engage the other people in the room as equals. The role of the ballot is to affirm a new method of debate that decenters various logocentrisms and spurs critical thinking by focusing on the ways in which we are subjectified in and through debate space and practice. This speech has been a demonstration of the way that this new method might appear.</span><br />
