B. Violation- the aff eliminates all nuclear weapons<br />

C. Reasons to prefer<br />

1. Ground- The world envisioned by the plan is one that is divorced from the realities of the status quo. Our Holloway evidence indicates that the mindsets, institutions, international systems, and norms relating to the use of nuclear weapons would be entirely different then what they are today. This means our DA and counterplan does not speak to the world that would be required by the passage of plan.<br />
<br />
2. Education- The question of whether nuclear weapons are good or bad is not the focus of the resolution. Instead debate about the ways we reduce or eliminate the role of nuclear weapons is the key question in the path to nuclear disarmament.<br />

2. The role of the nuclear weapons arsenal is deterrence- CTBT doesn’t restrict or reduce it<br />

From the nuclear-arms-control point of view, …. highly lethal biological weapons.<br />
<br />
C. Standards<br />
<br />
1. Predictable Ground- The affirmative may reduce and restrict any of the current 15 missions or the role of nuclear weapons in deterrence. They undermine predictability by justifying affs that change potential or past missions that haven’t been banned through legislation while claiming that the disadvantages are non unique or empirically denied.<br />
Oelrich 2005<br />
(Ivan, director of FAS strategic security, “Missions for Nuclear Weapons After the Cold War”)<br />
Nuclear Weapons Missions We have tried to make the list complete…. widely accepted missions.<br />
<br />
2. Education- Topic literature and the NPR prove that deterrence is the only role that nuclear weapons hold in the status quo. Aff’s interpretation undermines education by detracting from real world discussions about US nuclear posture in the post 9/11 international climate.<br />
<br />
D. Voters- Topicality is a voting issue for fairness and education
