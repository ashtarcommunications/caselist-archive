First note that the state and politics as a system of human relations is inevitable even if it were possible to rename or re-center a particular system the concepts underlying the system would remain largely unchanged. The question is at what level of human relationships the politics operates civilian or sovereign.<br />
Schmitt 1976 (Carl, The Concept of the Political, trans. George Schwab, Univ. of Chicago Press, p.78-9)<br />
State and politics cannot be… of the political.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also note violence is an inevitable human condition that is only containable through political means.<br />
Rummel 1977 (R.J.,”UNDERSTANDING CONFLICT AND WAR: VOL. 3: CONFLICT IN PERSPECTIVE” Chapter 9 Opposition, Determinism, Inevitability, And Conflict, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CIP.CHAP9.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/CIP.CHAP9.HTM</a>)<br />
If conflict is inevitable… is generally righteous violence<br />
<br />
Prior to the advent of nuclear weapons international politics was based on the sovereign’s ability to determine friends and enemies and to wage controlled wars aimed at particular goals. Once these goals were met conflict ceased.<br />
<br />
However the advent of nuclear weapons has distorted the sovereign’s ability to determine the exception which is basis of the friend/enemy distinction and has shifted politics from international enmity to a system of politics centered on civilian politics which makes conflict unceasing and results in the world being continuously on the brink of nuclear extinction.<br />

If war is not an end… uncontrollable by States,<br />
<br />
Also note that Warfare is the greatest instantiation of politics, however wars in the nuclear age lack the ability to be won. This detaches all political meaning from warfare and results in unceasing and unlimited violence.<br />

This situation has recalled… nuclear desertification<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons make state based war-fighting impossible. Instead of having a determined enemy to fight against, nuclear weapons render all of humanity a friend and enemy simultaneously.<br />
RASCH 2000 (William, associate professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, “Conflict as a Vocation Carl Schmitt and the Possibility of Politics,” Theory, Culture, and Society, Vol. 17, 2000, p. 15-16, 8 September 2009, ac)<br />
We can re-figure this debate… waged by the enemy?<br />
<br />
<br />
Next note that friend/enemy distinctions are inevitable in politics. However by placing politics at the level of humanity all enemies would have to be inhuman and as such worthy of extermination. Sovereign based politics does not require an inhuman or immoral enemy; war is merely a site to achieve political goals and conflict is ended when those goals are met.<br />
<br />
RASCH 2000 (William, associate professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, “Conflict as a Vocation Carl Schmitt and the Possibility of Politics,” Theory, Culture, and Society, Vol. 17, 2000, p. 12, 8 September 2009, ac)<br />
But is this freedom of full participation… ultimate sovereign can exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only alternative to our politics is this liberal pluralism which the status quo has created to constrain a politics of enmity. However this system can never be truly plural, its ultimate goal is the creation of an over-arching monism of humanity which makes all impacts inevitable.<br />
<br />
RASCH 2000 (William, associate professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, “Conflict as a Vocation Carl Schmitt and the Possibility of Politics,” Theory, Culture, and Society, Vol. 17, 2000, p. 12-13, 8 September 2009, ac)<br />
In Schmitt’s view, then… most extreme inhumanity’<br />
<br />
The system of liberal pluralism claims to solve violence through consensus but this system only succeeds at driving violence underground and criminalizing all opposition of this violence.<br />
<br />
RASCH 2000 (William, associate professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, “Conflict as a Vocation Carl Schmitt and the Possibility of Politics,” Theory, Culture, and Society, Vol. 17, 2000, p.21-22, 8 September 2009, ac)<br />
Accordingly, politics cannot compensate… hence criminalizes opposition.<br />
<br />
This politics at the level of humanity makes extinction inevitable.<br />
Denying the enemy’s humanity leaves them free to be annihilated and guarantees that wars will never end.<br />
<br />
SCHMITT 1976 (Carl, “The Concept of the Political,” p.54-55, ac)<br />
Humanity as such cannot wage… and no enemy groupings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the Plan: The United States federal government should immediately disarm all of its nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
<br />
Our politics of enmity is key to regulated and limiting violence. Our politics is the only politics capable of guaranteeing the humanity of the enemy while maintaining the ability of the sovereign to determine the exception. This is not normal decision making the ability to determine the exception is only during times of crisis after which that exceptionalism disappears. The status quo politics of humanity is a constant exceptionalism that is inconsistent with the plan and will ensure annihilation of the other.<br />
<br />
RASCH 2000 (William, associate professor of Germanic Studies at Indiana University, “Conflict as a Vocation Carl Schmitt and the Possibility of Politics,” Theory, Culture, and Society, Vol. 17, 2000, p. 18, 8 September 2009, ac)<br />
The actual history or the accuracy… has the basis for a limitation<br />
<br />
<br />
ELIMINATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS KEY TO RETURNING THE POWER OF THE EXCEPTION TO THE SOVEREIGN. THE EXISTENCE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TURNS WAR INTO A PURELY INTELLECTUAL EXERCIZE AND DESTROYS THE ENEMY AS A CONCEPT<br />
<br />
WAR IS THE EXISTENTIAL NEGATION OF THE ENEMY – WAR MUST REMAIN A POSSIBILITY AS LONG AS THE CONCEPT OF THE ENEMY REMAINS A POSSIBILITY.<br />
<br />
SCHMITT 1976 (Carl, “The Concept of the Political,” p. 32-33, ac)<br />
For to the enemy concept… enemy remains valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only eliminating nuclear weapons can return politics to state-based enmity. International organizations can’t solve and only further entrench a politics at the level of humanity which guarantees escalating violence<br />

The picture painted… is inevitably superior
