[We begin with a story from Hans Magnus Enzensberger]<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Hans Magnus Enzensberger (poet). “Two Notes on the End of the World.” New Left Review, 110. July-August 1978. </span><em><span style="color: black;"> <u>&quot;The apocalypse is part of our ideological baggage.

<br />
<span style="color: black;">The flip side of every value is nuclear war, the total and remainderless destruction which enables us to enthrone The Name – whether of God, Reason, Humanism, or Peace – as it's opposite. Nuclear war is the ultimate source of meaning, only true referent, the horizon and condition of all others. Imagine a nuclear war, and we see it in the faces of loved ones killed, landscapes destroyed, worlds renewed, and personal struggles – our own personal film strip of Hiroshima, Dr. Stangelove, Day of the Dead, funerals, divorces, marriages, births, every joy and every pain – and in all of these we see the sign of nuclear war.It doesn't matter whether they are aligned with or against nuclear weapons, in the face of their values we can see the sign of nuclear annihilation, towards which they aim, and which they will realize if ever they could succeed. </span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Jacques</span> <u>Derrida</u> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">(badass). “No Apocalypse, Not now (Full Speed Ahead, Seven Missiles, Seven Missives).” Trans.

<span style="color: black;">Vote negative to refuse the aff's final solution, maintain constant motion. This should not be confused with the nihilism of endless vacillation between alternatives which would only be to prolong and defer our nuclear desire – nuclear missiles will not wait in the air for us to play with language. Instead, this is to engender our own nuclear explosion, a final release of the energy we've built up in our calm anticipation of holocaust. Only this can stop the missiles before they're launched, by countering the nuclear processes which would make that holocaust actual. </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Peter</span><span style="color: black;"> <u>Schwenger</u> </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(professor emeritus of English at Mount St. Vincent University).

 SHIT!An outburst greeted with 20 minutes of hisses, boos, and cheers, putting a halt to everything. But it's not our fault, that was one thing the debate was really just lacking, though we wouldn't have done otherwise if we could.Today we can all be different, our own beautiful unique snowflake. But Ubu is a dark god, farting in the punchbowl. I don't like punch anyways - &quot;Waiter, can I get a coke?&quot; &quot;Sorry, we found a dead rat in the machine.&quot; - and Ubu strikes again.

 UCO KS Neg vs Missouri State FGMO State Tournament - Rd 5Judge: VegaThe aff read framework at the end of the 1ac, UCO ran this argument that the plan is a good idea but framework is bad.<br />
The affirmative offers the final solution to unfair and uneducational debate. In the drive to achieve theperfect debate space, the aff framework divorces ethics from action and restricts subjectivity to only be in terms of the state. Within this frame, our solve functionis to dispassionately carve the savage and barbaric from rational ordered society. Thus, they have cast critique debaters as the most recent sign of the savage – only the savage would violate their fair and educational debate, and this savage will be exterminated by frameworkBauman life in fragments 95 p 193-5“modernity is not only about producing” “separation of action and ethics”<br />
This is not just another ingenuine appeal to the logic of the holocaust – at the root of every genocidal actionwe can find the reduction of the individual to the role-performer: the soldier, the bureacra, the politician the architect of a perfect society. Like a toddler pounding a square peg into a round hole, the affirmativereduces us to exchangeable amoral actors, completely divorced from responsibility for those actions. By construcing debatea s a game or role-ploaying, the affirmative legitimizes ethics free action and guarantes these actions will be carried out violently.Bauman 95 life in fragments: essays in post-modern morality p195-198“such conditions-conditions without which” and “will do perfectly”<br />
By positing critiques as unacceptable, the affirmative uniquely constructs the saveage within society that must now be eliminated. By reducing the debate to a problem that must be solved they make the extermination of the unwanted inevitable as hurdles to be overcome on the road to a perfect societyBauman p 198-0“the modern spirit’s” “new building site”<br />
The reshaping of subjectivity to separate action from ethics produces the bureaucratic nature of progressive society that inevitably leads to the genocidal mentality implemented in nazi germany. Of course, the affirmative will not produce hitler or Goebbels, but by forcing us to dispassionately consider whether nuclear weapons are good or savage, and rationally dictate government policy from a high level of remove, the affirmative framework reduces us all to the role of Eichmann – very proficient at answering questions of policy, but ignorant to larger questions of the human effects of those policies –Churchill 05 interview with amy goodman on democracy now!“well it goes ot hanna arendt’s” “people targeted for elimination”<br />
Of course we agre that {aff plan}. But we reject their framework which locks this debate space into a forum for amoral game-players, a training ground for future eichmanns, we would use it to reinject ethics into the actions we, as debaters, endorse. We refuse to be turned into robots by the affirmative framework, we instead use debate a s ablast furnace for our revolutionary will.Schnurer 03 gaming as control contemporary argumentation and debate“the real game: potlatch” “debate should be about taking risks and creating new meaning”<br />
The aff framework corrupts their policy, reducing it to only ever on more attempt to stamp out the barbarian in the human. Nuclear weapons are the new eil that must be exterminated. Instead we would advocate their plan for different reasons, to check the most terrible aspects of their policy.Hehrke 98 contemporary arg and debate 1998 p 18-39“arguably, some policies” “communicative aspects of policies”<br />

September 2003.The big question is … from within debate.<br />
The affirmative endorses democracy and free deliberation, except for critiques. This exception for critique debaters reveals the lie of their framework, and allows any team to become the exception: because they read conditional arguments, because they read the wrong PIC, because they don’t specify an agent, etc. This transforms democracy into power over bare life.Aeyal Gross. “Illegal occupation: Framing the Occupied Palestinian Territories.” Berkeley Journal of International Law. 2005.A reversal of the relationship … it does contextualize them.<br />
The drive to rationalize and compartamentalize everything rods us of the gravity of our actions as we can only think and exist within their bureaucratic frame. At stake here is not just life, but what makes life valuable. This amputation of ethics from the individual steals the value to life from us as individuals in this room.Friedrich Nietzsche. “On the Use and Abuse of History for Life. 1873. Translated by Ian Johnson, January 2008.And now back to … as poet, as politician.<br />
The dominance of they type of debate they call for does not produce democracy, but rather coalesces with the dominant exceptionalist narrative. Debate becomes the training ground for imperialism. Our challenge to affirmation can revolutionize debate in a positive manner.William V. Spanos, in an email conversation with Joe Miller, posted on edebate. You know the one.Dear Joe Miller.

The problematic of nuclear weapons is not [aff impacts], but the elitism, the state-only focus, and the managerialism of security regimes which demanded always that nuclear weapons were a problem from congress-people and technocrats to solve. Everyone else was just a potential victim, undifferentiated.Bryan <u>Hubbard</u> (communications professor, chief of technology integration for US Air Force, the Pentagon). Nuclear Criticism after the Cold War. May 19<u>97</u>. Page 99-101.The dominant ideology or hegemony …. to speak in the nuclear conversation.<br />
These are all strands carried maintained by the affirmative plan. The retention of expertism, the commitment to global disarmament, and the insistence on managing weapons like a scientist looking down on the Earth as an experiment, can only reaffirm and strengthen the technostrategic regime of control, while alienating all supporters of the aff policy. This is empirically proven, the reason nuclear disarmament fails is because it fails to appeal to the populus.Bryan <u>Hubbard</u> (communications professor, chief of technology integration for US Air Force, the Pentagon). Nuclear Criticism after the Cold War. May 19<u>97</u>. Page 146-150.Throughout the body of … an element of the conversation.<br />
The plan can only entrench modern forms of domination, of the entire population by the elites.

This means that only the CP can solve. By speaking the same voice, the same tired rhetoric of realism and international relations, the plan can only feed that very system they oppose.

It is my intent to destroy any enjoyment you could possibly derive from this book.You may think you’re seated comfortably, or perhaps lying curled up in bed, but that’s just your body. In your mind there is only one posture for reading—a posture of submission. When you read you are always on your knees, humbly accepting your lessons from the writer god. Every reader is a zombie, a slave, a robot who wants to be programmed and controlled. You set aside your own thoughts for mine. Do it. Now.If you think a writer has any regard for his readers, think again. Only the basest form of writer cares one whit about his readers. For a great writer, the reader is just an obstacle between him and fame. That’s why the great books are always so difficult to comprehend. Look at <em>Finnegans Wake</em>. That book doesn’t make any gestures of compromise. That book doesn’t care about you. The only epiphany to be had with <em>Finnegans Wake</em> is to understand that, in the writer’s universe, you are the equivalent of a worm or a cigarette butt. Joyce grinds you into the ground with his heel.I know what you expect from an introduction. You want all the background. You want to know that Leopold von Sacher-Masoch was born in 1836, published <em>Venus in Furs</em> in 1870, died in 1895. You want to know that he came from a part of the Austrian Empire that is now known as the Ukraine. You want to know that he wrote in German, published a slew of other books and stories, achieved literary fame in his lifetime. You want to know that his fetish appears in many of his works and that <em>Venus in Furs</em> was modeled on the author’s experience serving as the slave of a woman named Fanny von Pistor. You want to know that Krafft-Ebing was inspired by the work and personality of Sacher-Masoch to coin the term masochism.But I don’t want to tell you all this. Maybe it’s useful for you to know. Maybe it’s not. Frankly it bores me and I don’t care about you anyway. The important thing here is my pleasure. The writer is the master in the literary relationship. The reader is the slave. If I want to tell you about <em>Venus in Furs</em>, you’ll listen. If I don’t, you’ll listen anyway. You have no choice. I’m the voice around here. You’re the ear. Get used to it.If you expect me to say anything enlightening about this book, you’re stupid. I don’t want to shed any light on this piece of garbage. I want to say things that obscure this book, cast it in the dark, bury it like an animal buries his shit. That’s what other writers have done. Freud doesn’t mention Sacher-Masoch once in his extensive discussions of masochism. Nietzsche, who had probably read Sacher-Masoch and was deeply interested in master-slave relations, doesn’t mention the author of <em>Venus in Furs</em> either. Spengler doesn’t include him in <em>Decline of the West</em>. Kafka, who drew on <em>Venus in Furs</em> for <em>The Metamorphosis</em>, never mentions Sacher-Masoch by name. Joyce, who harbored masochistic tendencies, refers to Sacher-Masoch twice in <em>Ulysses</em>. But that’s the exception and not the rule. Overall the attitude of other writers toward Sacher-Masoch is that of Henry James: “I never read a word of Sacher-Masoch. I read very little fiction &amp; had been warned off from him.”Warned off—why? Because as a scribe Sacher-Masoch doesn’t have much to teach. His biographers admit that the quality of his work declined precipitously after <em>Venus in Furs</em>. This “masterpiece” itself is written in little vignettes, like gasps between whippings. But even here look at the way Sacher-Masoch botches the description of his own fetish for fur. Wanda mocks the comparisons he invokes: “‘A woman wearing furs, then,’ cried Wanda, ‘is nothing else than a large cat, an augmented electric battery?’” An electric cat, a feline battery—that’s really erotic. That’s really perceptive… No, that’s really a mixed metaphor. Ugh.Then again, if Wanda mocks him, doubtless it is because he wants to be mocked. Sacher-Masoch disavows the clinical mastery of his symptoms because he wants to be not their master but their servant. Every word is calculated to elicit loathing and contempt. Sacher-Masoch oversimplifies (you have to be master or slave). He mixes metaphors (a feline battery?). He contradicts himself. Look at how he bungles his own symptomatology. He considers it not masochism, which didn’t exist as a clinical entity, but suprasensuality (<em>Übersinnlichkeit</em>). “I grew more confused each day, more fantastical, more suprasensual.” He takes a concept with roots in Platonism—the suprasensual as a realm literally above the senses—and declares it the root of his desire to undergo the most excruciating sensual experiences. It makes so little sense that it can only be a stratagem to involve you in his fantasies of punishment. If his ideas are all wrong, it is because Sacher-Masoch wants to be not correct but corrected.Sacher-Masoch spurns everything that would make you respect him as a man—has there ever been a greater example of Sartre’s <em>ressentiment</em> than this worm who choreographs his own humiliation and then complains about it?—and as a writer. Sacher-Masoch is a manipulator who plays the slave and a writer who pretends to be a reader. His stand-in, Severin, constantly talks about his reading: “I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian…” He reads aloud to Wanda. He’s prone to quoting. When he threatens to kill her, Wanda retorts: “What play is this from?” It is as though Sacher-Masoch wants to debase himself to the level of the reader. No wonder other writers shun him. What writer doesn’t want to be the author of masterpieces? Sacher-Masoch. He would have preferred to write slavepieces. He wants you to despise him. The decrepitude of his art is the sign of his effort to humiliate himself in front of the reader.In one episode Severin writes a poem called “Venus in Furs.” When Wanda takes the manuscript away from him, he can’t keep working on it because he can only remember the first stanza. Can’t you see that that’s what the author really wants from you? He wants to be punished, and the way to punish a writer is to gag him. “Silence, slave!” The worm would probably be thrilled if you would take over all the verbiage—if you would become the writer, take a copy of <em>Venus in Furs</em>, scratch out your own narrative on top of it, like a literary version of Robert Rauschenberg’s <em>Erased De Kooning Drawing</em>. Sacher-Masoch would have loved that. Erase his book.(It has been suggested by a psychologist in the <em>Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis</em> that Sacher-Masoch might have ghostwritten his wife Wanda’s stories and even her famous memoir. Certainly you can imagine Wanda compelling her slave to write texts which she could use to humiliate him by publishing them under her own name. This would not have had the effect of erasing his work, but it would at least have erased Sacher-Masoch’s name.)As a reader this puts you in a difficult position. On one hand, you feel that you would be only too happy to oblige Sacher-Masoch. You could take pleasure in humiliating this maddening book. You can imagine opening it up, working up a ball of spit in your mouth, hacking it between two random pages and slamming them shut. That’s what this worthless logorrhea deserves. With any luck the ink and spit will smear and you will end up with something more interesting that this miserable tome: a Rorschach test.On the other hand, isn’t Sacher-Masoch manipulating you into this? Do you really want to let him control you like that? The masochist positioning the sadist—it’s the perfect example of what Nietzsche means when he talks about slaves ruling over their masters. In his essay “Sade’s Reason,” Maurice Blanchot notes that “with Sade’s heroes the pleasures of debasement in no way reduce their mastery, and those of abjection raise them to the heights.” The opposite is true of Sacher-Masoch’s heroes. The pleasures of torture in no way elevate their abasement. To the contrary, it is the torturers who feel degraded by the victim, who are manipulated by him into doing and saying things they don’t really want to do. That is Wanda’s constant dilemma: the whip is being put in her hand.This is not to say that Sacher-Masoch is a simple inversion of Sade. In his essay “Coldness and Cruelty,” Gilles Deleuze argued this very persuasively: “The theme of the unity of sadism and masochism and the concept of a sadomasochistic entity have done great harm to Sacher-Masoch. He has suffered not only from unjust neglect but from an unfair assumption of complementarity and dialectical unity with Sade.” But to whom is this comparison really unfair? Does being compared to the divine marquis hurt the mostly mediocre work of Sacher-Masoch? (If it did, Sacher-Masoch would like it anyway.) Or does being compared to the pathetic chevalier diminish the greatness of Sade?If I weren’t confined to the front matter of this book, I would pop up at different moments of the narrative and show you just how inferior it is to a monument such as <em>120 Days of Sodom</em>. For example, I would stop the action at one of Sacher-Masoch’s idiotic little raptures about nature. Here you are reading the book for its lurid subject matter and this craphead of a writer has to interrupt it with an idyll to flowers or moonlight. If somebody ever wants to pay me—you couldn’t pay me enough—to translate this moronic tale, I’d take passages like this<br />
What solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The stars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems smooth, like a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.<br />
and translate it like this<br />
xxxx xxxxxxxxx! xxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx! x xxxxxxxxxxx xxxx. xxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxx xxxxxxx xx xxx xxxx-xxxx xxxxxxx. xxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx, xxxx x xxxxxx, xxxx x xxxxxxxx xx xxx xx x xxxx.<br />
or like this<br />
Fuck xxxxxxxxx! shit sperm pussy dildo! x xxxxxxxxxxx suck. Ass semen sodomy cunt cumshot xx tit fuck-fuck blowjob. Ass nipple whore sodomy, shit x rimjob, cunt x clitoris xx ass xx x fuck.<br />
or perhaps I’d just delete it. Why waste my time and yours? Or rather, why waste my time? Yours is a matter of indifference to me. You’re just a servile reader. Ugh. You disgust me. To paraphrase Wanda, you don’t mean any more than a dog — and dogs get kicked.This book is like the rim of a dirty toilet seat. If you want to lick it, I won’t be the one to stand in the way of your degradation. In fact, that may even be the best reason to publish the thing — so you can debase yourself with it. Prepare yourself, slave. Accept the punishment you deserve. Read this book. Do it. Now.<br />

Surely we can not just memorialize childhood, the lost hunters, lost stories, lost culture that came before us as the affirmative does.

<br />
Settlers have come, this is clear, but it is not the destruction of native cultures but the forced presenting of the natives that they depend on.

&quot;Rather than force the Indian into presence, as in the 1ac, we would follow a trace: the trace of difference which disrupts the manifest manner of presencing and simulating of the Indian which makes them knowable and controllable. We must look to this trace which is unknowable and unassimilated within the sytems of domination.Vizenor. 94 70-72<br />

the pressing question now is, of course, what to do about [nuclear waste, weapons/radiation/whatever]? how do we respond tot his terrible encroachment? should we reject the bomb and its terrible legacy, or embrace the prizes of our nuclear armament and the nearly unlimited power over the earth? but we refuse the aff's false choice between banishing or embracing nuclear technology, which would presencing only return to this force and annihilate the trace of difference.

Where the affirmative's nostalgia for Indian culture can only replay this colonialist simulation of the Indian, we would rather adopt this stance of reverence: that indefinable sense of awe at nuclear power which overwhelms us and strikes us dumb.

<h1 id="toc28"><a name="Nasty Brutish and Short"></a>Nasty Brutish and Short</h1>
In 1651, Hobbes said that life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short. There is no moral law that governs us, no principle of justice, rationality, or order. And the only way to win this order is through the violent imposition of a sovereign. Seeing that there is no sovereign in international relations, this gave rise to <em>realpolitik</em>: the belief that policy must be based on practical considerations rather than ideology or moralism.<br />
From Otto von Bismarck to Henry Kissinger, <em>realpolitik</em> has been the dominant theory guiding international relations for the past 200 years, but not without its challengers. Ever since Kant handed down his definitive articles for perpetual peace, IR scholars have held out hope for a new world government, to shore up the pitfalls Hobbes saw, but now grounded in rationality rather than oppression. However, the failure of the League of Nations, and the repeated failures of the United Nations to bring about order prove that this system can only proceed by opposing this real world to an ideal world of order and justice.<br />

Despite this, the affirmative holds out hope. If we would only remove TNW’s from Europe, we could at last have peace. This one gesture to Russia would signal that we can all come together to join hands and sing Kumbaya. But as should be clear, the world doesn’t work this way. Kant’s world of perpetual peace can only be a graveyard of perpetual peace, and their cosmopolitan vision can only be realized by eliminating all the obstacles in their way.Stavrakakis 99.The first response, on reoccupying the ... of the &quot;New Socialist Man.&quot;<br />
<span style="color: black;">This is particularly true in the case of nuclear weapons and Russia. We will not have perfect, peaceful coexistence post-plan. If we are to accept reality, we are left with three options: pacifism, conventional defense, or nuclear defense. Pacifism threatens to place us all in the gulag, while conventional war is even more dangerous than nuclear war. Only nuclear weapons can bring about the true reality principle – that war is not a crusade in which good wins out over evil, a belief which justified the genocides, wars, and pogroms of the past.

<span style="color: black;">The affirmative remains locked up with their ideals, constantly under siege, constantly finding the world unacceptable to the point of willed self-destruction.

From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances. In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite ... Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps. There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born. Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite. I say that the Library is unending. The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space. They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable. (The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.) Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: <em>The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.</em>There are five shelves for each of the hexagon's walls; each shelf contains thirty-five books of uniform format; each book is of four hundred and ten pages; each page, of forty lines, each line, of some eighty letters which are black in color. There are also letters on the spine of each book; these letters do not indicate or prefigure what the pages will say. I know that this incoherence at one time seemed mysterious. Before summarizing the solution (whose discovery, in spite of its tragic projections, is perhaps the capital fact in history) I wish to recall a few axioms.First: The Library exists <em>ab aeterno.</em> This truth, whose immediate corollary is the future eternity of the world, cannot be placed in doubt by any reasonable mind. Man, the imperfect librarian, may be the product of chance or of malevolent demiurgi; the universe, with its elegant endowment of shelves, of enigmatical volumes, of inexhaustible stairways for the traveler and latrines for the seated librarian, can only be the work of a god. To perceive the distance between the divine and the human, it is enough to compare these crude wavering symbols which my fallible hand scrawls on the cover of a book, with the organic letters inside: punctual, delicate, perfectly black, inimitably symmetrical.Second: <em>The orthographical symbols are twenty-five in number.</em> <a name="footnote1b"></a><span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html#footnote1" rel="nofollow">(1)</a></span> This finding made it possible, three hundred years ago, to formulate a general theory of the Library and solve satisfactorily the problem which no conjecture had deciphered: the formless and chaotic nature of almost all the books. One which my father saw in a hexagon on circuit fifteen ninety-four was made up of the letters MCV, perversely repeated from the first line to the last. Another (very much consulted in this area) is a mere labyrinth of letters, but the next-to-last page says <em>Oh time thy pyramids.</em> This much is already known: for every sensible line of straightforward statement, there are leagues of senseless cacophonies, verbal jumbles and incoherences. (I know of an uncouth region whose librarians repudiate the vain and superstitious custom of finding a meaning in books and equate it with that of finding a meaning in dreams or in the chaotic lines of one's palm ... They admit that the inventors of this writing imitated the twenty-five natural symbols, but maintain that this application is accidental and that the books signify nothing in themselves. This dictum, we shall see, is not entirely fallacious.)For a long time it was believed that these impenetrable books corresponded to past or remote languages. It is true that the most ancient men, the first librarians, used a language quite different from the one we now speak; it is true that a few miles to the right the tongue is dialectical and that ninety floors farther up, it is incomprehensible. All this, I repeat, is true, but four hundred and ten pages of inalterable MCV's cannot correspond to any language, no matter how dialectical or rudimentary it may be. Some insinuated that each letter could influence the following one and that the value of MCV in the third line of page 71 was not the one the same series may have in another position on another page, but this vague thesis did not prevail. Others thought of cryptographs; generally, this conjecture has been accepted, though not in the sense in which it was formulated by its originators.Five hundred years ago, the chief of an upper hexagon <a name="footnote2b"></a><span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html#footnote2" rel="nofollow">(2)</a></span> came upon a book as confusing as the others, but which had nearly two pages of homogeneous lines. He showed his find to a wandering decoder who told him the lines were written in Portuguese; others said they were Yiddish. Within a century, the language was established: a Samoyedic Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabian inflections. The content was also deciphered: some notions of combinative analysis, illustrated with examples of variations with unlimited repetition. These examples made it possible for a librarian of genius to discover the fundamental law of the Library. This thinker observed that all the books, no matter how diverse they might be, are made up of the same elements: the space, the period, the comma, the twenty-two letters of the alphabet. He also alleged a fact which travelers have confirmed: <em>In the vast Library there are no two identical books.</em> From these two incontrovertible premises he deduced that the Library is total and that its shelves register all the possible combinations of the twenty-odd orthographical symbols (a number which, though extremely vast, is not infinite): Everything: the minutely detailed history of the future, the archangels' autobiographies, the faithful catalogues of the Library, thousands and thousands of false catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of those catalogues, the demonstration of the fallacy of the true catalogue, the Gnostic gospel of Basilides, the commentary on that gospel, the commentary on the commentary on that gospel, the true story of your death, the translation of every book in all languages, the interpolations of every book in all books.When it was proclaimed that the Library contained all books, the first impression was one of extravagant happiness. All men felt themselves to be the masters of an intact and secret treasure. There was no personal or world problem whose eloquent solution did not exist in some hexagon. The universe was justified, the universe suddenly usurped the unlimited dimensions of hope. At that time a great deal was said about the Vindications: books of apology and prophecy which vindicated for all time the acts of every man in the universe and retained prodigious arcana for his future. Thousands of the greedy abandoned their sweet native hexagons and rushed up the stairways, urged on by the vain intention of finding their Vindication. These pilgrims disputed in the narrow corridors, proferred dark curses, strangled each other on the divine stairways, flung the deceptive books into the air shafts, met their death cast down in a similar fashion by the inhabitants of remote regions. Others went mad ... The Vindications exist (I have seen two which refer to persons of the future, to persons who are perhaps not imaginary) but the searchers did not remember that the possibility of a man's finding his Vindication, or some treacherous variation thereof, can be computed as zero.At that time it was also hoped that a clarification of humanity's basic mysteries -- the origin of the Library and of time -- might be found. It is verisimilar that these grave mysteries could be explained in words: if the language of philosophers is not sufficient, the multiform Library will have produced the unprecedented language required, with its vocabularies and grammars. For four centuries now men have exhausted the hexagons ... There are official searchers, <em>inquisitors.</em> I have seen them in the performance of their function: they always arrive extremely tired from their journeys; they speak of a broken stairway which almost killed them; they talk with the librarian of galleries and stairs; sometimes they pick up the nearest volume and leaf through it, looking for infamous words. Obviously, no one expects to discover anything.As was natural, this inordinate hope was followed by an excessive depression. The certitude that some shelf in some hexagon held precious books and that these precious books were inaccessible, seemed almost intolerable. A blasphemous sect suggested that the searches should cease and that all men should juggle letters and symbols until they constructed, by an improbable gift of chance, these canonical books. The authorities were obliged to issue severe orders. The sect disappeared, but in my childhood I have seen old men who, for long periods of time, would hide in the latrines with some metal disks in a forbidden dice cup and feebly mimic the divine disorder.Others, inversely, believed that it was fundamental to eliminate useless works. They invaded the hexagons, showed credentials which were not always false, leafed through a volume with displeasure and condemned whole shelves: their hygienic, ascetic furor caused the senseless perdition of millions of books. Their name is execrated, but those who deplore the treasures'' destroyed by this frenzy neglect two notable facts. One: the Library is so enormous that any reduction of human origin is infinitesimal. The other: every copy is unique, irreplaceable, but (since the Library is total) there are always several hundred thousand imperfect facsimiles: works which differ only in a letter or a comma. Counter to general opinion, I venture to suppose that the consequences of the Purifiers' depredations have been exaggerated by the horror these fanatics produced. They were urged on by the delirium of trying to reach the books in the Crimson Hexagon: books whose format is smaller than usual, all-powerful, illustrated and magical.We also know of another superstition of that time: that of the Man of the Book. On some shelf in some hexagon (men reasoned) there must exist a book which is the formula and perfect compendium //of all the rest:// some librarian has gone through it and he is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone vestiges of this remote functionary's cult still persist. Many wandered in search of Him. For a century they have exhausted in vain the most varied areas. How could one locate the venerated and secret hexagon which housed Him? Someone proposed a regressive method: To locate book A, consult first book B which indicates A's position; to locate book B, consult first a book C, and so on to infinity ... In adventures such as these, I have squandered and wasted my years. It does not seem unlikely to me that there is a total book on some shelf of the universe; [[#footnote3b]]&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;[[http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html#footnote3|(3)]]&lt;/span&gt; I pray to the unknown gods that a man -- just one, even though it were thousands of years ago! -- may have examined and read it. If honor and wisdom and happiness are not for me, let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my place be in hell. Let me be outraged and annihilated, but for one instant, in one being, let Your enormous Library be justified. The impious maintain that nonsense is normal in the Library and that the reasonable (and even humble and pure coherence) is an almost miraculous exception. They speak (I know) of the feverish Library whose chance volumes are constantly in danger of changing into others and affirm, negate and confuse everything like a delirious divinity.'' These words, which not only denounce the disorder but exemplify it as well, notoriously prove their authors' abominable taste and desperate ignorance. In truth, the Library includes all verbal structures, all variations permitted by the twenty-five orthographical symbols, but not a single example of absolute nonsense. It is useless to observe that the best volume of the many hexagons under my administration is entitled <em>The Combed Thunderclap</em> and another <em>The Plaster Cramp</em> and another <em>Axaxaxas mlö.</em> These phrases, at first glance incoherent, can no doubt be justified in a cryptographical or allegorical manner; such a justification is verbal and, <em>ex hypothesi,</em> already figures in the Library. I cannot combine some characters</span><span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-family: Garamond;">dhcmrlchtdj</span></em> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">which the divine Library has not foreseen and which in one of its secret tongues do not contain a terrible meaning. No one can articulate a syllable which is not filled with tenderness and fear, which is not, in one of these languages, the powerful name of a god. To speak is to fall into tautology. This wordy and useless epistle already exists in one of the thirty volumes of the five shelves of one of the innumerable hexagons -- and its refutation as well. (An <em>n</em> number of possible languages use the same vocabulary; in some of them, the symbol <em>library</em> allows the correct definition <em>a ubiquitous and lasting system of hexagonal galleries,</em> but <em>library</em> is <em>bread</em> or <em>pyramid</em> or anything else, and these seven words which define it have another value. You who read me, are You sure of understanding my language?)The methodical task of writing distracts me from the present state of men. The certitude that everything has been written negates us or turns us into phantoms. I know of districts in which the young men prostrate themselves before books and kiss their pages in a barbarous manner, but they do not know how to decipher a single letter. Epidemics, heretical conflicts, peregrinations which inevitably degenerate into banditry, have decimated the population. I believe I have mentioned suicides, more and more frequent with the years. Perhaps my old age and fearfulness deceive me, but I suspect that the human species -- the unique species -- is about to be extinguished, but the Library will endure: illuminated, solitary, infinite, perfectly motionless, equipped with precious volumes, useless, incorruptible, secret.I have just written the word ``infinite.'' I have not interpolated this adjective out of rhetorical habit; I say that it is not illogical to think that the world is infinite. Those who judge it to be limited postulate that in remote places the corridors and stairways and hexagons can conceivably come to an end -- which is absurd. Those who imagine it to be without limit forget that the possible number of books does have such a limit. I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient problem: <em>The Library is unlimited and cyclical.</em> If an eternal traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope. <a name="footnote4b"></a><span style="color: blue;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jubal.westnet.com/hyperdiscordia/library_of_babel.html#footnote4" rel="nofollow">(4)</a></span></span><br />

In the Book of Revelations, we’re told: “And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood; and the stars of the heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth her unripe figs when she is shaken of a great wind. And the heaven was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span><br />
On August 6, 1945 Hiroshima experienced this Apocalypse, 3 days later Nagasaki. Akiko Takatura explains: “it was like a white magnesium flash. I lost consciousness … at the same time I saw the flash. When I regained consciousness, I found myself in the dark. … After a while, a whirlpool of fire approached us from the south. It was like a big tornado of fire spreading over the full width of the street. Whenever the fire touched, wherever the fire touched, it burned. … It was just like a living hell. … Hiroshima was entirely covered with only three colors. I remember red, black and brown, but, but, nothing else.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn2|[2]]]</span><br />
Hiroshima and Nagasaki carry the form of apocalypse throughout history, an apocalypse with remainder, preserved in the archives. These accounts allow the affirmative to work through the bombing, to mourn, memorialize, and displace the trauma, inverting the form of literature. In Ulysses, we see the opposite form, the collection of an archive, so complete and litered with literary debris, Joyce had to publish a cheat-sheet for literary critics,<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn3|[3]]]</span> only to be wiped away by remainderless destruction. THIS is the form of literature, of nuclear war: apocalypse without revelation. The affirmative eschews this, instead taking up the Christian Eschatological form where they unite unveiling and the horrors of August, 1945.<br />

<span style="color: black;">Don’t forget the meaning of the word Apocalypse: “from the Church Latin apocalypsis, revelation, which … derives from Greek apokalyptein, uncover. … John of Patmos’ book of Revelation was called Apokalypsis … but was changed to “Revelations” 50 years later.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span> The affirmative diagnoses an apocalyptic tension, this uncanny feeling which accompanied people living under the threat of nuclear war. However, the look backwards to locate it, to the bombing of Japan. As Leopold Bloom says, “Our national epic has yet to be written.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn2|[2]]]</span> The nuclear weapons exist, promising salvation from hostile threats, or the destruction of the entire archive, and life on Earth with it. This uncanny feeling you experience is like the Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament seen by Bloom on that day in June, 1904, preparing for the apocalypse, whether that means rising to heaven or hell on Earth.<br />
This is the condition of life under nuclear weapons – this monstrous uncanniness. But while the affirmative looks backwards, to historical trauma which can be grappled with and assimilated into the same unitary whole they critique, we would look forward, with Joyce in Ulysses, to the destruction of the archive.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Paul K.</span><span style="color: black;"> <u>Saint-Amour</u> </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(assistant professor of English at Pomona College). “Bombing and the Symptom: Traumatic Earliness and the Nuclear Uncanny.” Diacritics, 30:4. </span><span style="color: black;"> <u>2000</u>.<br />

Anyone who’s read Ulysses is immediately struck by the detailed archiving, the lists of properties, locations, people, events, all of which Joyce carefully verifies and documents. We can see a similar archiving in the 1AC, to a lesser degree, with one important difference: If you look up Leopold or Molly Bloom, Stephen Dedalus or Buck Mulligan, you will find no trace, as if they’ve been erased from the archive, never to have existed. It recalls Dadelus’ claim: <span style="color: black;">“History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span><br />
Ulysses tropes the apocalypse, but no apocalypse that can be known or located. Rather, the complete destruction of the archive, which will either be averted, leaving us unfulfilled, or carried out and therefore unrepresentable. Thus, we follow Joyce and offer apocalypse without revelation, although maybe its’ revelation without apocalypse.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">Paul K.</span><span style="color: black;"> <u>Saint-Amour</u> </span><span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">(assistant professor of English at Pomona College). “Bombing and the Symptom: Traumatic Earliness and the Nuclear Uncanny.” Diacritics, 30:4. </span><span style="color: black;"> <u>2000</u>. </span><br />

“Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to Christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery, recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils.
