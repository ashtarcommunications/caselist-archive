<strong>Pre Shirley Disclosure<br />
The Desert</strong><br />
<br />
Malcolm has seen the affirmative a number of times and has a really good description of the aff, but here's a bit more:<br />
<br />
following many of our spanos arguments, we affirm the topical nothing.<br />
<br />
Reading from Authors like John Beck, Masahide Kato and Valerie Kuletz we notice the metaphysical path when confronted by the trope of the desert operates under the same metaphysical dictates as many practices of insturmental, &quot;topical&quot; debate.<br />
<br />
Spanos says that in context of nuclear weapons we must begin to think this space of in-between, this rift. He frames our current sociopolitical occasion as a time of in-between as well - a no more of the gods that have fled and the not yet of the god that is coming in contrast to fukyama's representation of this time as the end of history.<br />
<br />
We also read from Robert Marzec who talks about our relationship to the land - it shows the way capital is grafted onto landscapes.<br />

 The aff indicts Western metaphysics' desire to create the world into binaries, with one being considered full and productive and the other void of value, fit to be objectified and abused. This has been the root of American imperialism, with things like nuclear testing, mining, and waste all being done in the desert. This is because the desert is seen as absent of life and value-the unproductive end of a binary. The affirmative affirms the nothing of the resolution, acknowledging that any metaphysical statement contains within it both a supposedly filled material logic and a space of emptiness that is glossed over, and thus becomes an exceptional space that must be conquered or made productive. Affirming the desert is key because it is devoid of metaphysics. Theory has for too long abandoned the category of ontology, so we must begin there. The debate doesn't leave the room all that matters is how we are trained to act.<br />

The Nuclear Indian<br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Despite governmental attempts to cover up its past, in 1946 based on a capitalist ethic of divine right and exploitation, the United States began its policy of nuclear testing on indigenous nations and in 1954 the Marshall Islands were targeted by the first dirty bomb creatively named “Bravo”. Meanwhile the indigenous peoples living on the islands were deemed as no more than savage and therefore suitable guinea pigs in order to test the effects of radiation. The aftermath of these bombs has resulted in some of the greatest atrocities seen throughout history. Furthermore, these are not issues of the past but ones that still continue to haunt indigenous people today causing dispossession, and destroying their culture, autonomy and lives all in the name of national security. In a 1987 interview Jenny Dowell and Patrick Flanagan discuss further the nuclear destruction that many indigenous people have been forced to face over the last sixty years.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Traditionally, debate produces a particular type of scholarship that consistently ignores and rejects alternative viewpoints and systems of knowledge. We believe that nuclear weapons are a necessary technological development that protects our great nation from foreign predators, all the while forgetting about those that have to endure the repercussions of nuclear development, those on the margins that have felt the violence of colonization and western imperialism. It is our advocacy that that we should interrupt the dominant paradigm embedded within academia by investigating other forms of knowledge production in order to make liberation possible.<br />
