<br />
</span><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">The 1AC anxiety about the destructive power of nuclear weapons serves as a smokescreen for a global economy built on the death-trafficking of conventional arms which sanitizes and justifies the perpetuation of everyday violence against the sacrificial periphery. The micropolitics of this debate round form the conditions of possibility for macropolitical action and as citizens we are responsible for the effects of the political culture that we justify. Our alternative is acceptance of our nuclear reality. Instead of using anxiety about the future to flee from the violence present we need to learn to be at peace with destruction itself as a natural process and thereby creating the universal foundation for a lasting global peace. Our framework for the debate is not about anxiously choosing the lesser political evil but rather re-orienting our inner selves towards anger through acceptance and wisdom of the world. This re-orientation is a prerequisite both to the 1AC impact claims and understanding the value of human life that prevents all macropolitical violence. </span><br />

The 1AC narrative of state bureaucrats as professionalized crisis managers is a delusion arising out of ultra-nationalistic Cold War narratives which sought to obscure the true end of the arms race and ultimately the Cold War itself lay in the hands of citizen activism and the largest mass movement in modern history: the antinuclear movement. Their framing of nuclear control around nation-state power re-entrenches this nationalistic narrative of coercive control that makes arms racing and planetary nuclear destruction inevitable<br />

Institutionalizing the strategy is death for the antinuclear movement since the political game is already rigged in favor of powerful militaristic interests in the defense industry.

Apocalypse is the flip-side book-end of humanity’s original Eden. Their hysterical call to retreat from environmentally destructive practices foregrounds an artificially pure environmental state presided over by a false moral parables of human error that have somehow deviated from the natural environmental code of ethics. Nothing could be more laughable; the natural world springs forth from chaos, and our moral regulations will never be able to restrict consumption because of their inability to appeal to empirical reality to restrict human action. Their play of environmental doom perversely casts us as fallen angels who have angered our god-Mother Nature and demand apocalyptic punishment to expiate our sins.<br />

This nodal point around...nodal point.<br />

This drive for unifying principles is self-defeating and provides the justification for the violent eradication of so-called &quot;the industrial man&quot;. This search for causes and solutions of environmental destruction turns into a violent witch-hunt for convenient scapegoats and is the same justification used for the Nazi’s to find unity around the destruction of the Jews. Industrialization are not the problem, rather it is the divisions of society that authorize grotesque consumptive practices by those who are powerful enough to point the finger.

The affirmative poses the question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves with the reorientation of our collective political spheres takes precedent and in the process produces these ethics and our relationship with others merely as a background for political transformations. The affirmative makes the question not how much how we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces a mediated relationship that makes genuine ethical engagement impossible.<br />

In other words,...a priori.<br />
<br />
The affirmative will respond that the plan and the political play no prominent role in the posture of the 1AC. This, however, is the premise of our whole argument. Their belief that the political must remain in the background nonetheless, in order to generate change is the ultimate sell-out of their ethical commitment. This gesture is intrinsically unethical because it admits from the get-go that the ethical posture itself is insufficient absent its capacity to generate change within the domain of institutional politics.<br />
