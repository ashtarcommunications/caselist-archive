<strong>We are confronted by values that are incommensurable – responding to the call of the Other is incompatible with their contingent objection. Their scheme of decisionmaking requires that pure utilitarian consequences are the only way to make decisions. This is untrue and is a violent way to approach the world. Utilitarianism’s failure to account for alterity must be questioned before any responsible decision can be made.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Numerous jurisprudential books and articles have recently appeared on the topic of value incommensurability.</span><span style="font-size: 6.0pt;">. This hybridization of the two schools of thought will provide ethical grounding for legal incommensurability theorists, and political grounding for Levinasian critical theory.<br />

<strong>The securitized calculations in the disad derive from a mutually reinforcing cascade of discourses that preordain militarism and violence as necessary. We must adopt new perspectives such as the affirmative before we can begin to understand violence</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">What I take from Heidegger's argument -- one that I have sought to extend by analysing the militaristic power of modern ontologies of political existence and security -- is a view that </span><span class="underline">the challenge is posed </span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">not merely by a few varieties of weapon, government, technology or policy, but </span><span class="underline">by an overarching system of thinking and understanding that lays claim to our entire space of truth and existence</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. </span><span class="underline">Will our thought?</span><br />

<strong>Their arguments rely on the mathematical calculations of interest that MUST be transcended and moved beyond to actualize ethics – they can win all of their arguments that the plan might be unethical in conventional (i.e. body-count) senses, but this is precisely our argument – radical ethics, which is the only way to solve our aff, requires precisely this transgression of commonly accepted forms of ethics.</strong><br />

In order to assume his absolute responsibility with respect to absolute duty, to put his faith in God to work, or to the test, he must also in reality remain a hateful murderer, for he consents to put to death. Secrecy is essential to the exercise of this absolute responsibility as sacrificial responsibility.<br />

<strong>Our alternative is a deconstructive ethos. This responds to the call of the Other by recognizing the fallibility of the self and enacting a conversation with alterity. Only this deconstructive conversation avoids an imperialist colonization of the Other</strong><br />
