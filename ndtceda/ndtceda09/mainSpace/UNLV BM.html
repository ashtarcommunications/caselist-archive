OBSERVATION 1: War is inevitable<br />
<br />
A) War with China is Inevitable – We Must Strike Now Before They Begin to Match Our Military Strength<br />
<br />
Winslow, ‘9 <br />
[Lance, 9/2 founder of “online think tank” focusing on international affairs, If a Future War With China is Inevitable, What Are the US Options Now? <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?If-a-Future-War-With-China-is-Inevitable,-What-Are-the-US-Options-Now?&amp;id=2857751" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?If-a-Future-War-With-China-is-Inevitable,-What-Are-the-US-Options-Now?&amp;id=2857751</a><br />
<br />
Many military analysts and observers, and historical studiers of Chinese culture, anthropology, and even Sun Tzu believe that one day the United States of America will go to war against China. Interestingly enough, I am one of those individuals which believes this, and my observations China's behavior in the world are what lead me to this conclusion.<br />
First, China has no adversaries AND something for pretending to be friendly. <br />
<br />
2) Chinese modernization is part of a strategy of inevitable conflict with the US – China will gain superiority in a decade<br />
<br />
SCHNEIDER, National Institute for Public Policy, 2009<br />

<br />
Still, there is one growing AND government diverting their passions to war.<br />

It is common knowledge that the AND or in the worst case execution.<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION 2: WIN NOW OR LOSE LATER<br />
<br />
A)    U.S. will win a war now: <br />
1) China’s nuclear force is limited and vulnerable now.<br />

<br />
China's nuclear arsenal is even more AND stealthy nuclear-armed cruise missiles.<br />

        2) The US can successfully first strike China: primacy high now.<br />

<br />
This debate may now seem like AND primacy for many years to come.<br />
<br />
3) U.S. can take out every target in China with a relatively small portion of our arsenal<br />

Even a rough comparison of the AND cause massive civilian and industrial damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
B)    We know where Chinese mobile ICBMs are, and we know how to defeat them—they do NOT make a first strike impractical <br />

<br />
The Chinese Navy appears to be AND noise level, they're very detectable.&quot;<br />
<br />
2)    Jin not operational yet and is super noisy &amp; highly vulnerable<br />
Kristensen, 3-2-10 [Hans, Jin SSBN Flashes its Tubes, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2010/03/jinflash.php#more-2766" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2010/03/jinflash.php#more-2766</a>]<br />

Observation 3 is preempts<br />
<br />
1.Nuclear war won’t cause extinction-it will be concentrated in the northern hemisphere<br />

The human species faces numerous threats AND extinction with respect to single events. <br />
<br />
2.Fallout doesn’t result in extinction-prominent researchers conclude<br />

Two researchers, Starley Thompson and AND , staying indoors may even suffice. <br />

Nuclear winter is the theory that AND nuclear winter hypothesis has been discredited.  <br />

US nuclear weapons not on LOW status or hair trigger alert<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Arms Control, 2007 </span></span><br />
[Text of Nov. 28 E-mail from Strategic Command responding to ACT's questions on the alert status of U.S. nuclear weapons November 2007 www.armscontrol.org/interviews/20071204_STRATCOM]<br />
<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Q1) If &quot;hair-trigger alert&quot; and &quot;launch-on-warning&quot; are incorrect terms for describing the status of US forces on alert, what is the proper term? A1) </span><span class="underline">U.S. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">nuclear forces are not on “hair trigger” alert. The term “hair trigger” ignores the safeguards, deliberate actions, and procedures required in order to employ nuclear weapons</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> The U.S. nuclear force posture has evolved </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">since the end of the Cold War. Only a portion of the operationally deployed U.S. nuclear forces is maintained on a ready alert status</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> No strategic bombers, 450 Minuteman III IBCMs, and a small number of SSBNs at sea are on alert at any given time. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">U.S. policy is not to rely on a &quot;launch on warning&quot; strategy. U.S. strategic forces are postured to provide maximum flexibility so the U.S. is not faced with a “use or lose” dilemma.</span> A major strike on the U.S. would be required to eliminate the responsive ICBM capability. The ICBM force could be launched prior to impact, but only if the President were to direct such an action. In addition, should the ICBM force not be able to respond, the U.S. SSBNs at sea could deliver an overwhelming response if directed by the President.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> Should the international security situation call for it, the U.S. could bring its nuclear forces to a higher state of readiness (i.e., “generated alert”), putting a larger portion of its submarines to sea and returning heavy bombers to alert, to increase their survivability. Q2) The US government has made statements to the effect of as long asnuclear weapons exist it is necessary for us to keep some portion of our forces at some level of alert. What is the proper description or term for that &quot;level of alert?&quot; A2) See answer 1. </span><span class="underline">A <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">portion of U.S. nuclear forces are on day-to-day alert. Since the end of the Cold War, however, the U.S. has reduced dramatically both the overall number of nuclear weapon</span>s</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> and nuclear systems </span><span class="underline">maintained on day-to-day alert.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> To ensure deterrence, U.S. nuclear forces must be postured such that, under any credible scenario, a sufficient number of nuclear weapons would survive to respond to an aggressor’s attempt to carry out a disabling attack on the U.S. The proper term would be “on day-to-day alert”. Q3) The US government statement also noted that US forces have evolved away from &quot;rapid reaction high alert levels.&quot; Is that the proper term to describe the alert status of some US nuclear weapons systems today? A3) The U.S. nuclear force posture has evolved since the end of the Cold War. Only a small portion of our SSBNs and the 450 Minuteman III ICBMs remain on day-to-day alert. Nuclear capable bombers have been removed from alert status, but could be re-postured in a national crisis and additional SSBNs could be generated to alert status. Q4) Has the US completely stopped this previous practice of &quot;rapid reaction high alert?&quot; A4) See answer 3. Q5) What measures marked this shift? What steps were taken that no longer classifies or makes US weapons as on &quot;rapid reaction high alert?&quot; A5) Under the 1991 Presidential Nuclear Initiatives, all nuclear bombers were removed from alert. Only the Minuteman III ICBM and a small portion of our SSBN force remain on day-to-day alert and neither force is targeted against any country. All 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs, 50 Minutemen III ICBMs, the B-1 Bomber fleet, and four SSBNs have been deactivated or removed from strategic service. Q6) The USG statement further said that &quot;few of the operationally deployed US nuclear forces are maintained on a ready alert status.&quot; What is meant by the term few? A6) Only the Minuteman III ICBM force and a small number of SSBNs are on day-to-day alert. Q7) Independent nongovernmental analysts say that regardless of what the alert status is called, the reality is that some US nuclear weapons are capable of being fired in &quot;minutes.&quot; Is that assertion accurate? A7) The United States maintains the ability to launch its nuclear weapons in a timely basis as directed by the President. Minuteman III ICBMs are designed to be capable of delivering a rapid response prior to being struck by an adversary’s ballistic missile force. This is an important aspect of our deterrent because it complicates an opponents’ pre-emptive strike planning. However, </span><span class="underline">the fundamental fact is that U.S. forces are postured such that the President is not confronted with a “use or lose” situation in that other strategic forces could be directed to respond to an attack</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. See answer 1. Q8) In a Nov. 6 paper, nongovernmental analyst Bruce </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Blair wrote</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">&quot;the fact remains that the US posture is still geared for firing thousands of weapons with a few minutes.&quot; Is that an accurate statement?</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> A8) </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">No, this is not true</span>. Under the Moscow Treaty, the U.S. will have only 1700</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">-2200 </span><span class="underline">operationally deployed nuclear weapons. The U.S. is well on its way to achieving this limit. Only a portion of these are on day-to-day alert.</span><br />

<span class="underline">If the proponents for de-alerting admit a theoretical possibility of accidental or non-authorized launch of strategic missiles, one should recall that the Russian side did propose discussing jointly the ways to enforce guarantees of excluding such a possibility.

<br />
Framework<br />
A.) Intepretation: Debate should be a question of process rather than outcomes. This requires the affirmative prove the methodology that guides their policy prescriptions is superior to the alternative because methodological shapes the nature of political process<br />
<br />
B.) Prefer our interpretation<br />
<br />
1.) Education: Critical theory challenges our assumptions about the nature of politics and the content of the resolution; exclusion of these perspectives limits educational breadth to realist-exclusive frameworks.<br />
<br />
2.) Ground: Critical theory is an important element of political academia; testing the methodological assumptions of their advocacy is a key aspect of negative ground in order to investigate the historical and prospective implications their approach to policy would justify.<br />
<br />
3.) Fairness: Threshold for acceptability should be on the link level; if we can win a causative relation between nuclear weapons policy and the implications of the methodology we criticize, you should allow the critique. Non-topic specific criticisms should be excluded for their standards.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">State–centrism is the point at issue in the next section. Suffice it to say here that in his initial formulation of the speech act theory of security, Wæver attempted to yoke his insights concerning securitization to a thoroughgoing state–centrism (Wæver 1994, 1995). As we have seen, he was interested only in how states securitized issues in order to justify extraordinary measures by states: </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Wæver viewed the grammar of security as inherently statist. In doing so he actually undermined much of the usefulness of the speech act approach. Its (potential) great strength is that it encourages analysts to interrogate the politics of how particular threats are securitized in order to mobilize and legitimate particular responses to them</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span> <span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">States</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, or even state elites</span><span class="Emphasis2">, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are not the only actors who use the grammar of security in this way. All kinds of social groups, at both sub– and supra–state levels, attempt to securitize many different types of issues, often with far–reaching sociocultural, political, and economic implications</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> Consider, for example, how the peace movement of the 1980s identified nuclearism as a threat to security (e.g., Falk and Lifton 1982; E. Thompson 1982b) and generated massive public support for its cause despite bitter opposition from governments. Or the way in which some Welsh–language activists have identified the flow of substantial numbers of so–called lifestyle migrants from England to rural Wales as a threat to the survival of the language and thus, in their view, to Welsh nationhood. </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Adopting a speech act approach to the politics of security as practiced by groups other than the state is a fruitful avenue for exploration</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. Yet Wæver’s state–centrism initially led him to attempt to delegitimate any effort in this direction. Significantly, however, this position has now been reversed. In his collaborative study Security: A New Framework for Analysis, Wæver and his co–authors, Buzan and de Wilde, have decoupled the speech act approach from state–centrism, correctly acknowledging the distinction between “a state–centric approach and a state–dominated field [of study]” (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998: 37). 1 It is arguable, however, that </span><span class="underline">a more fundamental problem remains in Wæver’s particular understanding of speech act theory itself. Wæver seems to regard the content of security as fixed; that is, he believes that the implications of calling an issue a “security problem” cannot be challenged, only the objects to which that label is applied</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. In the earlier, </span><span class="underline">avowedly state–centric version of speech act theory</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, Wæver viewed the consequences of securitization as inherently conservative: </span><span class="underline">“The language game of security is... a jus necessitatis for threatened elites, and this it must remain</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">” (Wæver 1995: 56). This broad thrust has been retained (including the state–centrism?) in the latest formulation of the theory, which argues that to securitize an issue is to render it “so important that it should not be exposed to the normal haggling of politics but should be dealt with decisively by top leaders prior to other issues” (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998: 29). But </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the notion that the implications of securitization—the meaning of security—are fixed can be challenged at both the empirical level and at the level of the theory of language</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">. Empirically</span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, there can be no doubt that the theory and practice of traditional security have come under unprecedented scrutiny over the past twenty or so years.</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;"> In particular, </span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">notions of “common security” have been advanced based on the argument that there can be no long–term resolution of threats through unilateral, militarized, zero–sum action</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">. Rather</span><span class="underline"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, it is only a holistic and empathetic approach to security that can hope to ameliorate threats</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (the emergence of such an approach can be traced through the following independent, international commissions: the Commission on International Development Issues [1980]; the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues [1982]; the Commission on Global Governance [1995]). Moreover, </span><span class="underline">the experience of the end of the Cold War demonstrates that such a conception of security can become influential</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (a point returned to and developed further in Chapter 6). This suggests that contrary to the opinions of Wæver or indeed Deudney</span><span class="Emphasis2">, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the meaning of security is not necessarily fixed but is open to argumentation and dispute</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. Theoretically, this criticism of Wæver is buttressed by a Habermasian understanding of speech acts. Habermas’s “universal pragmatics,” which forms the general framework for his understanding of speech acts, was outlined in Chapter 3. His specific views on speech acts are summarized by Outhwaite: Contra conceptions of language as just a factual representation of states of affairs, or their negative counterpart in which it is seen as mere rhetoric, [in Habermas’s approach] the three validity–claims of truth, normative rightness and expressive truthfulness or sincerity are given equal importance. (Outhwaite 1994: 131) </span><span class="underline">This understanding of speech acts has major implications for alternative approaches to the theory and practice of security</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. It suggests that </span><span class="Emphasis2">when <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the label “security” is attached to particular issues, it generates validity–claims that are open to redemption or refutation through argumentation</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> Thus, for example, if a state treats the continued existence of a minority language within its borders as a threat to national security (as is the case with Turkey and Kurdish, and as was the case until recently with the United Kingdom and Irish), </span><span class="underline">this behavior is susceptible to critique on the grounds of truth, rightness, and sincerity</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. In this case, the truth of the claim that a minority language is a threat to the state may be questioned. The normative rightness of persecuting a minority culture in the name of national security may also be called into doubt, as well the sincerity of those advocating this policy (whose interests are really being served by such a claim?). </span><span class="underline">Another example of how validity–claims are brought into play through the use of the term “security” is a decision by a government to base another state’s nuclear weapons on its territory to counter a threat that it perceives as emanating from a third country</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (as was the case with the deployment of U.S. cruise missiles in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s). In this case </span><span class="underline">the questions that might arise during the process of redeeming the validity–claims implicit in this scenario would include: Does the third country really pose a threat to the state deciding to host nuclear weapons? What is the evidence concerning both material capabilities and intentions? Could not nuclear weapons and nuclearism pose a greater threat to security than any putative aggressor? Is it right to threaten death and destruction to millions of innocents in the name of national security? Should a state be privileged in this way?</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> Is the decision to deploy nuclear weapons a sincere response to a perceived threat, or is it a result of intra–alliance politics? Or does it reflect pressure from a self–interested military–industrial–academic complex? As these examples demonstrate, </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">once security discourse is viewed in terms of a series of validity–claims subject to redemption through argumentation rather than a take–it–or–leave–it package of militarized assumptions and responses, a more fluid picture emerges</span></span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> than the one presented by Wæver or Deudney. Understood in Habermasian terms, </span><span class="underline">the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">speech act of security cannot simply be narrowed by prior definition to exclude all threats other than those that are military in nature</span></span><span style="background: yellow; font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">—</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">rather, </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the breadth of the concept is subject to debate</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> Similarly, the </span><span class="underline">meaning—the implications—of securitizing a particular issue cannot be regarded as fixed.</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> However, I am not arguing that it is easy to challenge the traditions that are attached to a particular concept</span><span class="underline">. Simply to talk about something differently does not necessarily lead to different forms of behavior: Practice cannot simply be reduced to theory</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. </span><span class="Emphasis2"><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">But argumentation and disputation can have—and have had—profound effects even on the practice of securi</span>ty</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (a theme pursued in Chapter 6). When anchored in Habermasian pragmatics</span><span class="underline">, the speech act approach to security supports arguments for broadening the understanding of the concept and certainly undermines attempts at closure as a result of prior definition rather than argumentation and discussion</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. More generally, the focus on how arguments concerning truth, rightness, and sincerity are brought into play by security discourse provides powerful theoretical support for the project of critical security studies.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="underline">How</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, then, </span><span class="underline">can one develop an approach to strategy that is congruent within the overall set of assumptions that frame critical security studies? One obvious point of departure would be to subject traditional security understandings of strategy to an immanent critique that compares the field’s self–image</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, which in Europe, at least, </span><span class="underline">regards a concern with ends and consequences as an inherent part of the enterprise, with the instrumental, means–fetishism of so much strategy. </span><span class="Emphasis2">If such a critique could be successfully coupled with a move to critique the actual ends pursued—the privileging of the state</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, for example—</span><span class="Emphasis2">then it would certainly be a notable improvement on the current situation</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. But the critical theory argument reconstructed in the first three chapters of this book is not that proponents of traditional theory are all conservative, although some may be, or that they are moral inadequates, although doubtless some are, but rather that the epistemological assumptions underlying their work leads to analysis that is pro–status quo and amoral. According to this perspective, stra</span><span class="underline">tegy cannot be redeemed or reconstructed simply by attaching a concern with ends onto the actual practice of contemporary strategic thought. The atrophy of strategy—the tendency to concentrate solely on means—is a result of the assumptions made by strategists about what constitutes knowledge: most important, the relationship between fact and value and subject and object</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. </span><span class="Emphasis2">Thus to transform strategy in a direction more attuned to the approach of critical security studies requires a fundamental transformation of the epistemological basis of the enterprise</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> (see Bonß’s critique of Horkheimer in Chapter 2). Parenthetically, I submit that concern with epistemology points to the difference between critical security studies and much of peace research, two approaches that seem to have much in common. According </span><span class="underline">to a critical theory–informed perspective, </span><span class="Emphasis2">the attempt to utilize traditional methodology within a broader normative, peace–oriented framework</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">—an approach that is prevalent in peace research—</span><span class="Emphasis2">simply generates a contradictory intellectual project that must eventually succumb to conformism if the methodological logic is allowed to dominate or will collapse into pure idealism if the normative program is not supported by a different mode of analysis</span><span class="underline">. What is required</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, therefore, </span><span class="underline">is a mode of analysis that recognizes two points: that it is not enough to combine traditional modes of analysis with a commitment to emancipation, and that ends and means are not somehow casually related but are mutually implicated. As a result of such recognition, analysis will focus on the actually–existing possibilities for change arising from a hardheaded, historically grounded reading of the present</span><span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">. I argue that a particularly useful model for such an approach in the field of strategy is provided by Andrew Feenberg’s critical theory of technology (see Chapter 3). </span><br />

Yet, <strong><u>the very rage for calculability which securing security incites is precisely also what reduces human freedom, inducing either despair or the surrender of what is human to the de-humanising calculative logic of what seems to be necessary to secure security</u></strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span> I think, then, that Hannah Arendt was right when she saw late modern humankind caught in a dangerous world-destroying cleft between a belief that everything is possible and a willingness to surrender itself to so-called laws of necessity (calculability itself) which would make everything possible. That it was, in short, characterised by a combination of reckless omnipotence and reckless despair. But I also think that things have gone one stage further— <strong><u>the surrender to the necessity of realising everything that is possible— and that this found its paradigmatic expression</u></strong>, for example, <strong><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in the deterrent security policies of the Cold War; where everything up to and including self-immolation not only became possible but actually necessary in the interests of (inter)national security.</span></u></strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> <strong><u>This logic persists in the metaphysical core of modern politics</u></strong></span>— the axioms of interState security relations, popularised, for example, through strategic discourse— even if the details have changed.<br />

2.) The logic of calculability legitimizes genocidal oppression to enforce sovereign authority<br />

Otherness is born(e) within the self as an integral part of itself and in such a way that it always remains an inherent stranger to itself.&quot; It derives from the lack, absence, or ineradicable incompleteness which comes from having no security of tenure within or over that of which the self is a particular hermeneutical manifestation; namely, being itself. <strong><u>The point about the human</u></strong>, betrayed by this absence, <strong><u>is precisely that it is not sovereignly self-possessed and complete,</u></strong> enjoying undisputed tenure in and of itself. <strong><u>Modes of justice</u></strong> therefore <strong><u>reliant upon such a subject lack the very foundations in the self that they most violently insist upon seeing inscribed there</u></strong>. This does not, however, mean that the dissolution of the subject also entails the dissolution of Justice.Quite the reverse. <strong><u>The subject was never a firm foundation for justice, much less a hospitable vehicle for the reception of the call of another Justice. It was never in possession of that self-possession which was supposed to secure the certainty of itself, of a self-possession that would enable it ultimately to adjudicate everyth</u></strong>ing. The very indexicality required of sovereign subjectivity gave rise rather to a commensurability much more amenable to the expendability required of the political and material economies of mass societies than it did to the singular, invaluable, and uncanny uniqueness of the self. <strong><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">The value of the subject became the standard unit of currency for the political arithmetic of States and the political economies of capitalism</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">They trade in it still to devastating global effect. The technologisation of the political has become manifest and global.Economies of evaluation necessarily require calculability</span></u></strong>. Thus no valuation without mensuration and no mensuration without indexation. <strong><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Once rendered calculable</span></u></strong>, however, <strong><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">units of account are necessarily submissible not only to valuation but also, of course, to devaluation. Devaluation</span></u></strong>, logically<strong><u>, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">can extend to the point of counting as nothing</span></u></strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span> Hence, no mensuration without demensuration either. There is nothing abstract about this: <strong><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the declension of economies of value leads to the zero point of holocaust</span></u></strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">.</span> However liberating and emancipating systems of value-rights-may claim to be, for example, they run the risk of counting out the invaluable. Counted out, the invaluable may then lose its purchase on life. Herewith, then, the necessity of championing the invaluable itself. For we must never forget that, &quot;we are dealing always with whatever exceeds measure. But how does that necessity present itself? Another Justice answers: as the surplus of the duty to answer to the claim of Justice over rights. That duty, as with the advent of another Justice, is integral to the lack constitutive of the human way of being.<br />
