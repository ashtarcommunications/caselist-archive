The doctrine of deterrence paradoxically fused arms with monuments as it defused the explosive potential of the bomb; deterrence robs the arsenal of its materiality and projects into a political textual economy ripe for critical scholarship. Nuclear posturing has become a game of simulation and surveillance legitimated through the discourse of scientific rationality and nationalism.<br />

In displacing the materiality of the bomb, deterrence configures nuclear war as fabulously textual - the Latin fabula, a story, a fable whose writing and rewriting on the palimpsest of political discourse we must acknowledge and reclaim. The stark reality of nuclear explosives is inseparable from the fable of the war, an event which is only the signified referent of discourse but which nevertheless molds our consciousness and our politics.<br />

If there is no truth there can be no Apocalypse. The dominant nuclear strategy as rhetorical simulation invests and embeds our discursive energies in the logic of techno-scientific understanding and thereby eliminates the space for criticism as it collapses the possibility of human imagination into the totality of transcendent rules. There can therefore be no Apocalypse, not now, in our nuclear era. The Apocalypse is the revelation of truth, but science leaves nothing to be revealed because it takes the entirety of the world to be always already laid bare to our understanding.<br />

The new era of warfare ushered in by the technologies of the nuclear age – the ever-accelerating systems of communication, monitoring and control to outwit the nuclear adversary and earn the distinction of winning an unwinnable war in the name of nothing except the name itself through the transmission of missiles and missives – it is these rhetorically driven processes which have bankrupted our imaginations and predestined our destruction through nuclear conflagration. What is left out in the dominant political analyses and simulations is the reality of the everyday violence and the participation of these same technological trends in global oppression. And here debate is uniquely guilty in deploying the trope of the nuclear war as The Impact, a blinding instantaneous extermination by primordial energy whose light outshines the darkness of ongoing systematic violence.<br />

 <br />
Because nuclear texts are inherently political, the possiblity of space for political change exists in an intertextual economy. We reject the dominant view that the fable of nuclear war has an obvious intelligibility, choosing instead to actualize a critical orientation toward the doctrine of deterrence by disrupting the ever-accelerating flow of nuclear rhetoric and exposing the formal contridictions of virtual power.<br />

Obs. 1 Rise of the Megamachine<br />
<br />
The megamachine is the emergence of a system of power that uses humans as its constituent parts. It is an ideology that unites the ancient and modern world that molds life to fortify its powers complex – the collective dedication of death in nuclear war. These modes of extermination are rooted upon the psychic irrationality that sustains the fantasty of absolute weapons.<br />
<br />
“The ideology hat underlies and…..mankind is finally to save itself” p. 260-262<br />
<br />
The priests of this religion of the megamachine are the scientists who created and envisioned the world as a landscape without figures – a purely mechanical system that eclipsed the human, bent on harnessing and controlling the power of the sun to reshape the world according to the sun God’s strict commands.<br />
<br />
“Plainly, it was not the….the ‘music of spheres’” p. 33<br />
<br />
These priests replaced the human world of the Christian with a purely impersonal universe of science as law and truth. History is replete with a progression from the personal human to the austere religion that positions science as the only source of meaning and the achievement of scientific truth as its ultimate purpose. From Copernicus to Kepler, to Louis XIV and Atum-Re – the sun as reigned supreme.<br />
<br />
“If one ignore the religious aura…Eliade observes, ‘the sun is supreme’” (p. 34-35)<br />
<br />
Obs 2. The Omnipresence of Death<br />
<br />
The modern megamachine has recoded the Sun worship of the technocratic religion through nuclear technology. The pyramids of Egypt have become the stockpile of nuclear weapons, space rockets, control centers, and collective nuclear shelters used to validate and exalt the new religion that has unified all systems and institutions , ways of life, and being into its ever proliferatory and expansive umbrella of death<br />
<br />
“The modernized megamachine has reproduced….as had escaped instant incineration” )p. 300-302)<br />
<br />
The production of the nuclear weapon was critical to the constitution and emergence of the modern megamachine. It gave scientists their new place atop the power hierarchy. Every part of the megamachine is deliberately sterilized of human values – the relentless pursuit of knowledge, the methods were same but the purpose as mad.<br />
<br />
“The production of the atom….dreadful ultimate consequences of their effort” p. 255<br />
<br />
Increasing physical power without a corresponding increase of intellectual insight gives scientific and technological backing to a totalitarian de-moralization of society that released moral inhibitions and life – conserving taboos concerning technology. This explosive increase of energy has reimposed infantile ambitions and psychotic hallucinations in the very foundation of society.<br />
<br />
“What Adams forsaw in this…..infatile ambitions and psychotic hallucinations” p. 232-233<br />
<br />
Total automation has reduced society to the role of automatons – a giving up of all of the conditions to prerogatives for being human. Surrendering life at the source consigns our existence to the central bureaucratic programming of the megamachine.<br />
<br />
“For the sake of material and…..has always dreamed of? Quite true?” p. 332<br />
<br />
The universal imposition of the megamachine as the ultimate instrument of pure intelligence by the construction of the nuclear pyramid makes the extermination of humanity pale in comparison. A nuclear Ragnarok from which there is no return – the end of gods and humans.<br />
<br />
“In short, up to the present….now perhaps actually taking place.” P. 302-303<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Dismantling the Megamachine<br />
<br />
We affirm that the United States Federal Government should eliminate its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
The megamachine is not a natural or a priori phenomenon it is the result of human thinking and must be confronted as such. Technocratic society will continue to cannibalize our vital organs to prolong its meaningless existence until we recognize that the technocratic prison will open if we just choose to walk out.<br />
<br />
“As long as man’s life prospers….as we choose to walk out.” P. 435</span><br />
