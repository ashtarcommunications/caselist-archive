The resolution’s invocation of America’s nuclear arsenal and posture is every debater’s fantasy, drawing a straight line to extinction scenarios.<br />
<br />
this pathological fantasy is not unique to debaters, because nuclear weapons have become significant in our collective imagination only as agents of future Armageddon. this focus on the coming Armageddon precludes a genuine investigation into the meaning of our nuclear age. In particular, it displaces the atomic bombing of Japan. The fun of apocalyptic imagery has become a toxic fiction, written to disarm critical thought and to avoid the work of memory demanded by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />

the current debate over hiroshima has fatally digressed – our fixation on the hiroshima good/bad debate avoids genuinely grapping with its psychic wound<br />

<br />
<br />
radical contingency – opening ourselves to history – opposes psychic extinction. the only other option is meaningless existence in a closed thanoptic loop.<br />

breaking the loop requires embracing agonism – the possibility of ongoing conflict over memorials and neat resolutions.<br />

 The resolution’s invocation of America’s nuclear arsenal and posture is like every debater’s dream, drawing a quick straight line to extinction scenarios. For once, this tendency is not unique to debaters, because nuclear weapons in our collective imagination have become significant only as agents of Armageddon, some future scenario of fantastic apocalypse looming overhead. Whether on the left or the right, hawk or dove, this focus on the coming Armageddon is actually a fantasy precluding an earnest investigation into the meaning of our nuclear age. In particular, it displaces the single and most important historical resource we have to draw upon, the US atomic bombing of Japan in World War II. The fun of apocalyptic imagery has become a toxic fiction, written to disarm critical thought and to avoid the work of memory and remembrance demanded by Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />
Foard 97 (JH, JAAR, Prof of Religion at ASU, &quot;Imagining Nuclear Weapons,&quot; JSTOR)<br />
<br />
This ambivalence about… self evident fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The erasure of Hiroshima or Nagasaki as events to be mourned and engaged with is embodied by the right wing approach to history. The possibility of open-ended memory-work threatens a transcendental, fixed, and redemptive reading of history which affirms the eternal rightness of American nationalism.<br />
Nash et al. 97 (Gary, Ross Dunn, Charlotte Crabtree, History on Trial: Culture Wars and the Teachings of the Past, 125-127)<br />
<br />
Despite such a… just being born.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This detached relationship from Hiroshima is in reality an ideological prison binding us to a quest for total omnipotence and the future use of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Lifton and Mitchell 1996 (Psychologist at Harvard Medical School, Editor of E and P and author of 9 books, Hiroshima in America, 302)<br />
<br />
Since Hiroshima, we… Lewis Mumford observed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The liberal-humanist appropriation of Hiroshima is no better - it represents the same transcendental project, ultimately complicit with virulent forms of racism and nationalism. Instead of a glorified American referent, ‘us’ becomes the human community who look endlessly upon the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the abject reminders of our own rightness and humanity. They are frozen in time, and all of history along with them, in a narrative of linear progress through a single political project.<br />
<br />
Haver 1994 (William, positions, 2.1, “A World of Corpses”)<br />
<br />
What is in… as it were.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hiroshima always has and always will resist these moralizing and prohibitive containers that attempt to establish and fix the meaning of the atomic bombings within the totality of linear history. We are not simply a cry to “Remember Hiroshima”, demanding the constant repetition, in documentary form, of the statistics of the violence that transpired. This quest for a positivist recollection is an attempt to soothe the crisis of representation caused by Hiroshima, but it is this very failure of representation that provides the critical starting point for a new politics of memory.<br />

<br />
And so, our 1AC asks how to go about constructing new public spaces of memory. First and foremost, we must escape the confines of monumental history--the fixed and rigid relationship to the past—such as the right wing censure of Hiroshima or the liberal-humanist appropriation. The solution is not, however, a simple oppositional anti-monumentalism which elides the past altogether and makes critical examination impossible.<br />
Luciano 2004 (Dana, Georgetown English Professor and Max’s Thesis advisor, Arizona Quarterly, Autumn, proquest)<br />
<br />
The antebellum inclination… melancholically denies it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our solution is the very disavowal of capital H history and the static representational practices that entails., not a top-down centralized political project The radical potential of our intervention into the memory of Hiroshima is precisely this open-ended lack of guarantees that makes the public space of rememberance contested and always-becoming. This is the only way to effectively challenge the forms of oppression that take root when the meaning of History is tyrannically fixed.<br />
Haver 1994 (“A World of Corpses,” Positions)<br />
<br />
What I have… demand the impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
We open the space of historical grieving. This interrupts the representational practices that fuel endless war and destroy the possibility of our humanity.<br />

Butler 2009 (Judith, Prof of Rhetoric at Berkeley, Frames of War, 182-184)<br />
<br />
Non-violence thus… time and again.<br />
