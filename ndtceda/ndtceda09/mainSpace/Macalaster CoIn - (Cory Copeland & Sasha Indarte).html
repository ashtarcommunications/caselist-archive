Observation 2 is Deterrence:<br />
<br />
We Use and Target Weapons as an Attempt to Secure a National Identity—Our Justifications of Deterrence and National Security Serve to Cover the Lack in Desire<br />
Michael Shapiro, Prof of Poli Sci at University of Hawaii, “That obscure object of violence: Logistics and Desire in the Gulf War ,” The Political Subject of Violence, 1993 (Google Books)<br />
Ultimately, the imposition of meaning ...an effective and virile male entity.<br />
The Fear of Failed Deterrence is Precisely the Wrong Solution—the Ultimate Example of Nuclear Détente Proves that it is the Refusal to Acknowledge the Message of Deterrence that Solves<br />
Slavoj Zizek, “A Letter Which Did Not Reach its Destination..........(and thereby saved the world),” Lacan.com, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizdidnot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizdidnot.htm</a>)<br />

Don’t Trust the Negative Impact Comparisons—Our Primary Mission Must Be a Confrontation With Desire—Focusing on Utilitarian Impact Calculations Can Only Lead Us to Ignore the Primacy of these Issues and Cause the Impacts You Aim To Avoid<br />
Rolando Gaete, “ARTICLE: Law &amp; The Sacred: Desecration, Law and Evil,” Law/Text/Culture, 2000, p. lexis <br />
This is the terror that Burke wrote about, &quot;...return as the repressed&quot; (La Capra 1992: 126).<br />

The Affirmative is an Act of Ethical Responsibility—Rather than Deferring the Question of Duty We Must Universally Assume Our Actions and the Basis For Those Actions<br />
