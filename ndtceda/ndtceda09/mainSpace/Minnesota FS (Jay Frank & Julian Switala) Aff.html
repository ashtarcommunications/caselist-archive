<u>North Korea Advantage</u><br />
<br />
North Korean nuclearization in the face of U.S. counter-proliferation efforts guts U.S. credibility on nuclear issues<br />

<br />
Rushing into negotiations with North Korea without fixing the underlying relations problem results in failure by repeating Bush era mistakes – reactionary policies leave the U.S. with no credibility<br />

<strong>De-Targeting Affirmative</strong><br />
<br />
Obama can start the process unilaterally, but the total elimination of all current targeting strategies is necessary for change - Norris, 2009<br />
<br />
Only the plan starts the ball rolling - targeting is the mission that drives all U.S. nuclear doctrinal requirement - only a direct order from the President can change how STRATCOM targets - Kriestensen, Norris, Oelrich, 2009<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons are symptomatic of a split between mind and body. Only rejecting the Cartesian dualistic world view allows us to take our nuclear postures in debate out of the debate room. - Sing, Sethi, Jacobs, 2007<br />
<br />
The division between mind and matter is nominalist. Nominalism forces a vicious materialism that destroys our ability to value life, causing collective suicide and epistemic wrongness. - Halton, 2008<br />
<br />
Thus, The Plan: The President of the United States of America should, through an executive order, abandon and destroy all targeting missions regarding the United States federal government's nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
Obama has signaled a dream of moving pragmatically toward the abolition of nuclear weapons, but these words must take on practical effects. As long as it's only discourse, the military establishment will scuttle the path with semantic quibbling. Only concrete plans of action will break the deadlock of bureaucratic inertia - Rosenbaum 2009<br />
<br />
Gotta have a plan - not for the reasons that their blocks will assume, but for reasons that will make their blocks look as fresh as D Cram after the Texas Swing.<br />
<br />
#1 - The act of doing is vital to create new meanings: this subverts the common critiques of pragmatism in 5 ways<br />
<ul><li>Integrates the body and mind by acknowledging the aesthetic force of somatic experience</li><li>Grounds value in meaning, not use</li><li>Integrates aesthetics into ethics</li><li>Reverses the reduction of planning to tinkering</li><li>Holds the plan accountable to higher goals</li></ul>- Grange, 01<br />
<br />
#2 - Plan is necessary to motivate further change:<br />
<ul><li>Plan must not be reduced to it's utility - that neglects the aesthetic role it serves as a consummation of our values</li><li>This reverses the internal link assumptions of K's because the satisfaction will not last, but only energizes a new process of reflection</li><li>This dooms non-policy alternatives to hollow frustration and bad faith</li></ul>- Grange, 01<br />
<br />
#3 - The art of planning is the only ethical path: practical goals are a methodological necessity. Without them, abstract principle escape criticism. While we can't pretend to know the future, aesthetics grounds our ethics when we match our values to policies. Hiding our goals or ducking policy questions is unethical. - Grange, 01<br />
