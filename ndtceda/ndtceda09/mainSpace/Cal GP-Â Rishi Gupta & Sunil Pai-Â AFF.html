The Sacred and The Holy are two distinct ways of orienting ourselves towards Others. While the Sacred embodies a view of innate superiority that perceives others with mistrust and disdain, the Holy strives to nonviolently actualize human dignity and respect in place of inhospitable relationships. Politics then, is merely a universe of relationships, and choices and decisions, a way of organizing our position in that universe.<br />
Fasching and deChant 2001<br />
Darell and Dell, professor and director of undergraduate studies in the department of religious studies at the University of South Florida, Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, p. 10<br />
“Human religiousness is defined… my identity and my stories.”<br />
<br />
These ideologies manifest in explicitly different ways. The Sacred takes the form of an apologetic theology, which acts out of mistrust and precipitates escalation and violence. The Holy is an alienated theology, which acts out of hope and compassion, and in so doing, de-centers the self. Questioning subjectivity lays hope for stable relationships built out of hospitality.<br />
Fasching 1993<br />
Darrell, professor of religious studies at the University of South Florida, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, p. 2-6<br />
This book is an experiment in decentered… in the process of alienated theology.<br />
<br />
Nuclear deterrence embodies the Sacred. The mere possession of nuclear weapons is deeply violent; it denotes a conditional willingness to slaughter masses of innocent civilians. The ultimate paradox is that in attempting to assert control, nuclear politics deprives us of control over all the beautiful features of principled living. It is preferable to take a moral stance than to subscribe to violent axioms.<br />
Dummett 1986<br />
Michael, professor of Logic at Oxford University, Nuclear Weapons, Deterrence, and Disarmament, ed. Copp, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Supplementary Volume 12<br />
As we have seen, a genuinely idle threat… anything to do with nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
More important than physical deployment of weapons, nuclear posturing is deeply wrapped up in a genocidal, institutional ideology which treats life as disposable.<br />
Lifton and Markuson 1990<br />
Robert, professor of psychiatry and psychology at the Graduate School University Center, Erik, Professor at South State University, p. 3<br />
The United States and the Soviet Union… arrangements necessary for the genocidal act.<br />
<br />
This is a form of hostage holding. Willingness to exchange innocent life en masse for compliance with our political goals is deeply immoral. Any decision calculus which treats individuals as a means to an end must be rejected.<br />
Lee 1993<br />
Steven, Philosophy at Hobart and William Smith College, Morality, Prudence, and Nuclear Weapons, p. 45<br />
Hostage holding is morally wrong… threatening such retaliation may be morally acceptable.<br />
<br />
Strategizing around the necessity of instruments of genocide in this way infinitely sidelines morality for fear mongering and killing to heal. Psychic numbing, the idea that we repress anxiety in relation to the bomb, is a dangerous tool that allows us to engage in deeply violent acts without reservation.<br />
Fasching 1993<br />
Darrell, professor of religious studies at the University of South Florida, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, p. 115-120<br />
After Auschwitz and Hiroshima… total darkness of planetary suicide.<br />
<br />
This debate is not about determining whether or not nuclear weapons are useful. Rather, it is about activating ourselves in a struggle for something true and sincere. Rejecting the false choices of technocratic thinking is the essential leap of faith for resisting psychological devastation.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, psychotherapist and activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 155-156<br />
If this is the value of the facts,… clutches of the technocratic state.<br />
<br />
THE PLAN –<br />
<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ENACT A POLICY MANDATING DISARMAMENT OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARSENAL.<br />
<br />
Contention 2: The Blueprint<br />
<br />
Voting aff is more than a call to quantitatively reduce warheads. It embodies a refusal to submit ourselves to the violence of nuclear reasoning, and a willingness to take a nonviolent leap of faith in the face of recurring paranoia. Disarmament rejects the violence of the Sacred and inscribes ethics in the violent space of international politics.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, Psychotherapist and Activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 201-208<br />
Fresh heights of irrationality open… in the front line of a nuclear assault.<br />
<br />
Finally, personal responsibility is central to the debate over nuclear deterrence. As a strategy, deterrence is underwritten by public opinion, and as citizens in a representative democracy, we have rendered ourselves either politically impotent or acquiescent. Refusing the precept that murder of millions can ever be justified is the essential criteria for ethical decision making.<br />
Patten 1986<br />
Steven, professor of philosophy at the University of Lethbridge, Nuclear Weapons, Deterrence, and Disarmament, ed. Copp, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Supplementary Volume 12<br />
My suggestion for understanding individual… for individual responsibility might be rebutted.)<br />

<strong>AT: Disposal Specification</strong><br />
Weapons are considered part of the arsenal until they are actually dismantled<br />
Perry, Chairman Strategic Posture Commission, ‘9<br />
(William J.-, James R. Schlesinger, “The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States”, “America’s Strategic Posture”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf</a>; Jacob)<br />
The third concern is about… disclosure of stockpile information.<br />
<br />
Normal means is just dismantling<br />
<br />
We won't no-link out of anything, so no abuse<br />
<br />
There is no resolutional basis for requiring disposal specification.<br />
<br />
<strong>AT: Socialism K</strong><br />
Our critique of the nuclear complex is ultimately a critique of the modern state and capitalism. <br />
Chernus 1991<br />
Ira, Associated Professor of Religious Studies @ University of Colorado Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology of the Nuclear Age, p. 62-<br />
Indeed the entire nuclear weapons… must protect the entire machine forever.<br />
<br />
Revolution is no good. We need a social transformation that is non-violent and broader-based than the kind the negative favors.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, psychotherapist and activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 224<br />
Will it come to revolution… we look through nuclear terror.<br />
<br />
Alt can't solve numbing, which is a prerequisite to eliminating violence<br />
<br />
<strong>AT: CP: Dispose of nuclear material in ocean</strong><br />
They reduce nature to a standing reserve<br />
Neil Evernden, professor of Enviornmental Stuides at York, The social Creation of Nature, 1992, p. 130<br />
In his study of endangered species….there seems no threat of insurrection<br />
<br />
Reduces nature into pure energy. <br />

Outweighs extinction<br />
Michael E. Zimmerman, professor of philosophy at Tulane, Contesting Earth’s Future: Radical Ecology and Postmodernity, 1994, net-library<br />
Heidegger asserted that human self-assertion…hell on earth, masquerading as a material paradise. <br />
