<br />
Imposing order on the world causes war, violence and otherization - this is the root of all threats to survival - Lipshutz<br />
Nuclear weapons discourse constructed as racial politics - Gusterson 4<br />
Imperial thinking causes infinite violence, war and genocide - Foster 7<br />
<br />
National politics and individuals are distracted from discussing imperialism - the debate community has a political agenda<br />
This causes debate to lose its revolutionary potential by privileging one style of delivery, research and evidence<br />
This effects traditional and non-traditional styles alike - the technical process, rapid fire delivery and evidence intensive nature of debate destroys its accessibility and comprehensibility<br />
Exclusion haunts the activity - destroys personal political agency and societal discussion<br />
The types of impacts discussed created by consensus - catastrophic incidents win the ballot<br />
<br />
Imperial thinking shackles community - must resist oppression, violence and exclusion - Spanos<br />
<br />
Understanding and resisting imperial thinking is a prerequisite to discussing nuclear weapons -<br />
questioning the assumption of natural imperial thinking in debate prevents societal imperial thinking that leads to nuclear weapons development
