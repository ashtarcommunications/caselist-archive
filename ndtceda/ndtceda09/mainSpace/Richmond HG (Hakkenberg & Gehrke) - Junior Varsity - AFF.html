All of our nuclear weapons discourse is influenced by the patriarchy and masculinity.<br />

<br />
When trying … effective disarmament.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, we advocate that:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal and substantially reduce and restrict the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
Observation Two:   We stop the desensitizing of warfare.<br />

Let us now return to the physicist… about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only a gendered rejection of the Viagra-like obsession with the US nuclear arsenal can begin to build alliances and challenge the effects of domination.  Our step is a fruitful one.<br />

Some brief examples illustrate…thin air.<br />
<br />
<br />
a masculine perspective promises war inevitably.  Their impacts are terminally non-unique to say the least.<br />

<br />
<br />
One telling example …politics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The advantage is sweeping.  A gendered perspective on nuclear war is the best way to address proliferation and the motives that bring proliferation to escalation.<br />

War and Violence are societal creations not innate human activities. The plan solves.<br />
