 Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
Nuclear counterforce doctrine is a relic of the Cold War- it’s the foundation of an outdated nuclear policy that won’t be changed<br />

Contention Two: China<br />
<br />

Contention three: Russia<br />

Counterforce makes US-Russia tensions inevitable- leads to massive Russian weapons buildup<br />

(Hans M, Robert S, Ivan, April Occasional Paper No. 7, Federation Of American Scientists &amp; The Natural Resources Defense Council, “From Counterforce to Minimal Deterrence: A New Nuclear Policy on the Path Toward Eliminating Nuclear Weapons”,<br />

Changes in the Russian and Chinese nuclear forces would not … increase in the threat to the United States.<br />

What would be the consequences … whole planet, we will all be losers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Four: Targeting Doctrine<br />
<br />
Scenario One:<br />
Counterforce leads to a more aggressive US international posture that causes other countries to nuclear strike us<br />
Fetter, Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and Glasser, Former Research Fellow at the International Security Program 2005<br />
(Steve and Charles, Fetter, Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and an affiliate of the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs International Security, volume 30, issue 2, pages 84-126, “Counterforce Revisited: Assessing the Nuclear Posture Review's New Missions&quot;) asa<br />
<br />
Although U.S. damage-limitation capabilities … because it already enjoys a large advantage in resolve.<br />
<br />
<br />
In retaliation against a first strike, Counterforce targets command and control targets making escalation control impossible, no one will be able to call it off until the US is destroyed, all of your impacts assume escalation that the plan solves<br />
Feiveson, Senior Research Policy Scientist, et al, 99<br />
(Harold, Woodrow Wilson School, “The Nuclear Turning Point: A blueprint for deep cuts and de-alerting of nuclear weapons”. Brookings Institutional press, pg 51)asa<br />
<br />
Targeting command and control and political … States had already been destroyed. Leadership should be targeted last, if at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario Two:<br />
Counterforce is a throwback to Cold War worst-case thinking- the United States plans for a game-theory style apocalyptic attack<br />
Kristensen et al, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, Norris, senior research associate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Oelrich, Acting President of the Federation of American Scientists, 09<br />
(Hans M, Robert S, Ivan, April Occasional Paper No. 7, Federation Of American Scientists &amp; The Natural Resources Defense Council, “From Counterforce to Minimal Deterrence: A New Nuclear Policy on the Path Toward Eliminating Nuclear Weapons”,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/doctrine/targeting.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/doctrine/targeting.pdf</a>) RKB<br />
<br />
The deterrence challenge of today is quite … outside geopolitical context or triggering event.<br />
<br />
<br />
This makes nuclear conflict inevitable- planning for a worst case scenario makes the threshold for retaliation lower making war inevitable<br />
Nancy Kanwisher, professor at UC Berkeley, 1989<br />
(“Cognitive Heuristics and American Security Policy” Journal of Conflict Resolution Vol. 33 No. 4, JSTOR)<br />
<br />
Consideration of particular war-fighting scenarios has long …became necessary again, the problem of psychological distortions would resurface.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Five: Solvency<br />
<br />
Infrastructure targeting solves for deterrence in its purest form- guaranteeing pain if another country attacks. It makes it too expensive economically and militarily to attack<br />
Kristensen et al, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, Norris, senior research associate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Oelrich, Acting President of the Federation of American Scientists, 09<br />
(Hans M, Robert S, Ivan, April Occasional Paper No. 7, Federation Of American Scientists &amp; The Natural Resources Defense Council, “From Counterforce to Minimal Deterrence: A New Nuclear Policy on the Path Toward Eliminating Nuclear Weapons”,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/doctrine/targeting.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/nukes/doctrine/targeting.pdf</a>) RKB<br />
<br />
The targeting scheme offered here is for the transitional minimal deterrence mission on the path toward zero. … an adversary unwisely attacks the United States or its allies with nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Nuclear counterforce is never in the best interest of the US<br />
Fetter, Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and Glasser, Former Research Fellow at the International Security Program 2005<br />
(Steve and Charles, Fetter, Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and an affiliate of the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs International Security, volume 30, issue 2, pages 84-126, “Counterforce Revisited: Assessing the Nuclear Posture Review's New Missions&quot;) asa<br />
<br />
Other roles for nuclear counterforce are less likely to increase U.S. … be designed to have little impact on the breadth or assertiveness of U.S. foreign policy and therefore would not increase the probability of nuclear war.
