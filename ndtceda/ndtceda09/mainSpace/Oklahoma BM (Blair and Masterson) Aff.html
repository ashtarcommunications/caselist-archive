<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The last fifty years have seen a move to the latest phase of capitalism which allows a more intense and definitive extermination of the periphery through the production of the ultimate means of destruction in our time, nuclear weapons.<br />
Kato, 1993<br />
The vigorous invasion of the logic… Nations almost on a daily basis.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The current intellectual terrain of the nuclear landscape does not hold a space for those who already experience the ongoing violence of nuclear weapons. Our remapping of the nuclear terrain is an attempt to escape the current globalists techno-strategic discourse that may find ways to reject the idea of nuclear weapons, but would still in the end only result in a world that continues to ignore and exterminate the periphery. Our 1ac is pre-requisite to any discussions about the nuclear process. Absent a remapping of the nuclear landscape debates from our current locality would only continue the ideological reification of the violence.<br />
Kato, 1993<br />
Let us probe further into… Third World, Fourth World, and Indigenous Peoples.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our affirmation is an attempt to remap the nuclear landscape of debate by inserting into the debate over nuclearism an alternative way of seeing the landscape. Our affirmation is flying the flag of “Support Shashone Land Rights” Kuletz, 1998 <em>The Tainted Desert</em><br />
Despite tensions, marginal spaces…the view from Yucca Mountain.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our remapping the nuclear landscape opens up intellectual space for escaping the ideology of deterritoriality which is locked into a false sense of inevitable destruction for the periphery because of the desire for continued advancement of industrialization. Our affirmation is proof that it is not inevitable, but a path people choose to take.<br />
Kuletz, 1998 <em>The Tainted Desert</em><br />
Naming and mapping the nuclear landscape…as a form of cultural imperialism.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We affirm the resolution:<br />
“Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or restrict the role and missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal” …. in an attempt to remap the nuclear landscape bound within the resolution. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our affirmation is an attempt to forge that productive link between the struggles of the periphery that requires an abandonment of discourses rooted in technosubjectivity.<br />
Kato 93<br />
Frederic Jameson's proposed formula…&quot;real&quot; of the latter.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />
Threats are constructed by biased military and defense interests and used to justify the aggressive policies that make these conflicts inevitable<br />
Chernus 1 (Ira, PROFESSOR OF RELIGIOUS STUDIES UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,“FIGHTING TERROR IN THE NATIONAL INSECURITY STATE,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://spot.colorado.edu/~chernus/WaronTerrorismEssays/FightingTerror.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spot.colorado. edu/~chernus/ WaronTerrorismEssays/ FightingTerror.htm</a>, AD: 7/10/09) jl<br />
Just as the outcome of World… status quo portends only catastrophe.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The result is the zero point of the holocaust – calculative thinking demands war and genocide<br />
Dillon 99 (Michael, Professor of International Relations at the University of Lancaster, “Another Justices” Political Theory, Vol 27, No. 2, 164-5)<br />
Quite the reverse. The subject… an end to the requirement for decision.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While states still serve important functions in policymaking- focusiung exclusively on the state-centric approach to policymaking legitimates violent exclusion of alternative viewpoints.<br />
Bleiker, 00 Ph.D. visiting research and teaching affiliations at Harvard, Cambridge, Humboldt, Tampere, Yonsei and Pusan National University as well as the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague,(Roland, Popular Dissent, Human Agency and Global Politics, Cambridge University Press)<br />
To expand the scope of international theory… a legitimate rationale for violent encounters.</span><br />

YESTERDAY, President Obama presided… the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Portraying environmental harms in apocalyptic terms destroys agency and the motivation to act to solve the harms</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Faust 8 (Christina, Apocalyptic Framing RUNNING HEAD: APOCALYPTIC FRAMING Global Warming and Apocalyptic Rhetoric, November 2008,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/6/0/1/2/pages260125/p260125-1.php" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.allacademic.com// meta/p_mla_apa_research_ citation/2/6/0/1/2/ pages260125/p260125-1.php</a>)</span><br />
