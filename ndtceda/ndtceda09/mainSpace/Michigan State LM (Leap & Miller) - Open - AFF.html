Observation 1 <br />
The US has an ambiguous nuclear doctrine, without explicit clarification the perception is that the US has an aggressive nuclear stance<br />
<br />
Matt Martin, Program Officer, Policy Analysis and Dialogue, The Stanley Foundation  Scott and Sagan, Co-Director of CISAC and Professor of Political Science, Stanford University, 8-22-2008 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm</a> <br />
Many conference participants … moral legitimacy of nuclear arms. <br />
<br />
The NPR will not be successful without further commitments- Obama’s agenda has been hijacked by Cold War architectures<br />
<br />
Cirincionne, 8/10/09 (Joseph, Total Arms Control Badass, Huffington Post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bx.businessweek.com/defense-industry/view?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2Fjoe-cirincione%2Fthe-pentagons-nuclear-pos_b_255517.html" rel="nofollow">http://bx.businessweek.com/defense-industry/view?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2Fjoe-cirincione%2Fthe-pentagons-nuclear-pos_b_255517.html</a>) <br />
<br />
 The Pentagon's Nuclear Posture …&quot; and &quot;maintain extended deterrence.&quot;      <br />
<br />
Advantage One is Proliferation<br />
<br />
First, US strategy of nuclear ambiguity fails to contain proliferation- a declaration of no first use would set international norms, underscore commitment to the NPT, and reduce the salience of nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
Laird, National Security Analyst at the Carnegie Council on Ethics in International Policy, 2009 (Burgess, “A Guide to the Challenges Facing President Obama’s Nuclear Abolition Agenda,” July 21, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cceia.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0025.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cceia.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0025.html</a>) <br />
There is another initiative …, bolster non-proliferation efforts.  <br />
Second, a U.S. declaration of no first use would change strategic calculations of nuclear weapons states- further expansion of offensive nuclear weapons capabilities causes modernization and arms races<br />
<br />
Krieger and Ong 2002(David &amp; Carah, president and Director of Publications and Research at the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, Apr, “No First Use,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/04/00_krieger_no-first-use.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/04/00_krieger_no-first-use.htm</a> <br />
In March 2002, major US … a weapon of mass destruction. <br />
<br />
Nuclear proliferation causes extinction<br />
<br />
Utgoff 02 (Victor, Deputy Director for Strategy, Forces and Resources at the Institute for Defense Analyses, Survival, “Proliferation, Missile Defense and American Ambitions”, Volume 44, Number 2, Summer, p. 87-90) <br />
First, the dynamics of getting to a … dead cities or even whole nations. <br />
<br />
We’ll preempt your deterrence arguments- proliferation isn’t re-enforcing<br />
<br />
Karl Heinz Chock, Professor of Political Science at the University of Vienna 2006, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons – More May be Worse, www.iuvienna.edu/788_EN-Documents-PDFs-Spread-of-Nuclear-Weapons-Paper.pdf - <br />
<br />
Walt’s rational deterrence theory …compatible with assured protection. <br />
<br />
Also- prolif isn’t inevitable – satisfying key security conditions negates the desire for nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
Sagan, Professor of political science and co-director of Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, 2006 (Scott, Foreign Affairs, September-October, Lexis)<br />
<br />
But both deterrence optimism and …security guarantees to Tehran.<br />
<br />
Nuclear proliferation has reached a tipping point- now is a vital time to deescalate tensions<br />
<br />
CFR 2009 (Council on Foreign Relations, Independent Task force chaired by William J Perry and Brent Scowcroft under Project Director Charles Ferguson, “US Nuclear Weapons Policy,” April, entire report available at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/19226/us_nuclear_weapons_policy.html?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fby_type%2Ftask_force_report" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/19226/us_nuclear_weapons_policy.html?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fby_type%2Ftask_force_report</a>) <br />
Despite nearly universal…., it will increase. <br />
<br />
Independently, US declaratory postures creates a perverse incentive for horizontal proliferation- it’s the best incentive FOR nuclear acquisition<br />
<br />
NFU incentives new nuclear states- increase credibility with the US<br />
<br />
LYNN WALSH., editor, April 2002 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.socialismtoday.org/64/nuclear.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialismtoday.org/64/nuclear.html</a> <br />
The US, however, is now … retaliation against the US <br />
<br />
This rogue state acquisition and horizontal proliferation vastly increases the chances of miscalculation and accidental nuclear war<br />
<br />
Grotto and Cirincione, ’08 (Andrew, Center American Progress, Joseph, if you need to ask you don’t work hard enough, Center American Progress, November, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/11/pdf/nuclear_posture.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/11/pdf/nuclear_posture.pdf</a>) <br />
Rogue state acquisition …for weaker powers. <br />
Miscalculation causes extinction<br />
<br />
PR NEWSWIRE 98 [“NEJM STUDY WARNS OF INCREASING RISK OF ACCIDENTAL NUCLEAR ATTACK; OVER 6.8 MILLION IMMEDIATE U.S. DEATHS POSSIBLE,” APR 29, LN]<br />
<br />
Despite the end of the …casualties worldwide <br />
Advantage Two is China<br />
<br />
US NFU pledge key to solve Chinese modernization<br />
<br />
Arbatov, Chair of the non-proliferation program at the Carnegie Moscow Center, 2008 (Alexei, “Non-First Use as a Way of Outlawing Nuclear Weapons,” November, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Arbatov_NFU_Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Arbatov_NFU_Paper.pdf</a>) <br />
In this context a real problem is US readiness… in nuclear weapons limitation negotiations <br />
Major Chinese nuclear expansion would cause Asian domino effect – causes Taiwanese, Japanese, Russian, Indian, and Pakistani prolif – destroys regional stability.<br />
<br />
Moltz, Associate Professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, 2006 (James Clay, Nonproliferation Review, November, pp.599-600) <br />
<br />
The major proliferation question… cause serious proliferation problems <br />
Deterrence fails in Asia – new arms races cause instability and nuclear conflict.<br />
<br />
Cimbala, Distinguished Professor of Political Science at Pennsylvania State University, 2008 (Stephen J., Comparative Strategy, Vol 27 No 2, pp.120-1)<br />
<br />
In addition to the existing nuclear powers in Asia… major interstate warfare <br />
Change in US nuclear posture key – the impacts are accidental nuclear war, allied prolif, and US/Sino relations.<br />
<br />
Yuan, Director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, 2007 (Jing-Dong, Nonproliferation Review, July, available online via InformaWorld)<br />
<br />
Beijing hedges against these developments… rise as a major global power. <br />
Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should prohibit the use of the United States Federal Government’s nuclear weapons against an organization or government that has not used nuclear weapons against another an organization or government. <br />
Observation 2 is Solvency<br />
<br />
Universal NFU key to solve – only way to devalue possession of nuclear weaposn.<br />
<br />
Johnson, Executive Director of the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy, 2009 (Rebecca, Disarmament Diplomacy, Spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd90/90sa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd90/90sa.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
traditional approaches on security assurances… nuclear weapons for everyone <br />
<br />
We can solve without verification –implemented NFU pledges create a new multilateral norm.<br />
<br />
Johnson, Executive Director of the Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy, 2009 (Rebecca, Disarmament Diplomacy, Spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd90/90sa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd90/90sa.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
the process of stigmatising and outlawing… actual deterrence and security in the real world.
