 this is the neg we have been reading at the last few tournaments, we have also dabbled in some very basic and orthodox marxism for two debate this year. if you are looking for citations and stuff for this 1nc you are going to be dissapointed, we usually read some highlighting of this story and then read a few cards later to spin the argument how we want, we usually argue that the story proves how antinuclear values become inverted and more insidious when they are combined with triumphant narratives that confirm our heroic nature, our main cite for heroism bad is <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 200%;">Ruth Helyer 1999 (lecturer at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, ““Refuse heaped many stories high&quot;: DeLillo, Dirt, and Disorder,” <em>Modern Fiction Studies</em> 45.4 (1999) 987-1006) and we impact this argument with abjection bad from <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 200%;"><strong>Farrar 2000</strong> (Margaret E., Chair of political science @ Augustana, “Health and Beauty in the Body Politic: Subjectivity and the Urban Space,” <u>Polity</u> volume 33 issue 1, questia).<br />
<br />
HERE IS THE 1NC: </span></span><br />
<br />
Ender had dominated all of his training, a training ground not to unlike this one, he went over topic after topic, he encountered stuggle after struggle, Ender was plucked from his family at a very young age and was sent to Battle School, and now after many topics, training exercises and games, Ender was now ready to move to Eros the home of Command School, far from Earth, for a topic of training at an entirely new level, Ender was anxious while preparing for interstellar travel, Instructor<span style="line-height: 200%;"> Hester was not having it, “stop complaining…this topic is AWESOME. if you can't find something you want… then you should give up the activity and find something else to do with your life. seriously.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]][1]</span> But he couldn’t. It was his burden…<br />
the training machine this time took on more complex dimensions, he could look at the field from any angle, gradually he became adept at controlling the fighter’s speed, the training intensified and his new teacher, an old grizzled man, seemed to be pushing him harder and harder, and slowly he revealed what Ender was training for, the topic, was a hive mind life form had already put earth on the brink of destruction once, the old man explained that a Second war against the Buggers could happen again, he explained that they had one consciousness emanating from the queen, a sprawling and complex arsenal of machinery and nonhuman beings, Ender had never heard of any of this, not even of the first invasion that apparently had nearly blinked humans out of existence, the old man continued, “a lot of people see these creatures as bugs, aliens, but what people don’t know, and what you must know if you are use this training ground effectively, the head intelligence of the Buggers, the Queen, as many call it, is not an insect, but was once a human, like us, actually a male, we once thought of him as a hero, and we created him, his name was Dr. Manahattan,<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn2|[2]][2]</span><br />
The old man began to tell of a time on earth long ago when those heroes who were meant to fight evil were not child messiahs hidden in secret simulation chambers in space but beautiful men and women that walked among humans in masks and costumes, this was the dawn of earth’s nuclear age, taglines bombarded everyone everywhere on paper, a medium used to express idea before we had moved into an entirely paperless world: </span><br />
Cardboard ideologies were heald up high, “end is nigh,” no more vigilantes, Newspapers swirled everywhere, “the Russians have stepped up the A-Bomb,” “nuclear scientists have set the doomsday clock to five minutes to midnight,” “Nixon elected for third term,” news analysts blared, <span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 200%;">“On a scale of zero to ten, zero meaning impossibility, 10 being complete metaphysical certitude, what is the likelihood that</span>…” &lt;&lt;&lt;INSERT&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
This was the world, a spectacle everywhere obsessed with the possibility of mass death and suffering, transfixed, a giant mass of swirling newspaper clipping constructing stories, some stood atop their intellectual perches, some got down in the muck just long enough to feel like humans, some donned masks and pretended to save the world, some met a spectacular universities to discuss it, everyone everywhere lived in the backdrop Dr. Manhattan, but that too was not always his name.<br />
Scientist Jon Osterman gained power to control and manipulated matter with his will when he was caught in an &quot;Intrinsic Field Subtractor&quot; in Staryear A 1959. At first he seemed to evaporated but then after a few days he brilliantly rematerialized in a flash as a beautiful massive and naked figure which glowed bright blue in every direction, this atomic man grew in abilities and destructive power, he distorted matter with ease, some say he carried the ability to wipe out every living thing on Earth, some even spoke of him as a God, even the masked Superheroes of the day understood that this was a hero with <em>real powers</em>, and he was stunning.<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">“<u>As the ideal &quot;male body,&quot; the &quot;Hero&quot; should consist of both perfect form and morality, with a certain clean wholeness that precisely differentiates him from the threat of the unclean world.</u> To help us enjoy the book, he should act within clear parameters. These parameters answer to our socially conditioned urge to create a consummate construction, <strong>[End Page 987]</strong> easily identified by its firm boundaries, that we can believe in. <u>Our hero should always be safely on our side of abjection's border, to appease our &quot;need to structure and classify, to build a system against the terror in our souls&quot;</u> (DeLillo, <em>Names</em> 81). <u>The terror is that the undifferentiated mass of waste we dispose of (in a bid to be what it is not, identifying ourselves by our very lack of it) will force its way back into our life, insisting on revealing itself as part of us. Such unwanted baggage sullies our ability to conform to an acceptable prototype, where conforming requires that we display the correct signs, which are, according to Andrew Tolson, &quot;an aura of competence, a way of talking and behaving, [. . .] immediately recognised [. . . and] enshrined in social rituals and customs&quot; (21). Failure to comply results in an undeserving and inauthentic construction, with the potential to create disorder and to lead us into crisis.</u> However, as N.H. Reeve and Richard Kerridge remind us, <u>our yearning for authenticity can never be fulfilled (318). Narrating this constant human search for a tangible self, <em>Underworld</em> emphasizes the dichotomy between the modernist faith in origins and logical cognition and the postmodernist lack of cerebral justification, chronology, and causality--lack of respect for the &quot;actual pulsing thing&quot;</u> (DeLillo, <em>Underworld</em> 805).””<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn3|[3]][3]</span> </span><br />
“It quickly became clear that Dr. Manhattan was very valuable to the United States Military, Nixon used him to quickly win the Vietnam Conflict, but after that had settled, a group of costumed heroes wanted to assemble together with Manhattan to move their world toward the good,”<br />
The floor of the Command School Bunks seemed to grow colder as Ender watched his teacher bring some documents up on his viewing screen, “why are you telling me all this?” “Because you are now resolved to be Dr Manhattan’s enemy, you must know him, in order for there to be a solution to any problem we must study…<br />
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;insert&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
Documents showed on the viewing screen in Ender’s quarters,<br />
1st Meeting of the Watchmen:<br />
Ozymandius: welcome to the 1st ever meeting…<br />
Comedian: This is bullshit<br />
Ozymandius: for a guy who calls himself the comedian I can never tell when you are joking.<br />
Comedian: The Watchmen, that’s the real joke, didn’t work 15 years ago and it isn’t going to work now just because you want to play cowboys and indians.<br />
Nite Owl II: Maybe we should agree on no drinking at meetings, [Comedian Laughs]<br />
Rorshack: a group this size seems like a publicity stunt, I’m not in it for the ink.<br />
Ozymandius: we could do so much more, we could save this world.<br />
Dr. Manhattan: there are many solutions still left to be un-thought. But they may not be the ones usually considered, by…<br />
Ozymandius: by who?<br />
Comedian: he means to say by humans. Jesus, You really don’t give a damn about human beings, your drifting out of touch Doc.<br />
Ozymandius: With the right leadership we can.<br />
Comedian: and that’d be you right Ozy? Smartest man on the planet…<br />
Ozymandius: It doesn’t take a genius to see the world has problems.<br />
Comedian: Yeah but it takes a room full of morons to think their small enough for you to handle.<br />
Another document flashed on the screen….<br />
Rorshacks journal:<br />
I heard a joke once, man goes to doctor, says he’s depressed, life seems harsh and cruel, says he feels all alone in a threatening world, says he feels anxious, doctor says treatment is simple, the great clown paliachi is in town, go see him, that should pick you up, man bursts into tears, but doctor, he says, I am paliachi, good joke, everybody laugh, roll on snare drum, curtain,<br />
Rorshack’s Journal,<br />
Why are there so few of us left active, healthy and without personality disorders?<br />
All those liberals, intellectuals, smooth talkers…<br />
<br />
Excerpt from the 20th century television program “Face to Face with Dr. Manhattan…”<br />
Host: Ms. Black, you have the first question.<br />
Ms. Black: Dr. Manhattan, the doomsday clock is a symbolic clock face analogizing human kind’s proximity to extinction… as of now it stands at 4 minutes to midnight, do you agree that we are that close to annihilation?<br />
Dr. Manhattan: My father was a watchmaker, he abandoned it when Einstein discovered that time was relative, I would only agree that a symbolic clock is as nourishing to the intellect as a drop of oxygen to a drowning man.<br />
Ms. Black: so your saying there is no danger.<br />
Mr. Manhattan: Even in world without nuclear weapons there would still be danger.<br />
Host: But on to you for a second, it has been widely reported that many around you throughout your history have become ill with cancer.<br />
Mr. Manhattan: you are suggesting that I am the cause?<br />
Host: From where I am standing it is starting to look pretty conclusive.<br />
Mr. Manhattan: Even if that’s the case, it iss irrelevant, a live human body and a deceased human body have the same number of particles, structurally there is no difference…<br />
Ender’s Teacher continued, “this group, the Watchmen fought against injustice and made hard-won gains, but ender, you must remember, every value sets a non-value, the stronger a value is set the more easily it can become inverted, after that interview, the earthling public begins to view Mr. Manhattan differently, it was once said, the superman exists, and he is American, within a span of twenty years he would be seen as humanity’s most menacing monster. Millions around the Earth die from an unexplained weapon in the 1980s and Dr Manhattan is blamed, and he leaves,” “where did he go?” Ender asked, “it is not clear, we know he jumped from star system to star system in a blink of an eye, we know for a long time he was utterly alone, which we suspect is why he made the Buggers, and when First Invasion started nearly all earthlings had forgotten about the Atomic man, to them (meaning those who even knew about war) he was the Bugger Queen, wholly alien, the one who would finally put an end to history,” Ender sat up and was visibly disturbed, “but that is so sad…” his teacher interrupted, “‘I am not a happy man, Ender. Humanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us to be brilliant on its behalf. Survival first, and then happiness as we can manage it.’<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn4|[4]][4]</span> Do not forget…”<br />

“And this Ender is the meaning of heroism, the hero must be other worldly, their imagination must be beyond this world, this status quo,”<br />
The old man could tell that Ender was spent, that night Ender couldn’t sleep. In the morning the old man did not wake him for training, instead it was a familiar face from battle school, instructor Hester, “alright Ender, time to get up, the simulations are going to get harder today…” Ender seemed absent and distant, “listen kid, you are failing to see the beauty of this topic…” “what? Squashing bugs?” Ender muttered, “no, obvi, to defeat the nuclear man. Taking on Dr. Manhattan is awesome! So much better than the agricultural conflict topic, or our various simulations about the law, so much literature that we have never read, educational and important, this one is the best!” “but how do you know about Dr. Manhattan?” “Everybody at Command School knows about that, and I know you’ve been hearing the old man’s theory about the Forgotten Atomic Man, but the truth is, since we invented him, he has been a stain on the human, and not a small one either, this is a deep red tomato stain that has framed our imagination ever since, Dr. Manhattan has been lurking in the backdrop of our minds, has been the backdrop of our whole imagination, even if earthlings weren’t conscious of it. You see, this means you finally have a chance, with this topic, to use your training to come to terms with this monster we allowed to control us, you will be able to control it, to finally tame his massive blue power, IT. IS. AWESOME. I have always preferred red anyway,” by this time Ender was already strapped into the simulator…<br />
<u>Abjection draws us to the place where definition disintegrates. The inherent risk of this edge is illustrated by the vertiginous manner in which the homeless paint sprayers choose to commemorate their dead. While suspended by a rough piece of rope from a &quot;six-story flank of a squatters' tenement</u> [. . .] <u>graffiti writers spray-paint an angel every time a local child dies</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> of illness or mistreatment&quot; (811). &quot;The Wall,&quot; situated in the South Bronx inner ghetto, is named as such &quot;partly for the graffiti facade and partly [for] the general sense of exclusion--it [is] a tuck of land adrift from the social order&quot; (239), where life and death touch, where the trees and vines grow over and around garbage, which includes limbs and hospital waste (238-39). Sister Edgar, a nun who works in this desperate, borderland area, aptly summarizes the spray paint artists' cavalier attitude toward risk when pondering the homeless drug users' propensity for sharing needles. Her sentiments echo George's attitude when he invites Nick to pull the trigger: she understands </span><u>&quot;the lure of critical risk, the little love bite of that dragonfly dagger. If you know you're worth nothing, only a gamble with death can gratify your vanity&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (242). </span><u>In the struggle between subject and object, abjection represents the underside of that which professes to be clearly figurative. The subject must reject the abject and attempt to conceal and contain it</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">. <em>Underworld</em> attempts to reveal this &quot;underside&quot; and in the process confirms the abject as whatever disturbs socially imposed limits. </span><u>The subject claims to exclude the abject but must acknowledge its existence; in other words, the subject must acknowledge that &quot;that which threatens to destroy life also helps to define life&quot;</u><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> (Creed 9).<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn6|[6]][6]</span> </span><br />
Hester was right about this topic being fun, these new simulations were more difficult and involved a much grander scale than he was used to, a lot of other simulation topics had alluded to this type of warfare, but it was only now that it was the focus of his training, the Buggers, just extensions of the Atomic arsenal, moved better and more quickly, Ender was beginning to notice the characteristics described in Dr. Manhattan history expressed in their methods of fighting, when he defeated a challenge it was usually because we was beginning to see the battle field as if through the lens of the atomic man, his fighters began to move like the buggers, it was the only way to defeat him/them, this was exciting training, sometimes Hester would shout out, “switch sides!” and he could, it was exhilarating, before long he had incorporated the old earthling vernacular to think of his enemy, instead of “buggers” he called enemy fighters “A-Bugs” or “nukies,”<br />
One morning’s simulation was especially hard, end was using a simulated version of a weapon being designed for the second invasion, it had been explained to him that this weapon was so destructive it could not even be used in inner planetary warfare, it projected a giant laser which seemed to instantly disperse particles on a massive scale, he would wipe out and completely dismantle many of the little nukie squadrons, but it didn’t matter, until at some point he began to see a pattern, the A-Bugs were swirling around something fluctuating near its middle, if he hadn’t have been studying these bastards day and night he would have never seen it, and so he aimed the weapon and fired, in moments all of the galaxy was quiet, all nukies just floated in random directions like junk metal, shortly Ender heard clapping, commotion and some crying in the chambers around him, the old man, whom he had not seen in weeks, suddenly burst into his quarters, “you’ve done it!” he weezed, “we’ve won the war, and it seems as if the atomic man is destroyed!” and it was at this moment that Ender understood the purpose of his training, or more correctly his mission, Ender fell silent for three months, records indicates that when he was begged to return to Earth to celebrate his triumph, that he spoke for the first time and said,<br />
“Well, I'm your man. I'm the bloody bastard you wanted when you had me<br />
spawned. I'm your tool, and what difference does it make if I hate the<br />
part of me that you most need? What difference does it make that when<br />
the little serpents killed me in the game, I agreed with them, and was<br />
glad.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn7|[7]][7]</span><br />
<br />
<br />
But this trip Back to earth would never occur, within a year Ender would be known as the Xenocide, responsible for humanity’s worst atrocity, the wiping out of the Glorious Bugs, Ender would use interstellar travel to escape, and eventually he too was “forgotten,”<br />

Its popularity in the fantasy genre for both children and adults is testament to the resonance it has for readers of all ages throughout history. Something has changed, however, in the representation of the Child Messiah in recent children's fantasy.</u> Far from the glorious fate of a chosen one, there is now no future as utterly bleak in contemporary children's fantasy to be 'fated' as the next Child Messiah. Let me catalogue the casualties. <u>Ender Wiggin commits his first murder and is removed from his family at age six, commits xenocide at eleven, and is exiled at twelve.</u> Lyra Belacqua betrays her best friend to his death at eleven, destroys God, and finds and loses love at twelve. Will Parry commits his first murder at twelve, destroys God, and finds and loses love at thirteen. At the conclusion of both Ender's Game and His Dark Materials, <u>one thing stands out above all else</u>--these three <u>Child Messiahs are ultimately alone.

<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 34px;">relation of the ban is precisely this power of making exceptions, of adjusting the threshold of what society deems as acceptable behave ior, the relation of the ban “is the originary structure in which law refers to life,”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt; line-height: 38px;">Sovereignty always reconstitutes itself with greater power over life by constraining politics to pre-given institutionalized notions of power and the constant reinforcement of the value to protect life,</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 34px;">When one looks closely at the history of sovereignty it seems as if “every decisive political event were double-sided,”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span> the powers that be always remake themselves and further solidify power relations by characterizing emerging politics as overcoming of the old in favor of new more benevolent values,</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br />

Sovereignty wants its opponents to focus on the terrifying power of nuclear weapons, Foucault once wrote, “government is possible only when the strength of the state is known: it is by this knowledge that it can be sustained.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|[1]]]</span> The image of nuclear explosion is constantly invoked over and over again as the backdrop of politics<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 34px;">the 1AC only serves to depict nuclear weapons is more menacing and destructive, the 1AC does nothing actually to change the existence of nuclear weapons but simply replays the bomb in the forefront of our political imagination,</span><br />
