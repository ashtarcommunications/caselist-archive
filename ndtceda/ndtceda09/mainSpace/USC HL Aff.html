 Observation 1- The SQ of Late: The us is refusing to unilaterally withdrawl TNWs for fear of hindering the NATO alliance. Despite Eurpean opposition, the NPR will be cowardly silent on the questions of TNW in order to allow NATO to work it out<br />
Sprenger 2-24<br />
(Sebastian, inside Missile Defense Vol. 16 No. 7)<br />
“Secretary of Defense…issue at the NPR.”<br />
<br />
Even though the majority of people want US TNWs out, the US is passing responsibility under the guide of NATO consultation<br />
Burns 3-15<br />
(Robert, AFP, US cautions on removing nuclear arms from Europe)<br />
“The US is taking a go-slow approach…link US and NATO security.”<br />
<br />
<br />
As expected, a major debate is occurring between nations over the role of nuclear weapons within NATO strategy. Unfortunately, this debate is largely occurring in secret. Even opportunities to withdrawl realize that TNWs are just a matter of symbolic politics-there are requirements that nations dip theirhands in blood of nuclear preparation<br />
Chalmers 3-10<br />
(Malcolm, NATO’s tactical nuclear dilemma, Occasional Paper)<br />
“Yet the prospect that…over their nonnuclear partners.”<br />
<br />
Observation 2- Get something<br />
<br />
The us has abandoned the idea that it will unilaterally withdrawl TNWs in hopes that it can use it to extract something out of Russia<br />
Evans 3-12<br />
(Gareth, Agence France-Presse/Spacewar.com)<br />
“I don’t think the Americans…guarantee, as a deterrent.”<br />
<br />
The logic of the current US approach can be found resonating in like of Fox News. The Hannitys and Romneys of the world think that unilateral reductions will make the US vulnerable to all menacing Russian TNWs<br />
Hannity and Romney 3-2<br />
(Sean and Mitt, Federal News Service)<br />
“On the national security front…making us potentially vulnerable.”<br />
<br />
It is the frame of arms control that defines both the problem and the solution. Arms control is about balancing, it ensures that the US will always need to have something to leverage against its enemies<br />
Mutimer 2k<br />
(David, The weapons state: Proliferation and the framing of security)<br />
“As I demonstrated in Chapter 3…against the Soviet Union.”<br />
<br />
Arms control strategies employ conceptions of threats and otherizations<br />
Cooper 6<br />
(Bradford, “Putting disarmament back in the frame,” Review of International Studies 32)<br />
“Despite noting the influence of politics…military technology and strategy.”<br />
<br />
The tit-for-tat conditionality of arms control causes violence, war, and disease<br />
Vaughan 2004<br />
(Genevieve, “A philosophy for social change”, p.online)<br />
“Anthropologists talk about a cross cultural…embracing it or acting it out.”<br />
<br />
Observation 3- The Fear of Uncertainty<br />
<br />
TNWs represent NATO’s fear of the uncertain world. TNWs have become the cure for vague and exaggerated notions of preserving the peace by preventing an uncertain but impending conflict<br />
Larsen 06<br />
(Jeffrey A, The future of US non-strategic nuclear weapons and implications for NATO)<br />
“Instead of formulating…outside the region.”<br />
<br />
The fear of uncertainty is driving NATO’s grand strategy of pro-active deterrence<br />
Spagnulo 09<br />
(Laura, NATO nuclear burden sharing and NPT obligations)<br />
“The 1999 strategic Concept…strengthening non-proliferation.”<br />
<br />
Observation 4- Secrecy<br />
<br />
The decision to leave TNWs up to NATo is a decision that upholds top-down decision making. Only national leaders can make these hard decisions<br />
Lunn 3-10<br />
(Simon, NATO’s tactical nuclear dilemma, occasional paper)<br />
“It is planned that the Concept…dual-capable aircraft.”<br />
<br />
NATos decision on nuclear matters are happening behind closed doors<br />
Davis 2-10<br />
(Dr. Ian, Nato Watch, European Security Review no. 48)<br />
“A new emphasis…this is not enough.”<br />
<br />
Secrecy justifies a self-perpetuating logic of global nuclear coercion<br />
Taylor 07<br />
(Bryan C., “The Means to match their hatred: Nuclear weapons, rhetorical democracy, and presidential discourse”, Presidential Studies Quarterly Vol 37, No. 4, pps. 667-693)<br />
“I will return below…fetish of weaponry.”<br />
<br />
Observation 5- Another way<br />
<br />
The aff represents a way to get the public involved over nuclear issues. Out involvement represents a way of contesting right-wing adherence to extended deterrence<br />
Barrigan 3-5<br />
(Frida, People’s world)<br />
“The current generation of students…weapons for themselves.”<br />
<br />
Despite the drawbacks of the peace movement, public opinion can make governments uncomfortable over TNWs<br />
Lunn 3-10<br />
(Simon, NATO’s tactical nuclear dilemma, occasional paper)<br />
“The opposition in its various forms…to take account of.”<br />
<br />
This debate is a way of breaking through the haze of official discourse<br />
Giroux 09<br />
(Henry A., the politics of lying and the culture of Deceit in Obama’s America)<br />
“In the current American political landscape…swelling ranks of hatemongers.”<br />
<br />
The aff repreents an attempt to open up NATo nuclear debates with our own voices. NATO’s transparency and withdrawl of TNWs is critical to living up to the demands of the Non aligned movement<br />
Lindborg 09<br />
(Chris, Foreign Policy in Focus)<br />
“Remove the political…conference in 2010”<br />
<br />
This vision of co-repsonsibility is critical to non-violence and alternatives to empire<br />
Demonchonok 09<br />
(Edward, The American journal of Economics and sociology, 681.1 p.9)<br />
“We are living in a divers…since World War II.”<br />
<br />
<br />
