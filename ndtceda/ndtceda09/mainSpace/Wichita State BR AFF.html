1AC Witchita BR-TNWs<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is NATO<br />
<br />
Deployment of TNW’s in Europe is creating a divide within NATO<br />

Formally, at least that is AND weapons should be withdrawn from Europe.<br />
<br />
Removing our TNW’s wouldn’t cripple NATO would strengthen the alliance by modernizing its mission<br />

Then there is the institutional justificationAND a post-Cold War alliance.<br />
<br />
NATO will collapse without modernizing<br />

This is the key issue and AND citizens in the best possible way.<br />
<br />
<br />
1AC NATO Advantage (2/4)<br />
Failure to modernize NATO will collapse the alliance<br />
Brendan Wilson, December 2002, Center for Contemporary Conflict, &quot;Military Strategy for Transformation: NATO's Rubicon,&quot; </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/dec03/europe.asp" rel="nofollow">__http://www.ccc.nps.navy.mil/si/dec03/europe.asp__</a><span style="color: black;"><br />
The need for transformation is well AND in the Euro-Atlantic area.<br />
<br />
NATO is facing a legitimacy crisis, the key litmus test for the survival of the organization is redefining its strategic posture<br />

Afghanistan is where a critical Alliance AND Europe was not pulling its weight.<br />

However, this does not mean AND U.S. cannot ignore.<br />

FORWARD DEPLOYMENT ADVANTAGE<br />
Nuclear sharing encourages other countries to forward deploy TNW’s<br />

<br />
In some respects, TNWs are more dangerous than strategic weapons...others may well emulate this example.<br />
<br />
Forward deployed tactical nukes are prone to accidents – this is historically proven. This would escalate to a full scale nuclear war.<br />
