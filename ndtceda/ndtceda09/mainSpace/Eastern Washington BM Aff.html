<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The United States finds itself in an unsure and uncertain world; it no longer can organize the world according to the sovereign threat of Soviet power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Contemporary threats are rather ghostly indeterminate challenges to US authority and the system of sovereignty itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>At the heart of our response to this kind of insecurity is the doctrine of preemption, the notion of a holy war.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our ontological relationship to life and politics comes first—this is the key internal link to all value.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>There is literally no impact to any of their impacts which proceed from the framework of securitization.</span><br />
