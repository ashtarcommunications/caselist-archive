NFU key to US Non-proliferation Credibility<br />
Sagan, 2009 <br />
(Scott D. professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation June 1, “The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
It has been widely argued … against the use of any weapons of mass destruction against non-combatants 21<br />
<br />
Increased non-proliferation credibility reinvigorates the IAEA and boosts non-proliferation <br />
Zedillo, director of Yale Center for the Study of Globalization, 08<br />

Although nuclear safety has improved enormously ... and to draw in states that are not parties to the NPT.<br />
<br />
Proliferation guarantees massive nuclear escalation and war-current deterrence fails <br />
Utgoff, Deputy Director of Institute for Defense Analyses, 2002 <br />
(Victor, “Proliferation, Missile Defence and American Ambitions,” Survival, vol. 44, p85-102, ldg) <br />
<br />
Worse still, in a highly proliferated world … we will all gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations. <br />
<br />
Proliferation causes nuclear accidents-that destroys deterrence-3 reasons. <br />
Sagan, professor political science Stanford University, 2003<br />
(Scott, “The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed”, pg 74-75, ldg) <br />
<br />
My own book, The Limits of Safety, … and even organizational cover-ups<br />
<br />
Proliferation increases risk of nuclear terrorism, accidental launch, regional nuclear war and NPT collapse-culminates in extinction <br />
Cirincione, Director for Non-Proliferation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2007<br />
(Joseph, “Symposium: Apocalypse When?”, National Interest, November/December 2007, lexis, ldg) <br />
<br />
Let me be clear: Nuclear proliferation is a real danger … its abandonment by the current administration risks a return to the 1950s nuclear free-for-all.<br />
<br />
Nuclear terrorism causes a full-scale nuclear war<br />
Spiece, Legal Associate, 2006 (William and Mary Law Review, Legal Associate at Gibson, Dunn and Cruthcr Washington DC February 2006, lexis) <br />
<br />
The potential consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear … that regional conflicts will draw in the United States and escalate to the use of nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
Accidental launch causes extinction<br />
PR Newswire, April 29, 1998, <br />
(Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, “NEJM Study Warns of Increasing Risk of Accidental Nuclear Attack”) <br />
<br />
An 'accidental' nuclear attack would create … trigger full-scale nuclear war with billions of casualties worldwide<br />
<br />
Rapid proliferation collapses US leadership<br />
Roberts, Researcher for the Institute for Defense Analyses specializing in proliferation, 1999 (Brad, “PROLIFERATION AND NONPROLIFERATION IN THE 1990S: LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT LESSONS”, Nonproliferation Review, Fall 1999)PRC<br />
<br />
The proliferation challenge is thus a test … a price it has hardly begun to conceive, and much more than “just” blood and treasure.<br />
<br />
Maintenance of U.S. global leadership is vital to preventing numerous scenarios for nuclear conflict—loss of U.S. power turns the case in numerous ways <br />
Thayer, 06 (Bradley, &quot;In Defense of Primacy,&quot; The National Interest, November/December 2006, p. lexis) <br />
<br />
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, peace and stability have been … American primacy remains humanity's only practical hope of solving the world's ills.<br />
<br />
The time where threat of first use was needed is over. Current analyses of the role of nuclear weapons are narrow and exaggerated. We must now adopt a nuclear weapons no first use declaratory policy.  <br />
Sagan, 2009 <br />
(Scott D. professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation June 1, “The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
Is the threat of the first use of US nuclear weapons … with an appropriate range of nuclear retaliation options, if necessary, in the event that deterrence fails’.<br />
<br />
Declaratory policies enhance deterrence, reassurance, counterterrorism, and non-proliferation.<br />
Sagan, 2009 <br />
(Scott D. professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation June 1, “The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
Declaratory policy and public documents outlining … These norms can in turn influence internal debates in new and potential nuclear-weapons states about their own nuclear doctrines or potential nuclear-weapons acquisition. <br />
<br />
US NFU strengthens norms against acquisition, boosts diplomatic momentum towards nonproliferation efforts<br />
Martin, Policy Analyst Stanley Foundation 08<br />
(Matt, “A New Look at No First Use” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/pdb/NoFirstUsePDB708.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/pdb/NoFirstUsePDB708.pdf</a> &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/pdb/NoFirstUsePDB708.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/publications/pdb/NoFirstUsePDB708.pdf</a>&gt; ) mee<br />
<br />
NFU could also affect US policy abroad … it reduces the US ability to bring international pressure to bear against Iran’s enrichment program.
