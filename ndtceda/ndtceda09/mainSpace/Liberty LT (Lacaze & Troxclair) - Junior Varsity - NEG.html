3. Missions and role are the uses and purpose of nuclear weapons<br />
DoD, Jan 2009<br />
[Department of Defense, Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review Report, &quot;II. ROLES AND MISSIONS FRAMEWORK,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2009/QRMFinalReport_v26Jan.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2009/QRMFinalReport_v26Jan.pdf</a>, accessed 10-14-2009, mss]<br />

Core Mission Areas are broad Department of Defense military activities required to achieve strategic objectives of the National Defense Strategy and National Military Strategy. A Core Mission Area is a mission for which the Department is uniquely responsible, provides the preponderance of U.S. Government capabilities, or is the U.S. Government lead for achieving end states defined in national strategy documents. Each of the Department’s Core Mission Areas is underpinned by a Joint Operating Concept (see Section III) that identifies desired effects necessary to achieve operational objectives, essential capabilities to achieve these objectives, and relevant conditions under which capabilities must be applied. Joint Operating Concepts (JOCs) are a visualization of future operations. They describe how a commander, using military art and science, might employ capabilities necessary to meet future military challenges. In practice, JOCs establish context for the Department’s force development planning and resourcing activities. This helps the Department identify military problems and develop innovative solutions that go beyond merely improving the ability to execute missions under existing standards of performance. Although JOCs underpin the Department’s Core Mission Areas, they are not entirely Department-centric. For example, the Department informally coordinates with the Department of State and other agencies on concepts for irregular warfare, cooperative security, and stability operations. As we continue to evolve JOCs, there will be additional opportunities for interagency cooperation. Core Competencies are groupings of functionally-organized capabilities associated with the performance of, or support for, a Department of Defense Core Mission Area. The Department’s Components perform tasks and activities that supply these functionally-organized capabilities. The QRM determined the Department’s Core Competencies correspond to the nine Joint Capability Areas (see Section III) established following the 2006 QDR. Joint Capability Areas (JCAs) are groupings of related capabilities that support strategic decision-making, capability portfolio management, and joint analyses of capability gaps, excesses, and major tradeoff opportunities. JCAs also provide a common capabilities language for use across the Department’s activities and processes. Functions are the appropriate or assigned duties, responsibilities, missions, or tasks of an individual, office, or organization as defined in the National Security Act of 1947, including responsibilities of the Armed Forces as amended. The term “function” includes purpose, powers, and duties. Specific Functions of the Services and U.S. Special Operations Command are captured in Department of Defense Directives. Roles are the broad and enduring purposes for which the Services and U. S. Special Operations Command were established by law.<br />

<br />
B. Violation- the plan doesn’t make a role or mission smaller- it merely re-affirms already existing law through treaty ratification.<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to vote negative:<br />
<br />
1. Predictable limits- we shouldn’t have to debate cases we are less prepared for- their interpretation allows cases that prevent future increases like ban modernization or ban specific future weapons- AND debatability is less important than predictable limits and informed decision making- even if just one word or phrase precludes the CTBT it’s a deterrent to research it as much as topical cases which makes debate unfair.<br />
<br />
2. They do not reduce on face- at most the plan affects a role or mission. Effects T is unlimiting because virtually everything affects nuclear weapons- a bad economy reduces the budget for nuclear weapons, improved international relations reduces the need for nuclear weapons, more conventional weapons reduces the uses for nuclear weapons, etc.<br />
<br />
3. Extra-T- plan uses an extra-topical mechanism – a multilateral treaty – to ban testing- this allows numerous treaties affs like START III conditions and negotiation affs- AND they can claim advantages from parts of the CTBT that do more than affect nuclear weapons use.<br />
