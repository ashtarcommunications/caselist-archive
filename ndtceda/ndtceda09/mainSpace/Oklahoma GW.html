<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Behaviorists… as an incentive.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Because rationalists… explains mistakes.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">John Norton Moore’s… prospects of peace.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Norms of deterrence contradict other models of understanding confclit. Use of incentive theory in reference to nuclear posture ignores the effects of emulation and the thesis of democratic norm production.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The paraxodical logic of weapons produced never to be used allows warfare to take on a far more insidious form of immaterial violence in the form of reducing the world to a series of targest, enframing their existence such that they might only reveal themselves as objects to be destroyed. This guarantees complacency with all forms of structural violence absent the spectacular moment of nuclear annihilation itself.</span><br />

A declaration to retain nuclear weapons only for retaliation against a first strike is an ethical position based in the logic of pure revenge<br />
Tung Yin 04 “Disposable deontology: the death penalty and nuclear deterrence” lexis<br />
The death penalty cannot be…an opposition to the death penalty<br />
<br />
The affs paranoid concerning the possibility of nuclear war breaking out is outdated – nuclear weapons rely upon the nation-state model of conflict in which we must threaten rational states with the ultimate act we will never actually employ to create inability to der the undeterrable terrorist has created the need for a self victimizing, defensive posture in order to discharge our ressentiment towards this new enemy with moral high ground<br />

Zizek 91 Looking Awry p 34-35<br />

Lacanian psychoanalysis meets the burdens of scientific inquiry. Its transmissibility via standard formula creates the verifiability of scientific inquiry. Their reliance on empricist understandings of science are less scientifically valid then our theory<br />
