 Azerbaijan basing Cp<br />
The United States federal government should offer to collaberate with the Russian Federation in the establishment and operation of a joint US-russia missile defense system, with interceptors and radars based in Azerbaijan, supported by data from Russia’s Armavir radar. The united States Federal Government should offer to cease missile defense deployments in Eastern Europe if the Russian Federation accepts missile defense based in Azerbaijan. The United States federal government should accelerate development and deployment of sea-based boost-phase intercept systems based on Aegis ships and should deploy these capabilities against states such as Iran and North Korea. The United States federal government should adopt a nuclear no first use policy towards the Russian federation. <br />
