<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally - the end of the world is just a ballot away: Israeli strike results in Middle East nuclear war, disruption of oil supplies and terrorism.</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />
<strong>Morris, 2008</strong> [Benny, Professor of Middle Eastern history at Ben-Gurion University. “Using Bombs to Stave Off War.” <em>The New York Times</em>. 7-18, </span><span style="color: blue; font-size: 10pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/opinion/18morris.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/18/opinion/18morris.html</a></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">] </span><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 10pt;">Thus, the plan: United States Federal Government should substantially decrease the size of its nuclear arsenal by immediately initiating a policy of full disarmament.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contention Two: Then As Farce</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The politics of nuclear weapons are ideological in nature – they attempt to present reality as an ontological totality, depicting policies such as deterrence as natural outgrowths of technological advancement, making nuclear weapons both the source and solution to violence.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Daly, 2004 </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Glyn, “Risking the Impossible”]<br />
All ideology presents reality … things actually are.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Nuclear policy in particular is devolving into a game of pre-emption: the US sees its role as targeting potential threats and doing away with them before they have a chance to commit their crimes. Ignoring the inevitability of antagonism by deferring our confrontation with catastrophe produces a life lived under its permanent threat, one which Zizek argues is not worth living.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Zizek, 2003 </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">[Slavoj, In These Times, “Catastrophes: Real and Imagined”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizekcatastrophes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizekcatastrophes.htm</a>]</span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">In the war on terror, imminent … meant its exact opposite. </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br />
And, popular culture’s spin on ideology is represented by the film <em>Dark City</em>, which depicts Murdoch’s personal traversal of his fantasy – first by realizing the illusory nature of that which he desired and second by discovering that his understanding of his world was constructed by an alien race, the <em>Strangers</em>. Our argument, however, isn’t that an extraterrestrial collective is mediating society, but rather, the individuals are held under the sway of a limiting ideology. But this control is not absolute – ideology depends on an individual’s subjective investment – making the act of opting for the impossible the basis for any challenge.<br />
McGowan, 2004 </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Todd, Professor of English @ The University of Vermont, “Lacan and Contemporary Film,” “Fighting Our Fantasies,” pgs. 150-153] </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">But ideology penetrates even … way ideology functions. </span><br />
<strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;"><br />
To wake up is to traverse the fantasy of stability – we are not “the rev” or a literal catastrophe, rather, an act rendered impossible by the status quo political outlook. By collapsing the distance between ourselves and the fantasy, just as Murdoch confronted Shell Beach to find that it was no more than a poster on a brick wall, we are able to short-circuit fantasy’s operation. Psychoanalysis is a pre-requisite to policy discourse as no authentic politics can exist without it.<br />
McGowan, 2004 </span></strong><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">[Todd, Professor of English @ The University of Vermon, “Lacan and Contemporary Film,” “Fighting Our Fantasies,” pgs. 160-169] </span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">Because symbolic authority… authors a radical break. </span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Contention Three: You are What You Read<br />
The debate concerning nuclear weapons is riddled with the rhetoric of apocalypse, turning political discourse into a game of fiat pets engaged in hundreds of scenarios, all placing humanity on the brink of disaster. Relying on the threat of nuclear catastrophe to direct discourse is the ultimate form of conservatism, marking any consideration of a different world as impossible.<br />
Lichterman, 2009</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> [Andrew, Program Director of Western States Legal Foundation, “Deterrence, Torture, Power”, April 7, www.disarmamentactivist.org] </span><br />
<span style="line-height: 14px;">So too with “deterrence.”… they are not.</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, the world of debate, too, is falling victim to an absolutely ideological framework. This “politics-as-making” imposes mastery and control, the precepts of totalitarianism, into political discourse by defining the spectrum of possible policies as those which push one on to some idealized end. Do not grant their framework a neutral stance.<br />
Saurette, 1996 </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[Paul, “I Mistrust All Systematizers and Avoid Them: Nietzsche, Arendt, and the crisis of the Will to Order in international relations theory”, Millennium Journal of International Studies, ,Vol. 25, No. 1]</span><br />
Arendt contends that … nor beyond critique.
