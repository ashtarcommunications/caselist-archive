START CP<br />
The United States Executive Branch negotiators on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty Follow On Treaty should propose to Russian Federation negotiators that the treaty include a binding commitment to prohibit the first use of nuclear weapons against the Islamic Republic of Iran. The United States Congress should immediately schedule a cloture vote on financial reform regulation for February 8th 2010.<br />

Council of State CP<br />
The United States Supreme Court will require creation of a permanent bipartisan council of state within the executive branch, overseen by a joint committee of Congress as per the advocacy of Miller. The United States Supreme Court will require two members of the council of state be given observer status on the National Security Council. The United States Supreme Court will prohibit first use of nuclear explosive devises against the Islamic Republic of Iran without prior approval by the council of state.<br />

 A) The Truth:<br />
The fundamental assumption of military hardliners is accurate:<br />
Rauchhaus<span style="font-weight: normal;">, Robert. “Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis: A Quantitative Approach,” Journal of Conflict Resolution, 2/5/09</span><br />
&lt;jcr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/53/2/258&gt;<br />
“As the results presented in the previous… toward the lower end of the conflict scale.”<br />
<br />
Deterrence specifically solves – Long Major power peace proves<br />
Welsh, John. USAWC Strategy Research Project US army War College Publications “Nuclear Deterrence is Here to Stay” 2003.<br />
&lt;www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTFDoc?AD=ADA414501&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&gt;<br />
“Deterrence is a complex concept…exterminating the entire human race.”<br />
<br />
Post Cold War empirics are on our side<br />
Alagappa, Muthiah “reinforcing National Security and Regional Stability The Implications if Nuclear Weapons and Strategies,” The Long Shadow, 2009. P. 512<br />
“I extend that argument in this study to include the effects…<u>the roles andeffects of nuclear weapons in this larger context.”</u><br />
<br />
And, dozens of regional conflicts that never escalated prove our point<br />
Monroe, Robert R. Sept. 2009 “A Perfect Storm over Nuclear Weapons<br />
&lt;aripower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj09/fal09/Monroe.html&gt;<br />
“<u>Nuclear deterrence has been with us since</u>…and the defeat of communism without violence.”<br />
<br />
Deterrence does not need to be perfect in order to be comparatively better than alternatives<br />
Colby 07 Elbridge. IOrbis v. 51 no3 Summer 2007.<br />
“In between these two extremes, deterrence is a security policy…and thereby reduces our exposure to risk.”<br />
<br />
B) Realism:<br />
It's accurate – several reasons<br />
First studies, pragmatism and best explains motivations<br />
Mearsheimer The Tragedy of Great Power Politics 2001<br />
www.wwnorton.com/catalog/fal11/00 02025excerpt.htm<br />
“The optimists’ claims that security competition…the major states in each region at peace. “<br />
<br />
Second – Commitment to the empirical address concerns over Realisms static or State-centric nature<br />
Murray, Alastair J.H., Reconstructing Realism 1997, p. 187-8<br />
“Ashley does, of course, attempt to argue in ‘Political realism and human interests’…it is only because of its current centrality to international politics.”<br />
<br />
Deterrence isn’t immoral – their claims are simplistic and ignore the effectiveness of deterrence at preventing the ultimate immorality of global war<br />
Joseph and REichart 98. Robert G and John F Orbis v42, Winter p. OCLC First Search<br />
“Morality and ethics. In terms of morality, the blanket charge…continue to spread among states explicitly hostile to democratic values.”<br />
<br />
C) Topicality: Voting Issue - Fairness and Education<br />
<br />
Current “roles are based on deterrence<br />
U.S. DoD and DoE “National Security and Nuclaer Weapons in the 21st Century<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://defenselink.mil/news/nuclearweaponspolicy.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://defenselink.mil/news/nuclearweaponspolicy.pdf</a> pp.3-4<br />
“Within this more fliexible portfolio, nuclear weapons…hostile states that endanger international order.”<br />
<br />

<span style="font-size: 90%;"> Abrams, 83 (Society, September October<br />
“These facts constitue a genuine paradox: the moral” “that will prevent nuclear war, on the other.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 90%;">Second - Nuclear deterrence will not grow obsolete which serves as uniqueness<br />
