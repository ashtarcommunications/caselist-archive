<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">First, our faith in God and Christ has been perverted. Since the 1950's Christianity and politics have fused into an American Civil religion that sees the United States as agents of God's will and America's nuclear dominance as a sign of God's blessing.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This unholy marriage of faith and violence was born at Hiroshima and has sanctioned a regime of official state violence that remains utterly blasphemous. It threatens the lives and morality of every person. </span></span><br />

<br />
</span></span><br />
Next we note that this approach is the only possible solution to state violence, especially the violence of nuclear weapons. The choice to resist cannot be reduced to a single policy, or outcome, but must arise from a refusal to cooperate in state regimes of violence.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Such is the thesis … </span><u>conscience of Christians.</u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And, we reject the notion of collective political engagement as &quot;Americans&quot;. The demand that we roleplay as if we were the state and participate in public debates as a part of a collective American identity is false. Discussions of &quot;our&quot; nuclear weapons &quot;our&quot; policies and &quot;our&quot; interests inevitably are coopted to create an idolatrous allegiance to the state that sanctions and participates in violence.<br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And, the focus of current debate practice on scenario-planning, technical discussions and convoluted consequentialist evaluation is only an extension of the nuclear state. Talking in these narrow and &quot;realistic&quot; ways kills any ability for the individual to make moral decisions. </span></span><br />

<br />
So much for the … <u>the thinking of everybody.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
And, the language of policymaking can never serve as an instrument of peace. It is the language of violence and power. Positions, impact magnitude, timeframe etc. all take place in a self-contained logic of death that determines what is true through violence.<br />

In other words <u>… is already in hell.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is only by resisting the demands of institutions that we can reclaim our own moral decision-making. Acceptance of institutional and traditional logics of policymaking robs us of our moral sense, enslaving us to the state and its institutions. It is only by rejecting such engagement and rejecting the status quo that we can begin to have hope for a better world. </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Last, institutional engagement and loyalty made the Holocaust possible and will guarantee nuclear annihilation. Once we have exchanged our own moral identity for that of an instrumental, calculative agent of the state we are doomed to cooperate in mass atrocity. We will be like Eichmann, sanely and quietly going about the business of horrifying violence as a mere function of our identity as minions of the state apparatus. </span><br />

Observation one, the nuclear heresy<br />
First, discussion surrounding nuclear weapons are nothing short of apocalyptic humanism. This obsession with out survival has forced us to ignore what makes our lives and deaths worthwhile and such a secular age is doomed to wage wars even more dangerous than the ones before.<br />
Hauerwaus 85 (against the nations, pp. 132-133)<br />
<br />
And, this survival centered attitutde has given birth to a new religion that worships the bomb. This discussion means we must engage in talks about God because the boundaries of our mortality have been met which demands a remapping of our transcendent vision. If mankind is truly approach the problems created by nuclear weapons we must transform the current secular model into a religious one renouncing nuclear arms.<br />
Chapman in 85 (G. Clarke, Speaking of God in a nuclear age, Anglican Theological Journal, SUmmer 1991)<br />
<br />
It is our obsession with the bomb and its destruction that renders us blind to the destruction going on all around us, Violence takes place all over the world, but is hidden by the big apocalypse.<br />
Plate and Linafelt in 2003 (Brent and Todd, &quot;Seeing Beyond the End of the World&quot; Journal of religion and Film, APril, 2003, unomaha.edu/`jrf/Vol7No1/seebeyond)<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size and/or reduce and restrict the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal by disarming its entire nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
Thus, we offer the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should disarm United States' nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
Observation two the theological imperative:<br />
<br />
IF we are to understand nuclear weapons must expose their mythology. Science is not neutral. Existence of weapons guarantees violence only disarm =s hope.<br />
Stringfellow in 82 (William, Keeper of the Word, pp. 103-113<br />

Observation three: the Cosmic Struggle<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Our apocalypticism requires us to reject that history repeats itself. The world does not operate on a string of causal relations. Such determinism destroys Creation and renders us hopeless.</strong><br />
<strong>Hauerwas, 95</strong></span>(Stanley, Professor of theology@ Duke, Dispatching the front, p. 109-110) In particular, apocalyptic...which is vouchsafed.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #231f20; font-family: Calibri,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>And, we acknowledge that the Aff is based in the Christian practice of hope and God’s providential control over history. The current practice of determinism engages in optimism instead of hope, believing that human actions are justified through predicting future events. This destroys history through constant repetition of what we desire, rather than allowing it to be what it is, Unpredictable and Unseen.</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong><span style="color: #231f20; font-family: AdvP49BB69,serif; font-size: 12pt;">Mathewes in 2007</span></strong> <span style="color: #231f20; font-family: AdvP49BB69,serif; font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">(Charles T. [prof of religious studies @ univ. of Virginia] <em>A Theology of Public Life</em>) We begin by... to help us resist.</span></span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;"><br />
And, it is this hope in God’s providence which must guide our approach to violence. We currently seek to justify violence because of its inevitability, but this feeds the false theology that humans have control over the world, which guarantees violence. We recognize that changes in policy or in ideology only beget such despair.</span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><strong>Williams 2005</strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Scott [prof. philosophy and ethics @ waynesbury College] <em>Christian Century,</em> may 31, 2005, </span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3215" rel="nofollow">http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3215</a><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">) How are Christians ... of the Kingdom.</span></span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Lastly, it is this nihilism that seeks to describe all encounters of the world outside the divine mind which renders violence meaningless. It sees life as a given rather than a gift, which guarantees neutrality towards all things. Such discourse, then, necessitates an epistemic articulation of the loss of death before the loss of life. </span></strong><br />
