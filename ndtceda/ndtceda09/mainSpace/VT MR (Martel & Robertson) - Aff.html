<span style="font-family: Arial;">observation 1 - Point and shoot, I know just what you mean...<br />
Nuclear discourse is defined by two regimes of discourse - the discourse of the nation-state and that of the non-nation state - both construct nuclear war as comparable only to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, subordinating the constant nuclear war waged against fourth world peoples, revealing a form of capitalist domination focused on destruction of the periphery.<br />
Masahide Kato (professor of political science @university of hawaii) &quot;Nuclear Globalism: Transversing Rockets, Satellites and Nuclear War via the Strategic Gaze,&quot; Alternatives vol. 18; 1993 p. 339<br />
Nuclear war has been… … a historical fact.<br />
<br />
observation 2 - in a world that's full of shit and gasoline...<br />
And, the rhetoric of nuclear globalism employs the techno-strategic gaze, rendering obsolete the notion of perspective, creating an illusion of homogeneity. the absolutization of the strategic gaze makes possible capitalist domination over the periphery<br />

Historical contestations over… … illusion of homogeneity.<br />
<br />
we'll isolate a few impacts -<br />
Specifically, capitalism of late has become focused not upon incorporation of those in the periphery, but a complete domination of it. Nuclear war has been waged since 1945 - the primary targets being the inhabitants of the periphery.<br />

The vigorous invasion… … and Indigenous Nations.<br />
<br />
Nuclear globalism constructs a nuclear fantasy bringing about the extinction of all life forms on earth, delegitimizing the continuing oppression of the fourth world, blinding us to the nuclear violence being waged continually.<br />

Nuclear criticism finds… …manifested in nuclear criticism.<br />
<br />
These instances of nuclear war are, quite simply, genocidal acts of human sacrifice, with a disparate effect on the indigenous peoples they target.<br />

<span style="line-height: 19px;">Neither the Western Native Americans… … some as genocide.</span><br />
<br />
Thus, the plan: The United States Federal Government should ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.<br />
<br />
observation 3 - solvency<br />
Ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is an important step towards healing the injuries to the peoples and cultures who we have tested on.<br />

reform, vision, and strategy, are key to overcoming systemic forms of oppression. Our project requires critical reforms<br />

Our ethic is a rejection of globalist technosubjectivity, and discursive movements which destroy third world movements.<br />

The sole focus on methodology, epistemology and ontology destroy the effectiveness of theory – only by refocusing our discussions on practical policy matters can allow theory to resonate outside of the debate.<br />
