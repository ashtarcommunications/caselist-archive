 Contention One: <br />
<br />
The creation of nuclear weapons has made clear our globally shared vulnerability – this international situation leaves two choices: either we can maintain our nuclear weapons in a futile attempt to secure ourselves or we can embrace this vulnerability by giving up our nuclear arsenal.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Rolfsen in 8</span></span> (Cdr. Sen. Gr. Raag Rolfsen, Yale Center For Faith and Culture, Breakout Session, “The Significance of Vulnerability in a Time of Crisis” Remarks: Sarah Smith Memorial Conferences 2008: “Are we safe yet?”)<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;The aim of this paper is to make plausible that </span><strong><u>the security situation that the world finds itself in today is</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">, at least &quot; </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;where questions of meaning are not exclusively answered through the application of calculation and technology.</span> &quot;<br />
<br />
We propose the second option, vulnerability is an inherent condition of human existence – we are always already given over to others. Violent actions will inevitably occur, but we must seek an ethical relationship with others rather than a violent one.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Mills in 2</span></span> (Katherine Professor of Philosophy at University of South Wales in Sydney, Australia, Normative Violence, Vulnerability, and Responsibility, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://differences.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/2/133.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://differences.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/2/133.pdf</a>)<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;In contrast, </span><span class="underline">Butler</span><span class="underline"> moves toward a conception of responsibility that is founded not only on our mutual &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;understanding of ethics would necessitate letting go of at least some dimensions of the account of subjectivation.</span> &quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the current debates about nuclear weapons and disarmament are caught up in a gendered international system which justifies disproportionate violence against women and minorities and prevents an effective discussion of the ethical consequences of nuclear weapons.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cohn and Ruddick in 2003 </span></span>(Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, Sara, Professor Emerita of Philosophy and Feminist Studies at Lang College of the New School for Social Research “A Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction”, Boston Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights Working Paper No. 104) <span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;One of the constitutive positions of anti-war feminism is that </span><strong><u>in thinking about weapons and wars, we must accord &quot;</u></strong> <br />
<strong><u>AND</u></strong> <br />
<strong><u>&quot;and concern for peace and morality, can have disastrous consequences for both men and women</u></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;">.34 &quot;</span><br />
<br />
Technostrategic discourse has defined the limits of nuclear policy discussion, de-emphasizing the violence their policies make possible and condemning any ethical concerns as feminine and baseless, these restrictions on the discussion doom us to a status quo of increasing violence.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cohn, Hill, and Ruddick in 2005 </span></span>(Carol, Director of the Boston Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, Felicity, Greenpeace International Political Adviser on Nuclear and Disarmament Issues, former Peace &amp; Security Advisor to UNIFEM's Governance Peace and Security team, Sara, Professor Emerita of Philosophy and Feminist Studies at Lang College of the New School for Social Research, “The Relevance of Gender for Eliminating Weapons of Mass Destruction”, Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission, Adapted from a presentation on June 12, 2005) <span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><br />
&quot;Why did he feel that way? First, he was transgressing a code of professional conduct<strong><u>. Expressing concern &quot;</u></strong> <br />
<strong><u>AND</u></strong> <br />
&quot;plans and WMD.vi&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus, we propose that the United States federal government should permanently and irreversibly disable the nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: <br />
<br />
The very existence of nuclear weapons exacerbates the risk of conflict; reliance on deterrence for protection actually increases the risk of nuclear use and escalation. Unilateral disarmament is an important first step towards an international system less endangered by war and mutually reinforcing threats.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Cohn and Ruddick in 2003 </span></span>(Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, Sara, Professor Emerita of Philosophy and Feminist Studies at Lang College of the New School for Social Research “A Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction”, Boston Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights Working Paper No. 104) <br />
<strong><u>&quot;Our tradition has advocated and will continue to advocate unilateral reduction in nuclear arms</u></strong>. Our &quot;<br />
AND<br />
<strong><u>&quot;weapons inspire</u></strong>. &quot;<br />
<br />
Attempts to erase vulnerability and deny disorder are founded on the fantasy that the world can maintain orderliness—they inevitably incite a violent response. We should instead embrace our vulnerability to violence in order to craft more responsible political solutions that do not incite violence.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Butler in 2</span></span> (Judith, Prof. of Rhetoric and Comparative Lit at Berkley, “Precarious Life”, pg. 28-30)<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span></span><br />
<span class="underline">&quot;Let us return to the issue of grief, to the moments in which one undergoes something outside one's &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
<span class="underline">&quot;order, or to reinvigorate a fantasy that the world formerly was orderly.&quot; </span><br />
<br />
Retaliation makes violence inevitable—it creates a cycle wherein retaliation is met with further retaliation. This increases the likelihood of violence as a reaction to conflict and results in masculine domination. The plan’s suspension of response is an act of vulnerability—this creates an international politics of mutual understanding and nonviolence.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Butler in 3 </span></span>(Judith, prof at Berkley, Interview with <em>The Believer Magazine</em>, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_butler" rel="nofollow">http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_butler</a>)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;JS: If revenge becomes cyclical because one strike leads to another ad infinitum, one way to stop the cycle is not to do what the cycle &quot; </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">AND </span><br />
<span class="underline">&quot;horrid masculinism.</span><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> There, we got to gender pretty quickly, didn’t we? &quot;</span><br />
<br />
As long as nuclear weapons exist, extinction is 100% inevitable – disarmament is the only solution<br />
Martin E. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hellman 2k8, </span></span>Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering @ Stanford, “On the Probability of Nuclear War,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/inevitability.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/inevitability.html</a><br />

<strong><u>&quot;for survival to a new mode of thinking which recognizes war as the ultimate threat to survival.&quot;</u></strong> <br />

Any justification to maintain any part of the arsenal is rooted in patriarchal conceptions of security which must be rejected – these theories just sustain patriarchal ideologies which result in flawed policy that risks extinction.<br />

And, deterrence theory fails. It requires that all actors behave in a so-called “rational” manner, ignores the propensity for human error and technological failure, and limits out any alternatives—this justifies massive arms build-up and the continued exclusion of femininity.<br />

Realist security politics relies on notions of masculine dominance which only recognizes interstate relations, naturalizing systemic violence and producing self-fulfilling prophecies about war and conflict.<br />
