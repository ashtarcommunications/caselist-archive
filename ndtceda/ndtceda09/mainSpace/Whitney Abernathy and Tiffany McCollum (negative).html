 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">All Louisville Teams/Affirmative and Negative:<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><em>Overview:</em></strong> <em>Every participant is bound to utilize debate community norms and procedures consistent with all of the constitutional and operating documents of the three organizations which govern the Navy tournament: the American Debate Association (ADA); the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA); and the umbrella organization of both, the American Forensics Association (AFA). Because the activity should be built on an assumption of “shared governance” between students as debaters, coaches/graduate assistants as judges and directors as faculty administrators who create the governing documents, the evaluation process for every debate must be tested and proven to be consistent with those governing documents. Accountability through faculty governance is missing in construction of a debate evaluation process currently created solely by students and judges.</em></span></li></ul><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><em>Our Criticism:</em></strong> We believe the current evaluation process in every CEDA/ADA/AFA policy debate is <strong><em><u>not constitutional</u></em></strong> for three reasons:</span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">While possible individual evaluation norms and procedures are identified, discussed and advocated openly, both inside and outside of every debate, <strong><em>the construction of an evaluation process for each debate using these conventions is unspoken, covert, and lacks transparency</em></strong> (which ones are used, how they are prioritized, how they work together, etc). </span></li></ol></li></ul><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Each debate begins with our opponent putting the content of their “arguments” in a casebook entry and a judging philosophy that discusses different possible debate conventions/strategies that can possibly be used in the evaluation of those arguments. However, it is impossible to test and critique the evaluation process created because 1) it develops organically through the <em>application</em> by a judge of some combination of several specific conventions during the debate; and 2) is not revealed to debaters until <strong><u>AFTER</u></strong> the debate.<br />
In most cases, a judge uses a flow to separate the debate strategies/tactics/arguments, then relies on his or her training and experience to prioritize and assess the arguments and strategies, creating an individual evaluation process for that debate. However, this process is highly subjective, lacks transparency, and predictability since neither a team’s casebook entry nor judging philosophy explicate the entire process. This prevents any meaningful predictability as well as any level of fairness to allow our constitutionally protected challenge of the <em>entire process</em>. It is impossible to test whether the evaluation process is consistent with the organizational documents and principles that govern this debate. And when a flow is not used, the evaluation process is even more subjective, and that includes Louisville judges.</span><br />
<ol><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><em>Debaters and judges don’t consistently practice or enforce all of the individual organizational rules</em></strong>, especially the ADA standing rules.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Specifically at this tournament, <strong><em>the American Debate Association does not demonstrate how their standing rules uphold, support, and are consistent with other</em></strong> ADA documents like the mission statement in the constitution, as well as the <strong><em>governing documents</em></strong> of the Cross Examination Debate Association and American Forensics Association.</span></li></ol></ol><ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><em>Our Speeches:</em></strong></span></li></ul><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our speeches in this debate provide ethos, pathos, and logos for our criticism above, demonstrating why our past attempts this season to offer an alternative evaluation <em>process</em> have consistently failed. We will challenge whether the contemporary evaluation process allows students, judges, and faculty governance to engage in the shared responsibility for the constructing a constitutional evaluation process. We protest that the existing process is incapable of protecting our constitutional rights as granted in the organizational documents (ADA/CEDA/AFA) that govern this debate. We choose to stand in unity with the entire University of Louisville Malcolm X Debate Society embracing our mission to “increase effective decision making for a multicultural democracy.</span><br />
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><em>Our Demands:</em></strong></span><ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That each team and judge must make <strong><em>a written commitment</em></strong> to follow organizational governing written documents. Doing so creates clear expectations of a constitutional evaluation process in every debate round at this tournament.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That the evaluation process created from existing conventions, norms and procedures <strong><em>is made transparent</em></strong> through inclusion in each team’s casebook and every judge’s philosophy. This is necessary to create both predictability and accountability.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That each participant of this tournament is held accountable for a <strong><em>reasonable assessment method</em></strong> of those written evaluation processes. In the CEDA Constitution, Article XV, the Statement of Ethical Principles, Section 2 on Educator Practices, part D. says that a written ballot must be provided for every debate. Since most tournaments no longer give out ballots, we have given you a ballot and ask that you complete it and return it to us before we leave this room.</span></li></ol></li></ul><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">These demands are not <strong><em>optional</em></strong> considerations for debaters and judges. The ignored community reality is that academic debate is a system of shared governance between faculty directors and administrators, graduate assistants as coaches, and students as debaters. The written documents that govern this tournament cannot be undermined, assumed, or usurped by the created evaluation process used in any debate. Moreover, we believe that the casebook and judging philosophy create a contractual relationship between members that serve to create accountability and responsibility in the shared governance process.<br />
The casebook and judging philosophies are the customs used to facilitate preparation, and as such the entire evaluation process should be clearly communicated in these documents. Courts will likely recognize these types of customs as a large part of the contractual relationship for debate as a higher education systems of shared governance. Hence, we demand that the evaluation process is explicated in casebook entries and judging philosophies to ensure predictability, fairness, and accountability.<br />
Steven Poskanzer’s 2002 <u>Higher Education Law: The Faculty</u>, concludes that “courts have become increasingly willing to recognize and enforce contractual relationships within the academy itself: between the institution and its faculty and between the institution and potential, current, and former students.” (p20) Kaplan and Lee’s 1995 3rd edition of <u>The Law of Higher Education</u> says that the scope and terms of the contract come from a variety of places. “The written contract may range from a notice of appointment…to a lengthy collective bargaining agreement…Or it may not be called a contract at all, but a faculty handbook or an institutional policy manual. (p150)” Poskanzer points out that “The significance of written institutional rules or policies- and, in their absence, <em>unwritten</em> institutional custom and practice- in defining the legal rights and duties of members of the academic community cannot be overestimated.” </span>
