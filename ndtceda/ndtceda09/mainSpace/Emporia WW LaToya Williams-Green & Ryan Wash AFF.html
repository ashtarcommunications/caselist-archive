Districts Affirmative<br />
<br />
The affirmative begins with a discussion of the situation in Haiti and some specific stories of what is happening after the earthquake there. The 1AC tells the story of a person who was trapped under the rubble after the earthquake. The 1AC then transitions into a story for Ryan's childhood, specifically about his mother's struggle with alchoholism that eventually leads to her death. The 1AC continues into a few stories about Hurricane Katrina and the aftermath in New Orleans. Specific stories are shared and then the 1AC transitions back into the continuation of the story of Ryan's mother.<br />
<br />
The 1AC then turns to the resolution and ask the question of how similar the catastrophic results of a nuclear exchange would be to a Haiti and Katrina. Our argument revolves around the question of the day before -- what did Port au Prince look like the day before the earthquake? What about New Orleans? Our argument is that understanding the structural violence that preceded these catastrophes is essential to understanding the true impacts of these catastrophes. The status quo -- contra this perspective -- sees these catastrophes as the cause whereas the aff takes the perspective that these catastrophes like earthquakes, hurricaines, floods, and nuclear wars are actually just a flash exposure of structural violence that existed well before the catastrophe animates it. Our argument is that simply listening to the specific stories of individuals who are subject to this structural violence is a far more productive approach to understanding catastrophe than simply attempting to diagnose the instantaneous cause. Our argument is that the status quo has a problem of perspective in relationship to stuctural violence that circumvents our ability to understand any impact.<br />
<br />
There is no evidence in the 1AC.<br />

 <span style="font-size: 17px;"><strong>These stories are interlaced with memories about watching the show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as kids. The MMPR were a bunch of regular teenagers who Morphed -- became something else, something powerful and fantastic -- to fight against the villains, demons, and what not. Similarly, the affirmative identifies with these fantastic images in a comparable fashion to their own condition and discuss the relationship of this identification with structural violence and the contemporary arcane, insular, and exclusive nature of college debate.<br />
We conclude by saying that nuclear weapons never really had a lot to do with the daily forms of structural violence that Ryan encountered and thus read one of the following advocacy statements. (We do not defend these statements in a &quot;literal&quot; or &quot;instrumental&quot; sense or any other baggage-laden word).</strong><br />

 We have read a couple of different advocacy statements:<br />
<br />
<br />
We read evidence in the 2AC regularly but often times it is not the same from round to round. Here are a few cards that make it into the mix regularly.<br />
