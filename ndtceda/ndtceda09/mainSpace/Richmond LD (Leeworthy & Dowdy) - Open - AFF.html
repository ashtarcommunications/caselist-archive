Contention One:    We have a unique opportunity to consider the elimination of nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
It is possible to reduce nuclear weapons now and, although we do not agree with a standard impact calculus, we may all be doomed to an inevitable world of nuclear weapons and an eventual nuclear war.<br />

A Panel of Six Unbelievable Experts on Nuclear Weapons, 2009 (“Imagine there's no bomb”, The Age (Melbourne, Australia), April 8, 2009 Wednesday, NEWS; Opinion; Pg. 17 Malcolm Fraser (former prime minister), Sir Gustav Nossal (research scientist), Dr Barry Jones (former Labor government minister), General Peter Gration (former Defense Force chief), Lieutenant-General John Sanderson (former chief of the army and former governor of South Australia) and Assistant Professor Tilman Ruff (national president of the Medical Association for Prevention of War Australia).<br />
THERE has never …and is basically immoral.<br />
<br />
Yes, we know the Cold War is over, and yet we are still surrounded by nuclear weapons.  They have been stockpiled in warehouses, tucked “safely” onto their bunker shelves, maintained and protected by the rhetoric of politicians and nuclear scholars since the 1950s.  The language of nuclear “guardianship” is still alive and well, naturalizing nuclear weapons as a part of everyday American life.<br />

PLAN:  The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce and restrict the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />

Contention Two: Rhetorically Reversing the Pile!  The Stockpile Stewardship Program or SSP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The SSP is a major component of the US’s nuclear program.<br />

<br />
As planned, …located in seven states.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The SSP is a LEGAL excuse to build more dangerous weapons than EVER imagined.  Previous federal statements prove.<br />

<br />
In planning and implementing the SSP,<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuclear policy, public opinion and official rhetoric are one and the same.  Ignoring the power of nuclear rhetoric dooms any policy to failure.<br />

<br />
In his related critique …media, and the people?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The language of stewardship simultaneously depicts the nuclear stockpile as an outdated relic and a cornerstone of US national security.  Rearticulating the importance of nuclear weapons in the hegemonic discourse of commodity production replaces their destructive power with tame rationality, and allows officials to, literally, keep the ticking bomb on the shelf for a rainy day without any objection.<br />

<br />
The second strategy …on this planet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons are art.  Poets and Presidents have manipulated the language and imagery of nuclear war to control public opinion.  Now is the time paint our own pictures and take control of the debate about nuclear weapons.<br />
