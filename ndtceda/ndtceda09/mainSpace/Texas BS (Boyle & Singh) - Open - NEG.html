We understand the desire of the Affirmative and their enjoyment of the adversarial form of debate as it has been practiced historically. However, we believe that the loss of civility is rooted in this adversarial form and that is the root of all oppression and violence.<br />
Bone, Griffin, and Scholz 2008<br />
(Jennifer, Cindy, and Linda, “Beyond Traditional Conceptualizations of Rhetoric: Invitational Rhetoric and a Move Toward Civility,” Western Journal of Communication, October / December)<br />
Our criticism is one of form. It appears that the Affirmative conceives of debate as adversarial but we offer a view of debate and argument as one of lovers engaged in constructive argument that we feel would be nice.<br />

They conceive of our link claims to be links of omission, but they aren’t. There are literally infinite starting positions from which the Affirmative can make their argument – the one that they chose, at the expense of the others, is indicative of their beliefs and perspective.<br />

The 1ACs framework of future-oriented conflict management is a coping strategy that attempts to allay our fundamental anxiety surrounding the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki with the fantasy of control.<br />

[Robert Jay and Greg, Hiroshima in America: Fifty Years of Denial, p. XII-XV]</span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 10pt; font-variant: small-caps;"><br />
<br />
The 1AC’s vocabulary for discussing nuclear violence reduces hiroshima to a pile of corpses only useful for the scientific data it provides us about the potential effects of future wars. The haunting quality of the grave is traded for the sterile image of the cadaver. </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Foard, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Arizona State University, 1997<br />
[James A., “Imagining Nuclear Weapons: Hiroshima, Armageddon, and the Annihilation of the Students of Ichijo, School Journal of the Amencan Academy of Religion ]<br />
<br />
<br />
We can run from memory but we cannot hide -- the 1AC’s disavowal of the anxiety produced by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ultimately fails. The drive to securitize our anxiety concerning mass death fuels an endless process of militarization and threat production that makes all manner of State violence inevitable.<br />

Alternative: Vote neg. as a standstill in order to remember the dead. Against the aff’s obsession with the future-threats, nuclear control,and management, the alternative embraces a backwards glance that confronts the catastrophe of technostrategic thought, while providing a voice for the dead.<br />

CASE<br />
<br />
<br />
Their calls for disarm is not a recognition of the lack that is inherent in the drive because they claim to “solve” for the dangers of securitization. You can never satiate the drive, only displace desire onto to different objet a.<br />
<br />
Lacan 1973<br />
<br />
[Jacques, Seminar XI: The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, p179-80]<br />
<br />
The affirmative talks about security as if it is desire, but it’s not, it’s one of a drive – the oral drive that seeks to make one whole and the anal drive that seeks to expunge danger. However, they place their focus not on the drive, but on the objet petit a, which is irrelevant in relation to drive. Further, the affirmative is nothing but a displacement of the objet a from a securitization based on the objet a of the missile to the security promised via the objet a of disarm. This turns the case because the focus on the objet a is irrelevant in relation to drive.<br />
<br />
Lacan 1973<br />
<br />
[Jacques, Seminar XI: The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, p168]<br />
<br />
The affirmative misconceives the source of desire – desire is always the desire of the Other. Rather, they locate their argument in the drive, which is irrelevant to the objet a that they attempt to eliminate. For Lacan, desire is always rooted in the desire for recognition by the Other, but this is a desire that can never be recognized. We do not endorse the gendered language of Lacan.<br />

 <br />
A. The affirmative makes a call for the reduction of nuclear weapons,<br />
but stops short of recognizing the need for total disarm. This<br />
betrays their true intentions, which is centered around a desire to<br />
maintain the ability to annihilate the “enemy.” The affirmative is<br />
nothing but a confession to purge themselves of guilt and apply a<br />
soothing salve to the cognitive dissonance they feel. This<br />
psychological compensation only replicates the dangers of nuclear<br />
weapons and makes the situation worse, turning the case. We must<br />
embrace the global gentzsituation and accept nothing short than a<br />
demand of zero – a demand that says there can be no excuse for the<br />
existence of these weapons or the wars we intend to fight with them.<br />
