Only COMPLETE and UNILATERAL removal of US TNWs solves<br />
First – Reciprocal Concessions<br />
US withdrawal first is key – changes the conditions for TNW discussion within Russia<br />

The plan provides momentum for transparency – that’s enough to solve the advantages<br />

Informaworld]<br />
A transparency agreement … rather than geographical terms.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Second – Dialogue <br />
US withdrawing first is a prerequisite to even negotiating about Russian removal<br />

In addition, withdrawal … technology around the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
And – unilateral action solves Russian fears of US intentions – boosts relations and prevents an accidental launch<br />
MOSHER 2003 (David E., Senior Policy Analyst @ RAND, Beyond the Nuclear Shadow: A Phased Approach for Improving Nuclear Safety and U.S-Russian Relations, Pg. 31-32)<br />
The phased approach …nonproliferation and counterterrorism. <br />
<br />
<br />
Third – Moderates:<br />
TNW presence in NATO brews nationalist sentiments and distrust – plan undercuts the only argument hardliners use to justify inaction<br />
SOKOV 2009 (Nikolai, Senior Research Associate at CNS, worked at the Institute of US and Canadian Studies and the Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow.

The Politics of Russian TNW. …in areas of interest to Russia. <br />
<br />
<br />
And, there’s no offense – ALL of Russia’s security justifications for maintenance of its TNWs are a result of a perceived need – US removal signals abandonment of Cold War strategy<br />
ARBMAN &amp; THORNTON 2003 (Gunnar and Charles, Swedish Defence Research Agency, Russia's Tactical Nuclear Weapons Part I: Background and Policy Issues, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cissm.umd.edu/papers/files/thorntonrussia.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cissm.umd.edu/papers/files/thorntonrussia.pdf</a>) <br />
On the other hand, … of these NW to the U.S. <br />

There is a military consensus – European TNWs are utterly useless for deterrence.<br />

Informaworld]<br />
NATO expansion and changes… nuclear posture for a long time.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE 2: NPT<br />
Forward deployment of TNWs is an explicit NPT violation- justifies myriad scenarios for regional destabilization<br />

Though the cold war…&quot;under any circumstances&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Compliance is the critical internal link – U.S. action on TNWs signals a respect for NPT legitimacy and will slow proliferation <br />
WULF 2008 (Norman, Former Special Representative of the President for Nuclear Nonproliferation, 6/16, Federal News Service, Amrs Control Association Conference; subject; addressing the challenged facing the NPT, Lexis)<br />
I think, however,…of nuclear control issues,<br />

Breakdown of the NPT. …but it does increase the odds.<br />

RATNER 2003 [1/17/03, Ellen, World Net Daily Executive Report]<br />
Experts predict that …look like kid stuff.<br />

Even a minor conflict will go nuclear <br />
KNIGHT RIDDER 2000 (“Top administration officials warn stakes for U.S. are high in Asian conflicts,” 3/10)<br />
Few if any experts …for potential disaster.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
And – nonproliferation efforts are key – the world is reaching a tipping point and further acquisition guarantees a RAPID spread of weapons<br />
PERRY et al 2009 (William, former secretary of defense, America’s Strategic Posture, The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf</a>)<br />

From the standpoint of an …NWFZs are steps along the road.<br />

Second – US withdrawal of its TNWs prevents emulation of nuclear sharing, bolsters Article VI, and restores NATO credibility<br />

<br />
Contention 1: Thinkability<br />
Tactical nuclear weapons constitute a blurred line between conventional and nuclear capabilities. Our military doctrine treats them simply as a phase of war’s escalation while ignoring what use of nuclear weapons actually means<br />
Turner 2003 [Stansfield, Former director of Central Intelligence, Professor- University of Maryland, Tactical Nuclear Weapons- Emerging Threats in an Evolving Security Environment, Foreword, Page viii]<br />
The second reason …very thin tightrope.<br />
<br />
<br />
This notion of thinkability inevitably invites use of our forward-deployed weapons. Nuclear capabilities become merely a tool in the box of equally permissible capabilities<br />
Chossudovsky 2006 [Michael, Professor of Economics at the University of Ottawa and Director of the Center for Research on Globalization, February 22, Is the Bush Administration Planning A Nuclear Holocaust?, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/us-chossudovsky190107.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/us-chossudovsky190107.htm</a>]<br />
At no point since…commanders in the &quot;war theatre&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Coupled with the faith in technology to protect us from the omniscient nuclear danger, the growing willingness to use TNWs makes miscalculation inevitable<br />
Blair 2007 [Bruce, founder and president of the World Security Institute, “A Rebuttal of the U.S. Statement on the Alert Status of U.S. Nuclear Forces”, Center for Defense Information, November 6, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?documentid=4135" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?documentid=4135</a>]<br />
Both the United States …confrontation between them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2 – Imperial Order<br />
Forward-deployments are a tool of NATO-US aggression. Our nuclear posture is part of a double-standard based on notions of nonproliferation that result in pre-emptive nuclear strikes<br />
Chossudovsky, Professor of Economics at the University of Ottawa and Director of the Center for Research on Globalization. 2007 [Michael, September 27, US, NATO and Israel Deploy Nukes directed against Iran, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://justice4lebanon.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/us-nato-and-israel-deploy-nukes-directed-against-iran/" rel="nofollow">http://justice4lebanon.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/us-nato-and-israel-deploy-nukes-directed-against-iran/</a>]<br />
Several Western European …threatens the future of humanity.<br />
<br />
These nuclear bases are critical to extending the reach of US militarism and creating a foothold for US economic and political hegemony<br />
Lutz 2009 [Catherine, Watson Institute professor (research) and holds a joint appointment with the Department of Anthropology, The Bases of Empire: The Global Struggle Against U.S. Military Posts, p. 111-112]<br />
CAAB and the Lakenheath Action Group …had rights of access.19<br />
<br />
<br />
This underscores the identity of NATO as a tool of imperialism- Its desire to expand creates cycles of insecurity leading to violent interventions. Despite the end of the Cold war, it moves eastward in an attempt to contain the Russian threat using military and economic dominance.<br />
Cohen 1998 [Mitchel, co-editor of Green Politix, the national newspaper of the Greens/Green Party, February 19th, Against NATO’s war in Yugoslavia, BOMBING THE BRIDGE TO THE 21ST CENTURY: Behind NATO's Bombardment of Yugoslavia, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thing.net/~oliveworks/cohen2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thing.net/~oliveworks/cohen2.html</a><br />
The subsequent &quot;humanitarian&quot; …action [i.e., the UN] cannot be orchestrated.&quot; (NY Times, March 8, 1992)<br />
<br />
<br />
The intersection of conservative geopolitical ordering and neoliberal exploitation makes extinction inevitable. We must reject the kill to save mentality inherent in NATO's posture. The most violent acts in history are linked to expendibility and extermination of the other.<br />
Santos 2003 [Boaventura de Sousa, leading Portuguese social theorist, the director of the Center for Social Studies at the University of Coimbra, Collective Suicide?, Bad Subjects, Issue #63, April 2003, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html" rel="nofollow">http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html</a>]<br />
According to Franz Hinkelammert, … of horror and destruction.<br />
<br />
We should not underestimate the power of TNWs currently deployed in Europe – they are a pillar of NATO unity and deterrence posture<br />
Pincus, ‘9 [Walter, 1/9, The Washington Post, “Panel Urges Keeping U.S. Nuclear Arms in Eruope,” Debbie]<br />
The United States should… administration will be appointing over here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the plan disables the pathways of NATO secrecy and violence by eliminating its symbolic value<br />
Millar 2003 [Alistair, director of the Center on Global Counterterrorism cooperation, teaches at the Elliott School of International Affairs at The George Washington University, Tactical Nuclear Weapons- Emerging Threats in an Evolving Security Environment, Russia, NATO, an Tacital nuclear weapons after 11 september, page 90]<br />
NATO posits that it heavily …public awareness and concern.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, removing TNWs pulls the rug from under NATO – it undermines the Alliance’s ability to utilize its theater nuclear deterrent to justify “out of area” expansion<br />
Polser 2004 [Brian, United States Air Force Major and Masters in National Security Affairs from the Naval Postgraduate School, “Theater Nuclear Weapons in Europe: The Contemporary Debate”, Strategic Insights, Vol. 3 Issue 9, September]<br />
U.S. and Allied …nuclear roles and responsibilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Solvency<br />
Finally, even if the aff doesn’t solve completely it’s not a reason to reject – posing the possibility of eliminating nuclear weapons is enough<br />
Scoblic 2008 [J. Peter, executive editor of the New Republic, “Disarmament Redux”, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists March/April, p. Metapress]<br />
Of course, in a world …question of disarmament is broached.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, in the face of a military nuclear industrial complex that garners its power from silence and the illusion of invulnerability, the aff’s elimination of nuclear weapons disrupts the narrative of the monolithic, impermeable nuclear industry<br />
Lutz 2009 [Catherine, Watson Institute professor (research) and holds a joint appointment with the Department of Anthropology, The Bases of Empire: The Global Struggle Against U.S. Military Posts, p. 101]<br />
The fact that … people to believe (Haraway 1991).<br />
<br />
<br />
We do not need to abandon the system altogether – we simply need a few committed intellectuals to maintain persistent pressure against the nuclear complex<br />
Mello 2006 (Greg, executive director of the Los Alamos Study Group, &quot;The Way is the Goal - Disarmament Now!&quot; Nuclear Age Peace Foundation's International Law Symposium p <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/programs/international-law/annual-symposium/2006_papers/mello-greg_napf-2006-international-law-symposium.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/programs/international-law/annual-symposium/2006_papers/mello-greg_napf-2006-international-law-symposium.pdf</a>)<br />
U.S. society is in the…we have enough people.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan is a critical starting point for raising public consciousness activism. Provides the impulse for an upwelling of visibility and support that is critical to keeping militarism in check<br />
Wittner 2004 [Lawrence S., professor of history at the State University of New York-Albany, “The power of protest: the campaign against nuclear weapons was not simply an ideological movement; it was a potent political force.”, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Vol. 60 Iss. 4, p. Expanded Academic]<br />
The bad news is that … before, it can do again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only this form of resistance against US nuclear dominance can strike a blow against the forces of militarism that have become the unspoken norm of American politics. This really is our only hope of avoiding annihilation<br />
Lichterman 2003 (Andrew, policy analyst for Western States Legal Foundation, &quot;Missiles of Empire: America's 21st Century Global Legions&quot; Western States Legal Foundation, Information Bulletin, p. www.wslfweb.org/docs/missiles03.pdf )<br />
Today, however, both…more of nuclear dominance. 74<br />
<br />
The aff is good thinkin’ – Advocating workable ideas provides hope and strength for anti-nuclear movements -- in a world where pessimism and cynicism are the norm we must seize our opportunity and take steps towards getting rid of nuclear weapons.<br />
Roche 2007 [Honorable Douglas, chairman of the Middle Powers Initiative, “Turning Pessimism into Optimism: A Growing Consensus on Nuclear Disarmament”, Address to German Foreign Policy Conference “New Ways in Arms Control and Disarmament”, March 4-5, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gsinstitute.org/mpi/pubs/03_05_07_Roche_Berlin.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsinstitute.org/mpi/pubs/03_05_07_Roche_Berlin.pdf</a>]<br />
