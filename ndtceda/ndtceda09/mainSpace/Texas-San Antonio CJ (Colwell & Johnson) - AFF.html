NJDDT Round #1<br />
<br />
The roles and/or missions of nuclear deterrence that block dissent should be substantially reduced and restricted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deterrence relies on the paradox of institutional enemy construction: the government says we must deter another country because they are irrational, but deterrence relies on the belief where the other country will have a rational response. This paradox ensures that it’s in the government’s best interest to squash dissent.<br />

&quot; In this argument, the forbearer of the Domino Theory… might trigger a nuclear response. &quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
It’s all about who or what controls the frame of the debate. When argumentation reflects the practices of enemy construction that the state uses to justify policy, there is an endless cycle of imagined scenarios thought into existence. This creates a socialization whereby the justifications that undergird decionmaking become colonized by the thought of total war. Whether or not the threats constructed are true, this has real implications for how argumentation is tied to institutions that have a vested interested in eliminating dissent against the established order.<br />

&quot;It is in this context that the insecurity dilemma …<span class="underline">material basis for that policy</span>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Institutions control the terms of debate by defending deterrence in the face of total war. This creates the perpetual drive for action that subverts public dialogue.<br />

<br />
&quot;Flexibility is a central concept …<span class="underline">obligated to support such action</span>.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This creates a fixation on constructing and reconstructing governmentality. New emergencies are thought up continually in order to perpetually justify the knee-jerk impulse for policy response. This serial policy failure is evident in deterrence and debate itself. Governmentality of this kind creates a system in which we advertize and sell the best crises to policy experts in a cycle of futility. The policy experts have interests in creating a crisis to justify a policy response and keep the status quo unchanged, perpetuating the management of life.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The more argumentation mirrors the way institutions enact crises to motivate action, the more debate is rendered meaningless. It’s always measured against the risk of total war, creating subconscious withdrawal from criticism against deterrence. This is why criticism must be an end in and of itself, because if it’s value is suspended to temporarily avoid a future crisis, that cedes debate and decisionmaking to institutions in a form of violent representation.<br />

&quot;Institutions claim that deterrence is a public good. However…<span class="underline"> paradox that can only be managed from above</span>.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Institutional deterrence logic has been reproduced in academic debate. Using debate purely as a simulation where we talk about things we have little control over detracts from the important task of determining what the political relevance of debate is IN THE FIRST PLACE. This weds debate to the same practices that institutions use to rig the game, ensuring that the control over what debate simulates remains in the hands of elites. In other words, Mitchell had it right the first time…<br />
