Plan Texts:<br />
The United States federal government should modify its nuclear mission to include a pledge of No First Use to all signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, as well as all non-signatory allies of the United States.<br />
<br />
The United State federal government should declare not to use nuclear weapons first.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should pledge a policy of No First Use.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage: Chinese Modernization<br />
<br />
China is beginning to modernize in the face of a changing security environment -the depth of changes and decisions about changes in posture will be driven by US decisions<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Chinese nuclear modernization is at a critical juncture…..<br />
<br />
…..China’s continued rise as a major global power.<br />
US first-use posture is a key driver of Chinese modernization<br />

In this context …<br />
<br />
…may join in nuclear weapons limitation negotiations.<br />
<br />
We will isolate three impacts<br />
First, Accidents, modernization makes US-China escalation to nuclear conflict by miscalculation or accident much more likely – multiple scenarios<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
…beyond mere conventional or even theater warfare.<br />

At the same time, however, …<br />
<br />
…a military misadventure with the US.’<br />
<br />
And, that makes questioning US extended deterrence inevitable risking miscalculation and escalation- modernization will increase pressure on China to abandon NFU<br />
<br />

<br />
It is clear from the above discussions that current…<br />
<br />
…United States that China is striving for regional hegemony.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, If China moves or even modifies it’s No First Use Doctrine the end result would the end of Sino-US relations, conservative overreaction and total destruction arms control, proliferation, arms racing, nuclear war over Taiwan, and accidental wars - turns all DA impacts<br />

…nuclear weapons is to deter and, if necessary, respond to nuclear attacks.<br />
<br />
The alternative to the plan is to believe in the primacy of nuclear deterrence – this hubris results in nuclear conflicts with major powers - even the best deterrence can lead to escalation in crisis<br />

Press 2006 (Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame; Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania; The End of MAD?

<br />
Third, if Russia and China do not adequately reduce the vulnerability of their nuclear forces<br />
<br />
nuclear weapons were the preferred means of defending U.S. vital interests abroad.<br />
<br />
US policy is modeled– Obama must act to return to negative security assurances – key to preventing other countries from using weapons in crisis and restoring US credibility on non-proliferation leadership<br />

The NPR was reinforced in December 2002 by a presidentially…<br />
<br />
…dynamic that we set in motion in 2002 must now be recognized fully and countered.<br />
Proliferation causes much more likely nuclear war<br />

Henry Sokolski, June/July 2009 (executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, serves on the U.S. congressional Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism; Avoiding a Nuclear Crowd; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/46390537.html#n14" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/46390537.html#n14</a>)<br />
Combine these proliferation trends with the others noted…<br />
<br />
…proponents of nuclear abolition, nor their critics, would ever want.<br />
<br />
The plan can reverse the decline of the NPT and the alternative to the NPT is nuclear anarchy – deterrence failure and nuclear power blocs<br />

<br />
In conclusion, nuclear history has been shaped<br />
<br />
A no-first-use declaration would help address that concern.<br />
<br />
And we remove arguments that justify new programs – increasing our credibility for creating coalitions for counter-proliferation<br />
<br />
Scott D. Sagan 6/2009 (Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and Co-Director of Stanford’s Center for<br />
<br />
International Security and Cooperation; Survival, vol. 51 no. 3, June–July 2009, pp. 163–182)<br />
A US no-first-use declaration would also enhance US non-proliferation…<br />
<br />
…as would the ability of Tehran to claim it faces nuclear threats.<br />
<br />
First use will not deter terrorists– it will increase their support– international cooperation is the solution<br />
<br />
Cimbala, Stephen J. 2008 (Dr. Stephen J. Cimbala is Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the Pennsylvania State University-Brandywine; Joint Force Quarterly October 1, 2008)<br />
<br />
The threat of nuclear first use against terrorists…<br />
<br />
…and lethal nonnuclear munitions.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the risk of WMD terrorism is tiny and decreasing<br />
<br />
John Mueller 2009 (PHD; Department of Political Science, Ohio State University; International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament; 5/30; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Mueller_Terrorism.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Mueller_Terrorism.pdf</a>)<br />
The odds considered so far are for a single attempt by a single…<br />
<br />
…In addition, the science of nuclear forensics will advance.<br />
<br />
Also true of CBW’s<br />

The concept of a nuclear response to a CW or BTW…<br />
<br />
…still harder to foresee a nuclear response to such an attack.<br />
<br />
And true of Extended Deterrence – the links has no empirical basis and all available evidence points the other way<br />

A recurring argument on the American side…<br />
<br />
…the commitments of U.S. allies to nuclear nonproliferation.
