<br />
President Obama is attempting … efforts to learn about UFOs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if Obama fails to disclose classified knowledge, open contact with ETs is inevitable.<br />

On objective analysis, Barack Obama’s … military and spiritual impact as the war in Iraq.”<br />

John Johnson Jr. 09<br />
“At the time, NASA scientists said they hoped…than it would be if settles had to transport water from earth.”<br />

The moon bombing and the noble peace prize has paved the way for Obama to either lead us into galactic war or universal peace between December 10th and the start of 2010 as disclosure happens<br />
Plazmuh 09<br />
“An official announcement by the Obama administration…an interplanetary culture that openly deals with the challenges posed by extraterrestrial life.”<br />

Movement towards colonization of the moon will be seen as an extension of nuclear power projection, undermining peace progression, and sparking an intergalactic war.<br />

Tomorrow morning President Obama … monitoring our world and destructive stockpiles of nuclear weapons.<br />

Failure to take action and eliminate nuclear weapons will further an era of power politics that disregards ethics and universal peace in the name of national interest, secrecy, xenophobic hatred, resulting in the development of new-wave high-tech weaponry, and ultimately preventing the creation of a balanced global defense<br />

However, we must remain vigilant since even one nuclear weapon will undermine our ability to establish a culture of peace<br />

<br />
Advanced ethical extraterrestrial society … planetary, human and biosphere survival.<br />
<br />

<br />
Even if none of our intergalactic scenarios are true, working to abolishing nuclear weapons within the framework of exopolitics can usher in a new era of terrestrial peace and avert the proliferating wars and extinctions ongoing in the status-quo<br />

<br />
To help prevent war and hopefully usher in … is much work to be done!<br />
<br />
As a result we must understand politics as more than just an academic exercise since our universal rights are up for grabs, and whether it ends in violent repression or freedom is up to us<br />
