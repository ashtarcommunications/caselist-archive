The discourse of “deterrence” makes weapons seem defensive and removes debate over the existence of nuclear weapons, making the only relevant question if deterrence “works” – the linguistic move provides the elites ultimate ‘top cover’ backing world-wide wars of aggression to sustain a global empire.The result is that dominant opinion among experts and political leaders generates policy debate viewed historically is absurdly dangerous. Humanity can not long survive a global order of things in which “terror without end” lies at the center of power, with those who rule most of us in most places still deploying limitless violence to keep things as they are.<br />
Andrew Lichterman April 7, 2009 Western States Legal Foundation's Program Director, writes extensively on U.S. nuclear weapons and military space programs and their impacts on international arms control regimes and on prospects for disarmament, member of the editorial board of the International Network of Engineers and Scientists Against Proliferation Information Bulletin. Mr. Lichterman also taught law for many years, including courses on environmental law, legal history, and the rights of demonstrators. He holds a J.D. from Boalt Hall, U.C. Berkeley, and a B.A. from Yale.

&quot;The headlines tell us that President Obama is committed to working towards a nuclear weapons-free world ... “nonviolence or nonexistence” no longer is enough, now it also must be democracy or nonexistence, a full and final recognition of our collective vulnerability and our interdependence, one world, with every voice heard equally, or none.&quot;<br />
<br />
AND....What the United States calls “deterrence” is in reality the use of strategic weapons to underwrite the projection of force in pursuit of broadly defined “U.S. interests” anywhere on earth.<br />

 The Aff’s attempt to prevent nuclear use creates nukes as objects of desire. This latent yearning allows the possibility of nuclear conflict.<br />
Chaloupka 92 (William, <u>Knowing Nukes</u>, pg. 61-62)<br />
“This is my claim, then, in response to every attempt to strain meaning … heard constantly in American political talk over the last forty years: “Nuke ‘em!””<br />
<br />
Anti-nuclear declaratory policies are how states rhetorically maintains the legitimacy of their nuclear arsenals.<br />
Deudney 95 (Daniel, <u>On Security</u> ed. Lipschutz, pg. 104)<br />
“State apparatuses also can manage or compensate for he legitimacy problems … a vital instrument of state apparatus legitimacy during the nuclear era.”<br />
<br />
Nuclear apocalypse can no longer be a reality. The bomb has already gone off. Reflections on nuclear catastrophe feed a consumptive mode of being in which the apocalypse is producibility.<br />
Scherpe and Peterson 1987 (Klaus and Brent “Dramatization and De-Dramatization of the end” Cultural Critique No. 5. Winter pg. 95-97)<br />
“In the age of posthistorie, the end of the world … no less than a sift in the grammar of the end of the world”<br />
<br />
Security colonizes all politics and becomes the sole criteria for legitimation of state action – this leads to a cycle where security and terror only serve to legitimate each other.<br />
Bell 05 (Colleen “Biopolitical Strategies of Security: Considerations in Canada’s New National Security Policy” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.yorku.ca/yciss/publications/documents/WP34-Bell.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.yorku.ca/yciss/publications/documents/WP34-Bell.pdf</a>)<br />
“As an instrument of governance, security operates quite separately from discipline … not least of our ability to be citizens, democrats, or even humans.”<br />
<br />
The Rhetoric of nuclear apocalypse is a mechanism to maintain state domination. It ensures perpetual control of the population in the name of saving it from extinction.<br />
Coviello 2k (Peter <u>Queer Frontiers</u> ed. Boone et al.)<br />
“Perhaps. But to claim that American culture is at present decisively postnuclear … a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.”<br />
<br />
Alternative: Vote Neg<br />
Questioning the search for solutions opens up the space for alternative politics.<br />
Chaloupka 92 (William, <u>Knowing Nukes</u>, pg. 134-135)<br />
“We could, at least, protest against the kid of selves produced … We enter the era of the puzzle.”<br />
<br />
Even the best laid plans for nuclear limitation ultimately fail in the current setting – only the transitional politics of criticism can change the system<br />
Jeff Smith 1989 <em>Unthinking the Unthinkable</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> pg. 5-7</span><br />
Nuclear arsenals seem especially unhistorically contingent. … would have us believe that nothing is ever enough.”<br />
