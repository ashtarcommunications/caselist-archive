The case arguments we've read are already on the other wikis as well as the DA's.<br />
We've read a bunch of framework args and then the Nyquist stuff that just says that K args are a type of intellectual warfare that seek to undermine the United States. The impact is varies but is usually nuclear war.<br />
<br />
The K's we read are the Chaloupka K, Lacan K and our Baudrillard K.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Baudrillard K</u></strong><br />
The link arguments vary but the main one we read is the tyranny of the self link that says that utilizing the subject causes self hatred. We say that that causes us to attempt to relinquish our own suffering by relieving others suffering makes suffering a commodity.<br />
<br />
Other links we've read are some terrorism/security links, otherization links and some value to life claims.<br />
<br />
The alternative is object thought which we say allows us to challenge existing power structures as well as solve for our internal suffering.
