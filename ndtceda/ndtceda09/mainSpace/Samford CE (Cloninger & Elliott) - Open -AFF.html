Observation 1- The Status Quo<br />
<br />
The US has thousands of alert nukes both at home and abroad- they could put us on the fast track to extinction in minutes<br />
<br />
Mohling ’09 [Judith, May 14, staff writer for The Colorado Daily, “Peace Train: We must disarm” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.coloradodaily.com/news/2009/may/14/we-must-disarm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.coloradodaily.com/news/2009/may/14/we-must-disarm/</a>]<br />
<br />
President Barack Obama is… very meaning of civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
We’ve been very lucky so far- every day runs the risk of accidental exinction<br />
<br />
Crandell ’09 [Steven, Director of Development &amp; Public Affairs for the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, July 13, “Start a Revolution With A Video -- A 17 Year-Old Wins National Competition” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-crandell/start-a-revolution-with-a_b_247941.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-crandell/start-a-revolution-with-a_b_247941.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons proponents…suffer a nuclear winter).<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following plan: The United States federal government should revise U.S. strategic plans to eliminate launch on warning from available response options for its nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles and isolate silos from external launch control for its nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles. Questions, ask.<br />
<br />
Observation 2 is Solvency<br />
<br />
Removing “launch on warning” and launch control isolation solves accidental war and cyberterrorism while avoiding politics and sparking Russian reciprocity<br />
<br />
Rosenbaum ’08 [Ron, The Spectator columnist, May 9, “A Real Nuclear Option for the Nominees: Averting &quot;inadvertent&quot; war in two easy steps.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2191104/pagenum/all/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2191104/pagenum/all/</a>]<br />
<br />
In a footnote, Blair cites …leave us vulnerable to now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unilateral de-alerting would be seen as an incentive for Russian reciprocity<br />
<br />
Podvig ’04 [Pavel, SAC Research Associate and Acting Associate Director for Research at Stanford University, Nov. 1, “Reducing the Risk of Accidental Launch: A Case for Unilateral Action” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cisac.stanford.edu/news/reducing_the_risk_of_accidental_launch_a_case_for_unilateral_action_20050908/" rel="nofollow">http://cisac.stanford.edu/news/reducing_the_risk_of_accidental_launch_a_case_for_unilateral_action_20050908/</a>]<br />
<br />
The dangers of this…for Russia to reciprocate.<br />
<br />
And, even if we only solve for the US, we’re the most dangerous- overconfidence makes us overlook system errors<br />
<br />
Podvig ’04 [Pavel, SAC Research Associate and Acting Associate Director for Research at Stanford University, Nov. 1, “Reducing the Risk of Accidental Launch: A Case for Unilateral Action” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cisac.stanford.edu/news/reducing_the_risk_of_accidental_launch_a_case_for_unilateral_action_20050908/" rel="nofollow">http://cisac.stanford.edu/news/reducing_the_risk_of_accidental_launch_a_case_for_unilateral_action_20050908/</a>]<br />
<br />
The United States, on the other hand,…regardless of reciprocity.<br />
<br />
And, a consensus of strategic thinkers think that alert status doesn’t affect US deterrent strategy<br />
<br />
Blair ’08 [Bruce, President of the World Security Institute and former Minuteman launch officer, February 27, “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
An emerging consensus…use of a nuclear weapon.”<br />
<br />
Conventional weapons solve all their deterrence arguments<br />
<br />
Daley and Martin, 6-26-2009. Tad and Kevin, “North Korea, Iran, and the Demise of Nuclear Deterrence.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tad-daley/north-korea-iran-and-the_b_221243.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tad-daley/north-korea-iran-and-the_b_221243.html</a><br />
<br />
When one includes such things as …alone can fully do the job.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is Terrorism-<br />
<br />
Cyber attacks are on the rise and the US isn’t prepared for a strong attack- North Korea proves<br />
<br />
Baldor ’09 [Lolita, writer for the Associated Press, July 9, “US officials eye North Korea in cyber attack” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox/1225ad4269dbdc34" rel="nofollow">http://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox/1225ad4269dbdc34</a>]<br />
<br />
U.S. authorities on …in South Korea.<br />
<br />
Our alert systems are extremely susceptible to cyber-terrorism - hijacking, viruses and hackers can trigger the entire arsenal<br />
<br />
Blair ’08 [Bruce, President of the World Security Institute and former Minuteman launch officer, February 27, “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Beyond the familiar … signals carries real risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cyber-terrorism causes nuclear war<br />
Stephen Cimbala, professor of political science at the Pennsylvania State University Delaware County Campus, Summer 1999, Armed Forces &amp; Society: An Interdisciplinary Journal<br />
<br />
The nuclear shadow … unfortunate byproducts.<br />
<br />
And, alert nukes makes terrorist interception inevitable- only de-alerting solves terrorist access to our entire arsenal<br />
<br />
Blair ’04 [Bruce, president of the Washington-based Center for Defense Information and a former Minuteman launch officer, Sept. 19, “The Wrong Deterrence: The Threat of Loose Nukes is One of Our Own Making” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nuclearfreenz.org.nz/bruceblair.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nuclearfreenz.org.nz/bruceblair.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
Even the U.S. nuclear …ourselves against the real threats.<br />
<br />
That causes extinction<br />
<br />
Sid Ahmed 2004. (Mohammed. Extinction! <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm</a><br />
<br />
What would be the consequences…we will all be losers.<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 is Accidental War<br />
<br />
Alert nuclear weapons make accidents inevitable- even the best control systems can’t stop an accidental launch<br />
<br />
Sidhu ’08 [Waheguru, MacArthur Fellow at Oxford, St. Antony's College, “De-alert Nuclear Weapons, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/nwc/mon1sidhu.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/nwc/mon1sidhu.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The Berlin Wall was…as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Human error is especially likely<br />
<br />
Blair ’08 [Bruce, President of the World Security Institute and former Minuteman launch officer, “Taking Nuclear Forces Off Day-to-Day Alert” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert</a>]<br />
<br />
This launch-ready posture… the executing forces.<br />
<br />
Maintaining ICBMs on high alert makes accidental nuclear war with Russia inevitable<br />
<br />
Phillips and Starr ’06 [“Change ‘Launch on Warning’ Policy”, Alan Phillips is a retired physicist and physician who did radar research for the British army. Steven Starr is a medical technologist trained in nuclear engineering. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v22n3p14.htm" rel="nofollow">http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v22n3p14.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
As long as the United States …is inexcusably dangerous.<br />
<br />
US-Russian nuclear war outweighs all other nuclear conflicts<br />
<br />
Phillips and Starr ’06 [“Change ‘Launch on Warning’ Policy”, Alan Phillips is a retired physicist and physician who did radar research for the British army. Steven Starr is a medical technologist trained in nuclear engineering. ]<br />
<br />
We address only … flight times involved.<br />
<br />
Our nuclear war outweighs– war with Russia is the only scenario that ensures planetary extinction.<br />
<br />
Caldicott 2k2 [(Helen- Founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility, The new nuclear danger, p. 7-12)]<br />
<br />
If launched from Russia… annihilation of the planet.<br />
<br />
Try or die for the aff- it only takes one accidental launch to end civilization<br />
<br />

Steven Starr is a medical technologist trained in nuclear engineering. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v22n3p14.htm" rel="nofollow">http://archive.peacemagazine.org/v22n3p14.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
The disaster of an …failure of that kind.<br />
<br />
Even a slight risk of our impacts cumulate every year- we’re playing Russian roulette<br />
<br />
Phillips and Starr ’04 [“Eliminate Launch on Warning”, Alan Phillips is a retired physicist and physician who did radar research for the British army. Steven Starr is a medical technologist trained in nuclear engineering. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2004/09/00_phillips_eliminate-launch-warning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2004/09/00_phillips_eliminate-launch-warning.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
It is very …at Russian roulette (7).<br />
<br />
Current systems are faulty- recent slip-ups prove that the US arsenal is still highly susceptible to accidents<br />
<br />
Blair ’08 [Bruce, President of the World Security Institute and former Minuteman launch officer, “Taking Nuclear Forces Off Day-to-Day Alert” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert</a>]<br />
<br />
Even with the decades … nation’s ICBM force.”<br />
<br />
Safeguards don’t solve any of the advantages- modern systems are more at risk than ever<br />
<br />
LCNP ‘07 (“A Rebuttal of the U.S. Statement on the Alert Status of U.S. Nuclear Forces,” Bruce G. Blair (President of the World Security Institute), October 13, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lcnp.org/disarmament/opstatus-blair.htm" rel="nofollow">http://lcnp.org/disarmament/opstatus-blair.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
De-alerting would increase …imprudent in the extreme.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is Miscalculation<br />
<br />
Short response time makes miscalculation and nuclear annihilation inevitable<br />
<br />
Rosenbaum ’08 [Ron, The Spectator columnist, May 9, “The Return of the Doomsday Machine?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2173108/pagenum/all/#page_start" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2173108/pagenum/all/#page_start</a>]<br />
<br />
What are the United States' and …unhappy end of history.<br />
<br />
And, it would only take minutes to unleash our nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
Blair ’08 [Bruce, President of the World Security Institute and former Minuteman launch officer, February 27, “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
If the Kremlin and the White House ordered… launch order from higher authority.<br />
<br />
Nuclear containment would be impossible after a first strike<br />
<br />
McNamara ’05 [Robert, May/June, “Apocalypse Soon” Robert S. McNamara was U.S. secretary of defense from 1961 to 1968 and president of the World Bank from 1968 to 1981, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2829" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2829</a>]<br />
<br />
There is no way to effectively…other nations and to our own.<br />
<br />
It’s easier to prematurely launch alert nukes than to withhold them<br />
<br />
Blair ’04 [Bruce, President of the World Security Institute and former Minuteman launch officer, “Keeping Presidents in the Nuclear Dark” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/blair/launch-on-warning.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/blair/launch-on-warning.cfm</a>]<br />
<br />
What is misleading about the … has been kept from the presidents intentionally.<br />
<br />
Observation 4 is the Underview:<br />
<br />
All their disads are empirically denied: The US has cuts its nuclear forces by 50% over the last 15 years—more cuts are on the way:<br />

<br />
(National Security and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century, September, http: www.defenselink.mil/news/nuclearweaponspolicy.pdf)<br />
<br />
While maintaining these security commitments…replacement components as needed.<br />
<br />
Obama and Medvedev have agreed to cut the arsenal by a third in the status quo:<br />
