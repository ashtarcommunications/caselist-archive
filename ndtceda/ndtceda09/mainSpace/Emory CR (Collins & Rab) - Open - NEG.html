Their predictability is bad – it refuses to consider alternative methods and reinforces passivity and cynicism. This is the attitude that allowed the Holocaust to happen and gave rise to the possibility of nuclear war.<br />

2. Nuclear criticism can’t be legislated – it can only critique a particular operation of nuclearism. To do otherwise internalizes nuclearism’s control over interpretation, risking nuclear use.<br />
Williams, ‘86<br />

<br />
4. Their representations of nuclear war sustain the nuclear weapons complex—despite their efforts to disarm, they inadvertently reinforce the utility of nuclear weapons in the public’s mind. Focusing on particular instances of nuclearism allows the weapons complex to hang on to the concept of minimum deterrence and makes their impacts self-fulfilling.<br />
Arkin, ’97 <br />
(William Arkin, independent expert on defense and editor of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, March-April, 1997 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.org/issues/1997/ma97/ma97arkin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebulletin.org/issues/1997/ma97/ma97arkin.html</a>)<br />

Faith in the deterrence model has produced the accident as the only sign of instability – this analysis misses that in an adversarial dyad, moves and countermoves will be disguised as accidents to advance the national cause.<br />

B. Our interpretation is best ---<br />

1. Predictability --- ignoring the resolution opens up an infinite number of frameworks --- this undermines our ability to have in-depth research on their arguments destroying the value of debate.<br />
2. Ground --- the resolution exists to create fair division of aff and neg ground --- any alternative framework allows the aff to pick a moral high ground that destroys neg offense. No plan text is uniquely bad—prevents a stable advocacy from being isolated—means the aff can shift without any sort of check<br />

Halloran ‘7 (Richard, Former Military Correspondent for NYT, Parameters, “The China Fantasy: How Our Leaders Explain Away Chinese Repression”, Winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBR/is_4_37/ai_n24262295/" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBR/is_4_37/ai_n24262295/</a>)<br />
The author outlines...in either country.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hold this argument to a high threshold. If they’re correct that Western observers latch onto anything China does as a potential threat the opposite is also easily true --- that anything the US does is seen by China as threatening. This makes resolution impossible which is why the reference to intentions and stated capabilities in our evidence matters.<br />
<br />
Their argument presumes the US makes threatening moves towards China. This is simply not the case. China’s treatment of the US as threat has no basis.<br />

Yes value to life. Our status as beings inheres an affirmation of life in the face of extinction and nonbeing.<br />

Fear appeals mobilize for action against nuclear war. And failure to discuss the consequences of nuclear war means the discussion gets dominated by trivial issues that lose focus on preventing war.<br />

Threat construction does not guarantee war and war can frequently solve problems.<br />

One is also... man. Way harsh.<br />
Sustaining a strong military doesn’t undermine opposition to nuclear war. Promoting healthy fear can deter violence.<br />

Turn - Biopower operates to sustain life-not kill it—and rejecting it risks creating more attrocities<br />

Group identification is central to human evolution. Biology ties us to kin and tribal affiliation.<br />

4. Elevating values over extinction destroys value to life for both current AND future generations---this means deterrence outweighs on magnitude. It makes extinction inevitable---representations of knowing absolute truth of value to life makes life’s destruction unavoidable ---since we have no future possibilities of value to safeguard---that’s Schell.<br />
<br />
B. Avoiding extinction is the basis for other truth---answers their securitization arguments<br />
Schell 84 (Jonathan Schell, The Abolition, 1984, p. 4-5)<br />
Sometimes it is ...save our species.<br />
<br />
Prioritize the amount of people we save – it is dangerous to sacrifice individuals to abstract deconstructionism – we have an obligation to evaluate people equally<br />
Cummisky 96 (David, professor of philosophy at Bates College, Kantian Consequentialism, pg. 145)<br />
We must not...some to save many.<br />
<br />
We have an obligation to promote human survival because it promotes the happiness of future generations.<br />
