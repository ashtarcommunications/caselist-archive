The 1AC reads evidence from Robin Collins that comes from an email dicussion Northwestern debate had with her and then shared on their blog. Obviously, we agree that debaters should engage experts in the broader community.<br />
<br />
Our interpretation: When reading evidence from email conversations with experts, the entire email chain must be made public, not just the expert’s response.<br />
<br />
Violation: Northwestern made only a portion of their original email public. On their blog, you can find the arguments they asked Collins to answer, but you can’t find the rest of the letter they wrote her, including all context and introduction to the purpose of these discussions.<br />
<br />
Reasons to prefer:<br />
<br />
Context: The email to an expert can dramatically change the answer. Their interpretation allows questions like, What are the most extreme answers you’ve heard to these questions? Or, will you play devil’s advocate?<br />
<br />
We are not saying Northwestern has misled us, only that their practice enables it. There’s no downside to showing neutral emails.<br />
<br />
Brightline: Only requiring the whole exchange prevents teams from being selective about what context is provided to the broader community.<br />
<br />
Utility to other teams: Only full context allows other squads to cut the card and cite it appropriately. We have no idea to what extent Collins is willing for her responses to be cited in competitive debate.<br />
