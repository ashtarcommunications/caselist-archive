Nuclear apocalypse is a discursive fiction—a non-localizable nuclear war has not occurred, and its occurrence would eliminate the very possibility of speaking about anything, the bomb included. This means their representations of nuclear castatrophe are merely a fable which is used to justify the acceleration of the arms race. The affirmative buys into, and legitimates, this apocalyptic fantasy by assuming that the language they use to discuss the Bomb merely gives them unmediated access to discuss “facts” that exist in some objective, external world—nuclear violence exists only language, which means its “reality” consists in how we talk and write about it.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Their attempt to “rationally” hash out the best nuclear policy naturalizes and shields from criticism the very institutions which produce nuclear violence—their insistence on moving past ideology to policy details ensures that dominant ideology remains forever unquestioned, making their harms inevitable.</strong><br />

<strong>And, their literal representations of nuclear war lock in the apocalyptic drives which make nuclear annihilation inevitable—their language completes the process of dehumanization which makes it possible to use weapons and precludes an investigation into the modes of signification which have cause nuclear violence.</strong><br />

Fragmentary facts about... thinking about it.<br />

<strong>Their advocacy of arms control is an attempt to extend disciplinarity across the globe—it is this panopticism which paradoxically strengthens the nuclear-industrial complex by ensuring that no oppositional politics can emerge which has not always already bought in to the very thinking which ensures the continued build up of nuclear weapons.</strong><br />

It may be...precisely poststructuralist power.<br />
<br />
<strong>Prohibitions against nuclear use create the weapons as objects of desire. Coupled with the illusion of control, this latent yearning allows for the possibility of nuclear destruction—the framework of the affirmative constructs subjectivity such that we constantly yearn for own annihilation.</strong><br />

<strong>Ultimately, their fantasy of control necessitates totalitarian genocide as the universal commandment to ensure the survival of our social order necessitates total control over the globe in order to cull from it any aberrations from the norm—genocide and nuclear destruction are the inevitable feature of the affirmative’s universalism.</strong><br />

Voting negative to endorse of our critical interrogation of the textual artifact that was the 1AC.<br />
<br />
<strong>Our criticism is key decenter the common-sense metaphysics that underpins both the affirmative’s anti-nuclear strategy and the very existence of the nuclear-industrial complex—this textual reading of history is the only way to move beyond our dependence on nuclear weapons. While this process may not be immediate, or even short term, it is only by taking this longer view of history that we can ensure our reliance on nukes is not indefinite.</strong><br />
