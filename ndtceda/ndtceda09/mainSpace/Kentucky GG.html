Policy focus key to real world change<br />
Themba-Nixon 2000 (“Colorlines: Race, Action, Culture”<br />
“This is all about policy”…committed to making it so.<br />
<br />

<br />
and – it is not enough to merely talk about something related to the resolution – defending the resolutional statement is the only way to ensure fair debate where we can engage them. otherwise, the aff can shift and dodge neg arguments rather than engage us.<br />
Shively, 2000 (Ruth Lessl, Former Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas A &amp; M, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p. 181-182)<br />
The requirements given… agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
<br />
the perm is net-wrose – to always consider both makes knowledge of each less thorough. if one framework is better, the other is an opprotunity cost. here is evidence that makes this tradeoff argument<br />
Parcher, 2001 (Jeff, Former Coach at Georgetown, February 26, edebate)<br />
This is absolutely devastating…(as far as I've seen anyway).<br />
<br />
policy focus enhances research skills – alternate frameworks don’t<br />
Lyle and Speice, 2003 (Jim, Head Debate Coach at Clarion, Patrick, William and Mary Law School, Formerly of Wake Forest, Traditional Policy Debate – Now More Than Ever, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/SpeiceLyle2003htm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/SpeiceLyle2003htm.htm</a>)<br />
Having dispensed with… words independent of policy considerations?<br />
<br />
unlimited advocacy collapses into conservatism – our attempt to limit the discussion in a fair way enables productive political contestation and true reovolutionary advocacies. refusal to exclude anything means their framework is self-defeating<br />
Shively, 2000 (Ruth Lessl, Former Assistant Professor of Political Science at Texas A&amp;M, Political Theory and Partisan Politics,<br />
p. 180-181)<br />

Undergraduate educators are… and problem solving skills.<br />

compatability – paperless software and templates don’t play nicely with macintosh computers, which happen to be used by the majority of the debate community<br />
Hardy, 2009 (Aaron, Whitman College, “Paperless Debate Manual”, April 7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.georgiadebate.org/files/download/2" rel="nofollow">http://www.georgiadebate.org/files/download/2</a>)<br />
Why is support… don’t operate correctly.<br />

debater backlash – paperless will discourage participation because most debaters don’t support the transition<br />
