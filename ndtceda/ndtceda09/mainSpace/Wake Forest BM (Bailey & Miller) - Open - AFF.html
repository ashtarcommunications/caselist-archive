History proves- every time we get a new weapon we think we won’t use it- this is due to failure to effectively calculate risk<br />

The challenger explosion proves why nuclear optimism is flawed- it’s based upon a non-logical risk calculus that seems “common sense” but is flawed every time<br />

Nuclear optimism is a school……………. nuclear optimism.<br />

High alert nukes are a crisis in waiting yet we think we are safe due to experience- the same faulty risk calculus is behind the current economic collapse<br />

The idea of de-alerting nuclear forces…………. protected deployment pattern.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, history proves that bad risk calculations are behind every major war—de-alerting is critical to finally change the risk calculus we use<br />

Rejecting the failures of high alert nukes is the catalyst to change our risk calculus of threats- this must happen to prevent extinction<br />

Rejecting the deterrence failures of high alert nukes spills over to broader risk calculus—this solves multiple extinction scenarios<br />
