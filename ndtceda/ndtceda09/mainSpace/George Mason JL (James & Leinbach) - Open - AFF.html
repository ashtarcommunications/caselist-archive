 Throughout the course of history, mankind has been compelled by the desire to create and destroy. We are slaves to the technological imperative- the demand to justify the use of our newest creations even if it culminates in our destruction. In the context on nuclear weapons- this makes total annihilation inevitable.<br />

<br />
Additionally, the massive amounts of funding that have been poured into nuclear weapons demand their use. Intense pressure on leaders in times of crisis, empirical strategies of violence and lack of restraint, and the nature of probability make use of nuclear weapons inevitable as long as they exist. Unavoidable escalation of violence, by political leaders, officers in the field facing dehumanizing conditions, or in the nuclear wars sure to follow, dash any hope for a just or survivable war.<br />

By their very nature, use of nuclear weapons is unjustifiable. Their indiscriminate and disproportional character makes a just war impossible, and their devastating effects make any war unsurvivable. Even if they are never used, the conditional intent to use them, euphemized as ‘deterrence’, ensures our complicity in immorality.<br />

<br />
Conditional intentions increase the probability of the use of nuclear weapons, and are inherently immoral by their commitment to an immoral act. ‘Escalation control’ assumes the enemy can, or will, limit their violent reactions. In reality, a disproportionate response would be the most likely retaliation by an enemy.<br />

<br />
<br />
Additionally, conditional intentions to use nuclear weapons are a result of a predisposition towards violence which has characterized international affairs. This increases the probability of using nuclear weapons in crisis situations, while simultaneously creating the incentive for enemies to preempt. This cycle of violence and Realpolitik is unending and increasingly escalatory.<br />

<br />
Claims that deterrence works are grounded in a dangerously simplistic illusion about the causal chain in foreign affairs. It is impossible to prove that deterrence works- the causal chain is far too complex. It is more likely deterrence has raised the probabilities of nuclear war from 1 in 100 to 1 in 10- even if it hasn’t happened yet.<br />

Deterrence is a form of using innocents as hostages in the international arena: stripping citizens of their autonomy.<br />

To be stripped of autonomy condemns us to insanity or utter dehumanization. This is the biggest impact in the round- all of their impacts assume a life worth living, they are all written in the context of human beings experiencing these impacts- not shells of people.<br />

We understand ourselves in relation to others- knowingly taking the first step in a nuclear war via nuclear deterrence is an immoral act which has paramount meaning to our lives. All U.S citizens are morally complicit. Disarmament is the first step in ending international relations based in violence and fulfilling its moral obligation<br />

It doesn’t matter if we cant see the ultimate goal of disarmament- we must move in the right direction.<br />
