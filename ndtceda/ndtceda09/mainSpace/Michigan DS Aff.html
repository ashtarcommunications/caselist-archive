Advantage 1 – Securitization<br />
<br />
The process of instrumentalizing implied threats makes war depoliticized and necessary – becomes self-fulfilling -- we must manufacture threats to force others to seek our protection, but they only need our protection because we made up the danger. The aff ends this vicious cycle.<br />
Dabashi 7, Hamid, weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/831/focus.htm, 2007<br />
Once again the drums of war… with widespread practice.<br />
<br />
The status quo treats implicit threats of nuclear war as something to trade in negotiations, a bargaining chip. The US says “we won’t strike you if you give us what we ask for” – our pledge not to make these threats delegitimizes instrumentalization of nuclear weapons. This solves violence of the squo’s coercive Threats.<br />
Dolar ‘3, Professor Department of Philosophy @ University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, Senior Research Fellow, “The Power of the Invisible”<br />
This leads us to the simple… very non-completion.<br />
<br />
And, even though the US would not use its nuclear weapons, the implicit threat is enough. It militarizes our relations with the world and depoliticizes nuclear war as a constant spectacle from which all should flee. Thus, the US simultaneously inflates the value of nukes and asks for others to give up their freedom for their future.<br />
Dolar 3 (Professor Department of Philosophy @ University of Ljbljana, Slovenia, Senior Research Fellow, “The Power of the Invisible”<br />
To make a step further… sustains its authority.<br />
<br />
Specifically, implicit threats are the worst they push violent language underground and make the discursive violence the US employs invisible.<br />
Dolar 3 (Professor Department of Philosophy @ University of Ljbljana, Slovenia, Senior Research Fellow, “The Power of the Invisible” <br />
The threat works at its best… a virtual existence.<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 – Conflict Threshold<br />
<br />
Us ambiguity lowers nuclear threshold causes conflict<br />
Bruce G. Blaire, president of the center for defense information and former launch officer in the strategic air command, 2002, nuclear time warp.<br />
President George W. Bush’s new… into the wrong hands.<br />
<br />
NFU solves all scenarios for nuclear use – causes crisis stability<br />
Michael S. gerson 9 (research analyst, B.A. in history from the UT and M.A. in International Relations from the U of Chicago, Center for Naval Analyses Carnegie endowment for International Peace, Rethinking US Nuclear Posture)<br />
Now, on the other side, I think that… to de-escalate conflict.<br />
<br />
Declaratory policy si credible – audience costs.<br />
Michael S. gerson 9 (research analyst, B.A. in history from the UT and M.A. in International Relations from the U of Chicago, Center for Naval Analyses Carnegie endowment for International Peace, Rethinking US Nuclear Posture)<br />
Finally, would anyone believe it?... the costs to them of doing so.<br />
<br />
Binding power – escalation control.<br />
Guangkian, 9 [Peng and rong yu, Peng is an editorin chief of Strategic Sciences and has long been engaged inresearchon military strategy and international affairs. Rong is a phD. Candidtate at the Institute of Internatioanl Strategy and Development, School of Public Policy and Management, Tsinghua University, China Security, Vol. 5, No. 1, Winter 2009, page 78-87, World Security Institute]<br />
It would be suicidal for… in its unilateral NFU policy.<br />
<br />
Unambiguous spurs binding commitments – in others and us.<br />
Harold A Feiveson, senior research scientists, co-director of the Program on Science and Global Security at Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton and Enrst Jan Hogendoorn, Ph.D student at same school, “No first use of nuclear weapons” the Nonproliferation Review, 2003<br />

Conference participants noted that… rolling in his grave.”<br />
<br />
Deterrence ensures threats<br />
Andrew Lichterman, Western States Legal Foundation, “Deterrence Revisited: U.S. Nuclear Weapons and Power Politics,” March 2007.<br />
General Butler described deterrence as… courses of action.”17<br />
<br />
Traps cause nuclear use<br />
Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit partnership of scientists and citizens combining rigorous scientific analysis, innovating policy development and effective citizen advocacy to achieve practical environmental solutions, “Toward True Security: Ten Steps the Next President Should Take to Transform U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy,” 2008<br />
Threatening to use nuclear weapons… respond to nuclear attacks.<br />

 Specific Intellectualism K<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">1. </span>Perm do both – advocacies are not mutually exclusive; can affirm local narratives and a US policy of no first strike – permutation solves standpoint epistemology claims – he reads a narrative about his family who immigrated from India to escape the violence of nuclear weapons and the constant threats from Pakistan – psychological fear and destruction<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">2. </span>This discussion is key – shapes structural violence and other forms of violence<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">3. </span>We don’t exclude discussions of structural violence<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">- </span>North Korea oppresses it’s people for the sake of nuclear weapons<br />

<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">- </span>Iran<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">- </span>South Korea<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">4. </span>Gusterson out of context – he talks about prolif – debachy proves imposition of threats IS bad, US is crazy not the other countries; union of concerned scientists supports too<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">5. </span>Role of the ballot – compare status quo or comp policy option to the plan<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">a. </span>Education – policy education good<br />

The literature would have benefited… advance this debate.<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">9. </span>Aff is an attempt to educate the public and shape nuclear policy xx Harvard nuclear study 83<br />
Harvard Nuclear Study group, 83 (Living with Nuclear Weapons, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England, p. 7-9)<br />
The choice the United States faces… full range of issues involved.<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">10. </span>You don’t have to GO to DC to inform policy-makers – debate can solve<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">11. </span>Education informs change within the community<br />
Harvard Nuclear Study group, 83 (Living with Nuclear Weapons, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England, p. 9-11)<br />
Many citizens who are concerned… however, exactly the same.<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">12. </span>Hypothetical thinking about fiat is good xx scruten 99<br />
Streeten 99 9Paul, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Boston U, Devleopment, “The Case for Being Utopian” Volume 42, Issue 2, page 118)<br />
First, Utopian thinking can… most realistic vision.<br />

<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">13. </span>Cannot change the law directly, but simulation is still valuable xx Carlson 99<br />

<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">15. </span>Engagement in role playing key peace xx rawls<br />
Rawls, professor of political philosophy at Harvard university, The law of the Peooples, 1999 page 56-7<br />
Similarly, the ideal of the public… understanding among peoples.<br />
<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">16. </span>Second advantage is NTO predicated off of roleplaying – regardless of fiat implications, we still solve for the way we persue threat construction as a nation<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">17. </span>Aff is a first move towards a movement<br />
