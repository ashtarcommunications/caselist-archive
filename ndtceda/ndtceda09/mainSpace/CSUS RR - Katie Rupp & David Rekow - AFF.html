<strong>In order to completely understand the problems inherent within nuclear policy, we must first understand the cultural values and social filters that create and reproduce these problems throughout our society. The topic provides us with a unique place to question these previously uncontested ideologies and challenge how we as individuals can begin to alter the cycle. But how do you question that which has previously gone uncontested? We argue by, “Understanding the ways in which the dominant culture is produced and reproduced in the simplest, most mundane relational acts between the adult and the child reveals that whatever happens between warring nation-states, between the dominant and the subjugated, between the rich and the poor, happens first between the adult and the child, no more and no less than it ever has…” (Zornado pg.27) We are choosing in this round to highlight the mundane act of reading and how it carries within it the ability to expose and challenge the power structures of the dominant ideology that drive the nuclear dilemma.</strong><br />

<strong>We can’t finish Grandpa’s story, but we would recommend: The United States federal government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
Grandpa has left the door open for us to use our story to question the master narrative that has dominated our lives and the way we grew up thinking about the world. We begin this questioning with an analysis of how children’s literature has historically been a tool to indoctrinate.</strong><br />

<strong>Our decision to repurpose The Butter Battle Book is a perfect example of how one can contest the historical use of children’s stories as a tool to indoctrinate children, and shed light on how nontraditional examinations of the mundane can begin to deconstruct the adult-child power structure that is at the root of all societal harms.</strong><br />

<strong>In addition to challenging the historical function of children’s literature as a tool to perpetuate dominate ideologies; our reading of the Butter Battle Book as adults is a required step in breaking the cycle of cultural reproduction and becoming enlightened witnesses.

Your role as judge is to choose which offers the best strategy to oppose violence in our lives; you must choose whether to uphold the dominant narrative, or endorse our narrative and become an enlightened witness to the historical plight of the child. Before we can answer whether or not the resolution is a good idea, we must first understand the ideologies that drive the controversy surrounding our nuclear policy.</strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;"> </span><br />
