Death Drive – 1AC<br />
<br />
The international system is plagued by the fantasy that we are omniscient masters who can conquer and defeat the violence that permeates our internal order. The ideology and desire of late Capital and modernity structure this fantasy to overcome and conquer the psychic death drive. This fantasmic desire to overcome the drive produces an endless cycle of error replication because we repeatedly mis-target the sources of conflict and violence. This cycle is an inevitable march toward ultimate destruction. Paradoxically, the drive structures the logic of the international system, yet also poses as the radical possibility to move beyond it. Acknowledging that death is not the mark of human finitude allows us to take pleasure in the pain of continually missing our goal. This confrontation with the death drive allows for a radical break beyond this cycle of violence and corruption.<br />
<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana 1999Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 293- 297<br />
<br />
The lesson of drive … repeatedly missing one’s goal. 65<br />
<br />
To confront the internal order constituted by the death drive, we must accept the apolitical and destructive logic of the status quo. Any partial embracing of the death drive is underwritten by the desire to avoid authentically confronting it and to violently maintain the ideological fantasies of Truth and Goodness<br />
<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana 1999 Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 160-161<br />
<br />
In Lacanese, the subject … Truth and/or Goodness.<br />
<br />
In the realm of nuclear weapons the death drive is manipulated in the name of deterrence and eradication of those who contradict the sovereign notion of good. We are confronted with the chaos of the death drive at a time when the advancements in technology have outpaced our ability to advance an understanding of ethics. Deterrence ideologies act as ignorance of the Thing of the nuclear age which surpasses all rational calculation. Our path to destruction is buttressed by our lack of theorization and application of a theory of the Real and our insistence on policing the boundaries of the Good<br />

<br />
But with our advancements …our most tragic problems.<br />
<br />
Continued reliance on an ideology of the Good causes us to project evil onto the enemy other<br />
<br />
Themi Deakin University 2008 Tim Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy, 4.1-2<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/96/192" rel="nofollow">http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/article/view/96/192</a><br />
<br />
The goal here … hinted at self-amusement.[54]<br />
<br />
And this enemy construction creates an ever-expanding measures against ever present threats – the ideology of deterrence has extended from an ideology amongst nation states to one that can be extended to a Sole Madman – this ideology guarantees infinite violence in the international realm<br />
<br />
Zizek in 2005 (Slavoj, In These Times, August 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizekiranian.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizekiranian.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Classic power … desire for conquests.<br />
<br />
We must overcome the nihilism inherent in this denial and manipulation of desire by saying yes to life and opposing the aesthetic of nuclear destruction - only this act can serve as an adequate confrontation with the real<br />
<br />

<br />
But with psychoanalysis, … until it accidentally finishes us!<br />
<br />
In order to confront and overcome the nihilism created by the ideology of deterrence we affirm that:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should permanently disarm the United States’ entire nuclear arsenal. We can clarify<br />
<br />
Recognition of the death drive abolishes the source of totalitarian temptations – our attempt to articulate a new way of living free of nuclear weapons is the only hope to break away from our violent international order.<br />
<br />
Zizek Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana 1999 Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 390-391<br />
<br />
On the other hand, …order is profoundly misleading.<br />
<br />
The particular construction of enemies is the ideological knot that holds together the universal system of deterrence and nuclear weapons – untying this disintegrates the system as a whole<br />
<br />
Zizek 1999 Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 175-176<br />
<br />
Ridiculous as this notion … by addressing the sinthome. . . .<br />
<br />
The affirmative creates the space necessary for politics by using a universal gesture to expose the exclusions and violence created by democratic systems - our demand for disarmament is for more then just a call to reduce weapons - it creates a particular call that can be written onto the universal struggle against capital<br />
<br />
Dean, Associate Professor of Political Theory at Hobart &amp; William Smith, 2005 Jodi, Zizek against Democracy, jdeanicite.typepad.com/i_cite/files/zizek_against_ democracy_new_version.doc<br />
<br />
I’ve argued thus far … ‘itself’ absent this ‘beyond’)<br />
<br />
<span style="border-collapse: collapse; line-height: normal;"> </span><br />
Our affirmative is a gesture of state suicide--rather than attempt to subvert the state from out, we force the law to confront the death drive at the heart of its constitution by pitting the logic of deterrence against nuclear annihilation. Only this gesture of internal subversion strikes at the heart of law which is symbolic legitimacy, turning it against itself.<br />
