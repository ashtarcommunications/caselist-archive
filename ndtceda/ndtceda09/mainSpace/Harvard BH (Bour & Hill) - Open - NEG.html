The image of nuclear war invoked in the 1ac is a fiction, a virtual construction accessible only through fiction and fantasy—complete nuclear apocalypse has never occurred and by nature can never be described as having occurred. It is not a question of whether or not the bomb will be used but the end result of its discursive construct—the consequence of debate over the nuclear threat lies in the meanings produced. Visions of the bomb’s power only make us want it more<br />
<br />
Cordle, 2k6 (Daniel, Nottingham Trent University, “Cultures of Terror: Nuclear Criticism During and Since the Cold War”, Literature Compass, Vol. 3, No. 6, November) <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it is … to imagine it.’<br />
<br />
Prohibitions against the bomb create nukes as objects of desire—this latent yearning requires nuclear lashout<br />
<br />
Chaloupka, 1992 (William, associate professor of political science at the University of Montana, Knowing Nukes, p. 61-2)<br />
<br />
This is my claim, … years: &quot;Nuke 'em!&quot;<br />
<br />
Their antinuclear movement is counterproductive—it ignores the psychological motivation behind our embrace of the bomb. The affirmative’s repression of nuclear weapons and literalized images of nuclear destruction only increase the appeal of global annihilation<br />
<br />
Chernus, 1991 (Ira, associate professor of religious studies at the University of Colorado, Nuclear Madness, p. 186-88)<br />
<br />
The antinuclear movement… of nuclear madness<br />
<br />
And, that is why the anti-nuclear movement failed<br />
<br />
Chaloupka, 1992 (William, associate professor of political science at the University of Montana, Knowing Nukes, p. 82-3)<br />
<br />
In view of nuclear … mirrors absorb us.<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to laugh in the face of the bomb. Instead of fetishizing a fear of the bomb inherent in the affirmative, we need to deprive the bomb of all meaning. It cannot remain the defining aspect of international relations and politics, where no communication or dialogue is possible. Voting negative challenges the way the bomb defines the status quo culture of fear, using the power of the bomb against itself.<br />
<br />
Chaloupka, 1992 (William, associate professor of political science at the University of Montana, Knowing Nukes, p. 137-8)<br />

<br />
The affirmative unconditional commitment to the maintenance of US dominance in this new, “peaceful” world and portrayal of nuclear weapons as unsafe in the hands of “third world” countries makes nuclear violence inevitable<br />
<br />
Biswas, 2k1 (Shampa, Assistant Professor of Politics at Whitman College, Alternatives, Oct-Dec, p. 496-497)<br />
<br />
Within a national-security... a few states?<br />
<br />
Prolif discourse establishes the other as a constant threat—justifies nuclear use and violent intervention in the name of security<br />
<br />
Mutimer, 2k (David, assistant professor of Political Science at York University, The Weapons State, p. 93-95)<br />
<br />
The U. S. military appears ...of supplier states.<br />
<br />
Throughout history, US imperialists have used the concept of the superior “West” and inferior “Third World” to justify an endless sea of war and violence. This kill to save mentality evoked by the need to ensure “international security” culminates in genocide and extinction.<br />
<br />
Santos, 2k3 (Boaventura de Sousa, Director of Center for Social Studies at the University of Coimbra, “Collective Suicide?,”  Bad Subjects #63, April eserver.org/bs/63/santos.html)<br />
<br />
According to Franz ... neoliberalism plus war.<br />

Alternative—Text: reject the 1ac representations of nuclear proliferation<br />
<br />
The crucial question isn’t whether the action of their policy is good or bad, but whether to allow its routinized deployment through loaded terminology—vote negative to cultivate accountability in political actions<br />
<br />
Mral, 2k4 (Brigitte, professor of rhetoric at Orebo University, “We’re a Peaceful Nation: War Rhetoric After September 11”, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.krisberedskapsmyndigheten.se/4453.epibrw" rel="nofollow">http://www.krisberedskapsmyndigheten.se/4453.epibrw</a>)<br />

“IF WE WAIT FOR THREATS TO FULLY MATERIALIZE, WE WILL HAVE WAITED TOO LONG”<br />
<br />
AS DETERRENCE THEORY HAS TOLD US TIME AND TIME BEFORE, WE ARE ALWAYS ON THE BRINK OF WAR, WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION OF OUR GREATEST FEARS: WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT THAT COULD KILL US ALL. ARE THERE WMD’S? IS THERE TERRORISM? PROLIFERATION? WEAKNESSES IN OUR DETERRENT STRUCTURE? <br />
<br />
IN THIS STATE OF EMERGENCY INSTANTIATED BY NUCLEAR WEAPONS, POLITICS HAS BEEN REDUCED TO A COUNTDOWN; AN AUTOMATED PREPARATION FOR WAR IN WHICH THE MATERIALIZATION OF THREATS IS IRRELEVANT IN THE MOBILIZATION TO WAR. ANALYSTS (LIKE _) DON’T CEASE TO REMIND US THAT THE RISK OF A WAR ERUPTING STILL EXISTS DESPITE LACK OF A TANGIBLE THREAT—THAT MASS SLAUGHTER LIES SOMEWHERE, AT SOME UNKNOWN POINT IN TIME, OVER THE HORIZON. <br />
<br />
Massumi, 2k7 (Brian, professor in the Communication Department at the Université de Montréal, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, 10:2, p. Project Muse)<br />
<br />
If we wait for threats...return to a Cold War logic. <br />
<br />
TO PROVE THE THREAT WILL NEVER EMERGE IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE—WHY ELSE WOULD WE HAVE OUR CURRENT HARDLINE DETERRENCE POLICY TOWARDS THE WORLD. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS ALWAYS SOME THREAT, IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM. AND THE AFFECT OF THAT FEAR LINGERS WITH A HALF LIFE THAT FAR OUTLIVES ITS CAUSE<br />
<br />
VIOLENCE CAN CREEP UP AT ANY MOMENT…AND IF WAR CAN HAPPEN, THERE IS NO DETERRENCE, ONLY MUTUALLY ASSURED DESTRUCTION.<br />
<br />
Massumi, 2k7 (Brian, professor in the Communication Department at the Université de Montréal, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, 10:2, p. Project Muse)<br />
<br />
Preemption shares many characteristics...And that's the truth.<br />
<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE’S OBSESSION WITH THE PREVENTION OF WAR WITH _ HAS BECOME THE NORM OF LIFE—WAR IS NO LONGER LIMITED TO THE BATTLEFIELDS BUT EMBODIES ITSELF IN OUR EVERY DECISION<br />
<br />
THIS NEW POLITICS OF OBSESSION IS DEFINED BY ITS PREPARATION AND ORGANIZATION FOR WAR, WAR THAT WILL GO BEYOND ALL LIMITS AND ACHIEVE TOTAL DESTRUCTION. THEY MAY STOP A WAR WITH , BUT THE END RESULT IS WAR OF THE HUMAN RACE AGAINST ITSELF<br />
<br />
Lotringer, 2k2 (Sylvere, professor of French literature and philosophy at Columbia, Crepuscular Dawn, p. 11-12)<br />
<br />
The terrors of war can’t... is already a reality.<br />
<br />
THE PLAN CANNOT PUT THE GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE.  ONCE THE AFF HAS RELEASED THE AFFECT OF FEAR AND THREAT INTO THE EMOTIONAL ECONOMY OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS THE WAR MUST HAPPEN SOMEWHERE. <br />
<br />
Massumi, 2k7 (Brian, professor in the Communication Department at the Université de Montréal, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, 10:2, p. Project Muse)<br />
<br />
Truth, in this new world... single actualization exhausts.<br />
<br />
BUT AFFECT OPERATES AT THE ONTOGENETIC LEVEL—FEAR ACTIVATES A BODIL RESPONSE THAT EMOTIONALLY JUSTIFIES MORE FEAR. PRE-EMPTNING THOUGH AND WHOLLY CONDITIONING ACTION<br />
<br />
Massumi, 2k5 (Brian, professor in the Communication Department at the Université de Montréal, “Fear (The Spectrum Said)”, Positions, 13.1, p. Project Muse)<br />
<br />
A startle without a scare, ... pure affect, and emotion proper).<br />
<br />
<br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO REJECT THE AFFIRMATIVE’S USE OF FEAR AS GROUNDS FOR POLITICAL ACTION<br />
<br />
THE WAY THE AFFIRMATIVE HAS PRODUCED THEIR 1AC THROUGH AN AFFECT OF FEAR HOLDS US ALL AT GUN-POINT AND WE ARE CALLING THEIR BLUFF. OUR LEAP OF FAITH CREATES A RADICAL OPENNESS THAT ALLOWS US TO HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER <br />
<br />
Anderson, 2k6 (Ben, department of geography at the University of Durham, “Becoming and being hopeful: towards a theory of affect”, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, Vol. 24)<br />
<br />
In this paper I ..., dispersed, plural and partial” (Gibson-Graham, 1996, page 259).<br />
<br />
RADICAL OPENNESS OF HOPE ALLOWS FOR A DECONSTRUCTION OF AFFECTUAL FEAR THAT SOLVES<br />

Anderson, 2k6 (Ben, department of geography at the University of Durham, “Becoming and being hopeful: towards a theory of affect”, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, Vol. 24)<br />
