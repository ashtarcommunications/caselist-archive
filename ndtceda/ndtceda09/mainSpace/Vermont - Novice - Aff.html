OBSERVATION ONE: THE STATUS QUO<br />
<br />
First, The possession of nuclear weapons makes nuclear war inevitable.<br />
McCoy, Ronald (2007) 'The continuing risk of nuclear war,; Medicine, Conflict and Survival, 23:4, 259 — 266<br />
The threat of nuclear war… …will almost surely follow.<br />
<br />
And, even just the possession of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime against humanity. The U.S. has a moral obligation to completely disarm itself of nuclear weapons.<br />
Hastings, 2006 (Tom H. Hastings [the director of peace and nonviolence studies at Portland state University.]; The lessons of nonviolence, 103-104)<br />
From 23 May…. …rest of the world knows that.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, here’s our plan.<br />
The United States federal government should unconditionally dismantle its entire nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">OBSERVATION TWO: THE PLAN IS A GOOD IDEA</span> </span><br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Our contention is that we should focus policymaking around nonviolent means. This is the only path to nonviolent ends. Focusing instead on expediency and the efficiency of violence always begets more violence and leaves the pervasive violent system of international relations intact.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Gorsevski, 2004 (Ellen W. Gorsevski [</span></span><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Department of Interpersonal Communication School of Communication Studies Bowling Green State University]; Peaceful Persuasion, 169)</span><br />
Observers of nonviolent… …constructively managing conflicts<br />
<br />
Furthermore, our Affirmative is premised on the idea that nonviolence should guide the actions of policymakers. Failure to embrace nonviolence in the international system will destroy the planet and all the people on it.<br />
Hastings, 2004 (Tom H Hastings [the director of peace and nonviolence studies at Portland state University.]; Nonviolent Response to Terrorism, 114-115)<br />
Whether we term it… …best long-term path.<br />
<br />
We have an intellectual obligation to seek nonviolent means to resolve international conflicts. It’s the only way to overcome bias against nonviolence and make systemic change.<br />
Hastings, 2004 (Tom H Hastings [the director of peace and nonviolence studies at Portland state University.]; Nonviolent Response to Terrorism, 159-161)<br />
There are hundreds of peace… …more than 600 offerings.”<br />
<br />
<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Finally, Structural violence is embedded in our everyday language. A nonviolent approach can reveal hidden structures that perpetuate violence throughout societies. Changing what we value about the way we dialogue on important issues can change systems writ-large.</span><br />
<span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Gorsevski, 2004 (Ellen W. Gorsevski [</span></span><span style="color: black; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">Department of Interpersonal Communication School of Communication Studies Bowling Green State University]; Peaceful Persuasion, 159-176)</span><br />
The rhetorical notion… …media analysis and adaptation.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc1"><a name="x-NFU"></a>NFU</h2>
 <br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">We will defend the following plan: The United States federal government should adopt a no nuclear first-use declaration.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Observation 1: Non-Proliferation<br />
<br />
US retention of first use will collapse the 2010 Review Conference and the NPT<br />
Preez ‘7 (George and Jean [Nonproliferation Director, Monterey Institute] More Than Words: The Value of U.S. Non-Nuclear-Use Promises, Bunn International Studies Stanford University April, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007_07-08/NonUse" rel="nofollow">http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007_07-08/NonUse</a>)<br />
As a consequence of… …states not having them.<br />
<br />
Inability to renounce first use before the conference causes rapid proliferation<br />
Raghavan 9 ([President Centre for Security Analysis]; V.R., Nuclear Abolition: Need for a Phased Plan, February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22748" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=22748</a>)<br />
Inability to agree… …United States give its allies.<br />
<br />
Proliferation is at a tipping point – Obama must renew commitment to article 6 to strengthen the NPT<br />
Gard 9 (Robert [Chairman Center for Arms Control] Zero Nuclear Weapons: A Feasible Goal?, 8/25/09 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nuclearweapons/articles/082509_zero_nuclear_weapons_feasible" rel="nofollow">http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nuclearweapons/articles/082509_zero_nuclear_weapons_feasible</a>)<br />
There are ominous signs... …goal of nuclear disarmament.<br />
<br />
Non-proliferation efforts fail without a NFU declaration<br />
Butfoy ‘1 (Andrew [senior lecturer in the School of Political and Social Inquiry at Monash University, Melbourne]; The Politics of Nuclear Non-Proliferation, edited by Carl Ungerer and Marianne Hanson. p. 162)<br />
Threats of first-use obviously… …nuclear threats have utility.<br />
<br />
And, absent the NPT, first use is the greatest incentive for proliferation. Wider possession means greater risk of use.<br />
Ellsberg ‘8 (Daniel [Former Analyst, RAND]; At the Nuclear Precipice, p. 85-6)<br />
Later in 1990, after… …nuclear weapons by states, led by our own.<br />
<br />
Horizontal proliferation will be quick and destabilizing – collapsing international order<br />
Roberts ’99 (Brad, [Research Staff Institute for Defense Analyses, Member of the Editorial Board for the Nonproliferation Review]; “Viewpoint: Proliferation and Nonproliferation in the 1990’s: Looking for the Right Lessons,” The Non Proliferation Review, Fall, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol06/64/robert64.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol06/64/robert64.pdf</a>)<br />
But the standard answers… …world would change fundamentally.<br />
<br />
Every conflict will go nuclear. This means extinction.<br />
Taylor ‘2 (Stuart [Sr. Fellow Brookings]; “Invading Iraq Wouldn't Necessarily Make Us Safer”. 14 Sept)<br />
That risk dwarfs anything… …to deter nuclear attack by others.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
Unilateral NFU is the first step to stop prolif<br />
Blair et al ‘9 (Bruce G, [president of World Security Institute, expert on US Russia security policies, senior fellow in Foreign Policy Studies Program at Brookings Institute from 1987-2000, Phd in operations research from Yale University.] Toward True Security, www.ucsusa.org/global_security/nuclear_weapons/truesecurity.html)<br />
To prevent more nations… …potential U.S. first strike.<br />
<br />
Plan sets a norm for less acquisition, boosting diplomatic momentum for nonproliferation efforts<br />
Martin ‘8 (Matt; [Policy Analysis, Stanley University], A New Look at No First Use <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/resources.cfm?id=334" rel="nofollow">http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/resources.cfm?id=334</a>)<br />
NFU could also affect… …against Iran’s enrichment program.<br />

US commitment to article 6 increases international pressure to prevent prolif<br />
Reif ‘09 ([Nonproliferation Director Center for Arms Control]; Kingston, Nuclear Reductions and Nonproliferation, July <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2009/7/15/134152/310" rel="nofollow">http://www.nukesofhazardblog.com/story/2009/7/15/134152/310</a>)<br />
As I noted at the time… …reliance on nuclear arms.<br />
<br />
The NPT props up associated regimes and grants security assurances to nations<br />
Huntley ’07 (Wade [Director Non Proliferation Program Liu Institute]; Nuclear Nonproliferation: Time for ...New Thinking?, March <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://convention3.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/9/2/2/p179229_index.html" rel="nofollow">http://convention3.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/7/9/2/2/p179229_index.html</a>)<br />
Behind the flash-points… …regime are marginal – far from it.<br />
<br />
The NPT empowers domestic actors to pressure states for nonproliferation<br />
Sagan ’00 (Scott [Co-Director of Center for International Security and Cooperation, and Professor of Political Science, Stanford University]; “The Coming Crisis, edited by Victor A. Utgoff, Institute for Defense Analyses. 36-37)<br />
<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">A different perspective… …maintenance of nuclear first-use doctrines.</span></span>
