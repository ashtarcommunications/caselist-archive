<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The affirmative is a destructive reaction to the absurdity of life—life IS absurd, there is no meaning, and we cannot escape the violence that is around us. The will to save existence from the failures of the political is indicative of a fixation on the establishment of meaning outside and devoid of authentic understanding of freedom. Their need to attribute a value to life, to save life from the disposable, result in the construction of a thesis and antithesis to be annihilated. Only an action that affirms the finitude of man can transcend our existential crisis and the inevitable violence within a realist-politik.</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />

The notion of ambiguity must not be confused AND<br />

<br />
<span class="tagChar">Their attempt to attribute a moral stance and a inherent value to life is a figment of inauthentic consciousness that they use to mask suffering. Their worldview attempts to give order and purpose to a world that inherently lacks any essential order. We must become authentic with ourselves and reject their construction to bring to our attention the true nature of the world, only then will we be able to confront it.</span><br />

<br />
<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The political reaction of the affirmative sacrifices human subjectivity for a form of objectivity that is external and devoid of an ontological understanding of life’s absurdity. This form of objective reasoning of the plan degrades human life to a sub humanity. The sub-human is trapped in a constant state of fear, afraid to truly embracing existence but also afraid to retreat from the world. It makes the prospect of happiness an impossibility where the individual constantly defers agency as a flight from a present misery. The sub-human is dangerous and cannot break away from prejudice and hatred for others. He hides his fear in positive action, attributing values to the valueless, which are always doomed to failure. This ultimately results in annihilation.</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />

<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our alternative is to annul the ethico-political framework and affirmative’s response to the resolution that hails a particular objective response to the existence of “nuclear weapons”. We ask you to throw yourself into the existential ambiguity within life and suspend the value-laden will to power produced by the affirmative’s will for change. Our alternative is analogous with Neo’s choice to take the red pill – while order and fixed meaning can never be achieved in the world, our alternative allows a true engagement with the world that overcomes bad faith and the limiting aspects of inauthenticity.</span></span><br />
