 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The threat of extinction invites you to evolve beyond anthropocentrism. We are part of a cosmic dance, a descendant of mammals and fish<br />
Contention 1: Your ethical startin must be a respect for the cosmic process, which requires rejecting US nuclear deterrence policy.<br />
We are not the center of the universe, but a speck of light fluttering in an entangled cosmos large beyond our imagining. Vote aff to forge an ethics that give our existence dignity beyond the narrow perspective of the human<br />
Chapman 04<br />
“‘The Inhumanist,’ the second narrative of The Double Axevolume…within which our human tragedies are played out.”<br />
Nuclear strategy expresses anthrophocentric dualisms of energy and matter ,mind and body, nature and humanity, life and death. But the entanglement of humanity with supposed “dead matter” reveals itself with every breath.<br />
Griffin 84<br />
“If one approaches the explosion of a nuclear weapon…have managed to mute in their imagination.”<br />
The threat of extinction invites you to evolve beyond anthropocentrism. We are part of a cosmic dance, a descendant of mammals and fish; rocks and oceans; particles and dust. Stop cherishing your own existence and start thinking like a mountain, a quantum, a galacy…join us in reveling in the eternal aliveness of all things.<br />
Seed 95<br />
“Anthropocentrism’ or ‘homocentrism’ means human chauvinism…one that is sustainable and in harmony with life again.”<br />
Contention 2 – Ethics is not about preserving ecologies, but about how you want to relate to the world.<br />
An ecological ethics of “preserving” the environment collapses amidst the creative-destructive flux of the cosmos. Vote aff to respond in awe to this process, and to reject the picture of dead universe built to house humanity and life.<br />
Henning 09<br />
“Final truths (whether in religion, morality, or science)…for others, and for the whole of reality.”<br />
The distinction between “organic life” and “dead matter” is anthropocentric because it separates us from our larger ecological matrix. Status quo nuclear policies exemplifies this dualism by treating soil and water as inert resources poisonable by nuclear war<br />
Rowe 96<br />
“Open most ecology textbooks and the “fields of stud y” judged legitimate…Reverence for life means reverence for ecosystems.”<br />
There is no distinction between better and worse ecologies because nature is not a substance. At the quantum level solid matter dissolves into fuzzy quantum fields popping in and out of existence, dissolving the distinction between the observer and the observed.<br />
Bannon 09<br />
“Plumwood attributes the contemporary dominating attitudes of human…is constituted as a series of interwoven and overlapping places.”<br />
All of existence expresses consciousness<br />
Bloom no date<br />
“In Frankfurt, Germany, a Russian physicist…Big Bang Tango together, I’ve staked my life on it.”<br />
Preserving ecology locks you within anthropocentric frames by picturing nature as a knowable object whose good we can maximize. We must instead affirm nature’s radical strangeness, valuing even the dangerous ecologies that threaten our existence<br />
Bonnett 2002<br />
“So, why recommend the move from policy to frame of mind?...involve ethical, aesthetic, and spiritual sentiments.”<br />
Contention 3: The role of the ballot is to evaluate the plan from a cosmological perspective. The has three parts:</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Anthropocentrism is an illusion.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You must adopt the perspective of the cosmos.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Human intuitions about creation and destruction are relative.</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Fiat requires adopting a more than human perspective, and the only viable standard of evaluation is to affirm the cosmic process<br />
Luger 07<br />
“Anthropocentrism views reality relative to man, and maintains…rather than man, is the true measure of all things.”<br />
Policies enact values, codifying ethical judgments about the world. Before you can decide whether the plan is good or bad, you must first determine what impacts matter. Your decision must BEGIN with the question of what kind of value you want to express with your ballot.<br />
Sivil no date<br />
“Science and environmental policy are the most commonly accepted options…such an ethic is possible is the task of another paper.”<br />
Change is possible because we are entangled with larger worlds of discourse and power. Vote affirmative to proclaim that “The United States Federal Government should eliminate the utilization of the United States’ nuclear weapons arsenal.” Vote affirmative to reject the false dualisms that alienate you from the dynamic process of the cosmos.<br />
Opperman 2003<br />
“This has been a central concern in the works of deep..within the very fabric of the holomovement.”</span><br />

 Round 1 v. Emory NS<br />
Anders, Odekirk, Ridley<br />
<br />
Anthropocentrism<br />
<br />
<br />
The Earth wass the world and man was its measure, but space and multitude came in earth is a particle y a sand-grain sun , lost in a cove of the shores of a continent galaxy on galaxy innumerable swirls of stars endured forever and humanity Came, its two or three million years a moment it will certainly cease galaxy on galaxy endure<br />
<br />
There is not an atom in all the universes but feels like everyother graviton, electromagnetism,light , the nerves in the night’s black flesh flow them together stars winds people<br />
<br />
One esetince one music one oranism one life<br />
There is the hub and heavy nucleus great and small atoms and the suns and all the galactic universes organized on one pattern the eternal roundabout panting runners going nowhere frustrated flight unrelieved strain endless return all all the eternal firewheel<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention I: You’re ethical starting must be a rejection of anthropocentrism through respecting the process of the universe</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Sun does not revolve around the earth.. to give our existence dignity in the face of nuclear war we must become aware of ourselves as participants in a larger entangled who. We are a speck in the cosmos, and valuing ourselves means crying our in jo a tour participation in the chaotic flux.</strong><br />

<strong>Being rock, gas, mist, Mind,</strong><span style="color: black;"><br />
</span>Being the mesons traveling the galaxies with the speed of light,<span style="color: black;"><br />
</span>You have come here, my beloved . . . . <span style="color: black;"><br />
</span>You have manifested as trees grass butterflies, as single-celled beings and chrysanthemums;<span style="color: black;"><br />
</span>but you tell me you have never died<span style="color: black;"><u>.</u></span>*<br />
<br />
<strong>Responsibility to ecological difference is an expression of love. We joyfully affirm our interdependence with countless wonderous beings whose purpose and value is beyond human reckoning. We are not isolated egos, for we breathe in the sky and chew matter nourished by the soil and rain.</strong><br />
<strong>When we choose to poison our air, incenerate our trees, and rip up our soil… we are violating the ground of our very being.</strong><br />

<span style="color: black; font-size: 8pt;">I speak of the specter of ecocide, ……</span><span style="background-color: aqua; color: black;"> <u>but out of love; neither for our selves nor for the other, but for us all.</u></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention II Rather than trying to weigh the consequence sof the plan you should take a moral stance against US willingness to use nuclear weapons.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>We are complicit with our government’s policy of turning the earth into a battle field. Policymakers must make and absolute moral commitment to refuse to use nuclear weapons</strong><br />
<br />
Francesca Caigatti 2007<br />

It is beyond…barbaric talk<br />
<br />
<strong>The Goal of your ballot is NOT to minimize harm to nature, but to affrm a moral universe in which all existence is treated with dignity. Any decision-making process that weighs impacts position nature as an object of your wants and desires trapping you in anthropoc entrism because of the impossibility of weighing a flower versus a mountain versus the Atlantic Ocean versus the Galaxy Andromeda.</strong><br />

In conclusion I would…trap of utilitarianism<br />
<br />
<strong>Consequentalism merely expands the scope of anthropocentrism, in the process devaluing non-sentinent beigns not measurable in its caculus of leasure and ain. Generativitity depends on death and destrution</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention III. You must reject biocentrism because all existence expresses value the division between organic and inorganic existence collapses into meaningless violence as demonstated by current nuclear us e policy.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>The Status quo is motivated by an understanding of the lands as seaa as dead matter complex ecosytstems are treated as collateral damgage or a tool to deny resources to the enemy,</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="color: black;">Rebecca Garcia Lucas </span><strong>Rose,</strong><span style="color: black;"> Trinity College, University of Melbourne, </span><strong>2006</strong><br />
<em>[text theory critique</em><span style="color: black;"> 12 (2006)]<br />
Damage by military conflict is generally palpable …… <u>people, maybe for unforeseen generations.</u> </span><br />
<br />
<strong>The status quo treats soil and water as resources poisonable by nuclear war. This exemplifies the fallacy of biocentrism, the privileging of organic “life” over “dead” matter. The ethics of life is just warmed-over anthropocentrism, separating us from the ecological matrix from which organic matter emerged. The larger universe possesses more value and complexity than the tiny organisms it has produced.</strong><br />

<strong>Stop cherishing your own existence and start thinking like a mountain. You are part of a cosmic whole, a descendant of mammals and fish; rocks and oceans; particles and dust. Although you live in the shadow of nuclear war, this danger provides an opportunity to break through anthropocentric alienation and become conscious of the fundamental aliveness and interconnectivity of all existence.</strong><br />

We are part of a cosmic whole, a descendant of mammals and fish, rocks and oceans, particles and dusts. Although we live in the shadow of nuclear war, rejection of anthro pocentric alienaton redeems our existence through realizing the fundamental aliveness of all existence.

<br />
<strong>IV. The role of the ballot: The universe is not a lifeless collection of matter nor a playground built for enjoyment of humanity or life. All of existence expresses value through its difference and interconnectivity, from the smallest atom to the farthest galaxy, An ecological ethics of preserving things collapses admist the creative destructive flux of the cosmos. Your ethical calculus must instead begin with the question of how you want to comport yourself in the wowld.

<br />
<br />
<strong>Overcoming anthropocentrism is a frame of mind, NOT a quest to solve ecological destruction. Such an attitude turns nature into a knowable object whose good we can maximize, locking us inside human-centered rationalism.
