Advantage One: Proliferation<br />
<br />
Proliferation is at its tipping point<br />
Smith, Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs 08/09<br />
(Hon Stephen Smith MP Australian Minister For Foreign Affairs “Building Momentum: Australia, Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/speeches/2009/090812_tange.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/speeches/2009/090812_tange.html</a>) mee<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons …from non state actors.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Proliferation happens fast-nuclear hedging<br />
Levite, Fellow at CISAC 2003 (Ariel, Visiting Fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC) at Stanford University, “Never Say Never Again,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://iis-db.stanford.edu/evnts/3863/LeviteAriel_2004-0513.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://iis-db.stanford.edu/evnts/3863/LeviteAriel_2004-0513.pdf</a> &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://iis-db.stanford.edu/evnts/3863/LeviteAriel_2004-0513.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://iis-db.stanford.edu/evnts/3863/LeviteAriel_2004-0513.pdf</a>&gt; )PRC <br />
<br />
Japan provides the most salient example of nuclear … proliferation trends in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
<br />
Current policy of calculated ambiguity makes a US nuclear response to perceived threats more likely.<br />
Scott D. Sagan, Co-director of CISAC. June 1, 2009 <br />
(Scott Sagan is a professor of political science and co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation, “The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
The Bush administration’s policy of using US nuclear-weapon threats …imminent or actual chemical or biological attack.<br />
<br />
We solve proliferation in four different ways:<br />
<br />
First, NFU increases US Non-proliferation credibility-solves proliferation<br />
Scott D. Sagan, Co-director of CISAC. June 1, 2009 <br />
(Scott Sagan is a professor of political science and co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation, “The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
example emphasized that a mixture of preventive-war options … any weapons of mass destruction against non-combatants21.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Second, NFU is key to international cooperation against potential proliferators, which also solves proliferation<br />
Scott D. Sagan, professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation. June 1, 2009 (“The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
A US no-first-use declaration would also enhance US non-proliferation objectives … Tehran to claim it faces nuclear threats. <br />
<br />
Third, NFU solves proliferation-changes international nuclear norms, and this is key to solve proliferation.<br />
The Stanley Foundation 08 <br />
(The Stanley Foundation “A new look at no first use of nuclear weapons,” August 22, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm</a> &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximsnews.com/news20080822stanleyfdtnnuclearfirststrikedoctrine10808221601.htm</a>&gt; ,) mee<br />
<br />
Participants noted that declaratory statements also shape public and legislative debate … broader global consensus against the use of any weapon of mass destruction against noncombatants.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Fourth, a no first use policy ends possible US first strike-stopping adversary proliferation<br />
Jan Lodal &lt;file:///C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Local\Temp\%20\%20bio&gt; , principal deputy undersecretary of defense for policy and as deputy for program analysis at the National Security Council, March 2001(Pledging 'No First Strike': A Step Toward Real WMD Cooperation <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_03/lodal)jap" rel="nofollow">http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2001_03/lodal)jap</a><br />
<br />
Challenges to the Cold War arms control paradigm …cooperation necessary to stop the growing threats of WMD from terrorists and rogue states.    <br />
<br />
<br />
And Impacts<br />
First, Proliferation guarantees massive nuclear escalation and war-current deterrence fails <br />
Utgoff, Institute for Defense Analyses Deputy Director, 2002 (Victor, “Proliferation, Missile Defence and American Ambitions,” Survival, vol. 44, p85-102, ldg) <br />
<br />
Worse still, in a highly proliferated world there would be more frequent opportunities … gather on a hill to bury the bodies of dead cities or even whole nations. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuclear terrorism causes a full-scale nuclear war<br />
Spiece, Associate @ Gibson, Dunn and Cruthcr Washington DC 2006 (William and Mary Law Review, February 2006, lexis) <br />
<br />
The potential consequences of the unchecked spread of nuclear knowledge …United States and escalate to the use of nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
Accidental launch causes extinction<br />
PR Newswire, April 29, 1998, (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, “NEJM Study Warns of Increasing Risk of Accidental Nuclear Attack”) <br />
<br />
An 'accidental' nuclear attack would create a public health disaster …trigger full-scale nuclear war with billions of casualties worldwide<br />
<br />
<br />
NPT collapse causes nuclear war<br />
Stares, vice president for conflict analysis and prevention US Institute of Peace, 2007 (Paul, “To Ban the Bomb, Sign the Peace”, New York Times, January 30, 2007, lexis, ldg)<br />
<br />
Of all the crises facing the new United Nations secretary general, … a serious miscalculation leading to a nuclear war. <br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Hegemony<br />
<br />
A policy of first-use cripples US soft power globally.  <br />
Helfstein et al. 8 (Dr. Scott, Col. Michael Meese, Don Rassler, Maj. Reid Sawyer, Maj. Troy Schnack, Maj. Mathew Sheiffer, Dr. Scott Silverstone, Maj. Scott Taylor, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ctc.usma.edu/pdf/Terrorist_Deterrence.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctc.usma.edu/pdf/Terrorist_Deterrence.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
In contrast to a strategy aimed at states threatening nuclear retaliation …fundamentally different from rogue regimes. The costs seem to substantially outweigh potential benefits. <br />
<br />
No first use would boost US soft power and stop the spread of nuclear weapons<br />
J. Martin Rochester, professor of political science and International Relations Specialist focusing on International Law and Organization, 2007<br />
(US Foreign Policy in the Twenty-First Century, p 148)jap<br />
<br />
Richard Haas has said… announcing a policy of “no first use” of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soft Power is critical to maintaining public and international support for American hegemony<br />
Daalder and Lindsay 3 (Ivo H. and James M., Senior Fellows in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, Summer, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/views/papers/daalder/20030814.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The more others question America’s power, purpose, and priorities…and our power will mean very little.<br />
<br />
Maintenance of U.S. global leadership is vital to preventing numerous scenarios for nuclear conflict—loss of U.S. power turns the case in numerous ways <br />
Thayer, 06 (Bradley, &quot;In Defense of Primacy,&quot; The National Interest, November/December 2006, p. lexis) <br />
<br />
Throughout history, peace and stability … American primacy remains humanity's only practical hope of solving the world's ills. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should adopt a declaratory policy of using nuclear weapons only in response to a nuclear attack on the United States or its allies. <br />
<br />
<br />
Solvency:<br />
<br />
The time where threat of first use was needed is over. Current analyses of the role of nuclear weapons are narrow and exaggerated. We must now adopt a nuclear weapons no first use declaratory policy. <br />
Scott D. Sagan, professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation. June 1, 2009 (“The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
            Is the threat of the first use of US nuclear weapons … in the event that deterrence fails’.<br />
<br />
A No first use Declaratory policy enhances deterrence, reassurance, counterterrorism, and non-proliferation.<br />
Scott D. Sagan, professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation. June 1, 2009 (“The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
Declaratory policy and public documents …nuclear doctrines or potential nuclear-weapons acquisition. <br />
<br />
<br />
No-First Use would continue and enhance deterrence and extended-deterrence commitments<br />
Scott D. Sagan, professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation. June 1, 2009 (“The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
Given the current superiority of the United States …broader diplomatic and non-proliferation benefits. <br />
<br />
<br />
No first use doctrines are credible-three reasons<br />
Scott D. Sagan, professor of political science and co-director of Center for International Security And Cooperation. June 1, 2009 (“The Case for No First Use” Survival 51:3, 163-182)jap <br />
<br />
The second objection is that no-first-use declarations … declaratory policy would be significantly enhanced. <br />
<br />
<br />
Unilateral NFU will be modeled- previous initiatives prove<br />
Feiveson Princeton co-director Program on Science and Global Security, 2003<br />
(Harold A. Feiveson, senior research scientist and co-director of the Program on Science and Global Security at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University and Ernst Jan Hogendoorn , Ph.D student at Woodrow Wilson School, “No First Use of Nuclear Weapons” 2003 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/102feiv.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/102feiv.pdf</a> &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/102feiv.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cns.miis.edu/npr/pdfs/102feiv.pdf</a>&gt; ) msd<br />
<br />
It would be valuable for strong no first use commitments … commit to no first use of nuclear weapons.
