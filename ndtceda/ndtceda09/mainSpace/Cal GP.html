Undecidability K<br />
<br />
<ol><li>the aff is the worst kind of nihilism. They identify a societal wrong, only to take a step back and rethink the social coordinates which give rise to it. In aiming to create a framework which will then make justice possible, the aff has forsaken the entire enterprises of ethical decision making.</li></ol><br />
Undecidability describes the intrinsic condition of life which is aporetic, chaotic, and unknowable. All choices are madke with incomplete information and carry the risk of unintended consequences. Where ethical decisions are strong, hopeful and shoulder the risk of undecidability, the aff aims to actualize a democracy where the madness of decision making no longer applies<br />
Shepherd, “perpetual Unease or being at ease?” April 2007, p 227-243<br />
“derrida consistently rejected…in social relationships with authentic others.”<br />
<br />
The aff heralds the coming messiah, a social system which is foreseeable and brings the promice of a concrete, identifiable democratic justice and equality. As undecidability’s counterpart, messianism aims to eliminate the cast chaos and aphoria of the real world. However, undecidability is inescapable- the messiah’s cheer brigade thus has no choice but to resort to violence against threats to the stability of the coming democracy<br />
<br />
In contrast to the affs messianism, the alternative is the messianic, which is distinct because it sees democracy precicely as something which is always still to-come and can never be achieved. Voting negative therefore entails engaging ethics in all their aporetic madness<br />
Hagglund, “the necessity of discrimination: Disjoining Derrida and Levinas” 40-71 2004<br />
“the most problematic strategy in…makes responsibility possible in the first place.”<br />
<br />
The affirmatives messanism has resulted in the most horrid forms of historical atrocity. Only the alternatives messianic politics can capture the pragmatic benefits of their messianism while resisting the backslide into bloodshed.<br />
Caputo “Deconstruction in a Nutshell: A Conversation with Jacques Derrida, ed. w/ commentary by caputo, pages 156-164. 1997<br />
<br />
“it is clear to anyone with a jewish ear…not the private property of some chosen people.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, as a matter of decision making, you should ground your choices in responsibility. Only the alternative’s intervention into madness can fulfill the ethical potential of politics. The affirmative is anti-ethical and irresponsible to the core”<br />
Derrida. “Gift of Death” 1995<br />
“to “subordinate responsibility to the object of knowledge,”… for freedom and for decision”<br />
