Buddhism Cites<br />
<br />
<strong>First, the 1AC's desire for change is just a symptom of trying to fill our emptiness, and as long as desire exists it guarantees that human liberation will not occur</strong><br />
<br />
Loy 2003<br />
<br />
According to Shakyamuni, the cause.....economic solution to human unhappiness.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second, by avoiding death you are avoiding life, this is suffering that prevents human liberation.</strong><br />
<br />
Loy 1996<br />
<br />
Sakyamuni Buddha declared that he....implies a death-in-life.<br />
<br />
<strong>Third, the 1AC attempts to fight and avoid suffering, there is a way out through being mindful, recognizing our feelings, and looking deeply we can create the insight that is needed in order to create a life that is full of peace, joy and freedom in the spite of sufering</strong><br />
<br />
Bortholin 2005<br />
<br />
Recognizing that suffering is an.....time to carefully examine it.<br />

<strong>The impact is that Buddhism embraces individual human liberation as opposed to social engineering which will fail to create effective change - this comes before all impacts including nuclear war</strong><br />
<br />

We propose Mindful Breathign so we can achieve mindfulness</strong><br />
<br />
Bortholin 2005<br />
<br />
To avoid such a catastrophic.....into a state of ease.<br />
<br />
<strong>And the alternative ensures human liberation by preventing the suffering caused from the belief in a separate and independent ego &quot;I&quot; self - this realization and dwelling caused by the alternative is what also allows for mindfulness</strong><br />
<br />
Loy 2008<br />
<br />
Transforming our karma in this.....welfare and awakening of everyone.<br />
