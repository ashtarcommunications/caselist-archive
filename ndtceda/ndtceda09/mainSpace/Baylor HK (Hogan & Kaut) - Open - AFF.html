Baylor HK - Negligence Doctrine 1AC<br />
Round #3 - UNT<br />
<br />
Plan - The United States President should ban policies authorizing nuclear use against a state in response to a strike from a non-state entity.<br />
<br />
Contention 1 - Control<br />
<br />
The current negligence policy causes nuclear retaliation, ensures a nuclear solution is applied to diplomatic problems making any attack a reason to use nuclear weapons<br />
Beljac 8 &quot;The Nuclear Terror of Bush Negligence Policy,&quot; www.eurekastreet.com.au<br />
&quot;it was not widely reported...in military posturing.&quot;<br />
<br />
This focus on the terrorist threat is inflated to lead to a politics of fear justifying control of everything.<br />
Wolfe 8 &quot;Imaginary Existential Threats,&quot; thewaronbullshit.com/2009/06/25/exaggerated_threats/<br />
&quot;without venturing into the absurd...money and power.&quot;<br />
<br />
We will have no idea if the weapon is really stolen or authorized.<br />
Levi 8 &quot;Deterring State Sponsorship of Nuclear Terrorism,&quot; Muse<br />
Fourth, even with...one during peacetime-<br />
<br />
We must reject the negligence doctrine and avoid its militarization - the politics of fear employed by Bush doctrine makes endless military intervention, the erosion of rights, and the very conditions for terrorism inevitable.<br />
Kohn 9 &quot;The Danger of Endless War in an Endless War on Terrorism,&quot; Journal of Military History, 72(1), Muse<br />
A Global War on Terrorism...better of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Expansion of the war on terror is a tool the federal government uses to strip all rights and make all life destroyable<br />

&quot;As war becomes the...discipline at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Opposing militarism is a precondition to solving any problem - we need to form a culture of peace to sustain human life further<br />
Grious 8 www.truthout.org/112008J<br />
Finally, if higher education...sustain human life.&quot;<br />
<br />
Contention 2 - Cooperation<br />
Retaliatory threats gut international cooperation and foster mistrust of the US - shared intelligence with other countries is key to containing post-terror attack responses<br />

&quot;compellance refers to....conclusion below.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cooperation and trust with other states is key to interdict terrorist plots and smuggling chains<br />
Lee 9 &quot;Toward an intelligence based nuclear cooperation regime,&quot; www.fpri.org/enotes/200907.lee.intelligencenuclearcooperation.html<br />
&quot;Russian-American collaboration...proliferation world, maintaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
States don't cooperate with current policy, fear of resources being pinpointed to them for retaliation<br />
Levi 8<br />
&quot;threat perception is...of deterrent threats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Threat posture ensures we will have no idea who supplied the material and if leaders supplied nuclear materials<br />
Levi 8<br />
One might argue...and attribution efforts.<br />
<br />
Cooperation is essential to make sure remaining arsenal is secure<br />
Levi 8<br />
U.S. threats will not...undermine that goal.<br />
<br />
The intersection of strategy, calculation and technology at the heart of international relations is the base logic of scientific management and exploitation<br />
Burke 7 Beyond Security, 197-8<br />
The arguments of liberals...injuring or afflicting any.<br />
<br />
The war on terror should be read as an attempt to restore the ontological position of the American state - this is apart of the creation of security threats abroad<br />

On September 11...restore its OS.<br />
