<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>I AM ADDICTED TO THE MOST PERVASIVE AND DEADLY DRUG IN HUMAN HISTORY, BUT I AM NOT ALONE. MY PARTNER IS AN ADDICT, OUR OPPONENTS ARE ADDICTS, AND EVEN YOU, THE JUDGE OF THIS DEBATE ROUND, IS A DRUG ADDICT.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THIS WHOLE NATION IS ADDICTED TO THE DRUG KNOWN AS WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN SUCESSFUL AT KICKING THIS HABIT. WE CANNOT KICK IT BECAUSE WE DO NOT EVEN ADMIT THE HABIT EXISTS. WE RELEGATE RACISM TO THE PAST AND CELEBRATE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR DAY AS A FORM OF THERAPY. THE TRUTH IS, OPPRESSION IS IMBEDDED INTO THE VEIN OF OUR EXISTENCE LIKE A NEEDLE AND WE CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS HIGH.</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN THIS OPPRESSIVE SOCIETYAREADDICTS OF WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY. THE NORMS, VALUES, AND DAILY PRACTICES OF OUR SOCIETY FILL THE VERY AIR WE BREATHE WITH THIS DEADLY DRUG, INFECTING OUR LIVED-EXPERIENCE WITH WHITE-SUPREMACY-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY.</strong></span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>EVERYONE IN THIS SOCIETY IS AN ADDICT, THEREFORE EVERYONE IN THIS SOCIETY IS OPPRESSED. THUS WE DEMANDTHIS DEBATE SHOULD BE DECIDED BASED ON WHO BEST PERFORMS AN ADVOCACY TO LIBERATE THE OPPRESSED.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THE DEBATE TOURNAMENT IS NOT A PLACE OF CIVIL DISCUSSION ON CURRENT EVENTS, BUT A SAFE HAVEN TO FEED OUR ADDICTION. THE NORMS, VALUES, AND PRACTICES OF THE DEBATE COMMUNITY PROVIDE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET HIGH ON WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>OUR ADDICTION TO WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY IS THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL FORMS OF DOMINATION AND CONFLICT.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>ADDICTION TO WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY CALLS FOR THE CONQUERING OF OTHER HUMAN BEINGS OR NATURE TO SATIATE OUR NEED TO GET HIGH.</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THEREFORE THE ROOT CAUSE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IS OUR ADDICTION TO WHITE-SUPREMACIST-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY. TECHNOCRACTIC WHITE-SUPREMACY-CLASSIST- PATRIARCHY defines ANYTHING THAT IS NOT PERFECT STABILITY – INCLUDING NATURE OR BLACK BODIES – AS A THREAT TO BE DESTROYED. THIS DESIRE FOR CONTROL AND PEACE HAS CREATED THE ONLY TRUE METHOD FOR APOCALYPSE: THE NUCLEAR BOMB.</strong> </span><br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO ADDICTION IS TO BE FULLY HONEST ABOUT ONE’S CONDITION. ADDICTION AND OPPRESSION IS PERPETUATED BY FEAR OF A WORLD WITHOUT ONE’S DRUG, THEREFORE ACCEPTING THE TRUTH OF ONE’S CONDITION BREAKS THROUGH THE WALL OF FEAR THAT MAKES ADDICTION INEVITABLE. THE BALLOT IS AN AFFIRMATION OF HONESTY ABOUT AND ACCEPTANCE OF ONE’S STATUS AS A DRUG ADDICT. ONLY THIS AFFIRMATION WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE A COMMUNITY BUILT ON MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND LOVE.</strong> </span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>THE BALLOT IS THE INTERNAL LINK TO TRANSFORMING THE DEBATE COMMUNITY. YOU AS THE JUDGE ARE A GATE-KEEPER AND ONLY WITH YOUR SUPPORT CAN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY CHANGE. THE ROLE OF THE BALLOT IS TO LEND COMPETITIVE SUPPORT TO PRODUCE A COMPLETE CHANGE IN THE MEANING OF DEBATE</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times;"><strong>PERMUTING PERFORMANCES MAKES NO SENSE. THE LOGIC OF THE PERMUTATION IS THE LOGIC OF COLONIALISM WHERE THE COLONIZER LEARNS, COOPTS, AND RE-CODES THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE COLONIZED INTO THE DOMINANT ORDER. THEIR PERMUTATION IS JUST COLONIALISM WRAPPED IN A FAÇADE AND IS A LINK INTO THE CRITIQUE.</strong></span><br />
