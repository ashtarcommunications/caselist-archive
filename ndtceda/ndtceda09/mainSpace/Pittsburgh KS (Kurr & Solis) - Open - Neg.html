1. Definitions<br />
A. The “arsenal” is the supply of readily available weapons<br />
Los Alamos National Laboratory (&quot;The Stockpile&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lanl.gov/natlsecurity/nuclear/stockpile/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lanl.gov/natlsecurity/nuclear/stockpile/</a>, accessed 9-6-9)<br />

<br />
B. Substantial means in the main<br />
Words and Phrases, 2005, v. 40B, p.392, Okla. 191 1<br />
“Substantially” means in substance; in the main; essentially; by including the material or essential part.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Nuclear weapons means weapons mated to operational delivery systems- everything else is just a nuclear device<br />
Stratfor, 6-17-2008 [&quot;Nuclear Weapons: Devices and Deliverable Warheads,&quot; ]<br />
First, two key … speed of re-entry.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Violation:<br />
<br />
A. The aff is extra topical because nuclear weapons awaiting dismantlement are not part of the arsenal<br />
B. The aff doesn’t meet reduce because they dont reduce the number of active weapons.<br />
C. The aff isn’t substantial because weapons awaiting dismantlement aren’t in the main as they aren’t mated to delivery systems<br />
<br />
3. Reasons to Vote Neg<br />
A. Limits – including inactive nuclear weapons explodes the topic<br />
Woolf, 2008 (Amy F. Woolf, updated January 23, Specialist in National Defense Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, “U.S. Nuclear Weapons: Changes in Policy and Force Structure”)<br />

B. Bidirectional – the mission of inactive weapons is dismantlement, they could ban disarm.<br />

1. Interpretation<br />
<br />
A. The word “should” means that the aff must reduce/restrict a CURRENT role/mission of nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
B. The US and China pledged in November to no longer target each other’s nuclear weapons.<br />
NTI 11-18 (Nuclear Threat Initiative, November 18, 2009, “China, U.S. Remove Each Other From Nuclear Crosshairs”, Global Security Newswire, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20091118_1273.php" rel="nofollow">http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20091118_1273.php</a>)<br />

The United States and … military-to-military exchanges.<br />
<br />
2. Violation: The plan is the status quo. The US has no current policy to target China’s nuclear forces.<br />
<br />
3. Reasons to vote neg<br />
<br />
A. Limits: Allowing Affs to eliminate past roles/missions makes every idea topical. They could say Operation Plowshare, which analyzed peaceful uses of nuclear weapons, is a bad idea, which was eliminated in 1973.<br />
<br />
B. Ground: If the aff already happened, that means there are zero links to disads, counterplans, and kritiks.<br />
<br />
C. Education: There is none because there is no predictability in what the aff could do.<br />

 <br />
A) Interpretation<br />
1) Reduce means to make smaller<br />
Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 2009 [&quot;Reduce,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=66270&amp;dict=CALD" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=66270&amp;dict=CALD</a>, mss]<br />
reduce<br />
verb [I or T]<br />
to make something ... few simple questions.<br />
<br />
2) Restrict means to limit<br />
Compact Oxford English Dictionary, 2009 [&quot;Restrict,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/orexxstrict?view=uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/orexxstrict?view=uk</a>, mss]<br />
Restrict • verb<br />
1 put a limit on; keep under control. 2 deprive of freedom of movement or action.<br />
<br />
3) Role of nuclear weapons is deterrence<br />
Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, 5-6-2009<br />
[Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, co-chaired by Perry and Schlesinger; William Perry, Stanford University professor and Preventive Defense Project co-director, former co-director of Center for International Security and Cooperation, former Secretary of Defense; James R. Schlesinger, Commission vice-chair, MITRE Board chair, consultant to the Departments of Defense and State, Defense Policy Board member, and International Security Advisory Board member, American Academy of Diplomacy member, first U.S. Secretary of Energy , former Secretary of Defense, former CIA director, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, &quot;America’s Strategic Posture: The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States,&quot; United States Institute of Peace, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf</a>, mss]<br />
<br />
Third, declaratory policy ... weapons remains crucial.<br />
<br />
B) Violation—adding RLOAD as a launch posture is extra-topical because it does not reduce or restrict—and Launch on warning is not a role because it does not deter others and removing LoW is not a reduction in missions.<br />
<br />
C) Standards<br />
1) Plan has an extra-topical plank, allows the AFF to avoid debates about what US would transition to after LOW. Also allows them to claim extra-topical advantage based on adopting an RLOAD posture.<br />
<br />
2) Predictable limits- we shouldn’t have to debate cases we are less prepared for- their interpretation allows cases that involve any part of our nuclear arsenal if there is one piece of contextual evidence about role- AND debatability is less important than predictable limits and informed decision making- even if just one word or phrase precludes the RLOAD it’s a deterrent to research it as much as topical cases which makes debate unfair.<br />
<br />
3) Ground—they have to substantially reduce the role, they still allow for weapons to remain on high alert and allow for the US to launch just 10 minutes later, even if they are reduction it is not substantial enough to win a meaningful DA when the AFF gets to fiat out of nuclear war on this topic.<br />

<br />
1. “Its” is singular- nuclear weapons must belong solely to the US<br />

<br />
2. Substantial means in the main<br />
Words and Phrases, 2005, v. 40B, p.392, Okla. 191 1<br />
“Substantially” means in substance; in the main; essentially; by including the material or essential part.<br />
<br />
AND- Long-range strategic nuclear weapons in the triad are the main portion of the arsenal<br />

[Amy, Congressional Research Service (CRS) Reports and Issue Briefs, &quot;Nonstrategic Nuclear Weapons,&quot; l/n,]<br />
During the Cold … or tactical, objectives.<br />
<br />
3. Nuclear weapons means weapons mated to operational delivery systems- everything else is just a nuclear device<br />
Stratfor, 6-17-2008<br />
[&quot;Nuclear Weapons: Devices and Deliverable Warheads,&quot;,]<br />
First, two key … speed of re-entry.<br />
<br />
AND- TNW delivery systems aren’t operational<br />
Kristensen, FAS Nuclear Information Project director, 2005<br />
[Hans, Federation of American Scientists, former Natural Resources Defense Council Nuclear Program consultant, former Nautilus Institute Nuclear Strategy Project director, former Danish Ministry of defense special adviser, former Greenpeace International Nuclear Information Unit senior researcher, The Nuclear Information Project, &quot;U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nukestrat.com/us/afn/nato.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nukestrat.com/us/afn/nato.htm</a>,]<br />
The report concludes … weapons in Europe.<br />
<br />
B. Violation- NATO TNW aren’t part of the nuclear weapons arsenal because they’re not operational, removing TNW from Europe violates ‘its’ because the weapons are shared, and the plan doesn’t substantially affect the nuclear weapons arsenal because it doesn’t affect its main form- strategic weapons.<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to vote neg:<br />
<br />
1. Predictable limits- nuclear weapons is an umbrella term that includes a slew of affs that eliminate particular small nuclear devices- they interpretation legitimates “weapon of the week” cases like cruise missiles, nuclear artillery, and nuclear mines- AND it allows subsets of those affs that ban weapons from particular regions. Limiting to cases that affect the main US nuclear arsenal – long-range strategic weapons – is key to fairness.<br />
<br />
2. Ground- our interpretation is key to check against affs that decrease non-operational warheads- this allows cuts affs that there is no negative ground against, because the warheads serve no purpose- AND the aff makes the topic bi-directional- allows the aff to make arguments that TNW would be shifted to other areas and readTNW good- this makes it impossible to be neg.<br />
<br />
3. Precision- our interpretation gives meaning to the words ‘substantial’ and ‘its’- each word in the resolution must have value and if they don’t meet part, they don’t meet any- AND ignoring its justifies non-proliferation affs that just use the US to pressure other countries over their nuclear weapons policies.<br />

<br />
B. Violation- the aff eliminates all nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to prefer<br />
<br />
1. Ground- The world envisioned by the plan is one that is divorced from the realities of the status quo. Our Holloway evidence indicates that the mindsets, institutions, international systems, and norms relating to the use of nuclear weapons would be entirely different then what they are today. This means our DA and counterplan does not speak to the world that would be required by the passage of plan.<br />
<br />
2. Education- The question of whether nuclear weapons are good or bad is not the focus of the resolution. Instead debate about the ways we reduce or eliminate the role of nuclear weapons is the key question in the path to nuclear disarmament.<br />

This is not a ... in international politics.<br />

D. Topicality is a voting issue for reasons of fairness and education. Competing interpretations is best because it is the least arbitrary form of evaluation.<br />

<br />
The affirmative falls short of the true problem by focusing on the weapons as the problem, rather than the agent of political violence. The aff never gets to the root cause of the problem- weapons are a symptom not a solution. Focusing on weapons diverts attention from the root political cause.<br />

 <br />
Last night, when we were reading west georgia’s case it seemed ironic to me that the way I was able to do that was on the internet. The obsession with being worried about nuclear war provided the incentive to the development infrastructure of the internet. Independent of warfighting, this is one of many ways I connect to nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
My personal experience with nuclear weapons encompasses more than just experiencing the technology. Growing up, I loved many things. Two of these were the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dr. Seuss. With video games, comics, and action figures, they were an integral part of my playing during my childhood. At the time, I knew that they had gained their abilities from nuclear radioactive waste . Independent of the turtles, I loved reading Dr. Seuss. One of my favorite Seuss books was the Butter Battle Book, a story about the Yooks and Zooks who are separated by a giant wall and disagree over the proper way to eat toast. The sides fought and eventually developed the “Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo.” I was fascinated not only by the idea of eating toast with the butter on the bottom side but also by the drive these two sides had to develop technology to defend their positions. After I had moved on from Dr. Seuss and the Turtles and was about 11, I became fascinated with space. I wanted to become an astro-physicist or an astronaut and explore the universe. I remember reading that one of the ways humans could travel throughout space is by using nuclear power and technology. This was my first introduction to the science of nuclear technology, during 7th grade chemistry. Although I no longer pursue a career of nuclear engineering or astro-physics, that has no stopped by fascination with what role nuclear weapons play in space. Over the summer, when Joe Packer and I began researching this topic, we had idea to look at what effect nuclear weapons have on asteroids. This nostalgic research reminded me of my desire to explore space. We investigated why in 2005 NASA recommended a policy to use nuclear weapons against an asteroid especially given the ineffectiveness of such a deflection technique. This technology has provided me the opportunity to speak about my experience on a larger level. You see, Joe, Adam (who helped with the research), and I are writing an article for the journal Timely Interventions. This is allowing me to develop intellectually as a young scholar and learn how to present my ideas in a compelling fashion.<br />
<br />
While all these things are uplifting, this is not the only relationship I have with nuclear technology. When my great grandmother immigrated to the United States in the early twentieth century. She found herself in Boulder City, west of Hoover Dam. At the time, the area provided various construction work, which was the profession of my great grandfather. My grandma chose to stay in the region and when the test site opened in the 1950s, it provided many jobs for people in that community. My grandma would begin working there in the 1960s and stay until its closing in the 90s. Now my grandma suffers from many health problems: heart, back, etc. Doctors are pretty sure the result is extended exposure to radiation at the test site. Looking back, I reminded every time I see her the sacrifices she made, being an immigrant in the U.S., for my father and our family to enjoy a prosperous life.<br />
<br />
My experience has been both positive and negative with regards to nuclear technology. However, it is nuclear technology that has allowed me to develop as an individual for good and bad.<br />
<br />
Our 1NC advocacy solves because it presents the individual experience they claim is the role ballot. The aff cannot capture this for 3 reasons.<br />
<br />
1. STARTING POINT IS THE GLOBAL – Although the affirmative claims to want to focus on the local, they do not do this. The Affirmative paints a picture of the global dilemma that we are all facing, that of an omnipresent, negative and deadly relationship with the Nuclear. This focus on the global effaces the power of the local. Because we become obsessed with describing the power relations of the global we no longer see ourselves as motivators of our realties. As their own author says, “Power, when all its networks are untangled, is local.” Power does not exist out there in the world, but here, inside this round. The impact is projection of our political potentials into the global at the expense of activating the space inside ths round. This is impact is made evident by the political and discursive choices of the 1AC. Instead of describing their personal relations with the bomb in this local – this debate round – they attempt to proscribe what OUR RELATION TO POLITICAL POTENTIAL SHOULD BE. This is a case turn.<br />
2. FLATTENING OUR EXPERIENCES – The Affirmatives representation of the global orderings of the nuclear tell us that our relation to the bomb is totally negative. That is, the bomb is inescapable. As they claim in the FIRST LINE OF THE 1AC The debate community “exclusively” reifies nuclear rhetoric to win debates and this is evil. They don’t leave room for us to envision alternative ways of debating, or relating to the bomb, or activating our own political potential.<br />
<br />
a. The first impact is foreclosure of the political. Their Masco evidence says we must focus on the lived experiences of people to reconstitute our relation to the nuclear – is a political possibility that is foreclosed by the AFFs totalizing representation of the bomb.<br />
<br />
b. The second impact is that they discount the real lives and experiences of people in the debate community, thus making debate a less welcome place for otherness, and destroying coalition building key to movements of change. Their claim that we in debate exclusively enact the kind of mind-numbing negative discourseoe kritiked by the 1AC ignores the fact that there are many people in this community that constitute a vibrant movement towards responsible discourse and community building. The 1AC blocks the progression of these movements, asking you to endorse a politic where their voices no longer matter. This is a case turn and an independent voter for reasons of caring.<br />
<br />
3. SCRIPTING OUR ORENTIATION TO THE BOMB AS ONLY NEGATIVE – Th Affirmative represents a world where we must either endorse their politic or be engaged in a representation of nuclear weapons in debate. This politic of negative scripting destroys open ended process of articulation, rediscovering,and coming to the self necessary to develop resistive politics.<br />
