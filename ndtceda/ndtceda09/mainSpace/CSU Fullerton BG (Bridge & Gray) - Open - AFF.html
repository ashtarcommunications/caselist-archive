 <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We begin with a discussion of the bodies that the nuclear weapons arsenal is built on, including the bodies of those left dead and injured by the bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear testing, radiation tests, the nuclear fuel cycle, and depleted uranium weapons.<br />
<br />
The nuclear weapons regime creates these bodies in pain to make real its power and anchor its ideological belief systems.<br />
Gusterson, 98 (Hugh Gusterson, Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at George Mason University. Nuclear Rites: A Weapons Laboratory at the End of the Cold War. 1998. pp. 108-109)<br />
The marked bodies of all these...in the international power structure (Luke 1989).<br />
<br />
These bodies are only allowed to appear fragmented, decontextualized, and objectifed. The transformation of bodily pain into precise, objective, scientific data erases the subjectivity, suffering and person that inhabit the body, enabling the scientific task to continue unimpeded by awareness of the real pain it inflicts. This erasure is what enables the physical destruction of these bodies.<br />
Gusterson, 98 (Hugh Gusterson, Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at George Mason University. Nuclear Rites: A Weapons Laboratory at the End of the Cold War. 1998. pp. 109-111)<br />
The discourse of scientists and other experts…pain itself getting in the way (Hafferty 1991; Kenner 1987; Taussig 1980).<br />
<br />
Regulation of the ways bodies are allowed to appear in the public sphere leaves certain lives unmarked, able to be taken without recourse.<br />
Butler, 04 (Judith Butler, professor of rhetoric and comparative literature at UC Berkeley. Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence. 2004. pp. xx-xi)<br />
Public policy, including foreign policy…publicly about the effects of war.<br />
<br />
The ongoing violence enacted against bodies is pushed out of our consciousness, discursively contained so that we never have to confront it. This is what legitimizes ongoing destruction, as the nuclear war waged against bodies deemed to be disposable is subordinated to the imaginary of a hypothetical apocalypse to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />
Kato, 93 (Masahide Kato, Professor at the University of Hawaii. “Nuclear Globalism.” Alternatives. pp. 353-355)<br />
Thus, from the perspectives…Indigenous Nations almost on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
We argue that debate participates in the process of subordinating material reality to theorized abstractions about apocalyptic scenarios. Instead of treating debate like a laboratory for disembodied advocacy that ignores the effects of our material presence in the world, we believe debate should be about activating a critical social praxis, using our bodies and our privilege to confront the material conditions of violence that occur in the world around us.<br />
<br />
We ask you to use your ballot as a confrontation of the dismembered body of entire peoples in our backyards and world. Confronting the body that we have abandoned and repressed is a step necessary to challenge the role our nuclear arsenal plays in dismembering the body, distancing us from it so that it can be destroyed.<br />
<br />
The confrontation of suffering via exposure of the body reveals a never-ending contingency of social locations and fluidity of the ever-changing organisms that we are. It is only via exposure to the destructiveness imposed on the body that political spheres can interrogate the bodies of individuals that have been forgotten under the nuclearist worldview.<br />
<br />
Judith Butler explains that the bodies of others make claims on us that we have turned away from. Contemporary conditions of representation are based on a disassociation from the precariousness of bodies, ignoring the claims made on us and subordinating them to disaster scenarios. We must work to establish new modes of public seeing and hearing that allow these lives to appear as embodied, precarious, threatened by destruction.<br />
Butler, 04 (Judith Butler, professor of rhetoric and comparative literature at UC Berkeley. Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence. 2004. pp. 133-151)<br />
So the face, strictly speaking, does not speak…instigation to a sensate democracy they occasionally perform.<br />
<br />
Lastly, bodily politics is itself a non-structuralist or preordained methodology that makes it impossible to formulate universals or models for all-encompassing applicability. Applying the multi-faceted strategies we gain from the body of the suffering other to the process of ordering our daily lives overcomes the socioengineering schemes that deny the body agency in their pursuit of transcendence through reason. Beginning with embodiment opens up space for authentic politics by retrieving context and motivating praxis.<br />
Rajan, 90 (Roby Rajan, School of Business at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside. Alternatives, Volume XV. 1990)<br />
It ought to be stressed here that for Gandhi, …it is always and irretrievably situated.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;">The confrontation to suffering via exposure of the body reveals a never-ending contingency of social locations and fluidity of the ever-changing organisms that we are. It is only via exposure to the destructiveness imposed on the body that political spheres can interrogate the bodies of individuals that have been forgotten since the beginning of the nuclearist worldview. If you learn anything from this debate, it’s not so much about the disaster that we face, but about public criticism as an embodied act of exile that reorients violent relations through subversion of bodily exclusion from the domain of public representation.</span><br />
