Finally, participants asked whether NFU implied … ICBMs that we are able to launch quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Aff can’t solve accidents—Russian officers will bypass launch posture and authorization<br />
Hoodbhoy 98 (Pervez, Professor of Nuclear Physics @ Quaid-i-Azam University, “Is Accidental Nuclear War Impossible?” Chowk, AD: 8-23-09,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.chowk.com/articles/4419" rel="nofollow">http://www.chowk.com/articles/4419</a>)<br />

2. Russian nuclear weapons are completely safe—internal sources<br />

3. No risk of accidents—extensive launch procedures<br />

A PRIMER,” Air University, AD: 8-30-09,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA476162&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA476162&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf</a>)<br />

In the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Defense is … security system of Russian nuclear warheads in transit.82<br />
<br />
5. Technical and procedural controls prevent any risk of accidental launch<br />
Busch 4 (Nathan, PhD IR, No end in sight: the continuing menace of nuclear proliferation, p. 107)<br />
Russia has instituted a number of technical … accidentally launch an ICBM by pushing the wrong button.<br />
<br />
6. Accidental launch irrelevant—Russia no longer relies on its early warning system<br />

“Love is like war,” the chaplain says in Bertolt …, bearing in mind that nothing in this world is ever certain.<br />
<br />
Status Quo safety measures include PALs, detargeting, and multiple other safeguards, there is no risk of accidental launch. Dealert would only decrease deterrence and increase risk of delegated launch authority.<br />

C. Standards –<br />

2. Limits – They allow for hundreds of infinitely regressive affirmatives that prohibit a strike to one country because it would be a quantitative reduction in the mission but there is no restriction on the mission.<br />
