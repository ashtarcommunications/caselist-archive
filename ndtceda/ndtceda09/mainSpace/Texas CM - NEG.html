<strong>Hiroshima 1NC</strong><br />
<br />
We begin with a fragment of memory FROM AUGUST 1945…<br />
A person was stripped of skin... In the eyes of these individuals, the names of those responsible for the war have not yet been disclosed)&quot;<br />
[story from Matsuda, a hibakusha, found in Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p.127-130]<br />
<br />
That comes from the testimony of a Hiroshima witness named Matsuda. It is excerpted from a book that tells the story of a man who refused to stop talking about Hiroshima. Matsuda’s story reflects his rage as he slowly died over decades from the after-effects of Hiroshima. The powerful rage of his memory continues to haunt his audiences, provoking powerful reflections on life and death, war and peace.<br />
<br />
Yoneyama, Associate Professor of Japanese Studies &amp; Cultural Studies @ UCSD, 1999<br />
[Lisa, Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p. 132-135]<br />
These reactions suggest...through what I experienced.&quot;<br />
<br />
We have turned away from hiroshima to contemplate the apocalype. we find it easier to conceive of nuclear weapons through the lens of massive nuclear conflict than confont the meaning of our grandparents’ crimes. it is precisely because of this reluctance that we must return to hiroshima.<br />
Foard, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Arizona State University, 1997<br />
[James A., “Imagining Nuclear Weapons: Hiroshima, Armageddon, and the Annihilation of the Students of Ichijo, School Journal of the Amencan Academy of Religion ]<br />
From virtually the moment that Americans... a cultural construct rather than a self-evident fact.<br />
<br />
Before you decide whether the aff is a good policy, you must first decide whether you want to be a policy-maker.<br />
The affirmative is determined to plunge into a future of peace and prosperity, a world that has no room for the dead victims upon which it is built. But the dead are still with us as long as we can tell their stories. While Matsumi died decades ago, we hoped that remembering his story allowed a brief a moment of ethical identification—vote neg to embrace symathy with the dead.<br />
Yoneyama, Associate Professor of Japanese Studies &amp; Cultural Studies @ UCSD, 1999<br />
[Lisa, Hiroshima Traces: Time, Space, and the Dialectics of Memory, p.143-147]<br />
Social and cultural systems have constantly...that constitute the heterogeneous and contradictory structural elements of one's positionality.<br />
<br />
Before you decide to vote for a policy, you must first make an ethical decision about what sort of judge you want to be. In this debate, we ask you to set aside a policy-making role and use your ballot to acknowledge unconditional responsibility to the ethical call of history in Mitsuda’s story.<br />
Davis, 2001<br />
[Walter A., Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative, p. xvii-xx]<br />
4. History, I will argue, contains the same powerThe two works dialectically depend upon and complete one another.19<br />
<br />
Your role in this debate is to decide whether you want to be the sort of judge demanded by the 1AC, or if you prefer to be the sort of audience called forth by the alternative.<br />
Greene, Assistance Profession Communications @ UT-Austin, 1998<br />
(Ronald, Argumentation and Advocacy, Summer, p. 20-21)<br />
In Scott’s hands rhetoric becomes a particular form of human action with ethical consequences. ...Black's gloss of Marx but the implications of turning to Booth and Marx to ground the concept of the second persona.<br />
