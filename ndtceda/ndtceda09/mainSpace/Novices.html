Plan: The United States federal government should adopt a policy of minimal deterrence. We'll clarify.<br />

COUNTERFORCE STRATEGY FUELS AN ONGOING ARMS RACE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND RUSSIA AND MAKES MISCALCULATION INCREASINGLY LIKELY<br />

RUSSIA’S AGING DETECTION SYSTEMS COUPLED WITH THE TIME PRESSURES TO LAUNCH CAUSED BY COUNTERFORCE TARGETING CREATE AN INCREASING AND PERSISTENT RISK OF ACCIDENTAL LAUNCH<br />

Although much was made of the 1994 joint decision by Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin to no longer target each other with their weapons,…<u>, to avoid an accidental or unauthorized launch</u>.'<br />
