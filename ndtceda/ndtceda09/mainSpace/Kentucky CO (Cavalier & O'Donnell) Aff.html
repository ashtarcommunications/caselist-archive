PLAN <br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should prohibit the use of its weapons unless the United States or its allies are attacked with nuclear weapons. <br />
<br />
Advantage One – Prolif <br />
<br />
Obama will retain first use – Obama intends to maintain first use of nuclear weapons <br />

<br />
Scenario A. 2010 NPT Review Conference <br />
<br />
Negative security assurances are the most important issues for the 2010 Review Conference – US first use options will collapse the conference and the NPT <br />

The npt is the cornerstone…are available to terrorists <br />

NPT provides deterrence for states who seek nuclear weapons – collapse causes rapid proliferation <br />

India is moving away from their no first use doctrine which guarantees escalatory nuclear war with Pakistan – only a strict no first use commitment from the US can prevent this <br />
Scott sagan, june 2009, “the case for no first use”, survival, vol 51, iss 3 <br />
Us behavior is in fact highly…India in the opposite direction <br />

Failure to take nuclear first use off the table from the beginning ensures small concessions from North Korea which undermine six party talks <br />
Kim young soo, 9-30-08, “making the grand bargain stick” lexis <br />
North korea has so far kept silent…during the cold war <br />

Advantage – Russia <br />

First use posturing is driving Russian high alert levels – makes accidents and US-Russian nuclear escalation inevitable; NFU is key <br />
