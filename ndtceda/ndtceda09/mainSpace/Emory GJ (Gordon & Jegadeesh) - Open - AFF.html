CP’s that allow the possibility of doing the entirety of the plans mandate should be rejected<br />
a. Anti-educational—consult gives negatives an incentive to not work on the topic because they can always just change the process of the plan and claim arbitrary advantages—this prevents an in-depth examination of the topic literature and causes negatives to leave debate only knowing how to cheat and not how to research or strategize.<br />
b. Kills affirmative ground—the debate is massively rigged in the negative’s favor because they get to choose an agent of consultation where the literature is on their side—even if we can get offense it relies on us reading it new in the 2AC that gives them a 13 minute block to answer vs a 5 minute 1AR. [Also, its infinitely regressive they can consult any institution or individual—the net benefit is always a rigged game for the negative because they get to pick.]—In the context of our aff is uniquely worse since if we make a say no arg we lose since our aff would just be rejected<br />
