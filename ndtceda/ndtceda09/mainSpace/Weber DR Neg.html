<strong>The Pneumatic Spark<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">First, to truly understand the nuclear issue, we must expose its mythology. The 1ac reinforces the belief that all of science is morally neutral. This lack of moral character is responsible for the destruction of Hiroshima and the belief that America determines its own history and therefore controls the life of creation. It is this form of nuclear policy that is a policy of violence.</span></strong><br />

If human beings ... nothing significant has changed.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">And, it is our obsession with the bomb and its possibility to destroy us all that renders us blind to the destruction that is going on all around us. Violence takes place everywhere all over the world, but goes unseen. </span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">And, the aff is rooted in </span>apocalyptic humanism. Its obsession with our survival has forced us to ignore what makes our lives and deaths worthwhile and such a secular age is doomed wage wars even more dangerous than the ones before them.</strong><br />

Thus, those who tell us ... may not be just.</span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>And, the constant accusations of apocalyptic threats are a ruse created to unify populations in a fear that eliminates any alternatives to current political arrangements where any theological understanding is occluded. Such nuclear sovereignty puts us is a false dilemma, to either bomb or be bombed, either commit acts of terror or be terrorized.</strong><br />

So we return ... for its own existence.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, this fear of dying feeds the political and economic structures that justify the devaluation of all life.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>History 1NC</strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>First, Ethical concerns are moved by our thinking that we can control history, to view life as a single focal point justifies values being sacrificed to other values including life to perfection. Understanding ethics from history assumes that we can manage and shape history. When we try to control history, it only turns out in a different way then we intend. History cannot be controlled.</strong><br />
</span><strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Yoder 94 </span></strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;">(John Howard (prof of theology @ Notre dame.] Politics of Jesus)</span><br />
<strong><span class="ShrinkChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt;">One way to.... cause it to go. </span></span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><br />
And, History is not a something that is made up of casual relations; Things don’t just simply repeat themselves. Any attempt to control history through progress is nothing but a delusion that results in a dogma of liberal determinism. This leads to hopelessness in life and destroys any movements towards “progress.” Only through the acceptance of an apocalyptic reading of history can avoid this.<br />
</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Hauerwas, 95</span></strong><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> (Stanley, Professor of theology@ Duke, Dispatches from the front, p. 109-110)</span><br />
<span class="ShrinkChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt;">In particular, apocalyptic...which is vouchsafed.” </span></span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br />
And, The violence of the 1ac is inevitable in the current world that we live in. Only the hope of the Eucharist and in God’s providence can we navigate the inevitability of human violence. The current world justifies this violence due its inevitability and feeds in to the false theology of human control and that claims we can solve this violence through the plan action. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 6pt;">How are Christians...</span><u>of the kingdom.</u> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br />
And, Atheism is just as intolerant and bigoted as that of the Christian fundamentalists, those that believe in the idea of perfection call for the constant eradication of humans and those that fall out of their utopian vision of what the world should look like. Nothing indicates that we are improving our species through technology and science. Do not confuse religion with that of religious institutions, religion is fighting for justice and eradicating the violence against the weak. The greatest danger does not come from the believers but rather those that believe we can perfect the world through advancement and eradication of a certain group or part of society. </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 6pt; font-weight: normal;">These New Atheists....</span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">we must fight.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><br />
<strong>And, metaphysics must to be devoid of philosophical questions and must always be a question of the theological. In the world where philosophy and metaphysics are one in the same, being is viewed as a given not a gift.</strong> </span><br />

<span class="ShrinkChar"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 8pt;">This essay defines...and this demand. </span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br />
<strong>And, we live a hopeless world with no faith in any possibility of salvation. Even the secular minds find that the truths they were promised that of self-liberation and the end of all discrimination are just lies. In this secular world, God has been reduced to pragmatic purposes only. However, none of the problems proposed to be fixed by liberalism or a basis on ethics are still problems that have never been resolved. These secularists cannot acknowledge the power that gave rise to their world, to them death is the only future that individuals have nothing else transcends death.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><u><strong>We live in a time ....sought to address.</strong></u> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br />
<strong>And, the discourse of secularism is synonymous with nihilism because it seeks to describe all encounters of the world outside the divine mind. It sees life as a given rather than a gift, which guarantees neutrality towards all things. Modern discourse, then, necessitates an epistemic articulation of the loss of death before the loss of life.</strong> </span><br />

And, </span><strong>With in this secular world, differences are reduced to competing claims that result in war. A Christian ontology comes from the understanding of original peace, that of the eschatological event, Christianity is the exact opposite of nihilism by not actively excluding violence from eschatology. We see differences not as conflictual but peaceful and part of the doctrine of creation. Only Christianity sees the origin and the end as both peaceful events with minor intrusions of war.</strong> </span><br />
