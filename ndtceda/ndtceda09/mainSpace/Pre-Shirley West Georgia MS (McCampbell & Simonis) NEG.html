Nuclear Policymaking is a gendered issue<br />
Cohn, Hill &amp; Ruddick 05 (www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd80/80ccfhsr.htm, Disarmament Diplomacy, Issue 80, Autumn, 6)<br />
“This story is not simply about one individual, his feels and actions; it illustrates the role and meaning of gender discourse in the defense community… to borrow a strategists’ term, we can say that gender coding serves as a “preemptive deterrent” to certain kinds of thought about the effects and consequences of strategic plans and WMD”<br />
<br />
Nuclear euphemisms divorce the bomb from its effects by invoking domesticated imagery, the world of nuclear weapons is ever friendly, even romantic, totally abstract &amp; removed<br />
<br />
Cohn 87 (from aff aricle, cited above)<br />
“Sanitized abstraction and sexual patriarchal imagry, even when disturbing, seemed to fit easily into the masculinist world of nuclear war planning… There is much discussion of “vulnerability” and “survivability,” but it is about the vulnerability and survival of weapons systems, not people.”<br />
<br />
Euphamisms clear the moral obstacles to killing—they justify global extermination by dehumanizing the enemy.<br />
Haig Bosmajian 1984 (Dehumanizing People and Euphemizing War” Dec 5, www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1442)<br />
“in his definitive work The Destruction… Euphemize killing and the weapons of destruction and dehumanize the potential victims in order to justify their extermination”<br />
<br />
Euphemism’s of war must be exposed for what they are<br />
Bosmajian (same cite)<br />
“our political and religious leaders… the positive side is to ensure that people act without moral compunction”<br />
<br />
Masculine IR causes militarism exploitation, envt’l destruction, and scientific crises<br />
Zalewski &amp; Palpart 98 (marysia and Jane, [The ‘Man’ Question in International Relations], 86)<br />
“whereas we think it important to avoid what halliday calls “precipitite totalization,”… this has allowed (hu)manity to ignore the myriad warning signs of imminent catastrophe”<br />
<br />
<br />
The alternative is deconstruct the techno-strategic discourse of militarized masculinity and reconstruct alternative conceptions of rationality.<br />
Cohn 87<br />
“I believe that feminists, and others…. With aech other will invent those futures”
