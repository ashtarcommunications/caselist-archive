<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In The Shadow of the American Dream: Soon All This Will Be Picturesque Ruins</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">David Wojnarowicz, <em>Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration</em>, Vintage, 1991</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Americans can’t deal with death unless they own it…I might be fighting against in wartime”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And we are at war! You should come to war with us. Oh, don’t worry, it’ll be easy. I promise. Garrison and I have determined the most vulnerable missile complexes and they are two conveniently located in the Rocky Mountains, naturally we can’t tell you exactly where they are. But we are going to utilize this debate round to train you all as our G-Force Alpha Battle-Medallion group, the group is on the front lines of our mission to disarm the United States federal government’s nuclear arsenal. You just need to know four (4) easy steps:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Patrick Di Justo, “How To: Dismantle</span><span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">an Atomic</span><span style="font-family: Microsoft Sans Serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Bomb“, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/start.html?pg=12" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">__http://www.wired.com/wired/ archive/14.10/start.html?pg=12__</a> <br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you’re interested in joining our F-Force Manifest Destiny, the group that will hijack an extraneous nuclear weapon and detonate it on the institution of patriarchy of your choosing, just write your name, phone number, and email address on this sign up sheet. Maybe somebody’s worried about the role of the ballot, don’t worry it’s not about how successful our terrorist mission is, perse. In this debate round we’re investigating the question of imagined violence. In response to the imagined fear that nationalism produces, we disintegrate the hegemonic, “mythic norm” of US nuclear control. Our terrorist training camp is a threatened retribution, “just around the corner”.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Judith Halberstam, “Queer Violence: Representation, Rage, and Resistance”, in Social Text, No. 37 Winter, pg. 192-196)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“The “place of rage” where expression threatens to become action is of course….writings are more like wake-up calls and active protest than cathartic outlets.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We affirm Imagined Violence in response to the resolution, to be understood as a Terrorist Assemblage: dismantling the representational mandates that construct US sexual exceptionalism.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Jasbir K Puar, “Terrorist Assemblages: homonationalism in queer times”, pg. 204-6</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“These are queer times indeed, temporal assemblages hooked into an array of enduring…nevertheless surfaces as an object in need of excavation, elaboration, or specularization.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A specific manifestation of this nuclear control is in that of the nuclear family. The incestuous father is the natural extension of nuclear weaponry, purported to protect the family whilst secretly enacting endless violence upon it.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Jane Caputi, “Unthinkable Fathering: Connecting Incest and Nuclearism” Hypatia. Volume: 9. Issue: 2. Publication Year: 1994.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Another kind of nuclear father was exemplified by forty-one-year-old Ernie Lasiter…the phrase “nuclear family” established itself firmly in the national vernacular by 1947”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We’ll close with a poem from War Baby Express</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Roseann Lloyd, <em>War Baby Express</em>, Holy Cow! Press 1996, pg 21-25</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“A woman on frontline goes back to the house/Where her father raped her…On the sidewalk/To announce my missing name”<br />
