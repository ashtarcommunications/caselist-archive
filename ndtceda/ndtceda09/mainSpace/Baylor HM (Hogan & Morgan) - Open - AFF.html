 Baylor HM: Derrida<br />
Chapter One: Course de Vitesse<br />
<br />
The construction of nuclear threats and the dissemination of nuclear weapons are a byproduct of and fuel an increasing of speed and the influence of techno-tele-media apparatuses into every aspect of life. International relations, as a result, is marked by an increasing inequality of States exemplified by US military exceptionalism.<br />
Jacques Derrida. 1994. Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International. pg. 97-105<br />
<br />
<br />
The strategic debate surrounding the possibility of no first use is mediated by this acceleration – without decelerating from the speed race extinction is only seconds away<br />
Jacques Derrida Diacritics, Vol. 14, No. 2, Nuclear Criticism (Summer, 1984, pp. 20-31<br />
<br />
<br />
US refusal to adopt a no first use policy concerning nuclear weapons is an example of the accelerated state of sovereignty and the exposure of the limitations of our conceptions of politics and events. The addition of non-nuclear threats as first strike options facilitates the very threats it seeks to eradicate.<br />

Chapter Two: Nuclear Texts<br />
<br />
We are taking a step back from the speed race or course de vitesse. We recognize that we are not experts in strategy, diplomacy or techno-science. Our affirmative is a deceleration and deconstruction of nuclear weapons policy in order to open up an ethical space instead of defaulting to the system of nuclear preemption and US exceptionalism that constitutes the nuclear condition of the status quo and maintains the United States policy of first use of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our location outside of the levers of power is essential to our criticism of the fabulously textual nuclear system. Nuclear culture is conditioned by an intertextual economy dominated by techno-scientifico-military discourse. Their rendition of this fable spurs the violent speed race that permeates every facet of life.<br />
Jacques Derrida Diacritics, Vol. 14, No. 2, Nuclear Criticism (Summer, 1984), pp. 20-31<br />
<br />
<br />
Debate is a key site for evaluating the intertextual economy. Nuclear arms and critical scholarship are both symbols in the creation of the nuclear culture that encodes the nuclear condition.<br />
Bryan C. Taylor. 2003. “Our Bruised Arms Hung Up as Monuments”: Nuclear Iconography in Post-Cold War Culture. Critical Studies in Media Communication Vol. 20, No. 1, March. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://comm.colorado.edu/taylorbc/RCSM_20_1_01LORES.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://comm.colorado.edu/taylorbc/RCSM_20_1_01LORES.pdf</a><br />
<br />
While nuclear arms are built up around the nuclear fable, the fulfillment of this system to nuclear war would destroy the archive. The possibility of this destruction reveals the spectrality of nuclear weapons and necessitates deconstruction of the cultural text that condition the nuclear system.<br />
Jacques Derrida Diacritics, Vol. 14, No. 2, Nuclear Criticism (Summer, 1984), pp. 20-31<br />
<br />
Cultural criticism of the meaning of nuclear weapons is a primary step to the development of a public sphere apart from the reliance on the nuclear state- only our move away from technical debates about these questions can open space for effective politics. Failure to do so makes extinction inevitable.<br />
<br />
Taylor- Prof at TX A&amp;M 1993 Studies in Critical and Mass comm 10<br />
<br />
Chapter Three: Apocalyptic Fables<br />
<br />
Nuclear war’s ability to destroy the archive makes it the only possible referent as it becomes a remainderless war, unable to be survived by cultural memory. The discourse of diplomatico- military strategy, specifically those which criticizes the possibility of a no first use policy, operates on a system of continual deferral of the event of cultural death.<br />
Jacques Derrida Diacritics, Vol. 14, No. 2, Nuclear Criticism (Summer, 1984), pp. 20-31<br />
<br />
<br />
In this system of deferral, an elaborate technological and cultural infrastructure has developed to support preemptive nuclear strikes and the illusion of nuclear control. This represents a biopolitical move in the relationship between citizens and State. Calls to national security and apocalyptic futures creates an American bomb fetish that fosters the violence it seeks to eliminate.<br />

<br />
The endpoint of the nuclear biopolitics is the nihilistic impulse to do untoward violence that makes extinction thinkable<br />
Michael Dillon- Professor at U of Lancaster- 1996 The Politics of Security pg 14<br />
<br />
Chapter Four: Arrivant<br />
<br />
The manipulation of cultural memory functions under the guise of democracy while manipulating the conditions of deliberating nuclear policy<br />
Taylor 2k7 [bryan, “the means to match their hatred”: muclear weapons, rhetorical democracy, and presidential discourse”, University of Colorado–Boulder, presidential studies quarterly, vol. 37, no. 4, 667-692]<br />
<br />
<br />
Our affirmative is a reading of texts that takes an inventive slant to our responsibility to the other necessary for any true ethical consideration<br />
Geoffrey Bennington. 2000 “Deconstruction and Ethics” Deconstructions: A User’s Guide. Ed. Nicholas Royle. p. 67-8<br />
<br />
<br />
Rather than pretending to be the USfg, our affirmative functions as a means to disrupt the manipulation of cultural memory that is utilized to retain US policy of first use of nuclear weapons. It is necessary to speak with and about the specters that shape our inheritance of the world for ethics to be possible.<br />
Jacques Derrida. 1994. Specters of Marx: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International. pg. xvii-xx.
