Lacan<br />
<em>In choosing to represent “real world” results as the only valid signifiers of political action, the Affirmatives destroy the politics of thought.<br />
<br />
Badiou 06<br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, the name possesses… the question of Time.</strong><br />
<br />
A. OBSERVATION: the plan is an act of recognition, specularization, and pornographic voyeurism, an attempt by the Affirmatives to secure their perceived position in the psychopolitical world order. The Affirmatives refuse any encounter with the Real, choosing instead to embrace its utopian reflection, Real Politick.<br />
<br />
Toal 93<br />
<strong>Thirdly, though it may.. geopolitics and gender work together.</strong><br />
<br />
1. Specular ego-formation is inherently unstable. The ever present gap between the Real and the imaginary is closed by alienation and otherization of the external, fueling narcissistic aggression.<br />
<br />
Stavrakakis 99<br />
<strong>What is most… That’s a good one!’</strong><br />
<br />
2. Threat construction is an inevitable and lethal consequence of utopian projectionism. In the arena of geopolitics, the terminal implication of narcissistic aggression is genocide.<br />
<br />
Stavrakakis 99<br />
<strong>What I will try to… a highly problematic area.</strong><br />
<br />
C. ALTERNATIVE: identifying with the Other and abandoning the ego-formation of Real Politick disrupts social fantasy, opening discursive space for de-alienation. Recognizing the universality of the lack strips signifiers of their meaning.<br />
<br />
Stavrakakis 99<br />

Nuclear Rhetoric</strong><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 21px;">The 1ac employs domesticating metaphors to frame, support and implement their nuclear weapons policy. Characterizing nuclear weapons as nukes, reducing them to classes or along a life-cycle or employing them as umbrellas and bargaining chips naturalizes nuclear weapons, neutralizes their devastating force and makes catastrophic nuclear annihilation inevitable. </span><br />
