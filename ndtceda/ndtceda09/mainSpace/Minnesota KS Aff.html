<span style="font-family: Times;">The United States federal government should adopt a nuclear posture that has no massive retaliation plans, no pre-loaded targets, no ICBMs without flipped safety switches, and no SLBMs with installed inverters. The United States federal government should offer to codify this nuclear posture in a bilateral agreement with the Russian Federation. </span><br />

FIRST, we are fucked—the risk of accidents and unauthorized launch is high now for multiple reasons, and if we win one internal link, we will access a nuclear war that outweighs ANYTHING the neg can generate<br />
<br />
Steven Starr, analyst, “Catastrophic Climatic Consequences of Nuclear Conflict,” INESAP INFORMATION BULLETIN v. 28, April 2008, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://inesap.org/node/11" rel="nofollow">http://inesap.org/node/11</a></span>, accessed 7-23-09.<br />
&quot;The failure of the U.S. and Russia...threat of destruction&quot;<br />
SECOND, both sides have thousands of warheads on high-alert status—any neg claims to the contrary are LIES<br />
Bruce Blair, President, World Security Initiative, &quot;A Rebuttal of the U.S. Statement on the Alert Status of U.S. Nuclear Forces&quot;, Center for Defense Information, 11--6--07, www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=4135, 7-30-09.<br />

<br />
Second, Short decision windows Human error Tech failure Cyber attack Rogue commanders<br />
Bruce Blair, President, World Security Institute, and Victoria Samson, Senior Analyst, Center for Defense Information, 2009, “Taking Nuclear Forces Off Day-to-Day Alert”, Peace Action Maine, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert</a></span> umn-rks<br />
&quot;At the end of the Cold War...strike and nuclear war.&quot; <br />
<br />
Third, high alert risks multiple terror scenarios for extinction—materials theft from lack of coop, cyberattack, spoofed launches<br />
Dr. Bruce G. Blair, President, &quot;Hair-Trigger Missiles Risk Catastrophic Terrorism,&quot; Center for Defense Information, 4--29--03, www.cdi.org/blair/hair-trigger-dangers.cfm, accessed 7-30-09.<br />

<strong><em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 9pt;">Plan </span></em></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Times;">The United States federal government should adopt a nuclear posture that has no massive retaliation plans, no pre-loaded targets, no ICBMs without flipped safety switches, and no SLBMs with installed inverters.

FIRST, the plan solves—best way to avoid accidents<br />
Ron Rosenbaum, &quot;A Real Nuclear Option for the Nominees: Averting &quot;Inadvertent&quot; War in Two Easy Steps,&quot; SLATE, 5--9--08, www.slate.com/id/2191104/pagenum/all/#page_start<br />
&quot;His plan has four phases...destroying itself&quot;<br />
<br />
SECOND, Unilateral U.S. initiatives will snowball into a comprehensive nuclear safety frameworks--solves accidents, bolsters non-proliferation regime<br />
David E. Mosher, Lowell H. Schwartz, David R. Howell, and Lynn E. Davis, BEYOND THE NUCLEAR SHADOW: A PHASED APPROACH FOR IMPROVING NUCLEAR SAFETY AND U.S.-RUSSIAN RELATIONS, 2003, p. 141.<br />
&quot;The phased approach to the ...to achieve success.&quot;<br />
<br />
THIRD, the plan’s limit on the role nuclear weapons solves accidents and nuclear terrorism<br />
Daryl G. Kimball, Executive Director, Arms Control Association, “What Are Nuclear Weapons For?

Bruce Blair, President, World Security Institute, and Victoria Samson, Senior Analyst, Center for Defense Information, 2009, “Taking Nuclear Forces Off Day-to-Day Alert”, Peace Action Maine, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert</a> umn-rks<br />
&quot;De-alerting U.S....Mikhail Gorbachev.&quot;<br />
<br />
SIXTH, Russia will say yes—even if they don’t it prevents Russian accidents<br />
Amy Woolf, Specialist in Nuclear Weapons Policy, Congressional Research Service, June 23 2009. “Re-framing De-Alert: Decreasing the Operational Readiness of Nuclear Weapons Systems in the U.S.-Russia Context” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Woolf.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Woolf.pdf</a><br />

&quot;Although terrorism throughout...including their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
Realism opens up space for ongoing criticism <br />
Murray ‘97<br />
(Alastair J.H., Reconstructing Realism: Between Power Politics and Cosmopolitan Ethics p. 193-6)<br />
“For realism man remains, in … contemporary conditions must first be ensured” <br />
<br />
Realism must be used strategically – rejecting it risks worse uses. <br />
Guzzini ‘98<br />
(Stefano “Realism in International Relations and International Political Economy” <br />
“Therefore, in a third step, … not always necessarily in the spirit, of realism.”<br />

 <br />
I understand what it’s like to be excluded being from a rural community. <br />
Realism opens up a space for all perspectives <br />
De-alert challenges the core of deterrence and reshapes IR <br />
Blair ‘08 <br />
(Bruce, “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no</a>)<br />
De-alerting even at the … and international security” <br />
Policy debate doesn’t exclude anyone, many examples of successful minorities<br />
<br />
Technical Debating about policy actions is a source of political agency – arguing the cost and benefits of government policy is necessary to defy normalizing exclusion for politics.<br />
Kulynich 97<br />
(Jessica, Polity n.2, Winter p. 315-336)<br />
When we look at the … construction as passive clients. <br />
<br />
Role-playing is critical<br />
Rawls ‘99<br />
(John “The Law of Peoples” p. 56-57)<br />
“To answer this question … and understanding among peoples.” <br />
<br />
They could have read a specific answer to case, but their project destroys education<br />
Realism opens up the world for education<br />
Many minority perspectives in debate<br />
Perm: take into account all frameworks and then decide<br />
Perm: Use realism to evaluate, <br />
We bring our identity into the round. <br />
<br />
Local resistance becomes powerless if it avoids proscribing realistic policy alternative <br />
Silverstein 00<br />
(Marc, April 25, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.www.umb.edu" rel="nofollow">http://site.www.umb.edu</a>)<br />
“A “co-leader” of the IAC … the same whether it’s in a working-class.” <br />
<br />
Life-like situations make debate more successful<br />
Joiner 99<br />
(Christopher, “Teaching International Law: Views from and International Reelations Political Scientist”, ILSA Journal of International and Comparative Law v. 5 p.377)<br />
“By assessing the role of … the merits of their case.” <br />
Their refusal to engage with actual policymaking dooms their criticism to political irrlevance<br />
McClean ‘01<br />
(David, “The Cultural Left and the Limits of Social Hope,” Presented at the 2001 Annual Confernece of the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy)<br />
“Yet for some reason, at least … for the so-called “managerial class.””<br />
<br />
The affirmative injects themselves into the state.<br />
<br />
No reason debate can’t include education<br />
<br />
Laws are a necessary solvency policy fo social movements and help to augment those movements<br />
McAdams ‘04<br />
(Richard H. July, “Norms in Law and Economics University of Chicago Law School”)<br />
“Why would lawmakers believe … more with what the speaker said).”<br />
<br />
Role-playing allows us to debate and then rethink our identity<br />
Their deny that we can inject our identity in debate, destroys agency<br />

 <br />
Debate has a space for everyone<br />
Our identity is shown in the way we run arguments<br />
<br />
Everyone is a minority in debate <br />
Allowing for everyone opens op the most space for everyone. <br />
They try to lock out our 1AC, there just a new form of exclusion<br />
<br />
Realism must be used strategically<br />
<br />
3 Tier<br />
Identity is a commoditized in the search for the W<br />
<br />
Extend Kulnich, debate opens equal space for everyone<br />
Presenting a plan allows for greater world impact<br />
<br />
Extend Joiner, policy is the best form of debate<br />
<br />
They would have been far more effective to read a traditional kritik. <br />
<br />

 <br />
The three tier system leads is bad<br />
Ether <br />
A. Commodifies OR<br />
B. We can never access the 3 tier system<br />
<br />
Policy role-play is essential to understanding how policy is made<br />
<br />
Joiner proves debate provides a system to inject ourselves<br />
Ex. CAFO Aff last year<br />
<br />
We need mediators or we are ships in the night<br />
No brightline to judge<br />
<br />
We argue for realism because it provides a system to question domination<br />
Perm always functions best<br />
<br />
The neg provides no real action plan<br />
<br />
Our debate personality is our individual identity<br />
The arguments we run is our identity
