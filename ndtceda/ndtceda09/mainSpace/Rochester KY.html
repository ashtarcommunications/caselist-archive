<h1 id="toc1"><a name="Contention 1: Anxiety and Insecurity"></a><strong>Contention 1: Anxiety and Insecurity</strong></h1>
 Our psyche is defined by a constant structured flow of anxiety and insecurity-- we are always removed from a state of total fulfillment-- in this sense security is a fantasy that we pursue but never achieve. Nuclear weapons are the product of a structural anxiety-- when we experience insecurity our response to this has been to repress this anxiety by projecting it onto others-- we use nuclear weapons to dominate other countries into feelings of powerless insecurity through the threat of imminent destruction-- believing that if we can force them to fear us and feel insecurity because of us, we will be protected from our own fears. These psychotic anxieties produce defense mechanisms that make oppression and wr inevitable as we constant lash out in order to satiate our desire.<br />
Koehler 2005 [PhD, New York University, &quot;Psychoanalysiss &amp; the Madness of Nuclear Arms&quot;, May 7, 2005]<br />
Hanna Segal, Kleinian psychoanalyst, has written...has its roots in ourselves<br />
<br />
This threat of nuclear destruction is part of the same terroristic fantasy employed by political Islam - the goal is to shatter the psyche of the opposing force. The current strategy of massive retaliation and pre-emptive war is part of a process of sending a shattering message to those who would oppose U.S. hegemony. We should reorient these shattering acts inward at our ideology.<br />

<br />
Advantage 2 is NPT credibility<br />
<br />
First, U.S. TNWs destroy NPT credibility<br />
<strong>Higgin 5</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Davida, “US Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Europe”, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 8pt;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf</a></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">] </span><br />
<br />
Second, TNWs invite prolif and nuclear upgrading – this runs counter to the NPT<br />
<strong>Johnson 3</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Rebecca, “NPT PrepCom Second Interim Report May 4: Nuclear Disarmament”, May 4, 2003, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acronym.org.uk/npt/03inter2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acronym.org.uk/npt/03inter2.htm</a>] </span><br />
<br />
Third, NPT credibility is key to stopping break out prolif – there are 40 countries that are at the breakout point – combination of US actions and mutually reinforcing perception make the NPT the keystone of the nonproliferation.<br />

<br />
Fourth, Withdrawal would boost non prolif credibility going into the NPT review and would fulfill calls from Europe for their removal<br />

<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 16pt;">Advantage 3 – Nato Modernization </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Second, the current approach trades off with NATO modernization – it irritates relations and sucks NATO resources - we shift the focus of the alliance. </span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Kristensen 5</strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;">[Hans, National Defense Resource Council, February 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf</a>]</span><br />
<span class="apple-style-span"><strong><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><br />
Third, we solve the two most important questions of the alliance – nuclear weapons and Russia. No confidence in TNW protection now means there’s only a risk that we increase cohesion. </span></strong><br />
