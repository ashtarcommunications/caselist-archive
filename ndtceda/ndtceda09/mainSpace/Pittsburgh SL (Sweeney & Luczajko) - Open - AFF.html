<strong>Observation One is the Nuclear Genocide:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First, Obama is working in a belligerent nonproliferation regime where he is hypocritically emphasizing non proliferation while at the same time upgrading our weapons arsenal.</strong><br />
Darwin Bond <u>Graham</u> and Will <u>Parrish</u> “Anti-nuclear Nuclearism” January 12, <u>2009</u> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fpif.org/articles/anti-nuclear_nuclearism" rel="nofollow">http://www.fpif.org/articles/anti-nuclear_nuclearism</a><br />
<br />
<strong><u>The Obama … top of this pile</u></strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Next, bargaining of arms control while promoting deterrence relies on the fundamental and contradictory belief that nuclear weapons are both deadly but necessary. This contradiction is glossed over for policy elites through a process of psychological dissociation—we have learned to look only at the positive results of nuclear death.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Lifton</u></strong> (Robert Jay, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota) <strong><u>and Markusen</u></strong> (Professory of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota) <u>The Genocidal Mentality</u> pg. 192-194 <strong><u>1990</u></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"><br />
Because of this psychic numbing, efforts at limiting nuclear weapon use get co-opted into larger discourse of tactical military objectives. We have become dependent on nuclear weapons despite their genocidal potential. </span><br />
<strong><u>Lifton</u></strong> (Robert Jay, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota) <strong><u>and Markusen</u></strong> (Professory of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota) <u>The Genocidal Mentality</u> pg. 71-72 <strong><u>1990</u></strong><br />
The ideological cure … use of weapons.&quot; <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"><br />
<br />
</span><br />
<strong>And, deterrence strategies require constant mental preparation to enact genocidal violence.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>Lifton</u></strong> (Robert Jay, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota) <strong><u>and Markusen</u></strong> (Professory of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota) <u>The Genocidal Mentality</u> pg. 2-3 <strong><u>1990</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>For the &quot;credibility…</u></strong> for the genocidal act.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<strong>This mental preparation leads us to ignore what would happen if deterrence fails—a staggering loss of lives.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Lifton</u></strong> (Robert Jay, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota) <strong><u>and Markusen</u></strong> (Professory of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota) <u>The Genocidal Mentality</u> pg. 4 <strong><u>1990</u></strong><br />
Kennan conveys the … because of deterrence (as policy). <span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"><br />
</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Nuclearism is engrained in a dissociative field that normalizes the practice of genocide.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Lifton</u></strong> (Robert Jay, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota) <strong><u>and Markusen</u></strong> (Professory of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota) <u>The Genocidal Mentality</u> pg. 226-227 <strong><u>1990</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Dissociation, then, … necessary and rational.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Nuclear numbing creates a system capable of genocide so extreme that it becomes akin to omnicide- the destruction of all life on the planet. </span></strong><br />
<strong><u>Lifton</u></strong> (Robert Jay, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota) <strong><u>and Markusen</u></strong> (Professory of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota) <u>The Genocidal Mentality</u> pg. 2-3 <strong><u>1990</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The United … destruction of all life.</u></strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Lastly, disarming the entire arsenal is necessary to prevent this genocidal mass murder. </span></strong><br />
<strong><u>Lifton</u></strong> (Robert Jay, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota) <strong><u>and Markusen</u></strong> (Professory of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota) <u>The Genocidal Mentality</u> pg. 191 <strong><u>1990</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>A nuclear war set … waiting to be crossed.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
Resolved: The Executive branch of the United States federal government should disarm the nuclear weapons arsenal of the United States.<br />
<strong>Observation Two: Ethics</strong><br />
</span><br />
<strong>First, Nuclear weapons present the ultimate moral crisis- not only do they threaten to efface the Earth of all life but they also threaten the existence of those who choose to step back from international conflict.</strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"><br />

<br />
<strong>Furthermore,</strong> <strong>This imaginary war created by nuclear deterrence is the counterpoint to the meaning of life. Everyone is targeted.</strong><br />
<strong>Paupp 96</strong> (Terrence Edward, J.D. “The Nuclear Crucible: The Moral and International Law Implications of Weapons of Mass Destruction.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/ethics/issues/political/paupp_nuclear-crucible.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/ethics/issues/political/paupp_nuclear-crucible.htm</a>)<br />
<strong><u>By virtue of this …</u></strong> spiritual <strong><u>kind&quot;</u></strong> (Ellul, 2000, p.26).<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And, only by confronting disarmament can we attack realism-- in the name of realism, all visions for disarm are dismissed as utopian. The affirmative alone allows the imagination to expand freely – revealing steps for a world without nuclear weapons.</strong><br />
Jonathan <strong>Schell ’82</strong> The Fate of the Earth p 161-2 [gender paraphrased]<br />
As long as politics fails to take up...is to go on living.<br />
<strong><u>As long as … mankind is to go on living.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Lastly, Nuclear extinction obliterates any frame of ethics- if ethics is a dedication to the welfare of an Other, negating the inevitable destruction of the community that constitutes that relation must be top priority.</strong><br />
<strong>Schell 82</strong> [Jonathan. <em>The Fate of the Earth.”</em> 132-133]<br />

<br />
<strong>Observation Three: No Disads</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>There is a 100% chance of an accident occurring only if we continue to rely on our nuclear weapons. The aff solves this problem.</strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Lachlan <strong><u>Forrow et All</u></strong>, (M.D., Bruce G. Blair, Ph.D., Ira Helfand, M.D., George Lewis, Ph.D., Theodore Postol, Ph.D., Victor Sidel, M.D., Barry S. Levy, M.D., Herbert Abrams, M.D., and Christine Cassel, M.D) “</span>Accidental Nuclear War — A Post–Cold War Assessment” The New England Journal of Medicine April 30, <strong><u>1998</u></strong><br />

 <br />
Observation One: The Problem of Hiroshima<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The legacy of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has left a scar on the American psyche. Fifty years after the bombing there is still an active debate about the meaning of this event. What it reveals is a sense of confused ambivalence, where satisfaction and anxiety are fused together, leaving us with an unsettled vision of what American national-identity means. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lifton and Mitchell, 1996</span></strong> (Robert Jay and Greg, <u>Hiroshima in America: A Half Century of Denial</u>. pg. xi-xiii)<br />
<strong><u>You cannot understand the …</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 8pt;"> ethical, and psychological well-being.<br />
</span><br />
<span class="ReadThis"><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; text-decoration: none;">However, Lifton and Mitchell’s approach is a short-sighted one. They assume that if Americans were able to admit that the official justifications are wrong, that out psyche would be cleansed of this wrong-doing. Their approach to history and nuclear weapons is limited by the types of questions that are allowed to asked. What Hiroshima reveals is that there is something poisonous in the American psyche, and that something decisive changed in our systems of thought, calling into being a nuclear unconscious</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Davis, 2001</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;"> (Walter A., professor emeritus at The Ohio State University, </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal;">Deracinations: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">, pg. xvi-xviii)</span><br />

<br />
Further, the existence of our current nuclear weapons policy acts as the ultimate guarantee for American safety and security<br />
<strong>Kehler, 2009</strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Robert, <span class="ssl01">Commander, Air Force Space Command, “House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces Hearing; To receive testimony on the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Budget Request for National Security Space and Missile Defense Programs.” Congressional Documents and Publications, May 21, 2009)</span></span><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Lewis, 2006</span></strong> (Julian, Shadow Defense Minister for the British Royal Navy, “Nuclear Disarmament versus peace in the twenty-first century,” International Affairs, Vol. 82, No. 4 pg. 667-668)<br />
<strong><u>In the closing stages of … what the outcome would be.</u></strong><br />
<h2 id="toc7"> </h2>
 <span class="ReadThis"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">This nuclear unconscious attempts to hide that the nuclear age was a failure from the start. The quest for the ‘peaceful atom’ is a fantasy that attempts to make up for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The use of the bomb set in motion a drive to secure ourselves from the Other, forcing a cascade of the nuclear dilemma to rectify this original error. Striving for guarantees of a safe nuclear future ensures our anxieties about the system. </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-decoration: none;">Davis, 2006</span> <span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">(Walter A., professor emeritus at The Ohio State University</span></span> <em>Death's Dream Kingdom</em> <em><span style="font-style: normal;">pg.52-56)</span></em><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">To recapitulate historical facts … fundamentalism proclaiming its rectitude. </span><br />
<br />
This catastrophic anxiety is the core problem of the psyche and our inability to come to terms with this void is a fate worse than death. Our anxiety functions as the condition for the possibility of Hiroshima and Auschwitz. In attempts to master this emptiness we project our weakness through the bomb. This projection provides us the unrestrained power to bombard the other with pure suffering and destruction in an attempt to control the contingencies that constitute existence.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To respond to the psychical struggle in the nuclear unconscious, it is necessary to internalize this traumatic kernel. To do so shocks the system and forces a change within the self whereby we are able to humanize ourselves. This breaks with the guarantees of our current epistemic system and allows us to accept uncertainty and confront our catastrophic anxiety. </span></strong><br />

<span class="ReadThis"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; text-decoration: none;">The system of guarantees promised by deterrence is thrown into question through the plan by forcing us to confront the tragic kernel of our self. This confrontation is fueled by our relationship to history whereby the possession or use of nuclear weapons is an acceptable option. Allowing a counterhistory to emerge to challenge the humanistic narrative that circulates around Hiroshima today. </span><br />

<span class="ReadThis"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; text-decoration: none;">The moralization of anxiety takes the form of our lacking ability to confront evil. To displace this anxiety we make ourselves ‘good,’ to protect ourselves from danger. Failure to confront this psychical conflict reifies the original trauma and make the destruction of the self meaningless.</span><br />
