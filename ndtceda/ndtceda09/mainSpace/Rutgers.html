<strong><u>Advantage 1 is Nuclear Colonialism</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The US’ continued exploitation of the islands for nuclear testing and dumping is the highest form of Nuclear Colonialism!

<strong>The systemic nuclear violence waged against indigenous peoples is the worst form of genocide imaginable. It slowly kills a population by causing atrocious birth defects transforming them into disfigured monsters that suffer immensely and then die after a few days. -Johnson, Ekniland and Palacios ‘90</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The plan represents a cultural symbol that causes a discursive and political shift towards reclaiming public spheres of influence for native voices that is key to ending the nuclear colonial of the pacific. -Baldonado ’98</strong><br />

<span class="CardTextReadChar"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><strong><u>Nuclear disarmament can begin …state relations in the coming millennium.</u></strong> </span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>Finally, we must interrogate the status quo notion of “peace” and how it relates to the logic of disposability. Only plan’s critical view of discourse can lead to a true de-militarization of the pacific. -Baldonado ’98</strong> <br />

Thus the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should cancel Compact II and dismantle all military and nuclear installations in the Pacific in order to allow for the self-determination of indigenous peoples.<br />
