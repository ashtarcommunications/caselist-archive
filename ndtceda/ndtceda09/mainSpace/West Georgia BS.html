<strong>Speaking for others as an academic practice ignores mediation that occurs when we try to advocate for the position of the oppressed</strong><br />
<strong>Alcoff 92</strong> Linda, “the problem of speaking for others”<br />
The impetus to speak must be carefully…it is sometimes called for.<br />
<br />
The right to advocate for the oppressed only exists because of privilege<br />
Alcoff 92 <span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
Here is my central point. In order…language, and so on.<br />
</span><br />
Nothing about our arguments deny a material existence or that there is factual oppression occurring—it is always shaped by matrices of power<br />
Alcoff 92 <span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
A plethora of sources have argued…of the same milieu.<br />

Particular demands against oppressive state practies are revolution without a revolution—single issue political organiztion lacks concrete universality, allowing it to be absorbed and reinforce capitalist forces<br />
Zizek 2 <span style="font-weight: normal;">“Revolution at the gates, pg 296-302<br />
So the struggle ahead has no guaranteed…consider breaking out of the constraints of what appears “possible”<br />

The drive for hegemonic imperialism is inevitable according to the logic of capitalism—extinction<br />
Foster 2005 <span style="font-weight: normal;">“Naked Imeralism”<br />
From the longer view offered by a…movement against the new naked imperialism<br />
</span><br />
Liberal tolerance is ultimately futile against the back drop of cap and is violently re appropriated in the form of aggressive fundamentalism<br />
Zizek 99 <span style="font-weight: normal;">The Ticklish subject<br />
This is politics proper the moment in which…the Roman global Empire.<br />
</span><br />
The leftist cultural critique is a diversion from serious class analysis—they reduce class to inequality, instead of a structural antagonism between labor and capital. Aff turns ptx into symbolic contestation over culture, ignoring how the material and class forces shape reality.<br />
Red Critique 6 <span style="font-weight: normal;">“The Opportunism of the Transpatriotic Left”<br />
The ne post-9/11 U.S. “left”…legitimates the free market.<br />
<br />
</span><br />
Empracing experience or standpoint as the basis for epistemology ignores the mediated nature of experience—experience is just another site for articulating the dominant ideology because it ignores the historical continuity of class domination<br />

You should endorse our project of historical totalizing which regonizes the continuity of class domination—the aff is only a temporary resolution to more fundamental contradictions, which serves as a recolonizing strategy for hegemonic imperialism<br />
