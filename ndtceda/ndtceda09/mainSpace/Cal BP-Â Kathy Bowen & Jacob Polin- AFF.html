Jeffrey Lewis, Ph.D., executive director of the Managing the Atom Project at Harvard, author of “Minimum Means of Reprisal,” 9-29-2009. [Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Transcript: Rethinking U.S. Nuclear Posture, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://carnegieendowment.org/files/0929_transcript_nuclear_posture.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://carnegieendowment.org/files/0929_transcript_nuclear_posture.pdf</a>]<br />
So what I really want to focus on today are two efforts to reframe the way we look at the question of extended deterrence, first, on the subject of Japan, and then second on the subject of NATO. It’s worth noting on the subject of Japan, I think the Strategic Posture Commission report, which advocated retaining a cruise missile, which can be deployed on certain U.S. attack submarines, but which is currently in storage – the Strategic Posture Commission got a – got a wish list from the Japanese. And I think if anybody goes and talks to the Japanese, you will get a very similar wish list. And it will start with TLAM-N, this archaic nuclear weapon that the Navy doesn’t want anymore, and it will end up with precision low-yield nuclear warheads. And that’s really quite serious.<br />
