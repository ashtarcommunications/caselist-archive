Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words, contest is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about what is being contested. Resisters, demonstrators, and debaters must have some shared ideas about the subject and/or the terms of their disagreements. The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator's audience must know what is being resisted.

1. Ground-The affirmative team destroys negative ground by only removing a small fraction of US nuclear warheads from subs killing our ability to generate disad links because they can simply link out by saying they don’t remove enough to trigger the link<br />
2. Limits-The affirmative explodes the list of potential affs the neg would have to be prepared for. They justify simply eliminating one model of ICBMs making it impossible for the negative to predict what they will run<br />
3. Resolutional integrity-Their interpretation moots the word substantial in the resolution making the topic meaningless because one word is removable justifying all words being removable.<br />

<u>This debate should be about whether or not the affirmative advocacy is desirable or undesirable. We believe the question of desirability should be resolved by imagining a world in which a plan was adopted and evaluating the consequences of that action. Specifically, the relevant question in this debate is should the United States Federal Government nuclear policy</u><br />
<br />
<u>We also believe the debaters have an obligation to communicate in a clear and persuasive manner and adapt to the judge, just like any public speaker has an obligation to adapt to their audience.</u><br />
<br />
<u>We also believe that all participants in this debate have an obligation to act in a manner consistent with the governing documents of CEDA and the ADA. Specifically, these documents are the CEDA constitution, the ADA constitution, and the ADA standing rules.</u><br />
<br />
<u>We believe our criteria for evaluating this debate is consistent with these documents for the following reasons.</u><br />
<br />
<u>1. Evaluating the consequences of political action promote the educational goals of the organizations</u><br />
<br />
<u>The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion</u><br />

<u>The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must say “no” to- they must reject and limit- some ideas and actions. In what follows, we will also find that they must say “yes” to some thing particular, they must say “yes” to the idea of rational persuasion. This means, first, that they must recognize the role of agreement in political contest, or the basic accord that is necessary to discord. The mistake that the ambiguists make here is a common one. The mistake is in thinking that agreement marks the end of contest—that consensus kills debate. But this is true only if the agreement is perfect—if there is nothing at all left to question or contest.</u><br />
<br />
<u>In most cases, however, our agreements are highly imperfect. We agree on some matters but not on others, on generalities but not on specifics, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And this kind of limited agreement is the starting condition of contest and debate. As John Courtney Murray writes:</u><br />
<br />
<u>We hold certain truths; therefore we can argue about them. It seems to have been one of the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true. There can be no argument except on the premise, and within a context, of agreement. (Murray 1960, 10)</u><br />
<br />
<u>In other words, we cannot argue about something if we are not communicating: if we cannot agree on the topic and terms of argument or if we have utterly different ideas about what counts as evidence or good argument.</u><br />
<br />
<u>At the very least, we must agree about what it is that is being debated before we can debate it. For instance, one cannot have an argument about euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical group. One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one's target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the sitting have no complaints. Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words, contest is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about what is being contested. Resisters, demonstrators, and debaters must have some shared ideas about the subject and/or the terms of their disagreements. The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator's audience must know what is being resisted. In short, the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about intelligibly contesting it. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony</u>.<br />
· This is also supported by the fact that the ADA standing rules require affirmatives to have a plan text and for negatives to present a reason to reject the plan<br />
§ 2. Our vision of debate is flexible, promotes diversity, and promotes the free exchange of ideas. While we advocate evaluating the political consequences of our plan in this debate, each debater has the flexibility to present their advocacy in the way they choose. They can interpret the resolution as a metaphor, , they can use it a mechanism for investigating our own attitudes and the way we talk about nuclear weapons. The consequences of imagining a plan can have many implications and the desirability of a plan should be determined if those consequences are shown to be greater than any alternate consequence or opportunity cost to the affirmative idea.
