Here is a free deterrence card. It's really stupid.<br />
Kovich 09 [Lt Col Andrew S., Nerf Guns and Nuclear Weapons: We Need Less Abolition Talk and More Safety/Security Action, date most recent cited, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.au.af.mil/au/aunews/archive/2010/0502/Articles0502/Kovich0502.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.au.af.mil/au/aunews/archive/2010/0502/Articles0502/Kovich0502.pdf</a>]<br />
The fervor over nuclear abolition that occurs every decade or so is about to end. It’s a nice idea to rid the world of weapons of any kind but when faced with reality, weapons—nuclear or conventional—are unlikely to be eliminated from the face of the Earth. My nine and 12 year old sons already know this to be true. Over the holidays, I tried to place all Nerf dart weapons into one central location so that they could only be used when all family members agreed to participate in a Nerf war. Not surprisingly, guns with their darts were hidden so that one child could have an advantage. Indeed, human nature is such that someone will always want an advantage. With regard to national security, it is imprudent to believe that some members of the international community will never want to exploit such an advantage. In international relations, like in my living room, countries will maintain military capabilities to prevent others from imposing their own self-interests. Nuclear weapons then, are no different from my children’s dart guns. They exist, we need to control their use, and they are unlikely to go away.<br />

 <br />
Our framework: Debate should be a forum for the free expression of all ideas. The only constraints should be against speech which threatens immediate bodily harm to the participations thus making the exchange of ideas impossible.<br />
<br />
Our framework is competitive. The 1AC says debate has to be focused on social justice, we say that all competing claims are welcome. Their method is effectively censorship because we cannot read arguments that oppose social justice. Obviously all debates involve competing arguments and the need to resolve them. The problem is arguments that act as content restrictions. The 1AC and cross-x claims that traditional framework and topicality arguments use forum and censorship as a weapon. So too does the 1AC only with the opposite form of content. The difference is that our framework institutionalizes argument for and against social justice perspectives, allowing a space for the communication of all ideas.<br />
<br />
<strong>Gelber ’00</strong> (Kath, School of Politics and IR – U. New South Wales, “What to do about hate speech: an “institutionalised argumentation” model”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/gelber.rtf" rel="nofollow">http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/gelber.rtf</a>)<br />
In Australia, <u>an example of the harm considered sufficient to warrant government…</u> paper represents a potentially more effective hate speech policy.<br />
<br />
There are three net benefits to our framework –<br />
<br />
First – Side constraint. Free speech must be protected because it is unique as the source of all self-realization and human dignity.<br />
<br />
<strong>Blim ’95</strong> (John, Associate – Holleb &amp; Coff and JD – Northwestern U., Ohio State Law Journal, “Undoing Our Selves: The Error of Sacrificing Speech in the Quest for Equality”, 56 Ohio St. L.J. 427, L/N)<br />
<u>Part II traces the nature of speech to its …external world and deciding how best to live in that world</u>.<br />
<br />
This is particularly true of speech contrary to social justice. Fettering permissible speech diminishes individual self-realization because it denies our ability to construct our identity through words.<br />
<br />
<strong>Blim ’95</strong> (John, Associate – Holleb &amp; Coff and JD – Northwestern U., Ohio State Law Journal, “Undoing Our Selves: The Error of Sacrificing Speech in the Quest for Equality”, 56 Ohio St. L.J. 427, L/N)<br />
The explanation of the self outlined above … inconsistent with the notion of the autonomous self.<br />
<br />
Second – Conflict resolution. Restriction and dialogue are contrary approaches to conflict resolution. Speech limitations reduces conflict resolution to power politics.<br />
<br />
<strong>Heinrichs ’98</strong> (Terry, Associate Prof. Pol. Sci. – York U., Alberta Law Review, “Censorship as Free Speech! Free Expression Values and the Logic of Silencing in R. v. Keegstra”, 36 Alta. L. Rev. 835, L/N)<br />
128 Given the evidence the Court presents, …<strong><u>diverse society would be hard to imagine</u></strong>.<br />
<br />
This is even true if we’re CERTAIN of our own perspectives.<br />

<strong>Heinrichs ’98</strong> (Terry, Associate Prof. Pol. Sci. – York U., Alberta Law Review, “Censorship as Free Speech! Free Expression Values and the Logic of Silencing in R. v. Keegstra”, 36 Alta. L. Rev. 835, L/N)<br />
22 However, <u>even assuming</u> with Dickson C.J. <u>….</u>certainly important and useful to know -- particularly <u>in a democracy</u>.58<br />
<br />
Uniquely true for debate. Our framework is crucial to bridge academia to policy formation. Training debaters to engage argument rather than invoking framework is key preparation for future civic engagement.<br />
<br />
<strong>Pavela ‘6</strong> (Gary, Dir. Judicial Programs – U. Maryland, The Chronicle Review, “Only Speech Codes Should Be Censored”, 53:15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i15/15b01401.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chronicle.com/weekly/v53/i15/15b01401.htm</a>)<br />
<u>We live in a disputatious society</u>. <u>Beyond a few narrowly …</u> tested, reformulated, and revitalized, not turned into stale dogma.<br />
<br />
The impact is extinction. A revitalized public sphere is critical for solving all global problems.<br />
<br />
<strong>Boggs ‘97</strong> (Carl, National University – Los Angeles, Theory and Society, “The great retreat: Decline of the public sphere in latetwentieth-century America”, December, 26:6, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.springerlink.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/content/m7254768m63h16r0/fulltext.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerlink.com.proxy.library.emory.edu/content/m7254768m63h16r0/fulltext.pdf</a>)<br />
The decline of the public sphere in late twentieth-century …interests that had vanished from civil society. 75<br />
<br />
Third – Turns their internal link. Unrestricted speech most effectively confronts racism.<br />

There is a third reason why <u>laws that proscribe racist speech could …</u> approaches for combating racial discrimination.<br />
<br />
No turns. Silencing and false neutrality are arguments IN FAVOR of our framework because free speech is the best way to unmask hidden assumptions. This is an ON POINT answer to their false neutrality and dominant language arguments.<br />
<br />
<strong>Post ’91</strong> (Robert, Prof. Law – UC Berkeley, William &amp; Mary Law Review, “FREE SPEECH AND RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT: RACIST SPEECH, DEMOCRACY, AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT”, 32 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 267, Winter, L/N)<br />

The United States should expand military-to-military exchanges with Russia at operational facilities to include notification of satellite launches and divulging information concerning procedures for control, doctrine and technologies of command and control architecture.

<u>B. Our interpretation is best</u> ---<br />

3. Education --- academics must learn to engage the public’s line of thinking --- abstract moralism without addressing how to get our policies passed is useless.<br />

Case<br />
The K is counterproductive because it finds safety in the strategic planners’ language games. This is the fundamental problem – these language projects provide us with no safety.<br />
Chaloupka ’92 (William Chaloupka, Prof. Pol. Sci. – U. Montana, “Knowing Nukes: The Politics and Culture of the Atom”, p. 19-21.)<br />
We can begin to see the awkward, …works only intermittently, if at all. <em>delkind<br />

The bomb isn’t textual. We need a real political approach to solve it.<br />

Nuclear war is a threat in reality. Obfuscating the danger invites violence.<br />

An invasion of Japan would have cost up to a million casualties. Even hundreds of thousands would be an underestimate.<br />
