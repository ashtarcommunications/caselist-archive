 <strong><u>ACCIDENTS K</u></strong> <br />
<strong>Technology now shapes politics and human life-we can only make sense of things through technology.</strong> <br />
<strong>Adams ‘3</strong> (“Popular defense in the empire of speed: Paul Virilio and the phenomenology of the political body,” November)<br />
“technocracy as the totalitarian replacement of participatory politics…were designed to frustrate revolutionary mobs.”<br />
<br />
<strong>1AC attempts to rationalize life’s inherent irrationality-metaphysical approach and rhetorical justification for the 1AC call to action serves to further obscure accidents and opens the door for violent imperialism.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Smith ‘8</strong> (Jillian, “Tolerating the intolerable, enduring the unendurable: representing the accident in driver’s education films,” <em>Postmodern culture</em>, 19:1, September)<br />
“It emphasizes Freud’s comment that “accumulation…rather has opened multiplicity without end.”<br />
<br />
<strong>1AC is a matter of discipline-think accidents can be avoided only if we could learn to be more rational-debate becomes a training ground, much like driver’s ed, where videos of car crashes compel us to behave less contingently</strong> <br />
<strong>Smith ‘8</strong> (same source)<br />
“The catalog of classroom mental hygiene films reads like a national…breaks-producing its own accident.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Attempting to eliminate uncertainty can only realize its end in one way-self annihilation. As long as we live, we are an object of uncontrollable circumstances, like accidental nuclear war. Witihn the reactive logic which must squash accidents before they can occur, the only solution is to act as subject and bring it about ourselves.</strong> <br />
<strong>Ferguson 84</strong> (Frances, “Nuclear Sublime,” <em>Diacritics</em>, 14:2) <br />
“The intensity, moreover , of the commitment of the sublime to the promotion…to-or object of-conditions, circumstances.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Rather than embracing the re-active force of accident prevention, that nihilistic act of turning force against what it can do in order to negate every potential for difference and becoming – our alternative is to renounce the affirmative and allow the disorganized forces of the accident to remain active, taking force to its limit and affirming that becoming in the process of our own difference – this response in the very moment of active engagement with the accident is of critical important. Hence, we create the exhibit of the open.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Smith ‘8</strong> (same source)<br />
“Virilio wants exhibition of accident to play a role in prevention of accident but…prevents, not the accident, but the ability to endure its possibility.”<br />

<strong>1NR: Perm and spare arguments</strong> <br />
<strong>1NR Perm Args:</strong> <br />
<strong>Form and content are inseperable</strong> <br />
<strong>Bleiker 00</strong> (Roland, <u>Popular Dissent, Huamn Agency, and Glboal Politics</u>, pg. 280-1)<br />
“To recognize that language is…intereferes with such objectifications. ”<br />
<br />
<strong>Perm is still securitizing</strong> <br />
<strong>Connolly ’91</strong> (William, <u>Identity/Difference</u>, pg 29-31)<br />
“With respect to the idea of freedom…dramatize them more cogently.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Attempt to gain understanding of iintent and motive of those who initiate accident is manifestation of imperial drive to cultivate world and eliminate otherness.</strong> <br />
<strong>Stoler ‘8</strong> (Ann, “Epistemic Politics: Ontologies of colonial common sense,” the philosophical forum inc)<br />
“Among those who work on folk epistimics is a concern to account for how we predict, explain…their young, sat, ate, and dressed.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Agreements with Russia=attempt to fuse 2 imperial powers into 1 war machine. Plan text ensures more technological control.</strong> <br />
<strong>Virilio and Lotringer ‘4</strong> (Paul and Sylvere, <u>Pure War</u>, pg 117-119)<br />
“It’s becoming more and more obvious…recent French history. It’s significant.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Turns case-aff submits safety to technology that doesn’t attempt to stop accidents…it actually increases them, because they are necessary for absolute control.</strong>  <br />
<strong>Adams ‘3</strong> (Jason, “Popular defense in the empire of speed: Paul Virilio and the phenomenology of the political body,” November”)<br />
“The threats posed to the grey ecology, as far reaching…organic body of the earth, through methods which we explore below.”<br />

<strong>Kilson ’93</strong> (Martin, “The Gang that Couldn’t Shoot Straight,” <em>Transition</em>, no 62, pg. 217-25)<br />

The condition afflicting us all in the epoch of late capitalism is constant movement from place to place<br />
Jameson 84, “Postmodernism or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism”, The New Left Review, 146. July-August<br />
Now I want to say a few words…we find ourselves caught as individual subjects<br />
<br />
always the same question - simple card game - we are playing war - mead khalilzad citations refrences a world not necessary - we escape turn debate into post modern<br />
Schnurer, 03 (Maxwell, “Gaming as Control: Will to Power, the Prison of Debate, and a Game Called Potlacth”, Contemporary Argument and Debate, 24. September 2003<br />
The big question is: does gaming contribute to these…debate realm – not to become poets.<br />
<br />

Terms of competitive equity swirl around frantically, as shanahan said<br />
Bill Shanahan, Deleted Scenes, “Debate Team (The Documentary).<br />
<br />
I don’t know if you heat it…which is, I think, magical.”<br />

The 1ac invites us in – position of negative is reduced to a scapegoat<br />
Bergoffen, Debra<br />

We Agree with the 1AC – we approach debate otherwise. We debate as critique-critique as a verb<br />
Immanuel Kant. Critique of Judgement Section 74 1790<br />
<br />
We deal with a concept…anything about its object<br />
<br />
This means attending to those halls and spaces in between<br />
