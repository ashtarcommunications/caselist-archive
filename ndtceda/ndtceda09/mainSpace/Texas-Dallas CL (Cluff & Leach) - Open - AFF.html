 Thus, we affirm the resolution as a means of confronting the nuclear catastrophe and refusing the reactionary politics of self-defense which underwrite the national security complex: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
This affirmation is an act of engaging in agonistic democracy as an alternative to security politics – affirming the inevitable instability of life allows us to re-conceive politics as a contingent means for the enhancement of human potential rather than the universal suppression of difference.<br />
