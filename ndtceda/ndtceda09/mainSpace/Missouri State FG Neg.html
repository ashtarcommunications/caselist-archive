“not long ago, the term….of fictitious black Egyptians” <br />
<br />
Nuclear Psych is wrong<br />
Gusterson 98<br />
“The psychological critique consists…. Rather than psychiatric labeling” <br />
<br />

<br />
Testing solves health consequences<br />

Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
Hiroshima K<br />
<br />
The affs call for foregrounding Hiroshima is reappropriated and is an active form of forgetting the war crimes of imperial Japan <br />
Okuda 8 <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">“remembering the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki:collective memory of postwar Japan”</span><br />
“These different types of writing…japanese collective identity <br />
<br />
The alt is reject narrow historical focus on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in favor of remembering and mourning WWII. Their myopic focus causes the historical forgetting of imperial japans warcrimes that were 150 times worse than Hiroshima and Nagasaki—K is a prereq <br />
Gruhl 7 “it’s time to acknowledge that Hiroshima followed imperial japan’s decision to launch a terrible war onits neighbors” <br />
“The fate of Hiroshima cannot be judged without…we cannot forget”<br />
<br />
Retreat K<br />
<br />
Their activist reaction to deliberation lacks epistemic modesty—it engages in a form of knowledge production which replicates unjustice <br />
Talisse 6<br />
“that young’s activist is not reasonable in this sense…insofar as the activist denies this, he is unreasonable”<br />
<br />
Their attempt to sidestep the costs and benefits of policy implementation is the link—demonstrates their orientation toward their project lacks seriousness <br />
Issac 2 <br />
“politics is about ends and means—about…in which these activists live.”<br />
<br />
The retreat to local concerns enables unsolved global problems to assure extinction—their antipolitics solves nothing, but emptying space enables authoritarian reactions<br />
Boggs 97<br />
“The decline of the public sphere in the late… vanished from civil society”<br />
<br />
Alternative is to embrace the risks associated with implementation<br />
Rule 2010<br />
“in a dangerous world, any source… far more alarming” <br />
<br />
This serious political commitment provides the only hope to avoid the worst impacts and the internal links to their offence<br />
Issac 2 <br />
“second, it would mean frankly acknowledging…serious political commitment” <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Block Strategy:<br />
2NC kicked out of Hiroshima K and went for Retreat K and case args <br />
1NR said 6 min of FW <br />
<br />
2NC<br />
AT Perm: <br />
1AC foregrounding of theory was elitist, displaying a contempt which negates the perm<br />
Jarvis 2k<br />
“more is the pity that such irrational…and recondite debate” <br />
<br />
Although deliberation may include sub-national sites, their attempt to withdraw entirely fromone site forecloses the entire concept <br />
Talisse 6 <br />
“Part of the response to the first challenge is offered by…has to take many forms”<br />
<br />
Attempts to distinguish their academic from political action endorses retreat—even if the line itself is valid, the way they USE the line is alink—perms present an alibi<br />
Johnston 7<br />
“however, the absence of this type of…there is still much to be done” <br />
<br />
Their arg assumes private/public are stable catagories such that finding the words is somehow a link—we say they are fractal and thus fundamental to thought and dialogue despite changing in content<br />
Gal 2<br />
“For instance, in a discussion of the East…differentiation and cultural innovation”<br />
<br />
<br />
