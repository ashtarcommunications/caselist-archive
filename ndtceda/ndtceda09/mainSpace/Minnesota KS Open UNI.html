Minnesota KS Neg<br />
<br />
The USFG should engage the Russian Federation in negotiations over the phased withdrawal of air-deliverable nuclear forces. The USFG will offer to withdraw its tactical nuclear weapons from Eurpoe as part of the second state of the process after data exchange and the negotiation of a verification protocol<br />
Need phased approach to tactical weapons withdrawal- too fast fails, should withdraw during second stage of negotiations, solves risk and jumpstarts arms controls-<br />
Lampert and Miller, 1997 (Stephen and David, “Russia’s crumbling tactical nuclear weapons complex: an opportunity for arms control” INSS Occasional Paper n. 12) the multi-phased approach. Arms control… implementing the ANF regime<br />
<br />
European tnw have enourmous political value, very volatile issue- removal undermines risk sharing substantially weakens NATO alliance<br />
Millar 2003 (Alistair, “Russia NATO Tactical Nuclear Weapons After 11 September,” Tactical nuclear weapons: emergent threats in an envolving security envirment) proposals and agreements… public awareness and concern<br />
<br />
Collapse cause multiple escaltory wars-<br />
Duffield, 1994 (political science quarterly, 109 pg. 766-767) initial analysis of nato’s… existence of nuclear weapons<br />

Minnesota KS- Against K-State DR<br />
<br />
A Spec-<br />
1. They have to specify their agent.<br />
2. Standards- Aff conditionality. Resolution basis. Plan Text is key.<br />
3. Voter for fairness.<br />
<br />
T- Substantially<br />
A- Interp- USFG is the actor defined by the resolution. US Gov website 2009.<br />
The three branches…branches.<br />
B-Violation- The aff doesn’t use the USFG.<br />
C-Standards. Ground, revolutionarily, USFG key.<br />
D- Voters for fairness, education, jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
Fairplay Shell-<br />
The aff must defend a topical plan or advocacy statement.<br />
There are infinite ways to defend a topical plan without reproducing problematic norms.<br />
Starting point rules destroys the value of adovacy and the pedagogical potential of the game.<br />
Violates the non consensual reciprocacity: Armstorng in 2002.<br />
The Ideal polls of play…and determining.<br />
We co-opt their offence because rules inspire creativity.<br />
Armstorng in 2002.<br />
Since these rules limits…their interactions.<br />
<br />
Thus: We propose that the best model for play allows pre-formed rules to establish limits, but offer radical originality within, between, and upon these rules.<br />
This provides a model for social power. Armstrong in 2002. “the Politics of play, The Social Implication of Iser’s Aesthetic Theory.”<br />
On the other hand…ethical use of Power.<br />
<br />
Predictable Research outweights their turns:<br />
Sarratore in 99.<br />
The design games…controls the project.<br />
<br />
Zieck<br />
Calling on people to refashion themselves for an idea study neglect reifies flawed assumptions.<br />
Barratt in 1993- The assumption of…establishment.
