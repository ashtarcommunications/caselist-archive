The role of our nuclear weapons arsenal is not only external deterrence, it’s also an internal deterrent to the subjects of the state --- our own interests are pre-informed by logics that dehumanize us into passive populations of victims held hostage to our political forms by the nuclear state’s ability to realize and project a Doomsday Imaginary --- revolutionary change such as the French/American/whatever revolution are rendered impossible by the unopposability of this new state form.</span><br />

<em>“Albert <strong>Einstein signed the letter</strong>. Years later he would regret it, calling it the one mistake he had made in his life. But in August 1939, Adolf <strong>Hitler’s armies already occupied Czechoslovakia and Austria and his fascist thugs were arresting Jews and political opponents</strong></em> throughout the Third Reich. <strong><em>Signing the letter seemed vital.</em></strong> <em><strong>His friends and fellow physicists, Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner, had drafted the note he would now send to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</strong> The <strong>scientists had seen their excitement over the recent breakthrough discoveries of the deepest secrets of the atom turn to fear as they realized</strong> what unleashing atomic energies could mean. Now <strong>the danger could not be denied. The Nazis might be working on a super-weapon; they had to be stopped.&quot;</strong></em><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This “Bomb Scare” frames the discursive space of nuclear weapons in a way that reveals the political black hole of this year’s resolution: one that haunts all political subjects, whether in the halls of policymaking, the public square of society, or the academia of the debate community. Characteristic of this gap in knowledge are the cultural axiomatics such as American exceptionalism and free-market capitalism which brought into being the nuclear weapon’s articulation. In this way, the American creation of the nuclear weapon ushered in a juridical fascism's disciplinary power surrounding the control of nuclear weapons, and the new benchmark of the biopolitical process in the nuclear weapon's destructive capabilities. The “Punishment from Heaven” described by the Japanese as being delivered by American bomb crews to Hiroshima on August 6th was the U.S. capitalist response to the “radical fascism” of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. The radioactive halo over Hiroshima may have marked the dominant historical understanding’s “end” to the Second World War, but </span>failed to vanquish the fascism that was the object of its creation, instead only assisting in its smoother function under a benevolent new appearance.<br />

functions with the aid of two strata: the scale of destruction offered by the nuclear weapon and the axiomatic systems that find their moment of creation in the state’s total regulation of that weapon. The scale of destruction offered by can be understood as the biopolitical implications of their destructive properties, and the juridical authority that the State comes to wield over the regulation, even articulation of the nuclear weapon in the form of treaties such as the NPT, CTBT, and FMCT could be understood as the disciplinary power of totalitarianism that re-creates the double pincer of God: no subject may be free, the State, “god, as lobster” will always exert the power to discipline or destroy you. Caught between these pincers, we must ask, “Is there no way to resist? Is politics even possible? How might we resist this totalitarianism? Think as an example Rosa Parks: not the first person ever to refuse to change seats on a bus, but her action had revolutionary aspects consistent with the context of what could be called ‘the beginning’ of the Civil Rights Movement. An affirmation of the resolution is not a telos but instead a necessary predicate to produce the conditions for new statements, a collective undertaking that would span generations in the name of a people to come. The judge signing the ballot affirmative is an act of political irruption that establishes itself as a resistance to fascism and the apparatus of capture that has justified the violent repression of the present. [Surin 2006 (Kenneth, Deleuze and the Contemporary World 70-72)]<br />
<br />
<strong>1AC Act IV: Mar 25, 1945</strong><br />
(One of Einstein’s last letters to FDR concerned that military and political imperatives had overshadowed the judgment and research of science, coopting it in the mission to create a hegemonic nuclear state. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/correspondence/einstein-albert/corr_einstein_1945-03-25.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/library/correspondence/einstein-albert/corr_einstein_1945-03-25.htm</a> )<br />
<br />
We must make a distinction: we do not accept the existence of a State as given. We begin our understanding of the State as nothing more than one political form. We find fault with the State because it has always posited its necessity after the fact. (ATP, pg 352) Instead of engaging in some competition of political forms, we wish to ask whether politics is even possible now. (Pause) A visitor to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., after experiencing all the phenomenology of the holocaust, is confronted by a video of former president Bill Clinton, making the argument that to prevent the recurrence of such evil, the strong sovereign state is our only defense. This is bullshit, because the Nazis were the state, and proved the State itself is the condition of possibility for such violence as the Holocaust, even as the State posits its necessity to prevent the violent actions it relies upon for its sovereignty. This vicious cycle contributes to a smoother function of a fascist system that is established prior to desire itself, making us desire the types of forces which bring about the next Holocaust --- as the boys note,<br />
<br />
<em><strong>We started with the idea that desire must not be conceived as a subjective superstructure that is more or less occluded. Desire never stops investing history, even in its darkest periods. The German masses had come to desire Nazism. After Wilhelm Reich, we cannot avoid coming to grips with this fact. Under certain conditions, the desire of the masses can turn against their own interests. What are those conditions? That is the question.</strong></em> (Deleuze, Desert Islands, 217)<br />
<br />
Ironically, this statist fascism is in a sense the ultimate impact: pure destruction and abolition, leading to the suicide of the State and its constituents. (Deleuze and Guattari ’87 pg. 230-231) It’s a world in which we’re not only incapable of recognizing the totalitarian control that the State has come to exert over us as political subjects, but in which we come to desire that control through the death of ourselves and others.<br />
Modern discourse surrounding focuses on several of the catastrophic fears associated with its destructive powers. These fears circle around nuclear terrorism, so called ‘nuclear rogue-states’ and the possibility of ‘miscalculation’. The state posits itself as the best defense against all these threats by claiming to possess order with the sovereign power to protect its citizens and discipline those who transgress its order. (See examples from the presidential debates, most speeches by the Bushes, etc )<br />
One must challenge why the state posits itself as the best defense when the state has only contributed to the function of such violent events as the Cold War, and bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is even more pressing, dare we say it, necessary, to think the question as William Haver and Deleuze do, and ask, “what of these threats, but what of others that the state has not only refused to defend against, but instead has improved upon, producing a world where various holocausts become actualized, normative, and accepted by us, “the masses.”<br />
<br />
<em>(William Haver, “TBOTD” pg 7 – “<strong>the AIDS pandemic totalizes in an integrated viral relationality, at least possibly, otherwise heterogeneous (or even heteronomous) “elements.” AIDS unites such “elements” in the totality of an annihilation-in-common, in a technological mass death, in utter nihility. In effect, AIDS is a holocaust; in that this holocaust bespeaks totality-as-utter-nihility, it belongs to the order of other holocaust, actualized or merely promised, such as nuclear terror, ecological disaster, and previous (or concurrent) genocides. I do not think there is any possibility for a consequent thinking with regard to the AIDS pandemic without this thought of totalization, any more than there is with regard to nuclear terror, ecological disaster, or other genocides. But in each case, such a totality must be thought of as a totality present only in its material effects. In other words, there is a totalization at work here, but because the totality as such is only present in its effects, it is by that token absent for consciousness and knowing; the “global” here, then, marks the thought of a material effectivity</strong>.”)</em><br />
<br />
It is important to remember, on the other hand, another impact story. These harms are, in plainest terms, a matter of ethics. The concepts of ethical action and decision calculus one nowadays approaches a question of ethics with the question of whether they “should” do something. The aff’s understanding of ethics would cease to ask the question ‘what does it mean’ in order to ask whether one ‘should’ do something, and instead ask the question ‘what does it do’ in order to ask whether one can do something. As Ronald Bogue argues, if there is any ethical duty whatsoever it is to intercede on behalf of the capacity for affectivity. We must construct along a plane of immanence to show that ‘I’ and ‘other’ are no longer fixed entities, but points of emergence within becoming. We must call for a people to come—one that is eternally minor, taken up in a becoming-revolutionary. [Bogue 2007 (Ronald, Deleuze’s Way 12-14)]<br />
In order to escape a representational logic that precludes all other possibilities, our affirmation reads <strong><u>resolved: the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and substantially reduce and restrict the role and missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal</u></strong> as an aphorism, a text that challenges one to find the forces that contribute to its meaning as well as hook the text up to the force that gives it meaning, or create a new one. Deleuze and Guattari cite Nietzsche, saying:<br />
<br />
<strong><em>“if you want to know what I mean, find the force that gives what I say meaning, and a new meaning if need be. Hook the text up to this force. In this way, there are no problems of interpretation for Nietzsche, there are only problems of machining: to machine Nietzsche's text, to find out which actual external force will get something through, like a current of energy.</em></strong> (Desert Islands, 256)<br />
<br />
<strong>1AC: ACT iX - ?/??/??</strong><br />
This historicization of the nuclear weapon establishes its contingency and attempts to account for its existence in relation to the Refrain that has preceded and since followed it into the current epoch --- participation in this refrain is in preparation for a people to come that allow for a revolutionary understanding of the nuclear bomb as an idea : thus we contend---<br />
<br />
<strong>1:</strong> That the nuclear weapon’s existence was radically contingent upon the forces of capitalism and fascism that contributed to its articulation as an object and as a weapon.<br />
<strong>2:</strong> The creative and destructive forces at work prior to the decision to harness the energies of the atom and tie them to the State in nuclear weapons embody a radical deterritorialization of thought.<br />
<strong>3:</strong> In each debate round, from jump street, in the interim between when the timer starts and the judge signs the ballot, there is a deterritorialization of thought because of the radical possibilities of what can take place in that space.<br />
<br />
The act of casting the ballot affirmative is a reterritorializing act insofar as it demarcates and draws out a 'result' from deterritorialized space but this is only an ancillary effect of the refrain in which the affirmation participates. Our contentions above all participate in and are aspects of a Refrain (ATP 312). This refrain is the little rhythms of thought that contribute to the coming revolution of thought, of knowledge, of politics and the possibility of all three. To think of it one way, at the end of each round, the judge votes, in the same sense that the bird sings, the wolf shits, the human being communicates and/or moves (ATP 312). The bird's song is essential to its 'birdiness' just as the wolf's shits that mark its territory is inseperable from its 'wolf-ness'. To extend the metaphor, voting is essential to 'debaty-ness'. A refrain is aspects of an event or experience that create a territory - the bird sings, the wolf shits, the human communicates. However, our affirmation is of a particular type of refrain insofar as instead of only casting a territory or imagining a world, it recognizes the contingency of the existence of the nuclear weapon the way WE envision it, which has all the attendant effects of revealing the fascist system in an effort to produce ideas that disrupt its smooth function. This refrain is performed to disrupt this smooth function and produce new ideas, concepts and tools. We affirm the resolution but it's not a matter of signing a bill into law --- us talking about it in this context, at this moment alters the way nuclear weapons function within debate. To think of it another way, an affirmation disrupts the apparatus of the state by disrupting the way nuclear weapons function in discourse; this disruption reveals the fascism that relies on nuclear weapons, and allows us to establish new praxis against that fascism by refusing to accept its status as normative.<br />

<strong>This becomes significant as the ontological position of human beings is a prior question to its relationship to nuclear weapons. The prioritization of survival and the avoidance of technological destruction over the uniqueness of Being damns humanity to annihilation.</strong><br />

<strong>Ontology also shapes all knowledge of politics --- the normative focus on particularism renders us ontologically blind, but the debate space we’re presented with here offers a unique opportunity to acknowledge that debate isn’t neutral, it’s fundamentally political.</strong><br />

Perhaps the most important development ... modernity, has begun to come under sustained scrutiny.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The impact to this is twofold. First, the status quo engagement in this technological mindset is what makes nuclear war and environmental catastrophe possible. Our affirmation frustrates and confronts this sort of calculative thought that exists in the status quo which thwarts value to life and makes omnicidal extinction inevitable and meaningless</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">What is most illustrative is often ... it forgetfulness of 'the mystery'. </span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The second is concerned with value to life. In the technological age all understanding of Being becomes stripped by calculative thought. This outweighs any threat posed by nuclear weapons as a loss of Being cannot be overcome resulting in the very omnicidal doom that our McWhorter evidence speaks to.</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
The same mindset that justifies calculations is the same that allow for unspeakable acts of violence and holocaust to occur by justifying the exclusions of being lost in the standing reserve. This loss of Being and value to life becomes the most significant impact in the round.<br />

<strong>Thus we stand resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>We are resolved in our relationship to the topic – the topic wording is not a will to be imposed but instead must be open to possibilities.

<em>----Joseph Ciricione, 2007 (Joseph Cirincione, &quot;Bomb Scare: The History and Future of Nuclear Weapons&quot; pg 1)====</em><br />
“Albert <strong>Einstein signed the letter</strong>. Years later he would regret it, calling it the one mistake he had made in his life. But in August 1939, Adolf <strong>Hitler’s armies already occupied Czechoslovakia and Austria and his fascist thugs were arresting Jews and political opponents throughout the Third Reich. Signing the letter seemed vital.</strong> <strong>His friends and fellow physicists, Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner, had drafted the note he would now send to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</strong> The <strong>scientists had seen their excitement over the recent breakthrough discoveries of the deepest secrets of the atom turn to fear as they realized</strong> what unleashing atomic energies could mean. Now <strong>the danger could not be denied. The Nazis might be working on a super-weapon; they had to be stopped.&quot;<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">[[#_ftn1|</span></strong>[1]<strong>]]</strong><br />
<em><strong>This “Bomb Scare” frames the discursive space of nuclear weapons in a way that reveals the political black hole of this year’s resolution</strong>: one that haunts all political subjects, whether in the halls of policymaking, the public square of society, or the academia of the debate community. Characteristic of this gap in knowledge are the cultural axiomatics such as American exceptionalism and free-market capitalism which brought into being the nuclear weapon’s articulation</em>. In this way, <em><strong>the American creation of the nuclear weapon ushered in a nasty trifecta: a juridical fascism’s disciplinary power surrounding the control of nuclear weapons, the new benchmark of the biopolitical process in the nuclear weapon’s destructive capabilities, both of which are puppeteered by the royal science of Capital.</strong> The “Punishment from Heaven” described by the Japanese as being delivered by American bomb crews to Hiroshima on August 6th was the U.S. capitalist response to the “radical fascism” of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan. The radioactive halo over Hiroshima may have marked the dominant historical understanding’s “end” to the Second World War, but failed to vanquish the fascism that was the object of its creation, instead only assisting in its smoother function under a benevolent new appearance.<br />
<strong>One result of this new form of totalitarianism Foucault argues has been the shift on</strong> <strong>the part of the state apparatus to force the war machine to take war itself as an object --- that governments no longer go to war temporarily over territory or material wealth but rather permanently in the name of stopping war itself.</strong><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 200%;">(</span></strong> You know, that Foucault 78 card.) We also see this rhetoric in each conflict the U.S. has entered into since WWII, claiming to be intervening in the “interest of peace, freedom, and justice” in Vietnam, Iraq, Bosnia, Somalia, Pakistan even as we bomb into oblivion the condition of possibility for all three.<br />

<strong>Deleuze and Guattari argue that contained within the political forms we are familiar with today lies the ultimate incarnation of the “double pincer, a double bind,” which functions with the aid of two strata: the scale of destruction offered by the nuclear weapon and the axiomatic systems that find their moment of creation in the state’s total regulation of that weapon.</strong> The scale of destruction offered by nuclear weapons can be understood as the biopolitical implications of their destructive properties, and the juridical authority that the State comes to wield over the regulation, even articulation of the nuclear weapon in the form of treaties such as the NPT, CTBT, and FMCT could be understood as the disciplinary power of totalitarianism that re-creates the double pincer of God: no subject may be free, the State, “god, as lobster” will always exert the power to discipline or destroy you. Caught between these pincers, we must ask, “Is there no way to resist? Is politics even possible? How might we resist this totalitarianism? <strong>In response to the conditions of the status quo, an affirmation of the 1AC is a reterritorializing act that participates in a Refrain whose existence contributes to the radical possibilities of a new form of politics.</strong> Think as an example Rosa Parks: not the <em>first</em> person ever to refuse to change seats on a bus, but her action had revolutionary aspects consistent with the context of what could be called ‘the beginning’ of the Civil Rights Movement. An affirmation of the resolution is not a telos but instead a necessary predicate to produce the conditions for new statements, a collective undertaking that would span generations in the name of a people to come. <strong>The judge signing the ballot affirmative is an act of political irruption that establishes itself as a resistance to fascism and the apparatus of capture that has justified the violent repression of the present. ---</strong>Surin 2006 (Kenneth, Deleuze and the Contemporary World 70-72)<br />

<strong>We must make a distinction: we do not accept the existence of a State as given.</strong> We begin our understanding of the State as nothing more than one political form. We find fault with the State because it has always posited its necessity after the fact. (ATP, pg 352) Instead of engaging in some competition of political forms, we wish to ask whether politics is even possible now. (Pause) A visitor to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., after experiencing all the phenomenology of the holocaust, is confronted by a video of former president Bill Clinton, making the argument that to prevent the recurrence of such evil, the strong sovereign state is our only defense. This is bullshit, because the Nazis were the state, and proved <em>the State itself</em> is the condition of possibility for such violence as the Holocaust, even as the State posits its necessity to prevent the violent actions it relies upon for its sovereignty. This vicious cycle contributes to a smoother function of a fascist system that is established prior to desire itself, making us desire the types of forces which bring about the next Holocaust --- as the boys note,<br />
“It is curious that <strong><u>from the very beginning the Nazis announced to Germany what they were bringing: at once wedding bells and death, including their own death, and the death of the Germans. They thought they would perish but that their undertaking would be resumed, all across Europe, all over the world, throughout the solar system. And the people cheered, not because they did not understand, but because they wanted that death through the death of others.</u></strong>” ( Deleuze and Guattari ’87 pg. 291-292)<br />
<br />
<strong>This statist fascism is the ultimate impact: pure destruction and abolition, leading to the suicide of the State and its constituents.</strong><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 200%;"> (</span></strong><em><strong>Deleuze and Guattari ’87 pg. 230-231 )</strong></em> <strong>It’s a world in which we’re not only incapable of recognizing the totalitarian control that the State has come to exert over us as political subjects, but in which we come to</strong> <em><strong>desire</strong></em> <strong>that control through the death of ourselves and others.</strong><br />
<strong>Modern discourse surrounding nuclear weapons focuses on several of the catastrophic fears associated with its destructive powers</strong>. These fears circle around nuclear terrorism, so called ‘nuclear rogue-states’ and the possibility of ‘miscalculation’. The state posits itself as the best defense against all these threats by claiming to possess order with the sovereign power to protect its citizens and discipline those who transgress its order. <strong>One must challenge why the state posits itself as the best defense when the state has only contributed to the function of such violent events as the Cold War, and bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is even more pressing, dare we say it,</strong> <em><strong>necessary</strong></em>, to think the question as William Haver and Deleuze do, and ask, “what of these threats, but what of others that the state has not only refused to defend against, but instead has improved upon, producing a world where various holocausts become actualized, normative, and accepted by us, “the masses.”<br />
William Haver, “TBOTD” pg 7 – “the AIDS pandemic totalizes in an integrated viral relationality, at least possibly, otherwise heterogeneous (or even heteronomous) “elements.” AIDS unites such “elements” in the totality of an annihilation-in-common, in a technological mass death, in utter nihility. In effect, AIDS is a holocaust; in that this holocaust bespeaks totality-as-utter-nihility, it belongs to the order of other holocaust, actualized or merely promised, such as nuclear terror, ecological disaster, and previous (or concurrent) genocides. I do not think there is any possibility for a consequent thinking with regard to the AIDS pandemic without this thought of totalization, any more than there is with regard to nuclear terror, ecological disaster, or other genocides. But in each case, such a totality must be thought of as a totality present only in its material effects. In other words, there is a totalization at work here, but because the totality as such is only present in its effects, it is by that token absent for consciousness and knowing; the “global” here, then, marks the thought of a material effectivity.”<br />
<strong>It is important to remember, on the other hand, another alternate impact story. These harms are, in plainest terms, a matter of ethics. The concepts of ethical action and decision calculus become radically different in the context of this affirmation –</strong> one nowadays approaches a question of ethics with the question of whether they “should” do something<strong>. The aff’s understanding of ethics would cease to ask the question ‘what does it mean’ in order to ask whether one ‘should’ do something, and instead ask the question ‘what does it</strong> <em><strong>do</strong></em><strong>’ in order to ask whether one <em>can</em> do something. As Ronald Bogue argues, if there is any ethical duty whatsoever it is to intercede on behalf of the capacity for affectivity. We must construct along a plane of immanence to show that ‘I’ and ‘other’ are no longer fixed entities, but points of emergence within becoming. We must call for a people to come—one that is eternally minor, taken up in a becoming-revolutionary.</strong> <em><strong>Bogue 2007 (Ronald, Deleuze’s Way 12-14)</strong></em> <strong>In order to escape a representational logic that precludes all other possibilities, our affirmation reads the resolution as an aphorism, a text that challenges one to find the forces that contribute to its meaning as well as hook the text up to the force that gives it meaning, or create a new one</strong>. Deleuze and Guattari cite Nietzsche, saying:<br />
“if you want to know what I mean, find the force that gives what I say meaning, and a new meaning if need be. Hook the text up to this force. In this way, there are no problems of interpretation for Nietzsche, there are only problems of machining: to machine Nietzsche's text, to find out which actual external force will get something through, like a current of energy.<span style="font-size: 12pt;">(Deleuze, Desert Islands, 256)</span><br />

<a name="_Toc240888042"></a><br />
This historicization of the nuclear weapon establishes its contingency and attempts to account for its existence in relation to the refrain that preceded and has since followed it into the current epoch --- participation in this refrain is in preparation for a people to come that allow for a revolutionary understanding of the nuclear bomb as an idea: thus we contend---<br />
<strong>1: That the nuclear weapon’s existence was radically contingent upon the forces of capitalism and fascism that contributed to its articulation as an object and as a weapon.</strong><br />
<strong>2: The creative and destructive forces at work prior to the decision to harness the energies of the atom and tie them to the State in nuclear weapons embody a radical deterritorialization of thought.</strong><br />
<strong>3: In each debate round, from jump street, in the interim between when the timer starts and the judge signs the ballot, there is a deterritorialization of thought because of the radical possibilities of what can take place in that space.</strong><br />
The act of casting the ballot affirmative is a reterritorializing act insofar as it demarcates and draws out a ‘result’ from deterritorialized space but this is only an ancillary effect of the refrain in which the affirmation participates. Our contentions above all participate in and are aspects of a Refrain. (ATP 312)This refrain is the little rhythms of thought that contribute to the coming revolution of thought, of knowledge, of politics and the possibility of all three. To think of it one way, at the end of each round, the judge votes, in the same sense that the bird sings, the wolf shits, the human being communicates and/or moves.<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 200%;">(ATP 312)</span> The bird’s song is <em>essential</em> to its ‘birdiness’ just as the wolf’s shits to mark its territory is essential to its ‘wolfiness’. Thus, voting is essential to ‘debatyness’ A refrain is aspects of an event or experience that create a territory- the bird sings, the wolf shits, the human communicates. However, our affirmation is of a particular type of refrain insofar as instead of only casting a territory or imagining a world, it recognizes the contingency of the existence of the nuclear weapon the way WE envision it, which has all the attendant effects of revealing the fascist system in an effort to produce ideas that disrupt its smooth function. This refrain is performed to disrupt this smooth function and produce new ideas, practical ideas, new concepts and tools. This means we get to say we affirm the resolution, but it's not a matter of signing a bill into law, but us talking about it in this context, at this moment alters the way nuclear weapons function within debate<strong>. To think of it another way, an affirmation disrupts the apparatus of the state by disrupting the way nuclear weapons function in discourse; this disruption reveals the fascism that relies on nuclear weapons, and allows us to establish new praxis against that fascism by refusing to accept its status as normative.</strong><br />
