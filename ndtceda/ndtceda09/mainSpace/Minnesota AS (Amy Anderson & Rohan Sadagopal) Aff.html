The United States federal government should adopt a nuclear posture with no nuclear weapons on high alert.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 – Accidents<br />
<br />
SCENARIO 1 is the US ARSENAL<br />
<br />
FIRST, we’ll win five internal links —<br />
Short decision windows<br />
Human error<br />
Tech failure<br />
Cyber attack<br />
Rogue commanders<br />
<br />
