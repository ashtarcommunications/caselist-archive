Our aff is written and performed in a narrative format that would be difficult to transfer here so I am giving a brief explanation of it. If you have any further questions, feel free to e-mail me at michael_ely16@yahoo.com.<br />
<br />
We start the discussion of the affirmative in reference to another round where everyone was masturbating. This opens a discussion for production versus anti-production where we compare masturbation as an anti-productive act that doesn't yield intensities or creativity as opposed to sex which produces connections and breaks. We continue the discussion by stating that these debaters where just building a story tracing the existence of the united states' nuclear arsenal in a metonymic relationship to the social sphere (socius). We say that that structure is a bad form of politics because it plans out the future making a genealogy. This structure is only taken into account in the external, we say that we should have a micropolitical politics of desire. Our method is schizoanalysis. We also put in a discussion of the fear of death. We say that there is not a distinction between life and death, but rather we are in a constant stage of becoming. We perceive the 1ac as a minor text that challenges the dominant narrative of the nuclear arsenal.<br />

Our sources are as follows:<br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Felix Guattari. The illest mother fucker around. “The Anti-Oedipus Papers.” 1970. Edited by: Stephane Nadaud. Translated by: Kelina Gotman. Semiotexte Publishing, 2006. ISBN: 1-58435-031-8. </span><br />
<span style="color: black;">Pg.153 Pg.232-235. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Pg.311-312. </span><br />
This is where most of our literature base from the 1ac comes from.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: black;"><br />
The Joker a.k.a. Heath Ledger</span><br />
This is not a large portion of our aff, it is one line from the dark knight where he is talking about why plans are bad and anti-productive. It is the scene from the hospital where he is talking to Harvey Dent.<br />

This is the portion where we are talking about the fear of death.<br />
<br />
Generally we will use evidence from Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus later in the debate which were written by Deleuze and Guattari. We make quite a few sex jokes, feel free to laugh at them or not.<br />

Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg make up the majority of the 1AC.<br />
No, wait, I mean Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari.<br />
Well, same difference.<br />
Everywhere I look, everyone I meet, I see the same triangles: bombers, subs, ICBM's; aff, neg, resolution; UCO, Kansas, critic; mommy-daddy-me. It's the same triangles over and over again, and Deleuze and Guattari and Ginsberg and Dylan and Artaud and Colombat and Zupancic and Ephron and Edmiston and Billy the kid have all been thrown to the analyst's couch, locked into this mommy-daddy-me triangle where they're indistinguishable, driven to madness, starving, hysterical naked<br />
after they<br />
threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently <br />
presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with <br />
shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instanta- <br />
neous lobotomy, <br />
and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity <br />
hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong &amp; am- <br />

Anything to make them blend in, to make them belong, disappear, and die. Because we can't have a schizophrenic like Bob Dylan or Allen Ginsberg - much less Deleuze and Guattari - running around. This is the sort of death we experience constantly in life, the &quot;I&quot; subsumed under the &quot;we&quot;, the individual negated for the collective. We think the better way out is death. That is, not the collective death we were just discussing, but a very specific death which nevertheless concerns this collective death so maybe we are thinking <em>death</em> when we mean death ...<br />
Either way, we affirm the individual death by which the I is destroyed to become something new. In terms of the resolution, this means affirming the minor text of the 1AC to break up the major text of the nuclear triad/triangle.<br />
