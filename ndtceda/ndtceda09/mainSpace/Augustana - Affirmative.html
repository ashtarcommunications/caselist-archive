Plan: The United States federal government should eliminate all roles and missions of the United States' nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki mark a special place in history not only as the first use of atomic bombs, but also the inauguration of the atomic age. Today we live under the threat of nuclear annihilation, nuclear winter, and omnicide of life on earth. This path is by no means inevitable. Against the will to domination and instrumental reason of totality we should embrace a global ethics of responsibility.<br />

We will show…a further choice.<br />
<br />
The thought that war is everywhere turns politics into the art of foreseeing war and winning it by any means. This thought is implicated in war and complicit with its perpetuation. This politics is self-destructive, using war to overcome war, and culminates in the destruction of every possible action, nuclear warfare- sacrifice for the sake of sacrifice. Even peace becomes implicated in war as armed peace. Individuals are reduced to totality and become implicated in the logic of sacrifice of the present for some future objective meaning. But the claim to totality in war is always frustrated by an other or enemy. Ethics must be superimposed upon the ontology of war.<br />
Caygill; 2; Levinas and the Political; p. 103-105<br />
The preface to….nested within ontology.<br />
<br />
The defense of territory and possessions resembles Heideggerian ontology and amounts to a philosophy of injustice and a defense of tyranny. This devotion of the possessed leads to internal and external wars against any threat to totality. We must affirm an ethic of justice and responsibility for others as an alternative to ontology of war and politics of totality.<br />
Caygill; 2; Levinas and the Political; p. 113-115<br />
The reading of…other otherwise denied.<br />
<br />
Racism and genocide are not aberrations performed by perverse people- nor are they predestined. The kill to save mentality and the attribution of threatening qualities to the strange and foreign enemy stem from the failure to recognize our vulnerability in the face of the other and devaluation of difference.<br />
Burggrave; 5; Human Rights Review; 6:2<br />
According to Levinas…essendi (AS 60- 61).<br />
<br />
Failure to acknowledge the vulnerability of all humans leads to a fantasy of mastery and control that fuel the instruments of war by making some lives grievable and worthy of mourning, while others are not.<br />
Butler, Comp Lit &amp; Rhetoric @ Berkeley; 4; Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence; P. 28-31<br />
Mourning, fear, anxiety….fathom its possibility.<br />
<br />
The ethics framework must come first. The basis for obligation to the other shouldn’t come from knowledge, even knowledge of the instrumental consequences of one’s actions. Knowledge as the foundation of our relation to others will inevitably obliterate the other by reducing it to an agent of sameness.<br />
GOTTLIEB, Prof humanities @ Worcester Polytechnic Institute; 94; “Ethics and trauma”; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.crosscurrents.org/feministecology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.crosscurrents.org/feministecology.htm</a><br />
Levinas seeks to…agent of sameness.<br />
<br />
Politics is the decision or invention in the name of the other that is not reducible to some sort of moral calculus. Our ethics are defined as the infinite responsibility of unconditional hospitality. This infinite ethical demand is a response to the singular demand of the other yet never reducible to the singular context because of its infinity.<br />
Critchley, Chair Phil @ The New School; 4; Political Theory; 32: 2; april<br />
However, and this…invention, for creation.<br />
<br />
The state is inevitable- our only option is to make it as ethical as possible. Rather than placing limits to the extension of our hospitality, the law must make unconditionally hospitality to the other concrete. Our affirmation is constantly trying to move the state closer to the side of justice, and as such, is always a democracy to come.<br />
Simmons; 2; “Toward A Postmodern Anti-Foundational Foundation for Human Rights”; P. 13-15<br />
So, unconditional hospitality…anti-foundationalism and justice.<br />
<br />
The aff is a politics of ethical difference where politics must be mediated ethically. Responsibility for the other leads back to politics as a responsibility to questioning and demanding for justice. This is the only politics that avoids totalizing politics like National Socialism and war.<br />
Critchley; 99; The Ethics of Deconstruction; P. 221- 223<br />
The Levinasian account…attempts at totalization<br />
<br />
Freedom is constituted by our obligation to the other. This freedom allows radical novelty, an opportunity to begin anew, to have another chance, not the continuation of the same.<br />
Rosenthal; 3; “A Time for Being Ethical”; The Journal of Speculative Philosophy<br />
This position gives…have another chance.<br />
<br />
Ethical meaning permeates the legal context- law if primordially ethical. It’s impossible to separate ethics from the law or to always admit ethics into legal judgments.<br />

Law, if conceived….ought to do.<br />

<br />
Individual demands for disarmament create the conditions necessary for a world without weapons and war. This debate represents a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and plans that disarm the bombs in our lives. This demand creates non-violence, democratic dialogue, awareness and tolerance capable of confronting the dichotomous thinking that makes nuclear annihilation inevitable.<br />

If you believe…<u>world of tolerance</u>.<br />
<br />
Each person’s willingness to confront the existence of nuclear weapons creates the awareness necessary to create large scale collective action. We can’t afford to be distracted by the threats that justify their retention – buying into the possession of weapons destroys our souls. The ballot is key to endorsing the affirmative’s strategy which seeks to organize and educate young people who can pressure governments to abandon these weapons of cowardice.<br />
