Observation One—Inherency<br />
<br />
Obama’s made commitments to deep cuts now<br />

<br />
In his maiden speech to … ratified. These are strong words.<br />
<br />
However, these cuts ignore tactical nuclear weapons deployed in Europe—this makes reliance on TNWs more likely<br />

(David, 7/8, “Tactical Nuclear Weapons, the Menace No One Is Talking About”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/07/08/tactical-nuclear-weapons-the-menace-no-one-is-talking-about/" rel="nofollow">http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/07/08/tactical-nuclear-weapons-the-menace-no-one-is-talking-about/</a>, AG)<br />
<br />
All hail the U.S. and Russian … begins to matter to strategists.''<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should end United States forward-deployment of nuclear explosive devices that are deployed in Europe and not regulated under current nuclear arms control agreements.<br />
<br />
Advantage One—Accidents<br />
<br />
TNWs are the root of a warfighting mentality that results in miscalculation and war escalation<br />
Muller 2k - Peace Research Institute Frankfurt, Germany (Harald and Annette Schaper, “The Definitions, Types, Missions, Risks and Options for Control”, Tactical nuclear weapons: options for control, ed William Potter, UNIDIR 119, AG)<br />
<br />
TNWs invite the development of a … risk for misperception and miscalculation.<br />
<br />
Predelegation of TNWs ensures a hair-trigger posture that makes accidental nuclear war inevitable<br />

<br />
1. TNW promote a hair-trigger … them or lose them” principle.<br />
<br />
This escalates to nuclear war<br />

<br />
In Strangelove, the doomsday machine … 1985. It is still in place.<br />
<br />
Intrastate wars won’t escalate outside of TNW accidents—transatlantic relations, conventional and strategic forces will check escalation<br />

<br />
A. THE TRANSATLANTIC LINK Proponents … transatlantic link, TNWs are irrelevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two is Terrorism<br />
<br />
Terrorists will steal loose nukes to launch in the US—TNWs are a uniquely attractive target<br />
Boston Globe 2 (1/18, Russia's Scattered Tactical Arms a Temptation for Terrorists, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/bin/site/wrappers/media-show_clips_foreign-6557X.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/bin/site/wrappers/media-show_clips_foreign-6557X.html</a>, AG)<br />

MOSCOW The US-Russian arms treaty … safeguards built into strategic weapons.<br />

<br />
Location matters—European bases are unsafe—even the DOD has admitted major security risks<br />

History proves terrorists have already targeted European TNWs<br />

<br />
<br />
And then there is the … Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process.<br />
<br />
<br />
Terrorism outweighs—<br />
<br />
Future attacks coming soon—history proves<br />
NYT 8 (9/10, All Too Quiet on the Homeland Front, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/opinion/11ervin.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/opinion/11ervin.html</a>, AG)<br />
<br />
IF recent history is any … will soon be flushed out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Terrorists can easily acquire and build a nuclear weapon—causes U.S. retaliation and nuclear war—additionally, stealing Russian tactical nukes is an independent impact scenario<br />
Speice 6 – J.D. Candidate 2006, Marshall-Wythe School of Law (Patrick, 47 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 1427, AG)<br />
<br />
Accordingly, there is a significant and … the use of nuclear weapons. 53<br />
Even small terror attack triggers US lash-out<br />
Byman 7 – Director of the Center for Peace and Security Studies, Georgetown (Daniel, September, US Counter-terrorism Options, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cpass.georgetown.edu/Articles/August07/SurvivalArticle_DLB_Aug07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cpass.georgetown.edu/Articles/August07/SurvivalArticle_DLB_Aug07.pdf</a>, AG)<br />

Yet terrorism scares people. Even a … could contribute to a massive overreaction.<br />
US retaliation ensures extinction<br />

<br />
(3) Terrorism. Alas, the negative-… , along with our mishandling of it.<br />
<br />
Lashout to terrorism causes great power war, economic collapse, and nuclear obliteration<br />
Corsi 5 – PhD in Political Science from Harvard, author of multiple books on terrorism (Jerome, Atomic Iran, p 176-8, AG)<br />
<br />
In the span of less … still capable of exacting revenge.<br />
<br />
Russia will reciprocate withdrawal- and even if they don’t the plan’s signal still spills over for transparency cooperation solving security risks<br />
Polser 4 - Air Force Major, Master's in National Security Affairs from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School (Brian, Theater Nuclear Weapons in Europe, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA427697&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA427697&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf</a>, AG)<br />
<br />
U.S. theater nuclear weapons in … in Europe is a counterproductive strategy.<br />
<br />
Only a unilateral action solves and results in Russian transparency<br />
Kulesa 9 - analyst at The Polish Institute of International Affairs (Łukasz, Reduce US Nukes in Europe to Zero, and Keep NATO Strong (and Nuclear), www.ceeol.com, AG)<br />
<br />
Should NATO engage Russia as a … weaken the role of NATO.<br />
<br />
Advantage Three—Firebreak Mentality<br />
<br />
Nuclear taboo is a international norm that currently prevents wars from going nuclear—breaking that threshold with tactical use is a precondition to any impact escalation<br />
Polser 4 - Air Force Major, Master's in National Security Affairs from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School (Brian, Theater Nuclear Weapons in Europe, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA427697&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA427697&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf</a>, AG)<br />
<br />
The nuclear taboo is not a … security in the long run.<br />
<br />
<br />
TNWs make nuclear war thinkable by lowering the firebreak distinction between conventional and nuclear weapons—this guarantees a failure of deterrence<br />
Rajaraman 2 –Professor of Theoretical Physics, JNU (R, Apr 22, “Ban battlefield nuclear weapons”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thehindu.com/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehindu.com/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm</a>, AG)<br />

<br />
Withdrawal solves the thinkability of tactical use<br />
Derber 90 - Professor of Sociology, Boston College (Charles and William Schwartz, The Nuclear Seduction, p 39-40, AG)<br />
<br />
The only technical factors that … debate in the United States.<br />
<br />
The blurring of firebreak distinction ensures global annihilation at the hands of the US military agenda—this is the most pivotal question facing humanity—we as individual activists must focus our in-round advocacy on challenging the legitimacy of military discourse by making demands against TNWs<br />
Chossudovsky 6 - Professor of Economics at the University of Ottawa and Director of the Center for Research on Globalization (Michel, 2/22, Global Research, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=2032" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=2032</a>, AG)<br />
<br />
At no point since the … individually and collectively against war.<br />
<br />
Any retreat from policy-focused advocacy will fail and only entrench authoritarian military control of the public sphere<br />
Boggs 97 – professor of social sciences, Los Angeles (Carl, The Great Retreat, Theory and Society 26.6, jstor, AG)<br />
<br />
