<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;">The United States Federal Government should prohibit its use of nuclear threats to extract diplomatic concessions. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;"><u>Atomic Diplomacy:</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-weight: normal;">The international balace of power is on the brink of transition – now is a key time to secure US credibility<br />
Grant 9 (UPI, “Russia, china preparing new challenges to the united states”<br />
“the balance in international military power…big role in shaping those collisions”<br />
There is an increasing emphasis on the compellence role of nuclear weapons<br />
Raghaven 3 (the hundu, jan 17”nuclear weapons evolving role”)<br />
“the evolution of nuclear weapons in the….power projection remains to be seen”<br />
There are two internal links:<br />
First, bluffing<br />
Nuclear diplomacy is perceived as the ultimate bluff – the empirical failure of coercive strats is well know<br />
Paul et al 2k (the absolute weapon revisited” univ of mich press)<br />
“the arguments by the advocates of limited-nuclear-war… unimpressive record of atomic diplomacy”<br />
This is the biggest internal link to hegemony – bluffing crushes leadership regardless of military power<br />
Sartori 5 (anne, “deterrence by diplomacy” p 116)<br />
“my view is that the military balance affects…for the military balance”<br />
And, a failure to follow through with threatened retaliation would make multiple deterrence failures and collapse of leadership inevitable – bluffing outweighs resolve – best multivariate studies prove<br />
Sartori 5 (anne, “deterrence by diplomacy” p 105-9)<br />
“if my theory is correct…reputation for resolve also does so”<br />
Second, negotiation credibility<br />
Perception of self deterrence precludes nuclear threats in the course of diplomatic dealings from being credible, emboldening adversaries to test the US<br />
Fisher 7 (“deterrence, terrorism, and American values, homeland security affairs volume III no 1 feb)<br />
“in addition to articulating a policy….CBRN capabilities to terrorists”<br />
This spills over into all aspects of negotiation credibility – tanking deterrence”<br />
Sartori 5 (anne, “deterrence by diplomacy” p 125)<br />
“similar issues arise in the context…verbal and written negotiations”<br />
And, credibility is the key internal link to effective deterrence<br />
Mies 6 (“nuclear threat can enhance stability”, American physical society, 15.6)<br />
“I think there’s a grain of truth….greater collateral damage”<br />
Next, the impacts<br />
Stable US leadership preserves a peaceful international order – military might prevents power struggles and supports a peaceful economic order, solving all your DA impacts<br />
Thayer 6<br />
The alternative decline in us hegemony sparks a global power vacuum that causes great power wars<br />
Knowles 9 (Arizona state law journal)<br />
“first, the hybrid, hegemonic…suffer the most”<br />
These wars go nuclear – we control magnitude and probability – every conflict is inevitable and escalates<br />
Kagan 7<br />
Indepndently, deterrence bluffing sparks competitor CBW attacks<br />
Hussey 9 (peter, jan 29, “nukes for peace: nuclear terrorism and the state of us deterrent policy” )<br />
“in short deterrence cannot be a bluff…biological, or chemical weapon”<br />
And bioweapons extinction<br />

Gormley 6 (dennis m, survival vol 48, no 3, autumn)<br />
“instead of building modernized…international taboo against their use”<br />
And, the plan is reverse causal – it forces adversaries to focus on voncentional coercion which is far more effective<br />
Sterling et al 1 (barry m, “non-nuclear strategic deterrence of state and nonstate adversaries” oct)<br />
“alternatively, the us could explicitly…addressing nuclear weapons at all”<br />
Moreover, there is no empirical example of nuclear coercion being singularly effective conventional and economic coercion would solve better in every instance<br />

Recent doctrinal shifts prove India is moving away from deterrence visavis pakistan and towards offenseive comellence strategies<br />
Singh 9 (rethinking strategic doctrine in the indo-pak context)<br />
