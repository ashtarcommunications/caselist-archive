<strong>2AC answers to Emory CoRa, Vandy Round 4</strong><br />
<br />
Framework<br />
<br />
Traditional policy framework is not neutral, its soaked in conservative ideology—their implicit value commitment always favor the established order<br />
Meszaros 89 (The Power of Ideology 232-234)<br />
Nowhere is the myth...philosophy can escape<br />
<br />
Turn—invoking archaic rules flips fairness and education, the actual WARRANTS for Topicality as a voting issue<br />

Trying to freeze...just seems duplicitous<br />
<br />
Turn-NEG's rigidity decreases participation<br />

And I know what...commitment to debate.<br />
<br />
Deterrence<br />
<br />
No Link-AFF way ahead on whether Neg assessments are accurate. 1AC Zhenqiang, Pan and Kristensen prove they're almost always wrong and hardline approach only makes imagined threats real. This is a non-unique, take-out, and turn.<br />
Pan 4 “The “China Threat” in American Self-Imagination: The Discursive Construction of Other as Power Politics, Alternatives: Global, Local, Political, v29<br />
I have argued above...for both sides<br />
<br />
Case outweighs – 1AC advantages are systemic factors which make DA impacts inevitable and racist policies are never justified by defense claims<br />
<br />
Aff subsumes – 1ac undercuts neg sources, racist and profit motives void link claims<br />
Denny Roy 96, “The China Threat Issue”, Asian Survey v26 #8 pp 764-765<br />
As part of their...without an enemy<br />
<br />
No internal link-extend NRDC 8 from 1AC pre-set plans not keys to deterrence<br />
<br />
No Brink – US vastly suprerior militarily<br />
Hans Kristensen et al 2006 “Chinese Nuclear Forces and US Nuclear War Planning” Nov 06 ISBN: 0-9653386-451500<br />
Our principal finding...between the two countries.<br />
<br />
Timeframe<br />
<br />
Urgency and exploitation go hand in hand. The affirmative claims of immediate impacts and urgent action reduces world events to something similar to the flashing images on TV preventing a departure from our suicidal course and the arrival of our extinction.<br />
Paul Virilio 05 “Negative Horizon” pg 114-115<br />
As a 'speed factory'...live, for a time.<br />
<br />
Positive Peace<br />
<br />
The depiction of war as an event ignores the structural conditions that allow poverty to thrive making future violence on a greater magnitude inevitable.<br />
Leo R. Sandy and Ray Perkins 2002, “The Nature of Peace and its implications for peace education” Online journal of peace and conflict resolution, Issue 4.2, Spring 2002 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.trinstitute.org/ojpcr/4_natp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.trinstitute.org/ojpcr/4_natp.htm</a><br />
“Peace” is a word...what constitutes positive peace.
