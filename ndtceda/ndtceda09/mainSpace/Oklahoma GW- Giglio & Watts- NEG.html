NEW – Antagonistic Play Alt<br />
The act of the 1nc was a gesture of antagonizing the 1ac to force a confrontation with the real that interrupts its image of a harmonious whole. This disruption is part and parcel of a conception of the political that avoids the ahistorical tendencies of analysis by operating within a more radical political strategy that doesn’t require final solutions or satisfaction<br />

Insecurity is not unique - uncertainty and risk are inevitable. At issue is what makes life valuable. we encourage indifference and carelessness in a world characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affs world of paranoid tiptoeing<br />

The ultimate result of their orientation to life is the inability to live life itself. The desire to seek deliverance from life through a future moral order annihilates life in the present. This is the worst impact, our lives become a dreary perpetuation of biological life, devoid of meaning, only waiting for death<br />

the only way out of this cycle of guilt and investment, which must constantly revisit the site of injury, is forgetting. we forget the original injury which made us hate the world and seek repayment. Indeed, any repayment or forgiveness can only reinscribe the cycle of domination. the only alt is to walk away from the injury and cast it's memory into oblivion<br />

They do not defend the advocacy statement in the 1ac<br />
<strong>Standards</strong><br />
<strong>Competition</strong> Without a stable advocacy they can sever all links in 2ac. Our argument is not that debate must be fair, but that competition is valuable and necessary for us to grow. We must have a basis to challenge the affirmative and engage in struggle<br />

<strong>Purposelessness</strong> – the ballot can not be based on self-affirmation. Such a self-affirmation can have no higher purpose, it can not require the judge’s authority nor can it be premised on success. Like Sisyphus, only when we persist with no hope of overcoming this world to achieve some metaphysical victory can we celebrate life. For their 1AC to be meaningful, you should vote negative. Vote negative to recognize the aff’s ability to be self affirming requiring the ballot anxiety.<br />

 The affirmative abandons the topic in favor of the fantasy of debate anarchy – this abdicates their ethical responsibility to both us and the debate topic itself. Our framework is rooted in the masochist impulse to a tight, bound relationship to one another.<br />

ONE OFF<br />
The affirmative constructs themselves as all powerful egos capable of overseeing and manipulating international relations. This creates a dangerous relationship to the world in terms of objectification and only values the world in terms of strategic viability, discarding that which is not. It also confines IR to a totalizing positivism in which the violence of the state becomes naturalized as part of the game.<br />
