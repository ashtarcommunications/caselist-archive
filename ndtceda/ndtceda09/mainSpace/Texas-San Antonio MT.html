 Gendered Language<br />
Use of sexist language constructs violence against women – mocking sexual violence that reflect violence endorses that norm<br />

In November 1989, queen’s university in … thereby encoding a sexist world view<br />

This hinders transformation and leads to violence<br />

Public private K<br />
To invoke the “public” is not just a benign political move – it carries all sorts of assumptions about how the body should operate, where it should operateand filters out what is unproductive or passive<br />
Warner 2005<br />
<br />
This heteronormativity creates an invisible center. It attempts to define a sanitary and marginalized community. This leads to the productive standards of rationality, desirability, and superiority. This is the primary instrument for violence in modern society. Our institutions, our theory, and our lives have been backed by a force that creates repression of abomrla<br />

University-contained discourse about power sustains a hegemonic institution of knowledge production that destroys true resistance by turning it into a graveyard, paralyzes action<br />
Occupied UC 2009 november 19 the necrosocial: civic life, social death, and the UC<br />
The university steals and homogenizes .. who doesn’t participate in this graveyard<br />

Social death kills value to life and precondition to genocide<br />
Claudia Card 2003 Hypatia 18.1 2003 63—79<br />
This essay develops the hypothesis … do not include cultural death AND specific to genocide is … this view, however, is controversial<br />

University sucks – their impact calculus is based off of a fantasy of discourse which imagines it can produce change in the social sphere<br />

1ACs artificial change of the squos nuclear weapons leaves system of violence unquestioned bc these weapos of violence are interlocked with institutions of violence. The affs flawed perception is part of the institutionalization of war<br />
Cohn 3<br />
“it is not that we fail to distinguish…put before them<br />
<br />
<br />
Without prior questions to politics these masculinized fw maintain a system of perpetual violence. Feminized security forces politics through a gendered lens. Leading to a downward spiral towards extn! The !AC can win that plan is good enough in the abstract but their justifications and truth claims represent the dysfunctional impaired thinking that has plagued politics.<br />
Warren 96<br />
“patriarchal conceptual frameworks sanction…if not impossible.<br />
<br />
It is the belief that violence and aggression are inevitable that creates the self fulfilling prophecy ending in extn! Humyns are not violent by nature but position themselves in a way that promotes aggressive thought<br />
Kohn 88<br />
“it is true that the presence of some… without courting extinction.”<br />
<br />
Prior to an examination of politics we must begin with an alt epistemology that questions the hegemonic masculine discourse and reps of int relations. Doing so produces a better form of knowledge in which we can reveal the possibility of a discussion of nuclear weapons in opposition to the technostrategic fw<br />

Rhetoric of an accident reveals an evasion of responsibility, which gives the term extraordinary power. This both initiates a war and pushes the fear further into the cultural landscape<br />
Loopka 92<br />
“this absurd outcome may be most evident…as the saying goes.”<br />
<br />
Labeling an event as an accident creates a self fulfilling prophecy of destruction bc we prepare for the accident with the items that cause them<br />

Method comes first—rethinking our notions of gendered security is critical to building new frameworks for international relations<br />

The masters tool will never dismantle the Master’s house. We should not seek to smooth over difference with reformism<br />
