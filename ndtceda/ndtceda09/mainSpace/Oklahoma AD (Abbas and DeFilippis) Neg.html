Heidegger K<br />
The planetary reign of technology requires a new understanding of warfare altogether – modern conflict has blurred the distinction between war and peace; no longer do great powers seek an open confrontation on the battlefield. Yet violence persists, as rivalries serve only to perpetuate themselves, resulting in a technological enframing of the globe that can only ensure the continued domination of the Will over the Earth.<br />
Mitchell, '5 [Andrew J. Mitchell, Stanford University. “Heidegger and Terrorism.” <em>Research in Phenomenology</em> 35 (2005): 181-218]<br />
War is oppositional in preparing...beings have become uncommon.<br />
<br />
The prospect of nuclear war, while frightening, should merely be seen as the withdrawal of Being while we subordinate existence to the sovereign human Will – this possibility itself is much more threatening than any material destruction<br />
<strong>Caputo, '93</strong> <em>[John Caputo, Villanova University.</em> Demythologizing Heidegger<em>. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993. 139-141</em>]<br />
In his essay &quot;The Thing&quot;...essential, authentic, ontological destruction.<br />
<br />
The result of this eclipse of Being is a Will which reduces the world to a stable and predictable “Standing Reserve” to be called upon as it benefits the Self and refuses to value the world as anything else. This ontology represents a constant consumption which renders all beings objects—setting the tone for global warfare in the wake of the rejection of Being itself.<br />
<strong>Zimmerman, '81</strong> [Michael E. Zimmerman, Tulane University. <em>Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger's Concept of Authenticity</em>. 220-224]<br />
In 1951 Heidegger noted...the capitalist is a rational miser.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to do nothing. Don't be fooled – this isn't a question of passivity but of a releasement from the Will to Technology and an openness to the mystery of Being which transcends activity. Only such an ontological disarmament inaugurates new modes of revealing that don't depend on the world's subordination to human motivations.<br />
<strong>McWhorter, '92</strong> <em>[Ladelle McWhorter, University of Richmond.</em> Heidegger and the Earth: Issues in Environmental Philosophy<em>. Kirksville, MO: Truman State University Press, 1992. 3-7</em>]<br />
Heidegger's work is a call...subjective existence in our age.<br />
<br />
Ontology first -- it informs action.<br />
<strong>Dillon, '95</strong> [Michael Dillon, Professor of Politics and International Relations at Lancaster University. <em>Moral Spaces: Rethinking Ethics and World Politics</em>. Eds. David Campbell and Michael J. Shapiro. University of Minnesota Press, 1999. 96-98]<br />
Perhaps the most important...technocrats of decision making.<br />

Martin K<br />
The aff focus on nuclear weapons reduction represents a technological quick fix mentality which crushes any potential for a truly progressive movement.<br />
Martin '86 [Brian, Peace Studies]<br />
The major problem with...too much on 'achievable' reforms.<br />
<br />
The aff only dampens public concern over nuclear weapons - it won't prevent war.<br />
Martin '82 [Brian, Social Alternatives]<br />
This scenario may seem...changing society for the better.<br />
<br />
Focus on nuclear weapons trades off with the broader progressive struggle necessary to fight the war system - the aff leads to new technologies which replicate the logic of nuclear weapons.<br />

Agency<br />
A. THESIS: While debaters may have agency, debate itself does not – despite your claims in the 1AC, voting aff does nothing to advance the cause of any movement, political cause, or critical resistance.<br />
<strong><u>Lang ’99</u></strong> [Anthony, Senior Lecturer in the School of International Relations at University of St. Andrews, “Responsibility in the International System: Reading US Foreign Policy in the Middle East,” European Journal of International Relations Vol. 5 No. 1]<br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">Following these three thinkers, I assume the following meaning…</span> <u>agency of citizens, state responsibility tends to undermine that agency</u>.<br />
<br />
Moreover, performance in debate is bankrupt – the 1AC is an exercise of political futility – not only is your activism secured safely within the confines of a community largely-like academics – the 1AC itself is performed to win over the judge to the exclusion of others.<br />
<strong><u>Gunnell ’86</u></strong> [John, Political Science Professor at SUNY, <em>Tradition, Interpretation and Science</em>, p. 351-2]<br />
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.4pt;">There may be pointed exceptions; but, <u>on the whole, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: lime none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">the radicalism </span></u></span><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: lime none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">of political</span>…<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: lime none repeat scroll 0% 0%; letter-spacing: 0.15pt;"> merely substitutes one reified structure </span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: lime none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">for another</span></u>.<br />
<br />
The fact that the effectiveness of your activism hinges on a win or loss makes performance in debate inevitably suspect – these strategic interactions are ineffective.<br />
<strong><u>Habermas ’84</u></strong> [Jürgen, Philosopher &amp; Sociologist, <em>The Theory of Communicative Action</em>, p. 93-4]<br />

<br />
In fact, these strategic interactions reduce the likelihood for acceptance of activism and the success of your performance.<br />

You’ll never win that your call to action spurs any real world change – we have specific evidence that proves that collegiate policy debate destroys consensus on political issues and immobilizes real world change.<br />
<strong><u>Hayakawa ’90</u></strong> [SI, Former California Senator and English Professor at SFSU, <em>Language in Thought and Action</em>, p. 129]<br />
Disputes in which this “equalization” is likely to occur are… <u>is that statements are either “true” or “false.</u>”<br />
<br />
B. IMPACTS: The impacts you isolate are disads to your activism – performing resistance prioritizes the symbolic over the actual which disables movements.<br />

<strong>Forget the Holocaust 1NC<br />
<br />
The memory of the Holocaust is politically encoded, use of this memory as a justification for policy has nothing in common with the memory of Holocaust survivors of the experience of a Holocaust memorial. Rather, it is a strategic deployment to justify the elimination of that which we find unacceptable and prop up traditional liberalism. This reinscribes rationalism and anthropocentrism, turning the 1AC</strong>.<br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">Paul </span><u>Treanor</u><span style="font-size: 8pt;">. “Why Forget the Holocaust?” 200</span>7.<br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The best evidence, that the… liberated by Soviet troops. </span><br />
<br />
<strong>Their attempt to reinscribe the memory of the Holocaust attempts to brand the moral law in our flesh – “Though shall not use reason,” “Thou shall not kill,” and the slogan of holocaust memorials, “Never again.” This is the source of guilt, debt, and morality.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>This existential anxiety results in an addiction to suffering. They need a monster to fight, so they turn everything into to monster of the Holocaust. The result is no happiness in life.</strong><br />

<strong>Capitalism 1NC</strong><br />
