Chernus K<br />
<br />
In 1886, Friedrich Nietzsche pronounced the death of a centuries-old God. What he couldn’t have foreseen was the birth of a new God, carried over into the 20th century through all the wrath and awe of the gods of old. Our new God, the nuclear Bomb, must be recognized in all its religious and psycho-symbolic emergences, heralding the doxa of Progress towards a better world without Suffering or Death through paradoxically aligning us with Death itself. The nuclear Bomb is our new Opiate for the Masses.<br />

“In the preceding chapters, I have suggested that above and beyond…” “…those who question their choices-with a Bomb, if necessary.”<br />
<br />

Enter the affirmative. The affirmative deploys the State—our dealer—as a means to anchor us to the social fantasy of the heroic ego. The state is the nexus for the reification of dependence upon nuclear experts donning their robes as scientific shamen, magnifying our dependence upon, if not the Bomb, then the shadow it casts. Nuclear problems are couched by the affirmative in literal ways that prioritize a ‘rational’ approach to arms control that denies and buries the Bombs roots in our social imagination.<br />

“The state and its media also insure that the…” “…So the part of us that does worry may be just as numb as the part that refuses to worry.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s reductions are not neutral. Nuclear reductions place greater social faith in the only Bomb we have left, perpetuating the fantasmic construction of a “safe Bomb” capable of being rationally “stabilized.” The discourse of arms control perpetuate the social fantasy of omnipotent world-ordering through the rearrangement of some apparently ‘small’ and ‘trivial’ detail. The affirmative’s disgusting rationalization of nuclear weapons as a form of diplomatic leverage seeks to turn a blind eye to the tightening grip they foster to the ones we have remaining.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
“Since this &quot;safe Bomb&quot; fantasy depends on absolute faith in the rational ego…” “coincide with empirical actualities in only random, and often tangential, ways.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to “reject the affirmative’s mythology of the Bomb.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We are not doomed to despair. If the nuclear fantasy is primarily symbolic, this offers us chance to intervene in the way these images are constructed and disseminated. Only by stepping away from the mythology of the 1ac can we begin to re-imagine and re-articulate new symbolic vocabularies and modes of thinking that abandon faith in ontological security.<br />

<br />
“Yet, these essays also suggest that we need not abandon altogether the reality that we know today…” “…this conclusion are only a few of the many possibilities that these chapters can open up for all students of the nuclear age.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While we cannot give you a literal blueprint for what this mythic transformation would look like, only a symbolization—not literalization—of peace and war can free us from the commitment to a form of progress that will never come. We must insist upon the ‘unrealistic.’<br />

“This new understanding of peace demands a new direction for the peace movement…” “…the movement would have to become &quot;unrealistic'' and return to its former dynamic vision of immediate and total abolition.”
