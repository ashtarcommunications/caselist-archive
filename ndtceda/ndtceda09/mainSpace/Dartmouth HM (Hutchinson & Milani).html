Contention 1- False Warnings<br />
<br />
History proves Early warning mishaps are the most likely cause of an accidental launch<br />

False Alarms are inevitiable- Glitches, confusion, and mis interpretations<br />
John <strong>Hallam</strong>, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and Nuclear Flashpoints, citing Bruce Blair, president of the World Security Institute, 4/29/20<strong>08</strong>, “Nuclear Weapons Operational Readiness/Operating Status”, Reaching Critical Will, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/npt/prep" rel="nofollow">http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/npt/prep</a> com08/ngostatements/OpStatus.pdf<br />
The reason so many people have ...and Russian governments but never implemented .<br />
<br />
Dual phenomenology compounds the risks- overlapping false alarms happen creating an even greater risk of mistaken launch<br />

<br />
This means the rate of false alarms will increase drastically<br />

We should also keep in mind ...an accidental nuclear war will grow.<br />
<br />
Overconfidence in Early warning systems ensures we will retaliate on warning- US action alone is sufficient to solve the risks<br />
<strong>Podvig 5</strong> [Pavel, researcher at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, Reducing the Risk of Accidental Launch: A Case for Unilateral Action, September 8, 2005,<br />

Contention 2- LOW Capabilities<br />
<br />
The U.S. maintains launch on warning as a retaliation option-expert testimony proves<br />
Steven <strong>Starr</strong>, senior scientist with Physicians for Social Responsibility, USASGR Newsletter. “High-alert nuclear weapons:the forgotten danger”.

Official denials US officials have, ...solid-fuel engines powered up.”19<br />
<br />
And the NPR doesn’t deny launch on warning- the military just calls it launch under attack<br />

6. &quot;The Nuclear Posture ...remain sitting ducks for very long.<br />

LOW eliminates rational decision-making, making nuclear launch a series of checklists.<br />

This shift created enormous pressure on ...would cause an accidental nuclear war.<br />
<br />
A lapse in human alertness, coincidence, or glitches are enough to ensure retaliation in the face of false alarms<br />

As long as the United States ...after one failure of that kind.<br />
<br />
Accidents escalate – it would be nuclear war by check list<br />

Hair-trigger alert means this...war by checklist, by rote.&quot;<br />

Claims of prudence are unverifiable- there are no categorical assurances means the risk of escalation outweighs<br />
