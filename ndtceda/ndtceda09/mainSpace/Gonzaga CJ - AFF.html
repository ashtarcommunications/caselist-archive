 <strong><u>CONTENTION ONE</u> – THE NUCLEAR FAMILY; OR HOW I LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE MY (STEP)FATHER</strong><br />
<strong>UNDER THE GUISE OF PARENTAL OBLIGATION, AMERICAN NUCLEAR POLICY HAS TAKEN A PARTICULARLY INCESTUOUS TURN. DECADES OF URANIUM MINING AND RADIATION TESTING HAVE VIOLATED MILLIONS WHO PLACE THEIR TRUST IN THE NUCLEAR FATHER FOR PROTECTION. JUST LIKE EXPERIENCES DESCRIBED BY VICTIMS OF INCEST, DEVOTION TO THE BOMB AND ITS POLICIES FORCE THE SELF TO SPLIT FROM THE BODY, WARPING AND PERVERTING IDEAS LIKE SURVIVAL, TRUST AND FAMILY TO MAKE DAILY VIOLENCE AND PENETRATION NOT ONLY PALATABLE BUT THE EXPECTED NORM.</strong><br />

THE NUCLEAR FATHER: …has gone before.&quot;<br />
<strong>NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY ROOTED IN THE SEPARATION BETWEEN “SPIRIT” AND “BODY” REQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DUAL SELF THAT SEPARATES AND SUPPRESSES EMBODIED FORMS OF KNOWING. THIS DUALISM CREATES AN INTERNAL SENSE OF SELF HATRED AND A DESIRE FOR TOTAL ANNIHILATION TO ESCAPE THE FLESH OF THIS WORLD VIA NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST.</strong><br />

<strong>CONTENTION TWO – PEACEMAKING</strong><br />
<strong>UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT IS A NECESSARY BREAK WITH THE HOPELESSNESS THAT SURROUNDS ARMS CONTROL THOUGH AN AFFIRMATION OF PEACE AS PRACTICE THAT WILL REVERBERATE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. BY BREAKING THE ATOMIC SWORD, VOTING AFFIRMATIVE DOES NOT ONLY EMBRACE A NEW POLICY BUT A NEW POLITICAL NARRATIVE OF HOPE BASED ON CONNECTION AND NATALITY RATHER THAN THE INCESTUOUS NARRATIVE OF SEPARATION AND DEATH.</strong><br />

<strong>THE QUEST FOR PEACE IS A QUESTION OF PRACTICE. THE PROBLEM WITH NUCLEAR POLICY IS IT ATTEMPTS TO PRESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF THE FUTURE BY RESTRICTING HUMAN NATURE TO A SELECT FORM OF VIOLENT RELATIONS. THESE PREDICTIONS PROCEED FROM A STATE OF HOPELESSNESS THAT MAKES SURVIVAL IMPOSSIBLE AND NUCLEAR VIOLENCE INEVITABLE. INSTEAD, OUR REJECTION OF NUCLEARISM IS EMBODIED IN AN OPEN HOPE FOR THE FUTURE WHICH DOES NOT SEEK TO PRESCRIBE IT’S CONTENT BUT RATHER RECOGNIZES THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS SURROUNDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS FORCLOSE THE POSSIBILITY OF HOPE.</strong><br />
