<strong>1NC</strong><br />
<strong>Framework:</strong><br />
<strong>“Resolved” before a colon reflects a legislative forum</strong><br />
<strong>Army Officer School 4</strong> (5-12, “# 12, Punctuation – The Colon and Semicolon”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://usawocc.army.mil/IMI/wg12.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://usawocc.army.mil/IMI/ wg12.htm</a>)<br />
The colon introduces the following…&quot;Resolved: (colon) That this council petition the mayor.<br />
<br />
<strong>“United States Federal Government should” means the debate is solely about the outcome of a policy established by governmental means</strong><br />
<strong>Ericson 3</strong> (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts – California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater’s Guide, Third Edition, p. 4)<br />
The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action …the future action that you propose.<br />
<br />
<strong>Topicality is a voting issue for fairness and outweighs all other issues because without it, debate is impossible</strong><br />
<strong>Shively 00</strong> (Ruth Lessl, Assistant Prof Political Science – Texas A&amp;M U., Partisan Politics and Political Theory, p. 181-182)<br />
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists …rests on some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<strong>Conventional Weapons DA</strong><br />
<strong>Reducing reliance on nuclear weapons leaves the roots of militarism in tact – causing worse conventional weapons to fill-in</strong><br />
<strong>Martin 84</strong> (Brian, Professor of Social Sciences – University of Wollongong, “Principles for Antiwar Strategies”, Uprooting War, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/90uw/uw02.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/ sts/bmartin/pubs/90uw/uw02. html</a>)<br />
If all the military weapons in the world suddenly …and certainly much more than nuclear disarmament.<br />
<br />
<strong>Turns the Aff – conventional shift accelerates U.S. militarism and locks-in global dependence on nuclear weapons – both risk nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Sokolsky 2</strong> (Richard, Distinguished Research Fellow – Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University and Former Director of the Office of Strategic Policy and Negotiations – Department of State, “Demystifying the US Nuclear Posture Review”, Survival, 44(3), Autumn, p. 138)<br />
However, blurring the distinction between non-nuclear …strike capability could increase the likelihood of nuclear war.17<br />
<br />
<strong>Independently – battlefield AI will fill-in – causing fast extinction</strong><br />
<strong>Dvorsky 9</strong> (George, Board of Directors – Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies and Director of Operations – Commune Media, “The Perils of Nuclear Disarmament: How Relinquishment Could Result in Disaster”, 3-31, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/2985/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ieet.org/index.php/ IEET/more/2985/</a>)<br />
The assertion, therefore, that we need to completely rid …should be used, but that they should never be used.<br />
<br />
<strong>Weaponitis</strong><br />
<strong>The 1AC frame for arms control consolidates the conventional IR framework of security of the nation-state. We need a critical theory of arms control that interrogates the underlying assumptions and justifications presented by the 1AC.</strong><br />
<strong>COOPER ‘6</strong> (Neil Reader in International Relations at the Department of Peace Studies of the University of Bradford “Putting disarmament back in the frame” Review of International Studies 32 p. 361-364<br />
However, whilst it is important (if only to counter …as well as military and broader hegemonic practices.<br />
<br />
<strong>The weapons paradigm is obsolete, but the 1AC’s weapon-centered approach fuels an addiction to nuclear weapons called “weaponitis.”</strong><br />
<strong>Schwartz and Derber , member of Boston Nuclear Study Group and Prof of Sociology @ BC, 1990</strong><br />
(William and Charles, The Nuclear Seduction: Why the Arms Race Doesn’t Matter—And What Does, pg. 13-15)<br />
The fallacy of weaponitis lies in attributing …weapons paradigm was already obsolete.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Placing faith in a cut in nuclear weapons fuels our addiction to them and turns the plan’s solvency.</strong><br />
<strong>Schwartz and Derber</strong> , member of Boston Nuclear Study Group and Prof of Sociology @ BC, 19<strong>90</strong><br />
(William and Charles, The Nuclear Seduction: Why the Arms Race Doesn’t Matter—And What Does, pg. 206)<br />
That conclusion may be too pessimistic. A huge …weapons that don't really matter anyway.<br />
<br />
<strong>Politics of security guarantees extinction.</strong><br />
<strong>Dillon 96</strong> (Michael, “Politics of Security: Towards a Political Philosophy of Continental Thought, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.questia.com/read/103092657?title=Politics%20of%20Security:%20Towards%20a%20Political%20Philosophy%20of%20Continental%20Thought#" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.questia.com/read/ 103092657?title=Politics%20of% 20Security:%20Towards%20a% 20Political%20Philosophy%20of% 20Continental%20Thought#</a>, AD: 7/10/9) CR<br />
The way of sharpening and …the advent of the real prospect of human species extinction.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nuclear Weapons PIC</strong><br />
<strong>Framing the plan as a matter of “nuclear weapons” destroys its critical potential – the term pre-ordains the debate to exclude abolition, fuels co-option by elites, and ensures public ignorance of their message. Replacing the terminology is crucial to mobilize anti-nuclear resistance</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 236-241)<br />
Before concluding with some suggested …are charged with a denotation of enormous power through terror.<br />
<br />
<strong>Impact is extinction – reinvigorating the peace movement through a reframed approach is the only check against inevitable nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy</strong> 3 (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 222-223)<br />
Despite the ending of the Cold War, …antinuclear forces have framed the debate.<br />
<br />
<strong>Deterrence DA</strong><br />
<strong>Deterrence is strong now – but will fail it others close the gap</strong><br />
<strong>Kyl 5</strong> [Jon, United States Senate+ Chairman of Republican Policy Committee “Maintaining Nuclear Deterrence in the 21st Century” June 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/policies/Jun16NuclearMG.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.nuclearfiles.org/ menu/key-issues/nuclear- weapons/issues/policies/ Jun16NuclearMG.pdf</a>]<br />
The United States must now consider …democratic allies from emerging nuclear superpowers. 6.<br />
<br />
<strong>Nukes are key to deterrence – they collapse their utility</strong><br />
<strong>Joseph 00</strong> (Robert, Director – Center for Counterproliferation Research, senior scholar at the National Institute for Public Policy, professor – Missouri State University, and formerly Special Envoy for Nuclear Nonproliferation, Congressional Testimony – Senate Foreign Relations Nonproliferation Policy, 3-21)<br />
Therefore, it is essential that the United States …President Reagan held the vision of eliminating these weapons altogether.<br />
<br />
<strong>2NC/1NR</strong><br />
<strong>Nuclear Weapons PIC</strong><br />
<strong>The term “nuclear weapon” plays into the hands of pro-nuclear forces – it evokes images of massive power that authenticate its continued use – this rhetoric shapes reality and turns the case</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 221)<br />
The tool of language helps to shape the …nuclear power can be challenged radically.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rhetorical baggage – the term “nuclear weapon” connotes a power perspective of ultimate warfighting and is symbolically connected to images of U.S. supremacy – this fuels elite-cooption and sanitizes the horrors of nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 241-242)<br />
To escape this lexical trap of machtpolitik …exists to defy effectively the dominant power perspective.<br />
<br />
<strong>Relative distinction – “nuclear weapon” is a term used by both nuclearists and abolitionists – this prevents differentiation critical to spur public support for disarmament</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April)<br />
The size and success of this mass mobilization …nuclear debate with the lexicon of a new language.<br />
<br />
<strong>Replacing the word “nuclear weapons” shatters the consensus that “weapons” have utility – this fractures the linguistic bedrock of nuclear warfighting and enables broad support for disarmament</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 225-226)<br />
If the peace movement ever is going to …new way of thinking construed by language.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Turns case – pro-nuclear terms are a rhetorical trap that destroy movement toward abolition</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 223)<br />
Ever since the dawn of the Atomic Age in 1945 …of “the bomb” as a legitimate and effective instrument of political power.<br />
<br />
<strong>Turn – claims of censorship sustain the status quo – endorsing our replacement is critical to end nuclear threats</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 245)<br />
Redirecting the course of the …enforcement of the United Nations.<br />
<br />
<strong>The term “nuclear explosive devices” is best – it reveals the reality of nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Gates 2</strong> (John M, Professor of History – Wooster College, “The U.S. Army and Irregular Warfare,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.so" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.so</a> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://com.mil/iw/groups/IW_related_docs/The%20US%20Army%20and%20Irregular%20Warfare_Full%20Book.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">com.mil/iw/groups/IW_related_ docs/The%20US%20Army%20and% 20Irregular%20Warfare_Full% 20Book.pdf</a>)<br />
The use of the term &quot;weapons&quot; …are instruments intended for use in combat.<br />
<br />
<strong>Replacing “nuclear weapons” with the term “nuclear instruments of genocide” is best – its legally precise, credible for the public, and effectively depicts the dangerous of nuclear war</strong><br />
<strong>Hallett and Summy 3</strong> (Brien, Associate Professor in the Matsunaga Institute for Peace – University of Hawai'i, and Ralph, Senior Lecturer in Political Science – University of Queensland “Detooling the Language of the Master’s House: The Case of those ‘Nuclear Things’”, Peace &amp; Change, 28(2), April, p. 242)<br />
Terms that might be considered as …with a convincing ring of truth.<br />
<br />
<strong>The perm will get coopted.</strong><br />
<strong>Schwartz and Derber</strong> , member of Boston Nuclear Study Group and Prof of Sociology @ BC, 19<strong>90</strong><br />
(William and Charles, The Nuclear Seduction: Why the Arms Race Doesn’t Matter—And What Does, pg. 230-231)<br />
Similarly, to dominate the …narrow limits, can get one blacklisted.<br />
<br />
<strong>The perm fails. The state can make one minor concession while keeping the same system in place.</strong><br />
<strong>Schwartz and Derber</strong> , member of Boston Nuclear Study Group and Prof of Sociology @ BC, 19<strong>90</strong><br />
(William and Charles, The Nuclear Seduction: Why the Arms Race Doesn’t Matter—And What Does, pg. 234-235)<br />
<br />
A major movement victory such …without conceding anything of importance.<br />
<br />
<strong>Weaponitis K</strong><br />
<strong>Even if the alternative doesn’t gain steam, that’s a risk we have to take. It’s still better than the 1AC.</strong><br />
<strong>Schwartz and Derber</strong> , member of Boston Nuclear Study Group and Prof of Sociology @ BC, 19<strong>90</strong><br />
(William and Charles, The Nuclear Seduction: Why the Arms Race Doesn’t Matter—And What Does, pg. 235-236)<br />
True, many businesspeople, professionals, …accepting the establishment's invitation to dance.
