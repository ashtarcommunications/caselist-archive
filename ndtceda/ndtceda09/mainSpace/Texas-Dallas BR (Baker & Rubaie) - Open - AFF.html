Developments in American politics<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> such as political polarization have not only encouraged this effort by leaders but </span>have<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> also </span>enabled interest groups to tie their particular domestic concerns to the more activist foreign policy agenda, and they have encouraged opportunistic leaders<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> to use foreign policy as a salient issue in domestic political debate. </span><br />

ADVANTAGE TWO is PRIMACY –<br />
<br />
First, counterforce targeting fuels and locks in nuclear primacy<br />

For nearly half a century, the world's most powerful nuclear-armed states have been locked in a condition of mutual assured destruction… n9 Nuclear weapons may no longer produce the peace-inducing stalemate that they did during the Cold War. n10<br />

Counterforce is the *key internal link* to nuclear primacy<br />

<br />
One final point must be made… Absent this I am not optimistic about a move toward mutual deterrence at low numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Two internal links – FIRST is SUPERPOWER WAR –<br />
<br />
Conflicts will escalate to great power nuclear warfare – perception-based conflict will fuel arms races, accidents, and unauthorized use – *even if* Russia and China don’t modernize it will still trigger nuclear war in a crisis<br />
<br />

Lexis.<br />
<br />
One might argue that the various new U.S. initiatives discussed above do not reflect the deliberate pursuit of nuclear primacy,… In a new era of U.S. nuclear primacy, U.S. policymakers may once again be tempted to consider nuclear escalation during intense crises or if nonnuclear military operations go unexpectedly badly for the United States (e.g., in Korea). n72<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND is TRANSITION –<br />
<br />
Primacy will inevitably collapse – attempts to reform the squo accelerate decline – only a shift in strategy can soften the effects of America’s landing<br />
<br />
Robert A. Pape, ‘9. “Empire Falls,” The National Interest, January 2009 - February 2009. Lexis.<br />
<br />
AMERICA IS in unprecedented decline. … our own hubris may be our downfall.<br />

<br />
Feffer, ‘9. John, Contributing Member/Researcher at Foreign Policy in Focus, “World Beat,” FPIF, Feb 17. Vol. 4 No. 7. Lexis.<br />
<br />
The neoconservative movement thrilled to what it called the &quot;unipolar moment.&quot; … Debt has been the gravedigger of many an empire. I can hear the adding machine totting up the numbers.<br />
<br />
‘Heg bad’ isn’t responsive – it speaks to a type and not a trait of power – unipolarity is distinct<br />
<br />
Ikenberry et al, ‘9. “Unipolarity, State Behavior, and Systemic Consequences,” World Politics, Volume 61, Number 1, January.<br />
<br />
Scholars use the term unipolarity to distinguish a system with one extremely capable state from systems with two or more great powers (bi-, tri-, and multipolarity)…conventionally defined as size of population and territory, resource endowment, economic capacity, military might, and organizational-institutional “competence.”8<br />
*Even if* primacy is good, counterforce decimates the available arsenal and allows a third nation to assume primacy<br />
<br />
Wirtz, ‘7. “The Short Shadow of U.S. Primacy?” International Security 31.3 (2007)<br />
<br />
There is a final irony embodied in Lieber and Press's scenario… Given the variety of dynamics that might animate multipolar nuclear relationships, it might be time to explore the nature and points of crisis stability among several states that possess nuclear arsenals that differ in size and survivability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION TWO – SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
The plan solves escalation and miscalculation risks – comparatively ending the counterforce mission is the most effective way to reduce all current posture risks.<br />
<br />
Dr Marko Beljac, ‘9. “The Case for Minimum Nuclear Deterrence,” Science and Global Security, 7-24-09, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scisec.net/?p=154" rel="nofollow">http://scisec.net/?p=154</a>.<br />
<br />
Nuclear war can best be seen as a form of risk externality. … But everything has its proper time and place.<br />
<br />
Declaratory policy alone is only propaganda unless our missions change.<br />
<br />
Arbatov, ‘8<br />
<br />

<br />
However, as mentioned above, the main deficiency of the NFU idea is that it remains wishful thinking, completely detached from real defense and security considerations of nuclear weapon states.…or such a pledge will be a PR exercise having no more sense than the Soviet pledge of 1982 (or for that matter than China’s negative assurance of 1995 which will be addressed in more detail below).<br />
<br />
<br />
Only the case can solve – counterforce is the mission that drives ALL US nuclear doctrinal requirement – ONLY A DRIRECT order from the president can change how STRATCOM targets.<br />
<br />

<br />
This report argues that, as long as the United States continues these nuclear missions unjustifiably held over from the Cold War, nuclear weapons will contribute more to the nation’s and the world’s insecurity than they contribute to their security. …Nuclear weapons are so destructive that much smaller forces, of initially 1,000 warheads, and later a few hundred warheads, are more than adequate to serve as a deterrent against anyone unwise enough to attack the United States with nuclear weapons.<br />

The value of endangered species and the biodiversity they embody is &quot;literally ... incalculable.&quot; 343 … Natural evolution may in due course renew the earth with a diversity of species approximating that of a world unspoiled by Homo sapiens -- in ten million years, perhaps a hundred million.<br />

 US nuclear primacy is part and parcel with the US imperial project of domination of the world through expanded nuclear capability through threats of first strike<br />

The preservation of US primacy has historically manifests itself in racist and imperial practices that sacrifice the life to persuade the world of its dominance<br />

<br />

The violence of American nuclear imperialism is rooted in an objectification of the through the technostrategic discourse of late capitalism whose homogenizing view leads to the destruction of difference and legitimates the expansion of capitalist exploitation for too long this view of the globe has been the foundation of first world views that have lead to marginilizations of populations. These vision of the globe informs the entirety of American culture. The debate community is part and parcel with this system of exclusion as debate arguments and research practices create a false sense of omnipotence about global politics this vision is predicated on a uniquely western vantage point that continues the suppression of difference<br />
Kato 93 (Masahide, ‘nuclear Globalism: Traversing Rockets, Satellites and Nuclear war via the strategic gaze” Alternatives, 18)<br />
As I have argued, the objectification. . .progression of capitalism<br />
<br />
The Western Rationality that drives US nuclear primacy is responsible for ongoing and racist nuclear war atrocities of nuclear use in Japan and ongoing nuclear conflict against indigenous and Fourth World peoples is the ultimate example of the worst forms of strategy<br />

Plan – the United States will end all activities which attempt to enshrine American nuclear primacy.<br />
<br />
2 Vote aff – this is crucial to unraveling the construction of global space and time that is leading to the extermination of the periphery. Only our aff allows for a reinvention of space allowing marginalized communities to resist the global integration of capital – this unraveling of technostrategic discourse is vital not just to end US primacy but in the reformulation of debate and debate research practices. We must end the debate community’s neutralization of space through the technosubjectivization of the glove which is predicated on a belief in western omnipotence<br />

Can blacks, whites, and others who have for hundreds of years… Is love possible? Is freedom possible?<br />

<strong>Saying “we don’t exclude those people” is the link – It’s the omission that creates the black/white paradigm with effaces difference</strong><br />

Paradigms of race shape our understanding of race and our definition of racial problems… “those that will not fit the box are often not seen at all.”<br />

<strong>Reject the affirmative – they are an inappropriate method for analyzing social relations – their monolithic conception of whiteness and white privilege short-circuits access to solvency and leads to the duplication of stereotypes</strong><br />

At stake in these various critiques of whiteness is the matter of whether this mode of inquiry is a reliable means… self-reflection about these types of problems.
