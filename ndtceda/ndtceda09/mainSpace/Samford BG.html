Off Case Args:<br />
Vagueness—don’t explain what sole purpose is<br />
Financial Reform<br />
A) Financial reform will pass now--<br />
Matthew Rusling, 3/19/2010 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2010-03/19/c_13217313.htm" rel="nofollow">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2010-03/19/c_13217313.htm</a> )<br />
U.S. Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd…spark widespread economic calamity.<br />

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama…have the political capital to do so.<br />
<br />
D) Impact<br />
1) Failure to pass financial reform guarantees another financial meltdown:<br />
Sahil Kapur, 2/3/2010 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://rawstory.com/2010/02/consumer-groups-volcker-rule-most-important-financial-reform-initiative/" rel="nofollow">http://rawstory.com/2010/02/consumer-groups-volcker-rule-most-important-financial-reform-initiative/</a>)<br />
As the Senate debates financial reform… and that's a huge problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Economic collapse is extinction<br />
T.E. Bearden 2000 Fellow, Alpha Foundation’s Institute for Advaned Study &amp; Director, Association of Distinguished American Scientists, “The Unnecessary Energy Crisis: How to Solve It Quickly,” ADAS POSITION PAPER: SOLUTION TO THE ENERGY CRISIS, June 12, 2K. Available from the World Wide Web at: www.cheniere.org/techpapers/Unnecessary%20Energy%20Crisis.doc,<br />
<br />
History bears out that desperate…at least for many decades.<br />
<br />
AIPAC Attack<br />
AIPAC and obama are currently at odds over new Jewish settlements in East Jursalem<br />
Montopoli 3/15 (Brian)<br />
That blunt criticism was followed… are fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan.”<br />
<br />
Nuclear reductions are perceieved as appeasing Iran<br />
Gardiner 9 (Nile “Is Obama the most naieve president in U.S. history?)<br />
It is hard to fathom what the United States will… an increasingly dangerous world.<br />
<br />
AIPAC opposes any weakness to Iran<br />
Remba 7 (Gidon)<br />
American Jewish supporters of Israel… Iran must be vigorously pursued.<br />
<br />
Perceived losses by AIPAC cause them to fight for other gain—history proves Obama and Congress will cave<br />
Mearsheimer and Walt 6 (lexis)<br />
In April 2002 trouble erupted… with the help of the lobby<br />
<br />
AIPAC will demand attack on Syria<br />
Business Recorder 7 (Lexis)<br />
The AIPAC and its allies… with potentially disastrous effects.<br />
<br />
Invasion of Syria would cause a massive ME conflict<br />
Simpson 5 (Dan)<br />
There is some question as to how America’s military… in replicating Iraq in Syria?<br />
<br />
NNS CP<br />
The President should release a National Security Strategy including a statement that adopting a policy of [the plan] is vital to the national security of the United States.<br />
<br />
It competes—the NSS is a recommendation—not legally binding<br />
Caudle 9 (“National security strategies: security from what, for whom, and by what means”)<br />
Third, it is unclear who… could run counter to departmental independence.<br />
<br />
CP Solves<br />
Caudle 9 (“National security strategies: security from what, for whom, and by what means”)<br />
But the specifics of a national… between resources and strategic goals.<br />
<br />
Leadership Adv CP<br />
The US federal government should develop and implement a mobile Sea Basing naval capability as quickly as possible aimed at ensuring adequate United States forward deployent and power projection capabilities.<br />
<br />
Seabasing massively increase US power project<br />
Flynn 9 “Seabasing”<br />
In March 2005 the new National Defense… expeditionary power projection.<br />
<br />
Prolif Adv CP<br />
The USFG should push for the formation of a global energy agency for green technology and supplment the International Atomic Energy Agency’s work by assisting other countries in the development of nonnuclear energy.<br />
<br />
Pushing for global energy agency and green energy tech solves prolif and strips nuclear weapons of their prestige value<br />
Ferguson 10 (Charles)<br />
Just as Eisenhower led the way toward… irrational desires for atomic energy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Block Strategy:<br />
2NC—kicked out of APAC, went for the NNS CP, conventional deterrence (mpx turned hardpower/primacy—hurts softpower/leadership/cooperation), case (prolif and deterrence)<br />

Just who is being targeted…dropped from recommendation (Farren, 1992).<br />
<br />
Disarmament does not solve war. It causes deadlier weapons to fill in the void of nuclear weapons and makes rogue nuclear attacks more likely<br />
Brian Martin 84 “Principles for Antiwar Strategies” Uprooting War<br />
If all the military…than nuclear disarmament.<br />
<br />
Demands against the state do nothing—it defeats its protesters and raises up its power<br />
Brian Martin 94 “Protest in a Liberal Democracy, Philosophy and Social Action” Vol. 20 Nos. 1-2 pp. 13-24<br />
Permeating the dominanet political..sustain those same dominant groups.<br />
<br />
No value to life accepts the philosophical premise of Nazi Germany style murders and concentration camps that respect for life does not entail preserving life<br />
Steven Neeley 94 “The Constitutional Right To Suicide, The Quality of Life, and the “Slippery-slope”: An explicit reply to lingering concerns”<br />
The final solution in…of respect for human life.<br />
<br />
Strategic decision-making is inevitable—the failure to use empirical standards of analysis causes personal beliefs of policymakers to fill the void<br />
Fitzsimmons 6<br />
Why is this important?...the decision-makers themselves.<br />
<br />
Fear of Nuclear Weapons is good: becoming blasé about nuclear war risks extinction<br />

But the inhibitory effect…it might otherwise lack.<br />
Turn: Peace activism- fear of nuclear weapons is key to stopping their use and allowing peace activism to create a more peaceful society<br />

I could say that…might otherwise lack.<br />
<br />
We need the fear of nuclear weapons to break down nuclearism and de-nuclearize<br />
Jay Lifton World Policy Journal Spring 2001 pg. 25<br />
We need to replace psychic..pursue saner, life-enhancing projects.<br />
<br />
Imagining future nuclear scenarios enable criticism of nuclear weapons ability to destroy all humankind<br />
James Foard 1997 “Imagining Nuclear Weapons: Hiroshima, Armageddon, and the Annihilation of the Students of Ichijo School” Journal of the American Academy of Religion<br />
This ambivalence about Hiroshima…that no one will win.<br />
<br />
Abandoning deterrence invites nuclear proliferation and first strikes on U.S. soil. Attempts to move away from deterrence are utopian dreams.<br />
Robert Monroe 2009 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.airpower.au.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj09/spr09/monroe" rel="nofollow">www.airpower.au.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj09/spr09/monroe</a><br />
We would be ill…global conventional conflagrations.<br />
<br />
Targeting doesn’t determine intention. Deterrence is moral<br />
Finnis Boyle Grisez 87 “Nuclear Deterrence, Morality and Realism” pg. 156-157<br />
We know by now…for the present deterrent.<br />
<br />
Nuclear deterrence prevents multiple scenarios for nuclear war<br />
Foster 2001 La Times lexis<br />
In the post-Sept. 11 world…an ample U.S. nuclear arsenal.<br />
Future is not shrouded in mystery we can make some predictions about future events<br />
Michael Fitzsimmons 2006 Survival, December<br />
Additionally, the notion that…facing US national security.<br />
<br />
Focusing on nuclear weapons alone glosses over core forces driving their development and distracts from conventional weaponry that could kill hundreds of millions.<br />
Brian Martin 84 “Nuclear Disarmament is not enough” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/90uw/uw01.html" rel="nofollow">www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/90uw/uw01.html</a><br />

Is the state system…even the most well<br />
<br />
This conventional fill-in casuses nuclear breakouts during disarmament, frequent conventional war, and Al fill in that culminates in extinction<br />
George Dvorsky 9 “The Perils of Nuclear Disarmament: How Relinquishment Could Result in Disaster” 3-31 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/2985/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/2985/</a><br />
<br />
Conservative fill-in: belief in strategic uncertainty causes conservatives to fill in the void—justifying arms build-ups to confront the unknown:<br />
Michael Fitzsimmons 2006 Survival, December<br />
While the NPR is classified…now more credible.’<br />
<br />
Turn: Reliance on predictive tests requires decision-makers to expose their beliefs—this makes them easier to challenge<br />
Michael Fitzsimmons 2006 Survival, December<br />
Ultimately, though, the value…to say yes or no.’<br />
<br />
Turn: Dismissing predictive models locks in the status quo—turning the kritik:<br />
Michael Fitzsimmons 2006 Survival, December<br />
Moreover, this style of decision-making…confirmatory bias on the other.<br />

 Text: The United States federal government shall substially reduce and restrict the role and missions of the United States nuclear weapons that are not artistic.<br />
The Affirmative uses overly technical language to avoid using the term “nuclear weapons.” This form of obfuscation is not neutral but rather functions- to make nuclear weapon use thinkable<br />
Hook 85 Security Dialogue Vol. 16. No. 1<br />
The purpose of focusing…instead of an aberration.<br />
<br />
The counterplan’s word replacement is a small step but it makes a huge difference—linguistic choices help shape our understanding of reality in a way that can authorize or work against nuclear genocide.<br />
Hook 85 Security Dialogue Vol. 16. No. 1<br />
The discussion so far…new way of looking at reality.<br />
<br />
<br />
Framework<br />
Our Argument: Debate is best conceived of in terms of a competing dialogue- the creation of a “counter-word” to accompany the “word” is necessary to create genuine understanding:<br />
Bahktin 1990 The Rhetorical Tradition pg. 944<br />
We have already had…with the light of meaning. <br />
<br />
Fairness norms are critical to fostering an effective dialogic abandoning them undermines pluralism and diversity<br />
Star Muir 1993 pg. 290-291<br />
A final point about relativism…reasoned moral conviction.<br />
