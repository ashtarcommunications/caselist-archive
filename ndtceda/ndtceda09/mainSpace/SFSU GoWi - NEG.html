<strong><u>Nuclear Colonialism K</u><br />
(We have run some version of this K every tournament)<br />
<br />
Internal colonialism means that the federal government has complete control over who, what, and how it exploits indigenous people. America’s globally dominant economic and military power is at the expense of American Indian systematic disempowerment and death.</strong><br />
<strong>Churchill 1997</strong> (Ward, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and the Denial in the Americas 1492 to Present, City Lights Books, San Francisco, 1997, Prof. American Indian Studies at the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder pg. 292-93)<br />
“Under the neatly crafter system…the internal colonies of the native North”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Assertions of legitimacy in the interest of the world are exactly the same as the USFG’s tyranny over Native Americans and assured their subsequent genocide</strong><br />
<strong>Churchill 1997</strong> (Ward, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and the Denial in the Americas 1492 to Present, City Lights Books, San Francisco, 1997, Prof. American Indian Studies at the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder pg. 290-92)<br />
“According to the final (1979) report…consent to massive resource expropriation.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Nuclear colonialism cannot be maintained—putting all human existence in peril.</strong><br />
<strong>Churchill 2002</strong> (Ward, “Struggle for the land: Native American Reisistence to genocide, ecocide, and colonization.” pg 278)<br />
“Neither genocide nor ecocide can be…once their victims have died.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Decolonization of indigenous land is key to resolving the entire nuclear dilemma. This must be our first priority.</strong><br />
<strong>Churchill 1997</strong> (Ward, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and the Denial in the Americas 1492 to Present, City Lights Books, San Francisco, 1997, Prof. American Indian Studies at the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder pg. 347-49)<br />
“Plainly, the nuclear establishment has…rapidly opening beneath our feet.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Along with this, there has been some slew of case arguments depending on the team, they are as follows</em>:<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Baudrillard</u><br />
<br />
Attempting to re-assign meaning to the nuclear weapons is simply as over attempt to cover the absence of any true meaning- This overproduction of culture and art fosters cultural alienation. T/ Case<br />
Baudrillard 96.</strong> [Jean, March 16, &quot;The Global and the Universal&quot;]<br />
&quot;Culture is a form of glory ... discount of degradable projects.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Modern art has become part of the technical operation to cover the absence of the real by making it more real through abstraction, and the affirmative's use of aesthetics to find truth reduces their activism to banal utopia of new simulation.<br />
Baudrillard 05.</strong> [&quot;The intelligence of eveil or the lucidity pact.&quot; Translated by Chris Turner. 105-107]<br />
&quot;The adventure of modern...in this circular definition.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Using objects to uncover their &quot;true&quot; meaning (and ultimately gloss over the void of truth) leads to aesthetic of banality.<br />
Baudrillard, 05.</strong> [&quot;The intelligence of eveil or the lucidity pact.&quot; Translated by Chris Turner. 109-112]<br />
&quot;Art, in its form...current destruction of art.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Militarism biz:</u><br />
The Cartesian concept of the sovereign self, that is the Self-I-Eye of the United States, in relations to the other as a self referential form of knowledge that sets into place and order the idealized self in relation to the monstrous other creating not only the justification but the moral obligation to pursue war.<br />
Chow 06.</strong> [Rey. The Age of the World Target: Self Referentiality in War, Theory and Comparative World. 36-37]<br />
&quot;In the decades since 1945...and Other in general&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>The impact is biopolitical violence. The state becomes the aggressor who decides who lives and who dies.<br />
Giroux 07. <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Henry. The University in Chains: Confronting the Military Industrial Academic Complex. 24-25]<br />
&quot;Within the last few decades...targets of control and regulation&quot;</span></strong><br />

<strong><u>Weaponitis</u></strong><br />
<strong>The 1AC is the new form of anti-nuclear nuclearism that relies on the protection of nuclear materials while rhetorically being disingenuous to disarmament.</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman Bold',helvetica,sans-serif;"><strong>This act of anti-nuclear nuclearism uses the rhetoric of de-emphasizing nuclear capabilities in order to expand U.S. military superiority</strong></span><br />

The affirmative does not solve the root of militarism. Failure to recognize the long standing reliance on imperialism and militarism lead to continued violence of U.S. hegemony.</strong><br />
