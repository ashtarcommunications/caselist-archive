<br />
Only COMPLETE and UNILATERAL removal of US TNWs solves<br />
<br />
First – Reciprocal Concessions<br />
<br />
The plan is a critical concession to Russia – it induces Russia to reciprocate on TNW reductions and it builds confidence and trust towards broader nuclear cooperation<br />

This evidence of positive reciprocity in the current U.S.-Russian … nuclear weapons much more difficult to accomplish.<br />
<br />
And - TNWs have no deterrent value – US removal of its TNWs from Europe is key to Russian reciprocity<br />

Second – Dialogue<br />
<br />
US withdrawing first is the necessary precondition to get Russia willing to even negotiate about removing their own – plan spurs quick dialogue<br />

<br />
In addition, withdrawal is a precondition for <u>.. and technology around the world.</u><br />
<br />
And – even if no formal arms control is reached, unilateral action eases Russian fears of US intentions – boosts relations and prevents an accidental launch<br />
