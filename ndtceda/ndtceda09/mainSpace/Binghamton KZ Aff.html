Binghamton – Aliens – KZ?<br />
<br />
Plan Text: RESOLVED: That the President of the United States should issue an executive order to immediately dismantle the entire nuclear weapons arsenal of the United States and publically announce the prohibition of their use.<br />
<br />
NASA will go public with the LCROSS mission results within the next few weeks<br />
Kelly Beatty 09<br />
“On the plus side, the engineering team for LCROSS…the spectral match is still tentative and more data- crunching is in progress.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The coming release of the data from LCROSS will be used to pave the way for space colonization in the coming weeks.<br />
John Johnson Jr. 09<br />
“At the time, NASA scientists said they hoped…than it would be if settles had to transport water from earth.”<br />
<br />
<br />
NASA is funding the groundwork to take the information and apply it to colonization immediately.<br />
Johnson Space Center 09<br />
“…HOUSTON – NASA has chosen 18 proposals from universities…manager of the Steckler Space Grant Project at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The moon bombing and the noble peace prize has paved the way for Obama to either lead us into galactic war or universal peace between December 10th and the start of 2010 as disclosure happens<br />
Plazmuh 09<br />
“An official announcement by the Obama administration…an interplanetary culture that openly deals with the challenges posed by extraterrestrial life.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Movement towards colonization of the moon will be seen as an extension of nuclear power projection, undermining peace progression, and sparking an intergalactic war.<br />
Canadian Exopolitics Initiative, 05<br />
“A former Canadian Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister under Pierre…is also one of the organizations seeking Canadian Parliament hearings.<br />
<br />
<br />
If earth is destroyed in an intergalactic war, invaders would use our resource rich environment as a platform to launch an extensive intergalactic attack.<br />
Bruce Alan DeWalton 09<br />
“The draconian might, as suggested in the 12 chapter of the book of Revelation…end of the card disappeared.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 1: The Empire Strikes Back<br />
Disclosure of open contact with ETs is now inevitable<br />
Webre 09<br />
“On objective analysis, Barack Obama’s inaugural…of an equivalent social, culture, political, military, and spiritual impact as the war in Iraq.”<br />
<span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 11pt;"><br />

<br />
Observation Two: A New Hope<br />
Thankfully, Obama’s willingness to follow through with his promise to create a nuclear free world is the very diplomatic initiatives ETs are looking for to establish peace.<br />
Salla 09<br />
“Tomorrow morning President Obama gives a speech in Prague…xtraterrestrial visitors monitoring our world and destructive stockpiles of nuclear weapons.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Further, Obama has opened the right astrological pathways to enable Earth to rejoin the Universe Society if he can move America beyond its war path, which will be able to successfully spark the needed positive energy to change the world.<br />
Hand-Clow 09<br />
“It is the New Moon in Aquarius, the time of the year when we focus on personal and cultural ideals…which would be a great epithet for George W. Bush’s presidential tombstone.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Three: Revenge of the Sith<br />
First, failure to take action and eliminate nuclear weapons will further an era of power politics that disregards ethics and universal peace in the name of national interest, secrecy, xenophobic hatred, resulting in the development of new-wave high-tech weaponry, and ultimately preventing the creation of a balanced global defense.<br />
Salla 04<br />
“’Power politics’ refers to the Realpolitik practiced by a variety of national leaders…threatening any modernization programs underway and a coordinated response to the extraterrestrial presence.”<br />
<br />
<br />
This power politics produces a self-fulfilling prophecy since manipulative ETs continue to feed off our negative energy to produce more violence to pave the way for future manipulation until we make the choice to embrace positivity.<br />
Suzanne Pilon 07<br />
“You may have wondered why humanity on Earth seems to…however is simply being aware of the existence and effects of these energies.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Fortunately, abolishing nuclear weapons will enable Earth’s re-entry into the Unvierse society will prevent numerous scenarios of planetary extinction and omnicide.<br />
Webre 08<br />
“Advanced ethical extraterrestrial society is signaling…and absolutely necessary to planetary, human and biosphere survival.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if we don’t win our claims about the Universe Society, working to abolishing nuclear weapons within the framework of exopolitics can usher in a new era of terrestrial peace and avert the proliferating wars and extinctions ongoing in the status quo.<br />
Burkes 07<br />
“To help prevent war and hopefully usher in a new era of interplanetary…such a movement would change the course of history. There is much work to be done!”<br />
<span style="font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 11pt;"><br />

<br />
Observation Four: Return of the Jedi<br />
Your ballot matters since our expectations about how open contact goes down is essential to further our educational investigation in order to avoid political manipulation by government elites over alien contact.<br />
Salla 05<br />
“Groups of individuals are emerging around the world…how that new world will be shaped by our expectations and aspirations.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore, we must understand politics as more than just an academic exercise since our universal rights are up for grabs, and whether it ends in violent repression or freedom is up to us.<br />
Webre 2000<br />
“What matters now is that we are here tonight in our bodies politic. Politics…violently and repressively, or expansively in freedom – is in some sense up to us.”
