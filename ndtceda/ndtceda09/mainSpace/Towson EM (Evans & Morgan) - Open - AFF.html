1. One overstands the nature of ones being in the collective cultural community from which one is apart<br />
2. There is a fundamental respect for the humanity of all<br />
3. There is a fundamental respect for nature<br />
4. There must be an ethnographic/anthropological component to the research produced via an<br />

The rest of the evidence is embedded in a poem about the state of Black America, the role Towson plays in the debate community, and military industrial complex. they don't really have &quot;tags&quot; per say<br />

As a nigger your historical greatness like Timbuktu, black jesus and stories of Isis and Ra right along with regenal f lewis ‘wealth are all myths<br />
So you can only begain to overstand controlling a ppl’s history causes a spiritual, emotional, and psychological rift<br />
White supremacy uses institutions like religion and history to legitimate its truth and force negro’s to accept white nationalist interpretations.<br />

Now , we right around the modern wars<br />
They promised you that participating in these will open up doors<br />
you being a nigger , you believed them and instead you where thrown into this militarily constructed ex jewish communal cores<br />
These same cores now called ghettos are where tupac suggested that the new nigger arose<br />
Your niggerness had you missed out on the american new deal<br />
But it did give you access to the industrial capitalistic hamster wheel<br />

Now that you got my eyes you can’t see how when this form is about who liberate the oppressed they can still run framework for almost 9mins<br />
That translates to me “to die nigger die” with a entire list of anti-subjectivity tenates<br />
The sight of niggers make yall fear us<br />
No crying cuz we snatching everything including tear ducks<br />
Cuz all yall politics ,<br />
Is nothing but a pile of tricks,<br />
they never solve any of our problems but all the niggers of color is suppose to be already in the mix<br />

<br />
Think about it they test the nucs near the rural ppl or in their farms<br />
But letsnot forget dem ghettoes<br />

As a nigger college student I got an obligation to my community<br />
b/c my history tells me aint no fruit in just doin me<br />

So guess what, I’m roll with the ballot<br />
Cuz this aint no toss up like a geek salad<br />
African psychology is what it is<br />
