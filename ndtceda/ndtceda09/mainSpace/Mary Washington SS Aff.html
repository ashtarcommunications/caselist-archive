Unilateralism – Bunker busters are the critical next step in US unilateralism and destruction of nuclear non-use norms<br />

The Pentagon has developed a new AND once said, &quot;just business.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unilateral nuclear weapons policies and the destruction of international arms norms guarantee extinction – only strong institutions can constrain global violence and prevent a war of all against all<br />
Demenchonok, Fort Valley State University, Russian Academy of Sciences Philosophy Institute Senior Researcher, 2009<br />

Obama needs to make a strong and explicit announcement rejecting the role of bunker busters in the US arsenal to demonstrate US nuclear posture to the international community<br />
Perry, Harvard Preventive Defense Project Former Co-Director, Former US Defense Secretary, Stanford Professor, Hoover institute fellow, and Scowcroft, Former National Security Advisor to Ford and H.W. Bush, April 2009<br />

Over the past eight years, AND<br />
allies and other nonnuclear weapon states.<br />
<br />
Bunker busters are the single greatest issue for global perceptions for nuclear use and US pre-emption<br />
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 3/20/2007<br />
[&quot;Foreign Perspectives on U.S. Nuclear Policy and Posture,&quot; <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/events/index.cfm?fa=eventDetail&amp;id=974&amp;&amp;prog=zgp&amp;proj=znpp" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/events/index.cfm?fa=eventDetail&amp;id=974&amp;&amp;prog=zgp&amp;proj=znpp</a></span>]<br />
<br />
The first category in the report’s AND<br />
yield options for some time now.<br />
<br />
Multiple scenarios for nuclear war<br />
First, Conflict Escalation – Bunker busters cause a race to first-strike even in relatively stable conflicts – perceptions that other nations have mini-nuke capabilities make miscalculation likely<br />
Glaser, U Chicago Public Policy Studies School Deputy Dean and Professor, and Fetter, UMD Public Policy Dean and Professor, 2005<br />

<br />
Second, Modeling – US focus on making nuclear weapons “usable” is modeled globally and results in global pre-emptive wars including India-Pakistan, Russian aggression, Israel-Iran war<br />
Hitchens, Center for Defense Information VP, 2/26/2003<br />
[Theressa, &quot;Slipping Down the Nuclear Slope:Bush Administration Nuclear PolicyLowers Bar Against Usage,&quot;<span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/nuclear/counterproliferation-conference.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/nuclear/counterproliferation-conference.cfm</a></span>, 11/14]<br />
<br />
So, Bush administration thinking can AND<br />
in justifying it's own nuclear aggression?<br />
<br />
Third, Nuclear taboo - US bunker buster policy creates a precedent that erodes the no first use norm – this makes escalation of conflicts into global nuclear war inevitable<br />
Friedman, Center for Defense Information Independent Analyst, April 2002<br />
[Benjamin, &quot;Mini–Nukes, Bunker–Busters, and Deterrence: Framing the Debate,&quot; CIAO]<br />
Arms control advocates attack proponents of AND<br />
of power with their potential adversaries.<br />

5. The counterplan is not competitive - The counterplan only questions how the plan should be implemented, not if it should <br />
