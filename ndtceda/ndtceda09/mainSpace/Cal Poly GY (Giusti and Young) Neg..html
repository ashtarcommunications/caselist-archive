1. Radical opposition to the system affirms its existence. Opposing discourses allow the system to simulate its own death and delay its collapse.<br />

2.Speaking out and raising awareness is playing into the hands of the system they criticize, because it is intended to maximize speech without creating change. Instead, we need to engage the system through passive resistance, not active opposition.<br />

1. The images of catastrophe and destruction they present in the 1AC are like a drug, used by the first world nations to feed off the suffering of the rest of the world. Their efforts to solve these problems are co-productive with the disasters themselves, and this constant search for new spectacle will lead to the destruction of the human species in the quest to satiate our need for catastrophe<br />
Baudrillard in 94 [Jean, “The Illusion of the End” p. 66-71]We have long denounced the....own death as a species.<br />
2.Bereft of values, our society demands images of suffering from others to replenish our moral sentiment. We exchange our pity for their pain, in a process that guarantees the suffering must continue.<br />
