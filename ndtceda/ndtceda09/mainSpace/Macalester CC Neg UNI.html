1)Determinations, Attitudes and Ideas of Gender are of Profound importance with regard to nuclear weapons- the problems of the 1AC can be addressed only when we begin with the way that masculine assumptions shape nuclear discourse<br />
Cohn and Hill, “ The Revelence of Gender for eliminating weapons of mass destruction,” Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission Report<br />
<br />
--- when trying to think… about effective disarmament<br />
<br />
<br />
2) even the plan’s attempt to manage the danger of nuclear weapons depends on a command of strength and security which excludes any challenge to its perspective- within this discourse we cannot see of legitmate challenges to its truth<br />
Tickner 92, Gender in International Relations: Feminist Perspectives on Achieving Global Secutity<br />
<br />
--- the nuclear age military… view the international system<br />
<br />
3) The system of realist state centered dialogue continues exactly this problematic- the existence of war and international violence depends precisely on ignoring the masculine assumptions in which that which is not explicitly “of” politics or the state is rendered fit for destruction- turns the case and terminates in extinction<br />
Steans 98, An Introduction, p. 108-109<br />
<br />
--- critical approaches to international relations…. Come to understand their lives<br />
<br />
4) ALT- reject the affs use of the state securitized discourse in favor of a feminist methodology- attending to the interconnected and gendered nature of the violence outlined in the 1AC is crucial to open new ways of understanding and escape the self fulfilling prophecies of the status quo<br />
Youngs 04, International Affairs 80, 1, 75- 87, “ Feminist International Relations; a contradiction in terms? Or: why women and gender are essential to understanding the world we ‘live in”<br />
<br />
--- this characteristic of the state and issues…. Conventional and critical perspectives<br />
<br />
5) The hyper- masculine focus on negative peace and security allows for the reverence and celebration of violence which excludes women and renders all forms of violence possible<br />
Tickner 92, Gender in International Relations: Feminist Perspectives on Achieving Global Secutity<br />
<br />
--- since the beginning of the state system… outside the military establishment.
