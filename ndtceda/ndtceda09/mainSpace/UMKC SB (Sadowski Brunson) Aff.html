These are all of the authors and quotes we use in the pirates 1ac: the affirmative critiques traditional understandings of nuclear weapons and claims that we should include nuclear waste in our calculus of the harms of nuclear weapons<br />

... According to Elizabeth DeLoughrey, “the landscape of war has been increasingly understood as the visual media used to perpetuate and represent it.” <em>(Elizabeth DeLoughrey 2k9 Associate Professor of English at UCLA, Radiation Ecologies and the Wars of Light, Modern Fiction Studies Vol 55 No 3, project muse)</em> Furthermore, Kato describes the danger inherent in media representations: “the commercialization of the unconscious consolidates the First World way of seeing by disseminating images through the mass media.” <em>(Masahide; 1993 Dept of Poli Sci @ U of Hawaii; Nuclear Globalism: Traversing Rockets, Satellites, and Nuclear War via the Strategic Gaze; Alternatives 18)</em><br />

According to reporters from the Associated Press and Fox News, <br />

Peter Newell explains that “Despite the claims of the former World Bank Chief Economist Lawrence Summers that parts of the world, notably Africa, are &quot;under- polluted,&quot; it is misleading to understand the global allocation of environmental hazard in geographical terms.” <em>(Peter Newell 2k5; Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation, University of Warwick; Race, Class and the Global Politics of Environmental Inequality; Global Environmental Politics; MUSE)</em> In the words of Masahide Kato, “what is so characteristic of the global spatial order in late capitalism is a total eradication of &quot;the other&quot; by abolishing the notion of territory.” <em>(1993 Masahide; Dept of Poli Sci @ U of Hawaii; Nuclear Globalism: Traversing Rockets, Satellites, and Nuclear War via the Strategic Gaze; Alternatives 18)</em><br />
<em>...</em><br />
Kato explains that “what matters for the First World is no longer the relationship between self and other but self and matter,” <em>(1993 Masahide; Dept of Poli Sci @ U of Hawaii; Nuclear Globalism: Traversing Rockets, Satellites, and Nuclear War via the Strategic Gaze; Alternatives 18)</em> <br />
...<br />
Zizek explains that ... “subjective and objective violence cannot be perceived from the same standpoint: subjective violence is experienced as such against the background of a non-violent zero level. It is seen as a perturbation of the &quot;normal,&quot; peaceful state of things. However, objective violence is precisely the violence inherent to this &quot;normal&quot; state of things. Objective violence is invisible since it sustains the very zero-level standard against which we perceive something as subjectively violent.” <em>(Slavoj, senior researcher at the Institute of Sociology @ Univ. of Ljubljana, <u>Violence</u>, p. 1-2)</em> ...<br />
Peter Newell urges this change in focus: “the new international division of pollution feeds on entrenched patterns of social inequality etched along racial, class and gender lines, as well as constructing new patterns of environmental inequality.” <em>(Peter Newell 2k5; Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for the Study of Globalisation and Regionalisation, University of Warwick; Race, Class and the Global Politics of Environmental Inequality; Global Environmental Politics; MUSE)</em><br />
...<br />
Colleen Burke explains that militarism remains entrenched on an ideological level even if we challenge overt violence:<br />
<br />
“<strong><u>The ideological manifestations of militarism are</u></strong> ... which protects those in power.” (2k9 Colleen; March 19; Women and Militarism; Women's International League for Peace and Freedom; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wilpf.int.ch/publications/womenmilitarism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wilpf.int.ch/publications/womenmilitarism.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
Chris Cuomo explains “Crisis-driven attention to declarations of war might actually keep resisters complacent about and complicitous in the general presence of global militarism.” (1996 Chris, Hypatia, War is Not Just An Event: Reflections on the Significance of Everyday Violence, V 11, N 4)<br />

Our mission is to expose the darkest corners within the assumptions of the resolution, and our role is to stand firmly in opposition to the United States’ ongoing nuclear war against Somalia.
