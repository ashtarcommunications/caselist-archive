 Appeals for disarm = dangerous – divert academic and policy attention from realistic proposals to manage dangers of prolif – plan as zero traction<br />
O’Neil 5 (Andrew, IR at Flinders University, Comparative Strategy 24.4)<br />
“The objective of ridding the…nuclear proliferation in the years ahead”<br />

 -- Logocentrism K<br />
Idea of clarification in legislation is used to free a text from ambiguity – takes meaning away from texts and attempts to modify through speech<br />
Padgett 92 (CJ, Associate Justice, Hawaii Supreme Court)<br />
“The language of the original award…does not fit within the literal”<br />
<br />
Elevation of speech over written word is the most pervasie element of logocentrism – the assumption that oral clarification is somehow needed to give meaning to the plan is a wholesale denigration of texuality and an elevation of presence over absence<br />
Dasenbrock 88 (Reed Way, English at New Mexico State University)<br />
“Logocentrism: Privileging the spoken word…over writing, presence over absence.”<br />
<br />
Codification of logocentrism authorizes the worst gorms of genocidal exterminiation – political violence is made possible not only by institutional reality but by the metapjysics of presence that underpin philosophy. Confrontation with sources of international violence require a debunking of this philosophical tyranny<br />
Lilla 98 (Mark, Social thought studies at U Chicago)<br />
“Deconstruction was conceived in the spirit of…humanity would have to be forsworn.”<br />
<br />
Struggle to give clarity to text negates life itself - it is this desire to bring stability to language that replaces life with violence<br />
D’Ulisse 4 (J.E., contributing editor to new partisan)<br />
“In fact, what we now describe as…absence and death of the author.”<br />
<br />
This could not be more <br />
<br />
-- Minimal Deterrence CP<br />
The United States Federal Government should replace its nuclear counterforce mission with a minimal deterrence mission. <br />
<br />
Replacing counterforce with minimal deterrence is a critical step toward nuclear abolition while mainting deterrence<br />
Kristensen 9 (Hans M, Director – Nuclear Information Project, Federation of American Scientists)<br />
“This report argues that, as long as…No new weapons need be built.”<br />
<br />
Disarm fails and makes war more likely<br />
Rendall 7 (Matthew, Lecturer in Politics and IR at University of Nottingham, Nuclear Weapons and Inteergenerational Expoitation, Security Studes 16.4)<br />
“Whether states that already have…pay a larger share of the costs.” <br />
<br />
Minimal deterrence solves best – disarm causes nuclear catastrophe and makes rearmament inevitable<br />
Rendall 7 (Matthew, Lecturer in Politics and IR at University of Nottingham, Nuclear Weapons and Inteergenerational Expoitation, Security Studes 16.4)<br />
“Deterrence at very low numbers of…It is the more sustainable policy.”<br />
<br />
Effective deterrence control escalation and best predictor for war<br />
Sharp 8 (Dr. Walter Gary – Assoc Dep. General Counsel for International Affairs @ DOD &amp; Adjunct. Prof. of Law @ Georgetown, Democracy and Deterrence: Foundations for an Enduring Word Peace)<br />
“Moore concludes in solving the…responding to a totality of incentives”<br />
<br />
Alternative locks in war system – infinte number of root causes means only inventive theory solves<br />
Moore 4 (John Norton – Dir Center for Security Law @ UVA, Solving the War Puzzle: Beyond The Democratic Peace pg 41-42) <br />
“If major interstate war is predominatly…are dramatically increased or decreased”<br />
<br />
-- Boggs<br />
Aff is an attemp to move away from debate focus on mechanistic change of government policy – this form of politics ensures domination by elites <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">à</span> slavery and war<br />
Boggs 00 (Carol, Prof of political science @ USC, The end of politics, pg 250-251)<br />
“But it is very deceptive and misleading minimalism…Oakeshott’s Burkean muddling-through theories.”<br />
<br />
Abandonment of policy formulation is dangerous in the area of nukes – discussion of nuclear postures and its consequences is necessary to avert nuclear catastrophe<br />
Stimson 1 (Beyond deterrence: A global approach to reducing nuclear dangers, a report on US nuclear weapons polic by the new nuclear direction dialogue)<br />

CP-<br />
USFG should remove its weapons currently stored in Europe to the US and offer, in conjunction with this remocal, to end nuclear sharing with NATO if Russian federation agrees to increase the transparency of its TNW arsenal and confine its TNW to central storage facilities deep within its national terrirories<br />

<strong>“Blow up in air” CP</strong><br />
<br />
TEXT: The United States Federal Government should install destruct-after-launch mechanisms on the United States’ nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, designed to allow remote destruction in either the armed ballistic missile fired in retaliation to warning of nuclear attack on the United States if such warning is revealed to be false.<br />
<br />
DAL systems resolve short decision-times – missiles can be destroyed in the air if warning turns out to be false<br />
Mosher -03 (David E. Mosher, Senior Policy Analyst at the RAND Corporation, et al., 2003, “Beyond the Nuclear Shadow: A Phased Approach for Improving Nuclear Safety and U.S.-Russian Relations”)<br />
OPTION 9: INSTAL DESTRUCT-AFTER LAUNCH….prevent the launch from occurring<br />
<br />
Boost phase destruction is feasible now – and destroys missiles before Russia would even detect them<br />
Mosher -03 (David E. Mosher, Senior Policy Analyst at the RAND Corporation, et al., 2003, “Beyond the Nuclear Shadow: A Phased Approach for Improving Nuclear Safety and U.S.-Russian Relations”)<br />
A mislaunched missile can be….for the DAL system to operate within<br />
<br />
The Net-Benefit…<br />
DAL systems make launch-on-warning a credible deterrent threat – resolving the risk of accidental launches while retaining a LOW capability make launch-on-warning key to deterring first-strike attempts<br />
Frankel -90 (Sherman Frankel, Professor of Physics at the University of Pennsylvania, “Aborting Unauthorized Launches of Nuclear-armed Ballistic Missiles through Postlaunch Destruction”)<br />

<br />
<strong>Launch-Under-Attack CP</strong><br />
<br />
Text: The United States federal government should eliminate the United States federal government’s nuclear launch under attack policy.<br />
<br />
Their plan bans the wrong thing – the DOD definition of “launch under attack” is a retaliatory strike while enemy missiles are in the air. “Launch-on-warning” refers to counterforce strikes before adversary launches that attempt to limit damage.<br />
