1AC—Nuclear War (1/1)<br />
<br />
Contention one is the Status Quo: <br />
<br />
US maintains its nuclear arsenal on high alert<br />
<br />
CDI, ‘7 (Center for Defense, “A Rebuttal of the U.S. Statement on the Alert Status of U.S. Nuclear Forces”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?documentid=4135" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/program/document.cfm?documentid=4135</a>, November 6) <br />
<br />
The nuclear superpowers manage their strategic AND on alert patrol: 12 minutes.   <br />
This causes a nuclear catastrophe<br />
<br />
McNamara, ‘5 (Robert, Secretary of State 1961-68 and World Bank president 1968-81, “Apocalypse Soon”, Foreign Policy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2829" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=2829</a>) <br />

<br />
1AC—Accidental Launches--Russia (1/2)<br />
<br />
Contention two is Accidents Happen: <br />
<br />
Scenario one is Russia <br />
Collapse of Russian early warning systems makes nuclear war inevitable due to false alarms and limited decision time <br />
Shorr, ‘1(Ira Shorr, expert with Foreign Policy In Focus , and the Director of Back From the Brink, a campaign to take nuclear weapons off high-alert status. “Nukes Remain on Hair Trigger” October 10, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fpif.org/commentary/0110nuke_body.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fpif.org/commentary/0110nuke_body.html</a>)<br />

<br />
While these actions helped the AND launch that could destroy our nations.&quot;  <br />
<br />
De-alerting US and Russian arsenal is crucial to preventing unauthorized and accidental launches avoiding a nuclear strike<br />
<br />
Blair and Samson, ‘8 (Bruce and Victoria, President of the World Security Institute and Senior Analyst at the Center for Defense Information, “Taking Nuclear Forces Off Day-to-Day Alert”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert</a>) <br />

<br />
AS LONG AS THE UNITED STATES AND case, it is inexcusably dangerous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1AC—Accidental Launches—India/Pakistan (1/2)<br />
<br />
Scenario two is India-Pakistan Conflict <br />
<br />
US-Russian de-alerting would prevent India and Pakistan from placing arsenals on high alert resulting in a nuclear attack<br />
<br />
Arbatov and Dvorkin, ‘5 (Alexei and Vladimir, Director of the Center for International Security and Institute for World Economy and International Relations, Senior researcher at the IMEMO Center for International Security; Director of 4th Central Scientific Research Institute of the Ministry of Defense, “Revising Nuclear Deterrence”, Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland, November) <br />
<br />
Over the next few years, AND de-alerting and deactivation regime.  <br />
SQ tensions between India and Pakistan make accidental war inevitable<br />
<br />
Berkow, ‘8 (James, Independent political science writer and worker for a pro-free market environmental think tank, “Tensions mount between India and Pakistan,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://us-armed-conflicts.suite101.com/article.cfm/us_missile_defense_shield_actually_works" rel="nofollow">http://us-armed-conflicts.suite101.com/article.cfm/us_missile_defense_shield_actually_works</a>)  <br />

<br />
1AC—Accidental Launches—China (1/2)<br />
<br />
Scenario three is China <br />
US nuclear pressure means China will continue building and modernizing their weapons to match US capabilities<br />
<br />
Kristensen, ‘6 (Hans, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, “Chinese Nuclear Resources and U.S. Nuclear War Planning,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nukestrat.com/china/Book-i-13.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nukestrat.com/china/Book-i-13.pdf</a>)  <br />
<br />
Part of China’s motivation to modernize AND arms race during the Cold War. <br />
<br />
<br />
Absent plan China will place weapons on high alert—US action to de-alert is crucial to prevent Chinese accidental launches<br />
<br />
Blair, ‘8 (Bruce, World Security Institute President, Former ICBM Launch Control Officer, Brookings Fellow, PhD, Bruce,  “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)”, Paper presented at International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament, Oslo February 26 – 27 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wpcontent/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wpcontent/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>) <br />
Such guidance would overturn the longstanding AND to a nuclear-free world.    <br />
China US War goes Nuclear<br />
<br />
Johnson ‘1 (Chalmers Johnson, author of Blowback: the Costs and Consequences of American Empire, 2001, The Nation, p 20)<br />
<br />
China is another matter.  No AND borders have virtually no deterrent effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1AC—Nuclear Terrorism—Theft (1/2)<br />
<br />
Advantage two is Nuclear Terrorism: <br />
<br />
Maintaining weapons on high alert increase chances of theft due to constant transportation<br />
<br />
Blair, ‘8 (Bruce, World Security Institute President, Former ICBM Launch Control Officer, Brookings Fellow, PhD, Bruce,  “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)”, Paper presented at International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament, Oslo February 26 – 27, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wpcontent/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wpcontent/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>) <br />
The simple fact that maintaining warAND combat-ready forces is ended.   <br />
Only de-alerting prevents terrorists from acquiring nuclear weapons and launching a full scale attack on the US <br />
<br />
Blair, ‘3 (Bruce, World Security Institute President, Former ICBM Launch Control Officer, Brookings Fellow, PhD, “Hair-Trigger Missiles Risk Catastrophic Terrorism”, Center for Defense Information, 4/29, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/blair/hair-trigger-dangers.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/blair/hair-trigger-dangers.cfm</a>) <br />

<br />
We have reached a point in AND , we will all be losers.    <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1AC—Nuclear Terrorism—Cyber (1/2)<br />
<br />
More specifically, High alerted weapons increases chances of cyber terrorism and cyber penetration<br />
<br />
Blair and Samson, ‘7 (Bruce and Victoria, President of the World Security Institute and Senior Analyst at the Center for Defense Information, “Taking Nuclear Forces Off Day-to-Day Alert”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceactionme.org/taking-nuclear-forces-day-day-alert</a>) <br />
<br />
A new concern has arisen about AND of increasingly sophisticated cyber-penetration.  <br />
De-alerting weapons prevents cyber terrorism and hacking operations<br />
<br />
Blair, ‘8 (Bruce, World Security Institute President, Former ICBM Launch Control Officer, Brookings Fellow, PhD, Bruce,  “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)”, Paper presented at International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament, Oslo February 26 – 27, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wpcontent/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wpcontent/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>) <br />
<br />
There are a host of reasons AND of computer signals carries real risk.    <br />
Cyber terrorism results in an inadvertent nuclear war<br />
<br />
Rosenbaum, ‘8 (Ross, Slate Staff Writer, “A Real Nuclear Option for the Nominees”, Slate, May 9, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2191104/pagenum/all/#page_start" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2191104/pagenum/all/#page_start</a>) <br />
So it's insanely short-fused AND -but-unauthorized nuclear launches.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1AC—Russian Cooperation (1/3)<br />
<br />
Advantage Three is Cooperation with the Bear: <br />
<br />
Not only are current deterrence policies ineffective, but high alert status continues to impede US-Russian cooperation<br />
<br />
Hansell and Potter et al, ‘9 (Christina and William, Nikolai N. Sokov, Jing-dong Yuan, Directors of Newly Independent States Nonproliferation Program and James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies Monterey Institute of International Studies James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, “Reducing Russia’s Reliance on Nuclear Weapons in Security Policies”)<br />
<br />
2. The second crucial step AND an accidental, unintended nuclear war.  <br />
<br />
US-Russian cooperation is crucial to Iranian and North Korean disarmament—this can only be achieved by ending the posture of mutual nuclear deterrence as per plan<br />
<br />
Hansell and Potter et al, ‘9 (Christina and William, Nikolai N. Sokov, Jing-dong Yuan, Directors of Newly Independent States Nonproliferation Program and James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies Monterey Institute of International Studies James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, “Reducing Russia’s Reliance on Nuclear Weapons in Security Policies”, pg 106) <br />
It must be especially emphasized that AND the posture of mutual nuclear deterrence.<br />
<br />
1AC—Russian Cooperation (2/3)<br />
<br />
North Korean proliferation will trigger Japanese proliferation<br />
<br />
Huntley, ‘6 (Wade L., “Rebels without a cause: North Korea, Iran and the NPT,” International Affairs, 82:4, The Royal Institute of International Affairs) <br />
First, a steadily (if AND armed state as a consequence.9  <br />
Japanese Prolif will cause an East Asian Arms Race<br />
<br />
Chanlett-Avery and Nikitin ‘9 Analyst in Asian Affairs in the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade division of Congressional Research Service and Research Associate for the Center for Strategic and International Studies /Emma and Mary, February 19, “Japan’s Nuclear Future: Policy Debate, Prospects, and U.S. Interests”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34487.pdf/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34487.pdf/</a> <br />
<br />
To many security experts, the AND the risks outweigh potential stabilizing factors. <br />
That will cause nuclear war<br />
<br />
Cirincione 2k (Joseph, Senior Associate and Director of the Non-Proliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment For International Peace, Foreign Policy, Spring)  <br />
The blocks would fall quickest and AND of a nuclear weapon since 1945. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1AC—Russian Cooperation (3/3)<br />
<br />
Absent Iranian disarmament, Israel will strike Iran results in a nuclear holocaust<br />
<br />
IHT, ‘8 (Benny Morris. a professor of Middle Eastern history at Ben-Gurion University, is the author, most recently. “Using bombs to stave off war” International Herald Tribune.

Which leaves only Israel - the AND holocaust would be in the cards. <br />
<br />
That draws in every major power<br />
<br />
Ivashov, ‘7 (General Leonid Ivashov, vice-president of the Academy on geopolitical affairs. He was the chief of the department for General affairs in the Soviet Union’s ministry of Defense, secretary of the Council of defense ministers of the Community of independant states (CIS), chief of the Military cooperation department at the Russian federation’s Ministry of defense and Joint chief of staff of the Russian armies. “Iran: the Threat of a Nuclear War” Global Research April 9, 2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5309" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=5309</a>) <br />
<br />
What might cause the force major AND respects much more nightmarish than WWII.<br />
<br />
1AC—Solvency (1/1)<br />
<br />
Contention three is Solvency <br />
U.S. must act unilaterally to de-alert weapons before Russia will follow<br />
<br />
NWCC, ‘9 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://pogoarchives.org/m/nss/nwccpn-report-20090401.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://pogoarchives.org/m/nss/nwccpn-report-20090401.pdf</a>) <br />
De-alerting a significant portion AND launch toward the U.S. <br />
<br />
US action gets Russia on board for reciprocal de-alert—verification is not a problem, empirically proven with START I<br />
