<strong>Our aff doesn't really have tag lines per se, it is structured kind of in the style of a narrative. These are the closest we have to tag lines.<br />
<br />
for indigenous and fourth world peoples, nuclear warfare is perpetuated and it's effects felt daily.</strong><br />

<br />
As of 1991...Fourth World and Indigenous Peoples.<br />
<br />
<strong>the discursive framing of an instrumental affirmation of the topic ensures viewing the world through the techno-strategic gaze which limits opposition to nuclear testing while simultaneously legitimizing more. Kato continues.<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Masahide Kato, same source as above.<br />
<br />
From the perspectives of...almost on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
</span></strong><strong>many nuclear debates this year will choose to approach the topic in a seemingly benign way- pretending to politically manages our admittedly dangerous nuclear policy and genuinely want to save lives. but under this benign appearance lies a malignant praxis: our debate practices and the way we talk about the world matters.</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Pat Gherke, former debate coach and rhetorical scholar, 1998.<br />
<br />
Some policies may intend...policies and policy advocacy.<br />
</span><br />
<strong>Why aren't we seeing the masses rise up in protest against this kind of overt genocide? Kato believes that it is because most westerners and much of the globe now is caught up in the techno-strategic gaze. this phenomenon was inaugurated at the point that we first put satellites into space that were able to relay a photo back to earth of the entire planet in one shot. it was believed we'd done it all- conquered the errant planet- there was nowhere left to hide. Spanos is no stranger to this age of the world picture in which he, quoting Heidegger, calls:<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">William Spanos, <u>American Exceptionalism: Anatomy of Empire</u><br />
</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">...that global enframement...standing and disposable reserve.<br />
<br />
</span></strong>Rey Chow goes as far as to say that these self-referential politics with the USFG center acting on the periphery guarantees knowledge production that is actively waging war on indigenous and 4th world peoples- even worse, without our affirmation we will continue politics that will result in not only the destruction and assimilation of more cultures but also domestic terrorism and the destruction of the United States.<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Rey Chow 2000</span><br />
<br />
Thus we affirm the resolution. the role of nuclear weapons in our society is currently a privilege to the first world nations over the periphery. nuclear testing, mining and dumping are strategies that are interrelated in order to gain security from our nuclear weapons arsenal. We don't pretend to be policy makers and we don't act as if a plan will actually pass from our speech act. Our affirmative speaks out against the role of our arsenal which privileges the first world over the periphery. We say &quot;yes&quot; to the resolution's call against nuclear weapons while resisting the temptation to act from the high position of the gaze. This allows us to challenge the current paradigm of knowledge production that serves the first world interests of the techno-strategic gaze.<br />

Narrative style affirmative, dealing specificly with the symbolization of peace.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Ronin. Hafu native speaker of Japanese........&quot;<br />
Vizenor (hiroshima bugi pg. 1)<br />
<br />
“Mary Rose, in one of the entries ahead of mine, wrote that her favorite uncle has died of cancer caused by exposure to radiation in the military. She was uncertain of the actual place because her uncle was secretive about his service....&quot;<br />
Vizenor (hiroshima bug pg. 57)<br />
<br />
“the atomic bomb dome, first protected as a historical site, with no intended irony, is now registered on the World Heritage List....&quot;<br />
Vizenor (hiroshima bug, pg. 10)<br />
<br />
I obstruct and mock your museums of fake peace for they tell the wrong stories, they have no sense of irony<br />
You saw nothing in Hiroshima—print that on a t-shirt and sell it in your museum gift shop and pretend you are enacting peace<br />
Better yet, create a resolution, debate peace and nuclear weapons, dedicate yourselves to the language of peace while whitewashing away your own violence. You would laugh if only you could see yourselves.<br />
<br />
“ Survivance, for instance, is not merely a variation of survival, the act, reaction, or custom of a survivalist....&quot;<br />
Vizenor (hiroshima bugi pg. 15)<br />
<br />
Traditionally debaters have accepted the idea that we must interact in a space ruled by a resolution. The resolution in this specific space can only serve as our Peace Memorial. We unwittingly tie ourselves to the fixed notion that we must construct an affirmation of the resolution, but, this affirmation only allows us to assuage our guilt over nuclear violence without really changing anything—we become the simulation of peace. This type of simulation does nothing more than create another fake apology that we spit out whenever we feel threatened by any meaningful move toward peace. In this space, the spirit of survivance and the trickster are the keys the stopping the victimry that we as debaters, continue through our simulated games and use of language within a policy framing. We do nothing more than create more symbols and more apologies for the bombs we dropped years ago and uniquely use discourse to whitewash true suvivance from having an opportunity to speak to us of real peace.<br />
what is this survivance we speak of?<br />
<br />
&quot;“The Trickster and comic liberator craves chance in agonistic imagination to lessen the power of social science and bourgeois humanism . . . &quot;<br />
Vizenor (Narrative Chance: Postmodern Discourse on Native American Indian Literatures, em p. 122)<br />
<br />
The way construct our games of pretending to create change some fake political space puts us, as debaters, in the same chair as the man choosing to launch the bomb. We are “disarming” or “rethinking” nuclear weapons, while destroying the people effected by our machines in the first place. To change is to interject, to accept, to allude, to listen to the stories of survivance and stop silencing them to reject our current framing. “<br />
.“Native American Indian literatures are tribal discourse, more discourse...&quot;<br />
Vizenor (Narrative Chance: Postmodern Discourse on Native American Indian Literatures, em p.4-5 )<br />
<br />
The resolution is our Atomic Bomb Dome. Our memorial to the ones lost, but nothing more than a simulation that is seen as a good enough apology. These types of false simulations lead to the further assimilation and extermination of native people and culture. The symbol itself takes away our shame from the original violent actions and allows the rationalization and legitimization of the same types of violent and genocidal actions to continue. Whether the symbol be through language construction or a monument the result is the same, we simulate peace while legitimizing violence. Our job is to take on the role of the trickster to transcend the boundaries of oral and textual traditions. Interjection of the trickster narratives allows us to invoke our agency to view this space as an opportunity to affirm the infinite connections and alternative perspectives. Our advocacy is that we trick the United States into believing they never had nuclear weapons in the first place. Our advocacy does not forget, but through remembrance, sets fire to the way we are told to think and learn and interact.<br />
<br />
&quot;The postindian simulations are the core of survivance, the new stories of tribal courage....&quot;<br />
Vizenor (Mannifest Manners pg. 5-6)<br />

<br />
&quot;The simulations of manifest manners are treacherous and elusive in histories; how ironic that the most secure simulations are unreal sensations, and become the real without a referent to an actual tribal remembrance.&quot;<br />

The nuclear weapons regime creates these bodies in pain to make real its power and anchor its ideological belief systems.The stable regime of power at the heart of our nuclear weapons arsenal is built on dismembered, charred, maimed, scarred, and atomized bodies, transmogrified into neat discrete bodies of data that anchor claims of stability and dominance.</strong><br />
