The affirmative engages in identity construction via the depiction of other states as the political referents for political decision-making. In the process of this type of entity/identity construction, a homogenized, monolithic identity becomes ascribed onto other groups, regions, and geographies. This produces a framework that overlooks the ever becoming identities of peoples and NOT fantasized statist identities.<br />
Christoph Weller, 1997. [Collective Identities in World Society Some Theoretical and Conceptual Considerations. Christoph Weller is the Deputy Executive Director of the Institute for Development and Peace at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany. Google.]<br />
The consequences of who … as the UN War Crimes Tribunal (Stiglmayer, 1994).<br />
<br />
The framework to confront the nuclear dilemma based on construction of statist identity is what recreates the accumulation of power for certain states to elevate their ideologies over other unintelligible statist identities. This is not to say that the state itself is bad, but that the preeminence of other state identities becomes the foundation for imperialism insofar as identity becomes hierarchalized and used as motivation for intervention, violence, and rampant violent imaginaries.<br />
Arundhati Roy, 2002.[Come September. Arundhati Roy is an Indian novelist, activist. Google.]<br />
The theme of much …human way: &quot;Welcome to the World.&quot; [Applause]<br />
<br />
Statis forms of identity produce the politics of subhumanity insofar as national identity causes us to conform and become subjects to its power politics, making us blind to the dangers of our ideology and misunderstandings. This form of politics is the first step to annihilation<br />
Simone De Beauvoir, 1947 [&quot;Personal Freedom and Others&quot; in The Ethics of Ambiguity, p 35-73. marxists.org]<br />
Yet, he exists. By the fact...the agonizing conciousness of himself.<br />
<br />
This is a prior question- we must change social structures to solve war<br />
Brian Martin, 90 [Uprooting War, www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/]<br />
The principle of structural change is...action, or a consequence of other actions<br />
<br />
The alternative is to vote for a politics that strips itself from identity construction as the primary motivating referent for international engagement. The more they depict singular ‘countries’ or ‘groups,’ the more it proves their fixation on identity as the reigning framework to make others unintelligible. Voting negative is the critical first step to negate identity, and therefore, the recurrence of all violent logics. The poetics of this radical, proximate individualism is the only way to rupture ideology at its core—our poetics is the lived, performative example of ever-becoming possibilities.<br />

Radical nothingness has become the strategy of the 1ac individuals. This nothingness becomes the something to embrace. This method is characterized as wholly individualistic and tied to this and only for the people in this room. Historically, this rhetorical device that attempts to challenge imperialism privileges theory in the classroom without understanding with the oppressed.<br />
hooks, 90 (“Postmodern Blackness,” Postmodern Culture. <span style="color: windowtext;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Postmodern_Blackness_18270.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Articles_Gen/Postmodern_Blackness_18270.html</a></span>)<br />
It is sadly ironic…radical liberation struggle.<br />
<br />
Nomadism is a cognitive plaything of the educated elite that isolates intellectuals from the material conditions we must engage to produce real change<br />
Pels, 99 (“Privileged Nomads: On the Strangeness of Intellectuals and the Intellectuality of Strangers,” Theory Culture &amp; Society Vol. 16 No. 1, Sage)<br />
In this article, I will be…evade the codes of settled people. (1977: 149)”<br />
<br />
Their form of nomadic narcissism is a strategic denial of place, creating a transcendental “view from nowhere” that lets them hide the specific interests served by their romantic projection of the nomadic wanderer.<br />
Pels, 99 (“Privileged Nomads: On the Strangeness of Intellectuals and the Intellectuality of Strangers,” Theory Culture &amp; Society Vol. 16 No. 1, Sage)<br />
In this fashion, the self-celebration of…his freely wandering mind.Affirming nomadic tactics domesticates and romanticizes the difficult life of unrooted travel for their own ends.<br />
Pels, 99 (“Privileged Nomads: On the Strangeness of Intellectuals and the Intellectuality of Strangers,” Theory Culture &amp; Society Vol. 16 No. 1, Sage)<br />
The previous accounts are not simply suggestive…representing him as a generic stranger.<br />
<br />
Spanos’ engagement with identity is based on the individual being male, straight, and able bodied. This is a denial of the oppressed’s culture.<br />
Mader, 2002. (“‘New World’ or ‘American’ empire?” College Literature <span style="color: windowtext;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200210/ai_n9126833/pg_4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200210/ai_n9126833/pg_4/</a></span>)<br />
Finally, identity politics…our sustained attention<br />
<br />
Performance without enfleshment is not subversive enough to challenge power structures. This is the way whiteness reproduces itself.<br />
Warren and Facet, 2004 (“<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Subverting Whiteness: Pedagogy at the Crossroads of Performance, Culture, and Politics</span>” Theatre Topics - Volume 14, Number 2, pp. 411-430)<br />
Performative pedagogy, as…invisibility of whiteness.<br />
<br />
The affirmative creates a Cartesian split, allowing the theoretical mind to become the forefront of solvency. This is a historical devaluation of the body and the way that bodies are the only possibility for change.<br />
Warren, 04 (“Bodily Excess and the Desire for Absence: Whiteness and the Making of (Raced) Educational Subjectivities,” Performance Theories in Education: Power, Pedagogy, and the Politics of Identity.)<br />
With such a reliance on a Cartesian…maintenance of a smooth system. </span><br />

<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">So where are you. You’re in some motel room. You just wake up and you’re in a motel room. There’s the key. It feels like maybe it’s just the first time you’ve been there, but perhaps you’ve been there for a week, three months. It’s kind of hard to say. It’s just just, I dunno, an anonymous room. There’s nothing in the drawers. Nothing except the Gideon Bible, which of course, I read religiously. Hahaha. You know who you are, and you know kind of all about yourself, it’s just for day to day stuff, notes make it simple. I have this condition…you see it’s my memory, I have no short term memory. Since my injury I can’t make new memories. It’s just, everything fades. If we talk for too long, I’ll forget how we started. I go on facts, not recommendation. Memory is unreliable. Memory is not perfect, its not even that good. Memory can change the shape of a room it can change the color of a car, and memories can be distorted. Theyre just an interpretation. If you have a piece of information which is vital, writing on your body instead of on paper can be the answer. It’s just a permanent way of keeping a note. What’s the last thing I remember? My wife. Dying. The facts? White, male, and John G.<br />
<br />
Total nuclear war is a tattoo that has no referent point. It is a textual event that frames our plans and strategies by embedding them in fantasy. Nuclear criticism aimed at dislodging that fantasy produces anxiety.<br />
Klein, 1990. [The Future of Nuclear Criticism. Richard Klein Professor of French Literature at Cornell University. Yale French Studies, No. 77, Reading the Archive: On Texts and Institutions (1990), pp. 76-100.]<br />
Total nuclear war… problem for Nuclear Criticism.<br />
<br />
You don’t want the truth. You make up your own truth. Like your police file it was complete when I gave it to you. Who took out the twelve pages? You did.<br />
Now why would I do that?<br />
To give yourself a puzzle you can never solve. Do you know how many towns, how many John G’s there are?<br />
<br />
Leonard and the US share a similar trauma that provokes them both to act violently towards others. Leonard’s tattoos give him a John G. to find and kill. The clues tattooed on his body allows Leonard to repress Teddy’s suggestion that he may have killed his own wife. This repression is much like how the US represses the desire to know and experience the bomb.<br />
Chaloupka, 1992. [Knowing Nukes: The Politics and Culture of the Atom. William Chaloupka, professor of political science at the University of Montana. Pg. 61-63]<br />
As Deleuze and Guattari emphasize… opacity begins to clear.<br />
<br />
Fact 1- White, Fact 2- Male, Fact 3- What was fact three?<br />
John G. Why can’t you remember that?<br />
I have this condition…<br />
I know about your condition. Just write it down<br />
Pen, I need a…pen. Where’s the pen, where did it go. I can’t find a pen. Keep it in mind, keep it in mind, keep it in…<br />
<br />
Tattoos and their memories are used to channel Leonard’s anger outward at John G. In the same way, the inability to change our relationship to trauma and anxiety forces the psyche to project destruction upon vulnerable communities as a coping mechanism. This projection numbs the psyche to racism, genocide, sexism, homophobia, and nuclear arms races, which further cements their existence.<br />
Koehler, 2005. [Psychoanalysis &amp; the Madness of Nuclear Arms. Brian Koehler PhD New York University. May 7, 2005.]<br />
“One reason why … guilt over destructiveness, etc.<br />
<br />
I’ve probably tried this before. I’ve probably burned truck loads of her stuff. Why can’t I remember to forget?<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to not tattoo yourself with nuclear politics. Allowing yourself to forget the 1ac is the only way to overcome our relationship with trauma and act anew.<br />
Bianco, 2004. [Techno-Cinema. Jamie Skye Bianco Assistant Professor of English at University of Pittsburgh. Comparative Literature Studies 41.3 (2004) 377-403.]<br />
