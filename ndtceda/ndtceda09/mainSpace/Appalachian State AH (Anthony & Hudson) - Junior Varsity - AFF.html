<strong>Plan: The USFG should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear arsenal by banning the construction of nuclear power plants and decommissioning existing nuclear power plants.<br />

<strong>1. CI - we substantially reduce the size of our nuclear weapons arsenal. Fissile material is a pre-requisite for nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Nuclear centrifuges supply the uranium for both nuclear weapons and nuclear power. By eliminating these reactors we rid ourselves of all new nukes and also nuclear power.</strong><br />
Nuclear Energy Information Service 2004 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.neis.org/literature/Brochures/weapcon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.neis.org/literature/Brochures/weapcon.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Standards - Effects are clearly called for by the topic. Even if the plan is effectual, it violates no individual term of the topic. We don't take any unnecessary steps. We allow better education and depth because we cut to the core of the problem<br />
<br />
3. Brightline - Our brightline is alreayd accepted as policy; Monitoring includes undeclared materials and facilities</strong><br />
Sylvester, Pilat, and Burr 2008 (Nuclear Safeguards, Securit, and Nonproliferation pg. 135).<br />
<br />
<strong>4. We meet. Civilian and military nuclear power cannot be seperated.<br />
<br />
Nuclear power plants use fuel from nuclear weapons in times of shortage</strong><br />
Smith 2009 (The Nation)<br />
<br />
<strong>5. No in-round abuse. This case is obviously debatable. The function of topicality in debate is simply notice. If a case is prominent in the literature and if it has been debated before, the notice function has been adequately met. We should debate real world issues and not play work games. We spur debate on the root cause of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
6. Other debate burdens interact. Inherency and solvency; significance relate to DAs to determine the net benefit of competiveness.<br />
<br />
7. Solvency, in terms of gaining an advantage is LOGICALLY separate from whether the plan has a topical effect. The effect of the plan might be topical but still nolt be advantageous.<br />
<br />
8. There's no real reason why topicality cannot be a probablistic question. Virtually all other issues in debate are probablistic, and a more probable than not standard seems to preserve limits.<br />
<br />
9. Limits - We fairly limit the topic by allowing cases that substantially address nuclear weapons while the negative interpretation severely over-limits by reducing cases to only those that talk about delivery systems. For example, their interpretation would mean that you couldn't ban fossil fuels on a topic about global warming or you couldn't eradicate mosquitos if the topic was about malaria.<br />
<br />
10. FX T is not a voter, because AFF is fair, reasonable, and debatable.</strong><br />
