<u>Prologue: The Topic</u><br />
<strong>This year’s debate topic “Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal” posits the debate community at an important juncture. Under the guise of neoliberal anti-nuclear discourse, the debates that occur within this topic propagate and produce imperial knowledge through the deployment of techno-strategic discourse. The topic paper’s calling for increased policing of the relevance of topical knowledge production devises and utilizes technologies to reduce the participants of the debate community into docile producers of defense industry scholarship.</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;"> As the topic paper explains:</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: black;"><br />
<u>Jones and Yeats 2009</u> [Chris and Jessica, scholarly lackeys of the war machine, “United States Nuclear Policy and Strategy: A Proposal for the 2009-2010 College Debate Topic,” Prepared by the Office of CSIS JY, <span style="color: #942e06;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usctrojandebate.com/Nuclear_Weapons_Topic_Paper.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.usctrojandebate.com/Nuclear_Weapons_Topic_Paper.pdf</a></span>]<br />
<br />
E. There will be a demand for your expertise in the policy analysis community…eliminating the field of nuclear weapons design?‛ etc.<br />

<br />
<strong>The technocratic discourses that govern the operation of the topic and its policing is reflected in the similar technologies empirically used to establish American public’s understanding and relationship to the bomb itself. through framing the bomb as a distant, complex, and god-like object, we enter into a state of paralysis where we are no longer able to identify and challenge the effects of the bomb. bodies that are sacrificed in the process of creating, maintaining, and deploying the bomb are reduced to collateral damage and numbers for a utilitarian calculative methodology. the topic this year maintains and props up this form of decision-making process in our debates, reducing the debaters and the judges into human calculators as a means to make tough choices such as whether if it’s a good idea to Disarm or reduce roles or missions.</strong><br />
<strong>As active participants of the debate community, josh and I advocate that the debate community resist this form of dominant methodology that governs this year’s topic. the judge, as a responsible member of the debate community, should vote for the team that best interrogates the relationship that we have with the bomb under this year’s resolution. Before we can devise policies of the bomb, we have to understand our relationship to it.</strong><br />
<strong>Through our own research and reflection, we find that the allegory of Frankenstein is a compelling starting point to interrogate our assumptions of the bomb. just as Dr. victor Frankenstein created the monster Frankenstein using techno-strategic normative science, our technological advances also produced an equally powerful and feared monster—the bomb. just like Frankenstein’s body was sewn together, our monster is comprised of dismembered bodies that belonged to its victims. both monsters are bearers of death.</strong><br />
<strong>throughout history, since fat man and little boy’s grand appearance at hiroshima and nagasaki, we have largely been unwilling to interrogate the implications of the bomb in its ability to destroy. Frankenstein’s allegory reveals to us myriad assumptions about the construction of the bomb and our relationship to it. the cultural critique of Frankenstein offers a potential space for reinventing our relationship with the bomb, therefore bridging our disconnect with its victims to fully understand its implications.</strong><br />

Mary Shelley's novel has been so popularized… We need the shadows if we are to survive.<br />
<strong>That being said, for the purposes of the debate, the negative can make their traditional arguments of proliferation, deterrence, etc. we are not going to spike out of your DisAdvantages and counterplans and say ‘No Link’ unless it is just bogus. however, the negative should have to justify and be held accountable for the kinds of representations they choose to deploy in their arguments since these notions will produce education that filters into real world policy-making. the judge should have the responsibility to evaluate the substantive as well as methodological questions at the end of the debate round.</strong><br />
<strong>the ballot should be viewed political currency that the judge has to hedge against the defense industry scholarship produced in the status quo that prevents an authentic questioning necessary to uncover these fundamental notions. instead of viewing the ballot as a tool for advancing utilitarian politics, josh and I advocate that this framing of the resolution will provide better educational and agency merits.</strong><br />

<strong>Chapter 1: Techno strategic Discourse</strong><br />
<strong>Since the deployment of Fat Man and Little Boy, America’s nuclear arsenal established its dominance and prowess through exhibiting its potency as the bearer of destruction. the dismembered, charred, maimed, scarred, and atomized bodies are trans-mortified into neat discrete bodies of data to measure, document, and maintain America’s military superiority within the international power structure.</strong><br />

<span style="color: black;">Nuclear weapons first proved their power….hierarchies of dominance in the international power structure (Luke 1989).<br />
</span><br />
the discourse on nuclear weapons is a dangerous relegation of bodies as emptied of agency and pain, and the fragmentation and objectification of the body parts enable physical destruction without recourse.<br />

Chapter 2: Alienation<br />
<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">Within the technocratic state apparatus, the populous is alienated from their agency. extremist nationalistic ideologies are used to create the conditions for genocidal policies in relation to nuclear wars. based on the discourses of the enemy Other, the populous are reduced to docile subjects, paralyzed in their ability to resist the hegemonic control of the state even within the sub-national level.</span><br />

<br />
In a modern technocratic state….. associated genocidal policies is carried out.<span style="color: black;"><br />
</span> <span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: normal;">Techno- Strategic discourse focuses on the bomb instead of the bodies that they affect, alienating our agency from the politics that we produce under its ideological interpretations. this form of politiking is dangerous since it is only concerned with the capacity for nuclear weapons to securitize American hegemony within international power structures instead of recognizing the pain and suffering that the bomb inflicts upon its targets.</span><br />

Chapter Three: The Scientists<br />
the nuclear science community is constituted though its cult-like properties. Coupled by the military-industrial complex, it reduces scientists to parts or components of a machine and dehumanizes their existences if not for their work. deeply entrenched within the science of the bomb is the alienation of the scientists from the pain that they create, implicating the complex psychological consequences that the bomb has on its makers<br />
<strong>Caldicott 02</strong> (Helen, Dr. Prof at The New School, numerous degrees and awards, “The New Nuclear Danger: George W. Bush’s Military-Industrial Complex” pg 14-17)<br />
<br />
Chapter Four: Frankenstein and the Bomb: Resolving Dissonance<br />
Frankenstein provides a context for understanding the science, the scientist, and the monster. It forces us to confront the relationship that we have with the bomb and its monstrosity to alter and take responsibility for the relationship that we have with these artifacts.<br />
Kim <strong>Hammond</strong>, School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford. “Monsters of Modernity: Frankenstein and Modern Environmentalism,” Cultural Geographies 11. 20<strong>04</strong>. Sage<br />
In the context of the opposition of natural=unnatural…. he becomes a murderous monster.<br />
Frankenstein is an effective political critique of US imperialism. The figure of the monster and the metaphors present within Frankenstein serve as a point of reflection in devising alternatives against the disastrous elitism prevalent in US foreign policy making. this is the best method to resist against the normative defense industry scholarship<br />
Elizabeth, <strong>Young</strong>. Professor of English and Gender Studies at Mount Holyoke College. “Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor”. NYU Press, 20<strong>08</strong>. Pg 2-3<br />
Even when the metaphor…. monster making in the novel itself.<span style="color: black;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: normal;">Frankenstein provides us with a cultural critique for questioning our epistemologies and bridging the disconnect between us and the Bomb. it seeks to unveil the phenomenon that we have repressed, and to confront our fear of the monster</span><br />

Despite this historical shift…. mechanisms and 'logics' of narrative.<br />
Thus our advocacy: We should affirm the dismembered body of Frankenstein.<br />

<u>Nuclear Borderlands Aff<br />
<br />
Part One: Mapping the Geography of the Borderlands</u><br />
<strong>Borderlands describe the condition of belonging. Although traditionally defined as spaces in which nation-state lines are blurred, borderlands could also demarcate the spaces where the mapped lines the separate one space from another become less definitive. Borderlands are such because of the porous subjectivities that move freely between marked spaces that indicate locus of power, where hybrid identities emerge to inform us about the power of space in creating identities. However, borderlands are also sites where violence is committed. It is a dangerous space where the state determines who it would like to include as a part of their populous, where politics of inclusion and exclusion occurs. This is a space where marginal populations are rendered invisible, and the violence that they experience within this space goes unnoticed because they are not seen as legitimate subjects with political, social, and cultural currency. The borderlands are spaces of contestation of meanings, an oppressive site that has the potential to produce resistance and give voice to those silenced in the status quo.</strong><br />

At a time when national boundaries seem increasingly insignificant…and my own feminist architecture.<br />
<br />
<strong>The borderlands is not an abstract concept or idea, since it resides within our everyday engagement with the world. Those who reside within these spaces are often dehumanized and their ability to access resources are stifled as a result of the structural violence that governs their everyday.</strong><br />

Despite the fact that their presence…rather than an initiation of nonexistence.<br />
&lt;Personal Narrative from Hong-Mei Pang&gt;<br />
<strong>Part Two: The Nuclear Borderlands</strong><br />
<strong>The Nuclear Borderlands is a site where structural violence is committed. It exacerbates the condition for the nuclear nation-state building based within the logic of the bomb.</strong><br />
<strong>Masco 06</strong> (Dr. Joseph, assoc prof anthropology and social sciences @ U of Chicago, “The Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico”, p.335-337)<br />
In the early twenty-first century…alternative way of living in the nuclear borderlands.<br />
<br />
<strong>Advocacy Statement:</strong><br />
<strong>We affirm the borderlands within the topic.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Part Three: Debate Borderlands: The Resolution and its Implications</u></strong><br />
<strong>This year’s debate topic prompts us to look at nuclear policies to determine the best course of action to reduce the violence of nuclear arms. However, upon our own investigation of nuclear politics, Hong Mei and I find that the real violence occurs at the level of the local. It is at the level of which entire populations are exposed to radioactive by products of nuclear testing, and the level of which these forms of systematic violence go unnoticed. The resolution, however, does not deal with the reality of nuclear weapons, but instead prompts debates to circle around policy implementations that question the ability for the</strong> <strong>US</strong> <strong>to possess and use its nuclear arms against other states in order to securitize its own populations. This form of representation not only begs the question of the kinds of violence that is produced with nuclear arms at the most immediate level, but also brings to light the ways that the USFG uses the nation-state construction of the citizenry to justify the atrocities that it does onto non-citizens. Since debate is a porous space whereby knowledge is exported into the real world, the resolution creates the conditions for research that justifies violence at the borderlands, nuclear or otherwise. Debate thus becomes a borderland.</strong><br />
<strong>Coutin 2003</strong> (Susan Bibler, Ph.D., Sociocultural Anthropology, Standford U<em>, Globalization Under Construction: Governmentality</em>, Law and Identity, “Illegality, Borderlands, and the Space of Nonexistence”, p 193-194)<br />
I cannot celebrate the space of nonexistence….this space is not likely to disappear anytime soon.<br />
