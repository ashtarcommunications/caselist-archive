    Answers To Off Case Args<br />
Right fill in, universalizing technology/politics as bad=extinction/withdrawal from praxis, plan is negative action<br />
<br />
Psychology/Ontology focus fails, won’t change perception or policy; reps don’t shape policy<br />
<br />
Extend 1AC Schwartz and Arednt-value to life claims are flawed, extinction comes before v2l impacts<br />
<br />
Extend 1AC Spencer-take responsibility for our accidents rather than scapegoating other countries solves internal link to impacts<br />

Obama overtures won’t solve—breeding resentment and increasing the potential for crises<br />
Brij Khindaria, 7/25/2009 [International Columnist on International Politics for The Moderate Voice, Obama and Biden are seeing a new “cool war” with Russia, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://themoderatevoice.com/40689/obama-and-biden-are-seeding-a-new-" rel="nofollow">http://themoderatevoice.com/40689/obama-and-biden-are-seeding-a-new-</a>“cool-war”-with-russia/]<br />
&quot;Even as he asserts his desire to reset relations with Russia in a positive direction, President Barack Obama is &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;and gas, so Obama will not be able to easily unite Europeans to confront Russia’s political ambitions.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These crisis conditions exacerbate the potential for accidents—stress and short decision time make launch inevitable, even with faulty or questionable data<br />
A. G. Arbatov, et. Al, 2001 [V. S. Delous, A.A. Pikaev, V. G. Baranovsky, Institute of International Economy and Foreign Relations at the the Russian Academy of Sciences, De-Alerting Russian and US nuclear weapons: A path to reducing nuclear dangers, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ieer.org/russian/pubs/dlrtbk-e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ieer.org/russian/pubs/dlrtbk-e.html</a>]<br />
&quot;Experts in the area of complex systems notice a deep correlation between the probability of occurrence of &quot;<br />

<br />
There is no “ride-out” option under Launch on Warning—any perceived strike will be responded to with nuclear retaliation<br />

&quot;What is misleading about the briefing is that the president’s supporting command system is not actually geared to &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;very long.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glitches exacerbate the potential for accidents<br />
A. G. Arbatov, et. Al, 2001 [V. S. Delous, A.A. Pikaev, V. G.

&quot;As historical experience demonstrates, the highest potential danger of an accidental nuclear conflict lies in the &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;false alarms of an incoming nuclear missile attack by the adversary.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These accidents quickly escalate into full-scale war<br />
Morton Mintz, 2001 [former chair of the Fund for Investigative Journalism and a former Washington Post reporter, The American Prospect, Two Minutes to Launch, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=two_minutes_to_launch" rel="nofollow">http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=two_minutes_to_launch</a>]<br />
&quot;Hair-trigger alert means this: The missiles carrying those warheads are armed and fueled at all times. Two &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;all of us,&quot; explains Bruce Blair. &quot;It would be, basically, a nuclear war by checklist, by rote.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Modern weaponry coupled with Launch on Warning increases potential for escalation<br />
A. G. Arbatov, et. Al, 2001 [V. S. Delous, A.A. Pikaev, V. G. Baranovsky, Institute of International Economy and Foreign Relations at the the Russian Academy of Sciences, De-Alerting Russian and US nuclear weapons: A path to reducing nuclear dangers, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ieer.org/russian/pubs/dlrtbk-e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ieer.org/russian/pubs/dlrtbk-e.html</a>]<br />
&quot;An accidental launch of an intercontinental missile, from land or from sea, or a detonation of a nuclear &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;the launch of all weapons which are maintained on alert, in an exchange of massive nuclear strikes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rationality goes out the window after a perceived launch—quickly escalates<br />

Launch on Warning guarantees extinction<br />

&quot;As long as the United States and Russia retain their arsenals of nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles, &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;that kind.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the most likely scenario for war<br />
Dr. Alan Phillips, 2003 [Ph. D. with honours in physics at Cambridge University, former Radar operator for the British Army, Interview, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.web.net/~cnanw/nolowinterview.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.web.net/~cnanw/nolowinterview.htm</a>]<br />
&quot;At the present time, I think an accidental war is far more likely than an intentional one. An intentional one could happen I &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;happened already.&quot;<br />

Accidental war is the most probable scenario for US-Russia nuclear war<br />
FAS et al, Federation of American Scientists, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Union of Concerned Scientists, 2008<br />

&quot;By revamping its deployment practices so it could no longer launch its nuclear forces promptly, the United States would reduce Russia’s incentive to &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;prevent the United States from retaliating with its surviving nuclear weapons.&quot;<br />

Abandoning Launch on Warning solves the risk of accidental warfare with Russia<br />
Dr. Alan Phillips, 2002 [Ph. D. with honours in physics at Cambridge University, former Radar operator for the British Army, No Launch on Warning, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/05/00_phillips_no-launch.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/05/00_phillips_no-launch.htm</a>]<br />
&quot;If Russia and the US were actually to abandon the option of launching on warning, even while they retained &quot;<br />

&quot;does not even depend on the other side knowing that the change has been made.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Russian posture is irrelevant—plan dramatically reduces chance of accidents<br />
Dr. Alan Phillips, 2003 [Ph.

Q9: Why do you say that reciprocity with &quot;No Launch on Warning&quot; is not important?<br />
&quot;Because not responding to a false alarm does not put that side at any disadvantage. If one side is at &quot;no &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;would be halved because the risk on the Russian side may be greater.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention II: Politics of Vulnerability<br />
Violence is inevitably part of the human condition—making ourselves vulnerable in the face of that violence is the only way to build effective relationships with each other<br />
Katherine Mills, 2002 [Professor of Philosophy at University of South Wales in Sydney, Australia, Normative Violence, Vulnerability, and Responsibility, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://differences.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/2/133.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://differences.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/2/133.pdf</a>]<br />
&quot;In contrast, Butler moves toward a conception of responsibil- ity that is founded not only on our mutual &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;under- standing of ethics would necessitate letting go of at least some dimensions of the account of subjectivation.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The vulnerability to death accepted by the plan is the only true ethical gesture—allows us to recognize shared vulnerability and build relationships with the Other<br />
John Milbank, 1999 [Francis Gall Professor of Philosophical Theology at the University of Virginia, The Ethics of Self-Sacrifice, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9903/articles/milbank.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaderu.com/ftissues/ft9903/articles/milbank.html</a>]<br />
&quot;Secondly, they hold that death, far from being complicit with evil as religious traditions have often taken it to &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;self–interest.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan suspends the reaction to violence by making immediate retaliation impossible—allows reflection on shared vulnerability and a meaningful relationship with violence and the Other<br />
Fiona Jenkins, 2007 [Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the Australian National University, Toward a Nonviolent Ethic: Reponse to Catherine Mills, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://differences.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/2/157.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://differences.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/2/157.pdf</a>]<br />
&quot;What might it mean,” Judith Butler asks in the context of a reflection on responsibility, “to undergo &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;essential to what is (not) done in refusing a reciprocal gesture of returning injury.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan’s suspension of response inculcates an ethic of nonviolence and mutual vulnerability in US foreign policy<br />
Judith Butler, 2003 [Maxine Elliot professor in the Departments of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at University of California, Berkeley, Interview, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_butler" rel="nofollow">http://www.believermag.com/issues/200305/?read=interview_butler</a>]<br />
