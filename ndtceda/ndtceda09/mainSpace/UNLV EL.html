Violence and Murder are a deeply ingrained part of human nature and brain circuitry – by creating violent fantasies we can weigh the cost and benefits and control the drive to kill and turn the key—proves the alternative solves the aff better <br />

<strong>Red Fem Kritik</strong><br />
Butler’s discursive engagement with the body is an ideological cover to escape the anti-socialist feminist implications of her strategy; on balance the alternative is net beneficial<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">The nondiscursive for ... a strategy for managing the crisis of class relations.</span><br />
The aff’s method normalizes dominant binaries that violence upon the body inevitable and systemic. Also, they don’t solve--Discursive emancipation can’t solve structural oppression. AND, the alt solves better—A revolutionary political ethic that starts examining gender from a Marxist is an essential starting point to resignifying the body<br />

Overcoming discursive violence towards the body demands a material engagement with the structures that form our assumptions about the subject. The alternative is to embrace a revolutionary socialist feminism. This transformative political act best engages the forces of oppression that affect our everyday lives-They make true social change impossible.<br />

 A. Interpretation—aff has to reduce/restrict current missions/role we cite the Orelirch list (Oelrich List)<br />
<br />
B. Violation—<br />
1.Aff makes prohibitions on nuclear weapons that do not reflect specific regional conflicts for the war termination mission—city busting is extra-topical<br />
2. We don’t target cities—not part of the mission<br />
Younger, Associate Laboratory Director for Nuclear Weapons, Los Alamos National Laboratory 2000<br />

The ….damage.<br />
<br />
C. Vote Neg-<br />
1. Explodes the topic—They get to make claims about all nuclear use which makes 100s of topical affs within that mission—makes the scope of the resolution insufficient.<br />
2. Ground—Can’t engage whether the mission is good or bad because the aff doesn’t specify which regional conflict(s) they end war termination for—makes all neg disads go away<br />
3. Topic Education—Oelrich list best research base for the topic—most defensible and specific way to frame the topic there is<br />
<br />
D. Voter—fairness, education, jurisdiction<br />
<br />
Wake CM’s moral call for a solution to the anxiety over nuclear use is a repression of the natural desire to be violent—their opposition to it justifies future acts of invisible conflict<br />
Zizek ‘1 (Slavoj, Professor of Philosophy at the Institute for Sociology at Ljubljana, On Belief, Pg. 31-32, 2001)<br />
The logic of this ….pre-theoretical generalizations.<br />
<br />
Wake has their impact framing backwards—pain and pleasure are interrelated in the human mind. Attempts at separation of pain and pleasure prevent the staging of conflict in the first place<br />
Fink Professor of Psychology at Duquesne University ’97 (Bruce, A Clinical Introduction to Lacanian Psychoanalysis, pg. 190-192, practicing psychoanalyst and author of The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance)<br />
In every movie in which …enactment of castration.<br />
*Gendered Language Said in Context<br />
The alternative: Reject the 1AC and its methodology to create space for a lens of a sadomasochist ethic.<br />
<br />
Critical consequentialism is an ethics that denies individuals of their jouissance whereas the practice of S&amp;M creates an ethic of love thy neighbor that precludes the possibility of calculation and intervening actors<br />

Text: The President of the United States federal government should issue a National Security Directive requiring the Department of Defense to include in its Nuclear Posture Review a recommendation to have the United States federal government prohibit its use of nuclear arms on cities<br />
<br />
It competes – NPR is a set of recommendations for the executive to choose from – it doesn’t establish policy<br />

1. First and foremost: …currently US nuclear policy.<br />
<br />
Unless we consult Japan about changes to our nuclear posture they will develop offensive conventional strike capabilities provoking conflict with North Korea<br />

Next off is Ruralism-<br />
Their focus on the city is bad- focuses on the POTENTIAL impact of a nuclear strike on a city, ignoring the ongoing nuclear war against RURAL and indigenous populations. This LITERALLY strikes close to home for us, because the rural and indigenous populations of Nevada are the victims of an ongoing nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Between 1951 and 1992, there were 1021 nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site. Thousands of Nevadans worked at the Nevada Test Site. The rates of work-related illness, cancer, and accidental deaths among these workers is astounding. But those working at the Nevada Test Site are not the only ones affected by the nuclear poisoning. Other “innocent bystanders” living in rural areas of Nevada are referred to as “downwinders,” or those who lived down-wind from the explosions.<br />
<br />
Until 1962, nuclear tests were actually performed above ground and could be seen nearly 100 miles away. The people of Nevada could go outside and watch the nuclear explosions. What many did not know then was that they were being poisoned, every single time a nuclear explosion was conducted. The wind carried radiation that people inhaled, ate, and drank. Every day that passed and every additional nuclear test just increased the rate at which they and the earth under their feet was being poisoned.<br />
We align our arguments with The Nevada Desert experience, a group that protests the site. They explain the origins of some of the harmful effects of the test site. Nuclear testing is conducted on land taken from indigenous peoples. It exemplifies the tendency to view both delicate ecosystems and those with the least political power as expendable.<br />
<br />

<br />
Nuclear tests were routinely carried out near rural populations—they were the direct victims of the ongoing nuclear war in Nevada—and they have been lied to by the government<br />
<br />
Annie Corry tells her story in American Ground Zero: The Secret Nuclear War, in 1993.<br />
<br />
&lt;The entirety of Annie’s story&gt;<br />
<br />
We believe that the only way anyone can begin to understand nuclear weapons is by examining them in relation to ones situatedness Our reality is inevitably altered in one way or another by our surroundings. Recognizing the inevitability of situatedness means that we must use our situatedness as the starting point for any investigation. This is true of not only ourselves, but all those affected by the test site as well, including the indigenous populations that once lived on the now poisoned land. We approach the resolution using our social location to relate to the rural and indigenous environmental movement regarding the Nevada Test Site.<br />
The two clark pieces of evidence read in the downwinders 1ac<br />
<br />
Reject the aff because it prioritizes citizens of the city-We view the ballot as a way for us to acknowledge the invisibility of populations caused by the Euroamerican and city centered culture of our social location-this is the best hope for renewal and reconciliation<br />
