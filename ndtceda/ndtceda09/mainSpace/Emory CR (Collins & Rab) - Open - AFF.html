 <span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap;"> THE UNITED STATES CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF ITS NUCLEAR POLICY BEGINS WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF ITS NUCLEAR UMBRELLA. THROUGH THIS LENS THE UNITED STATES VIEWS ITSELF AS PRESERVING ITS HEGEMONY AS THE HEAD OF THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSEHOLD BY PROTECTING ITS ALLIES, OR CHILDREN, FROM THE DANGERS THEY WOULD INCUR SHOULD THEY POSSES NUCLEAR WEAPONRY. THIS TYPE OF LOGIC PLACES THE UNITED STATES AS THE SOMETIMES COERCIVE, SOMETIMES BENEVOLENT BUT ALWAYS ALL KNOWING FATHER. Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 37-38] The word “virginity” made frequent....of parents setting limits for their children.<br />
AS THE HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE UNITED STATES OPERATES IN WAYS TO ENSURE DOMESTIC BLISS—OUR NUCLEAR MISSILES ARE FAMILIALIZED—WE HAVE BROUGHT THEM INTO OUR HOMES AND REPLACED THE PEOPLE THAT ONCE COMPOSED THE FAMILY UNIT WITH WEAPONS SYSTEMS WHOS PROTECTION IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 38-40]<br />
Sanitized abstraction, sexual and patriarchal...vulnerability and survival of weapons systems, not people. CONGRATULATIONS—A BABY BOY—THE US IS NOT ONLY ITS FATHER, BUT ITS MOTHER TOO—THROUGH THIS REALIZATION THE PATRIARCHAL SYSTEM CAN NOW GIVE LIFE—AND TAKE IT AWAY Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 40-42]<br />
There is one set of domestic images that... war as involving “a big bang, like the start of the universe.”<br />
<br />
NOW OUR ‘BOY’ IS GROWING UP AND AS THE FATHER FIGURE WE USE SEXY SNAPY PHRASES TO HELP MAKE TALKING ABOUT WEAPONS FUN AND THRILLING—AT THE EXPENSE OF FORGETTING THEIR TRUE PURPOSE—DESTRUCTION.<br />
Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 43-44]<br />
Although I was at first startled by the....comprehension, powerful in a way that stretches and thrills the imagination. THIS TYPE OF NUKE-SPEAK PREVENTS ANY<br />
<br />
DESCRIPTION OF THE PHENOMENA OF CATASTROPHE THAT NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE CAPABLE OF—AND THROUGH THIS REPRESSION OF DISCUSSION THERE IS A FALSE DISTANCE CREATED THAT ALLOWS FOR THOSE SPEAKING TO FEEL THAT THEY ARE TRULY IN DISTANCED FROM THE POWER NUCLEAR WEAPONS POSSESS—AND THUS CAN ESCAPE THE IMPACT OF NUCLEAR WARFARE<br />
Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 44-45]<br />
I entered a world where people spoke...awareness by virtue of their linguistic stance.<br />
<br />
FURTHERMORE—THE LIMITING OUT OF THIS VOICE THROUGH THE CREATION OF NUCLEAR LANGUAGE CREATES A STRUCTURE OF ‘WORST CASE SCENARIOS’ THAT LIMIT OUT THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO CONNECT WITH THE DISCUSSION. HUMAN LIVES ARE LOST AS ANY SORT OF REFERENCE POINT AND ARE SIMPLY THOUGHT OF AS ‘COLLATERAL DAMAGE’ THROUGH THIS CREATION OF A WORLD OF ABSTRACTIONS Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 45-47] It did not take very long to learn the language of nuclear...what counts is the internal logic of the system.<br />
<br />
THIS RESULTS IN HUMAN LIVES BEING REPLACED BY WEAPONS, AND ALL DISCUSSIONS ARE POSED IN TERMS OF WHAT WEAPONS ARE LOST OR PRESERVED DESTROYING THE ABILITY THOSE DISCUSSING NUCLEAR WEAPONRY HAVE TO STAY CONNECTED WITH HUMAN CONCERNS Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 47-48] The strategic stability of regime...become more comprehensible.<br />
<br />
AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHIN THIS LENS OF PATRIARCHAL FRAMING—WE WILL CONTINUE TO FALL DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE AND ALLOW FOR THE SACRIFICE IF HUMAN LIVES TO BE AN ACCEPTABLE CASUALTY IN OUR DISCUSSIONS OF NUCLEAR WEAPONRY Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 48-49] As I learned to speak, my perspective changed...it was a struggle to climb back out.<br />
<br />
THROUGH OUR DOMESTICATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND THE LANGUAGE WE USE WITH THEM RESULTS IN THEIR LIKELIHOOD INCREASING. FURTHERMORE THERE IS NO TRUTH BEHIND MILITARY SECURITY PLANNERS AND THEIR STRATEGIES TO PREVENT NUCLEAR WAR DERIDA 84 [JAQUES, PROF OF HUMANITIES AT UC IRVINE, “NO APOCALYPSE, NOT NOW,” JSTOR] Indeed: nowhere has the dissociation ...most crudely opinionated psychagogy, the most vulgar psychology.<br />
<br />
THUS WE ADVOCATE THAT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE ITS NUCLEAR UMBRELLA.<br />
<br />
ONLY THROUGH A DECONSTRUCTION OF FOUNDATION THIS LANGUAGE RESTS UPON CAN AN ALTERNATE DEPICTION OF REALITY BE CREATED THAT WOULD INCORPORATE INDIVIDUALS INTO THE DISUCSSION AND THUS DISPLACE THE DOMINATE MILITARIZED MASCULINE VOICE THAT DE CONTEXTUALIZES THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE STATUS QUO. Cohn 1990 [Carol, Director of the Consortium on Gender, Security and Human Rights, “‘Clean Bombs’ and Clean Language,” Women, Militarism, &amp; War. Elshtain, Tobias. 1990 pg 50-51] However, I have been arguing throughout this...conversations with each other will invent those futures.<br />
<br />
BY UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS THAT OUR CURRENT GENDERED LENS HAS ON OUR VIEWING AND DISCUSSION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONRY OPENS SPACE FOR A FEMINIZED LENS THAT HELPS DECONSTRUCT OTHER FORMS OF PATRIARCHAL OPPRESSION Peterson and Runyan 99 [V.
