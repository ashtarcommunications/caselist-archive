The nuclear weapons arsenal is a tool used to consolidate US militarized hegemony supporting racist imperialism. The arsenal’s maintenance is based on a history of racism, of testing and drilling for uranium in minority communities. These weapons deserve to be rejected on multiple levels, the one common denominator of any anti-nuclear strategy being agreement that something should be done<br />
