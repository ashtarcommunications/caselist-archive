Text – The United States Federal Government should:<br />

- establish a legally-binding negative security assurance for all members of the Non-Proliferation Treaty regime that are in full compliance with their NPT obligations.<br />
- should adopt a no nuclear first use declaratory policy towards permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, India, Pakistan, and Israel.<br />
- should state that the U.S. maintains nuclear weapons for the purposes of deterring nuclear attacks.<br />

The counterplan is conditional – proving that the CP is worse that the status quo does not logically justify the plan. Logic is a prerequisite to all other impacts. It creates good education and predictable rules.<br />
