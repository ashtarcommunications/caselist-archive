 <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">if critical theory is to be adequate to stopping nuclear annihilation, it must abandon its circular metaphysical occupation by thinking the rift between thought and action.<br />
we can negate it or think the second term positively. being is the ground of potentiality, the place rather than nonplace.<br />
Earth is divided in two roles, the productive and unproductive space. it is an end oriented mode of inquiry, the function of metaphysical thinking is ideological. this objectification domesticates the unknown.<br />
the desert is what threatens metaphyscis, it is nothing so it has no object. Nothing to focus on.<br />
This nothing is difference. american exceptionalism is based in denying this difference by trying to convert it into a something, by saying difference is a problem that can and must be solved in the name of truth. These heirarchized binaries allows the first major term to demonize the second minor term.<br />
The response to US imperial policy is to accommodate or banish the desert-the US prefers to ban it.<br />
One example is nuclear testing on desert lands-land seen as empty so it is given use and meaning through the testing of nuclear weapons.<br />
An instrumental affirmation of the topic is a flawed view, it categorizes the world according to the dictates of late capitalism.<br />
The primary targets of warfare are the sovereign nations of indigenous peoples.<br />
We expand nuclear war to include every form of nuclear violence.<br />
The real catastrophe is competitive ongoing nuclear explosions.<br />
In naming those that are thought as invisible, we expose power.<br />
Approaching the world through certain frameworks limits questions and answers.<br />
Any definitive theoretical structure is problematic.<br />
This orientation reifies others and transforms us into something ordered and conquered<br />
We Infuse ontology into the topic<br />
We seek an undialectical beyond, beyond identity and national boundary<br />
Thus, we affirm the topical exile which resides in the resolution.<br />
We affirm the topic without policy, we believe in the topical nothing.<br />
Most think the topic is something. These affirmations are similar to the way international relations naturalizes imperialism.<br />
We affirm the topic in this room, specifically the nothing. We think the nothing positively.<br />
This is a way to refuse to play by imperialism’s logic, but also take other action.<br />
In this unequal world, injustice and balance of power always rules.<br />
We refuse to consent to American imperialism, we refuse the occularcentric pattern of destruction.<br />
We refuse to understand the European concept of war between nations<br />
We are a specific tactic to subvert binaries.<br />
Use your ballot to affirm the topical exile, think the second term positively.<br />
The end.<br />
<br />
This aff is basically the same one I’ve been judging for 3 years now so it’s unlikely to change much. </span><br />

 READ IN GONZAGA QUARTERS AGAINST NORTHWESTERN BF<br />
<br />
Malcolm has seen the affirmative a number of times and has a really good description of the aff, but here's a bit more:<br />
<br />
following many of our spanos arguments, we affirm the topical nothing.<br />
<br />
Reading from Authors like John Beck, Masahide Kato and Valerie Kuletz we notice the metaphysical path when confronted by the trope of the desert operates under the same metaphysical dictates as many practices of insturmental, &quot;topical&quot; debate.<br />
<br />
Spanos says that in context of nuclear weapons we must begin to think this space of in-between, this rift. He frames our current sociopolitical occasion as a time of in-between as well - a no more of the gods that have fled and the not yet of the god that is coming in contrast to fukyama's representation of this time as the end of history.<br />
<br />
We also read from Robert Marzec who talks about our relationship to the land - it shows the way capital is grafted onto landscapes.<br />
<h3 id="toc3"><a name="UCO Koslow and Spurlock Aff-IN THE DESERT-1ac description"></a>1ac description</h3>
 The aff indicts Western metaphysics' desire to create the world into binaries, with one being considered full and productive and the other void of value, fit to be objectified and abused. This has been the root of American imperialism, with things like nuclear testing, mining, and waste all being done in the desert. This is because the desert is seen as absent of life and value-the unproductive end of a binary. The affirmative affirms the nothing of the resolution, acknowledging that any metaphysical statement contains within it both a supposedly filled material logic and a space of emptiness that is glossed over, and thus becomes an exceptional space that must be conquered or made productive. Affirming the desert is key because it is devoid of metaphysics. Theory has for too long abandoned the category of ontology, so we must begin there. The debate doesn't leave the room all that matters is how we are trained to act.<br />
<br />

<br />
Other authors include William V. Spanos, Valerie Kuletz and Masahide Kato.<br />
<br />
Some other thoughts: 1AC seems to identify a main problem as being the placement of identity before difference instead of vice-versa<br />
<br />
Also lots of talk about the &quot;condition of possibility&quot;, indicating that a mimetic orientation is problematic. By affirming nothing, this chain of mimetic reproduction (or production) can be broken<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<h3 id="toc4"><a name="UCO Koslow and Spurlock Aff-IN THE DESERT-2ac at: framework"></a>2ac at: framework</h3>
 this debate doesn't leave the room. we are focusing on epistemology and ontology<br />
<br />
line by line debate is bad-relies on static structure that favors technostrategic metaphysical thinking<br />
<br />
by affirming everything positively we escape topical imperialism in this room<br />
<br />
debate's technical practices train us to be neocons<br />
<br />
predictable education-they can run their aff on the neg to answer ours<br />
<br />
framework is calculative thinking that seeks to manage every debate. No authentic dialogue-it's just coded to reinforce imperialism<br />
<br />
framework is biopolitical-it makes us create enemies to be fought against<br />

 broke round 7 @ harvard<br />
<br />
We stand before you two years from one if the biggest spectacles in debate history. Our History. The release of this video on youtube quickly spread to the teleprompters and talking points of the news anchors and pundits from CNN to Fox News. Another instance of our ‘tolerance’ of the liberal university system? unprofessionalism and a loss of decorum – he wasn’t wearing any fucking shoes!?!!? This video of ceda 2008 has provoked many different responses. The affirmative Runs through a few of these responses that extend to ceda 2008 and beyond... including excerpts from Stephanie Dillard, Josh Gonzales, Adam Jackson, Steve Mancuso, Andy Ellis, Jack Stroube, Jason Russell and Deven Cooper.<br />
<br />
Our affirmative is a stance against the CEDA Code of Conduct which threatens to sanction individuals who do not meet the standards of professional conduct.<br />
<br />
Over the year and past years we have investigated many different ways that our debate practices replicate the arbitrary standards of exclusion found in the world - when confronted with difference they operate under the metaphysical dictates of accomodate/banish from the way the desert is made productive via forcing crop production to banishment and nuclear weapons testing when it fails to be a suitable ground for production; - this also extends to the imperial &quot;errand in the wilderness&quot; where the exceptionalist puritan drive was relentless in accomodating this virgin land to become a city on the hill and simultaneously banishing the inhabitants: produced as <em>nothing</em>.<br />
<br />
When confronted with the difference of topic: we affirm the topical nothing that is a-part of and a-part from dominant instrumental debate practices.<br />
<br />
Indeed, we affirm bill shanahan<br />
<br />
The foundation of CEDA was supposed to be a ‘big tent’ to house all the different crazieness going on in the community – we prided ourselves on inclusion of even the most radical critiques – indeed, CEDA is known by most as ‘The People’s Tournament.” But as big as this tent is, we drew a line and said no to one of those more extreme outbursts – we reigned it in, domesticated it: played damage control. The subjective standards that allow elimination of criticism deemed ‘uneducational’ is part of a dictatorial gaze that disciplines debaters to become model citizens - we question what that model produces.<br />
<br />
Part of our exilic affirmation takes a note from the idea of <em>le differend</em>. We believe that debate is fucking awesome. Perhaps even <em>Where the Wild Things Are.</em> We are not too naive to see that conflicts will arise: even big ones. The point is not to determine a objective rule or vantage point to discipline individuals who speak in radically different idioms, the point is to keep the idea of justice open and affirm this difference as a <em>differend</em>. We then read from Kennith Jenkins.<br />
&quot;This capacity to keep open even truthful discourse&quot; ... &quot; as opposed to homogeneity&quot;<br />
<br />
This issue has been swept under the rug for two years – now is time that debaters and judges alike keep the agonstic spirit of debate open – or when looking in the <em>mirror</em>, we very well might not like the community we find.<br />

Roland Bleiker explains:<br />
<span class="apple-style-span">“<em>the puzzles</em></span><span class="apple-converted-space"> <em>[we believe, of the resolution]</em> </span><span class="apple-style-span"><em>are understood most adequately through an interdisciplinary approach, which is necessary to deal with circles of revealing and concealing that surround transversal struggles. Such an approach entails constant moving back and forth not only between unconnected bodies of literature and different levels of analysis, but also between theory and practice, abstraction and everydayness, epistemology and ontology, space and time, discursive domination and possibilities for dissent that arise from fissures in them</em>.”</span><br />
<br />
We read different, conflicting, affirmations of the resolution from George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Abbie Hoffman, Margaret Thatcher, and General Lee Butler, not as multiple worlds or conditional advocacies or anything of the sort, but as pieces in one larger puzzle. Otherwise, we would risk collapsing into our disciplinary holes, like the nuclear weapons scientist who sees Moscow as nothing but lines of rads and pressure, or the anarchist who refuses to ever engage traditional politics. Though technology has been pushing us forward and forward insisting on it's objectivity and accuracy, no one site can make claim to absolute truth. So we should take a breath on our forward march of progress, and take a moment to move in circles.<br />
<br />
We also believe, following Kierkegaard, that &quot;a decision is a terrible thing&quot;, and no amount of knowledge or debate can absolve us of responsibility for our actions. We try to calculate our actions, weigh the costs and benefits, consider every potential scenario - this is nothing but an attempt to assuage our anxiety at our always imperfect knowledge. While it may make us highly educated, it leaves us ignorant to the moral and political consequences of our action.<br />

<span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="mso-special-character: footnote;"><span class="MsoEndnoteReference">It seems that each year, William V. Spanos comes out with a book somewhat relevant to the resolution. This year is no exception.<br />
In his new 2010 book, Spanos sketches a memoir of his experience in Dresden and more generally as an American soldier and POW in WWII. It was while he was captured as a prisoner of war that he witnessed the firebombing of the &quot;open city&quot; of Dresden for 24 hours. Further, he was forced to confront this exceptionalist violence up close when he was assigned the task of cleaning up the bodies of this devastated city. He refers to this as the &quot;zero zone&quot;: meaning spatially, the razed city of Dresden/Hiroshima/Nagasaki and temporally as that moment when the benign american national identity confronts its malignant praxis.<br />
<br />
In response to this violence, we affirm the topic <em>in time,</em> attuned to the differences that time disperses. This <em>interesse</em>ted affirmation allows us to be reflexive and political.<br />
