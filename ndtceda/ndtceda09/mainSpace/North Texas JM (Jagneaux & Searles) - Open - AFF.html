Contention One is Inherency:<br />
The U.S. deploys two warheads on submarines – the power and accuracy of the W-88 warhead makes it the key factor in undermining nuclear stability<br />

Perhaps the most devastating ... submarine deployment in the future.<br />

<br />

Even without detonation, the W-88 is prone to water damage that would irradiate the oceans<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two is Russia:<br />
Russia maintains high alert and the Dead Hand in response to the threat of US submarines – many factors threaten to trigger the machine and cause nuclear war independently from accidental launch<br />

<br />
Feasibility and Affordability. ... inspections each year.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The W-88 is a unique first-strike weapon – replacing it with the W-76 will not allow hard target counterforce missions even if the Trident Missile is upgraded<br />

<br />
The conventional version ... according to officials.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Russia still relies on early warning systems and unilateral cuts are key<br />

[Thomas, Stanley Foundation, Sandia Report, “De-Alerting and De-activating nuclear weapons”]<br />
<br />
<br />
Russian military leaders ... between the two sides.<br />
<br />
Contention Four is Framework:<br />
1) Interpretation - Competitive policy option and/or the status quo.<br />
2) Limits/Predictability<br />
3) Education<br />
4) AFF Choice<br />
5) Independent Voter if conceded<br />
6) Policy debate over nuclear policies key to challenge governmental policies, allow social change and prevent nuclear war<br />
