<strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10.0pt;">A) Textually – the affirmative ought to be held responsible for the rhetoric in their plan text; the counter-plan tests the desirability of the language of the affirmative's policy. </span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10.0pt;">B) Functionally – the terminology used in describing policies is critical. </span></strong><br />

In this way we are able to turn language in on itself and consider its insufficiencies, in this case, the insufficiency of the extension of the word “weapon” into the nuclear age<br />

<h3 id="toc8"><a name="Pittsburgh LS-GSU Round 7-Nuclear taboo:"></a><strong>Nuclear taboo:</strong></h3>
The aff reinforces the nuclear taboo, relying on an ideological<br />
prohibition against the use of the bomb and recreating the image of<br />
hte nuclear weapon as the ultimate societal harm.<br />
Tannenwald 05 [&quot;Stigmatizing the Bomb: Origins of the Nuclear Taboo.&quot;<br />
via ProjectMUSE]<br />
<br />
To invoke the nuclear taboo is to glorify the dualistic taboo<br />
structure itself. Just as the Christian prohibition on sex<br />
de-eroticizes sexuality to preserve its function, nuclear tabooism<br />
posits the libertine in opposition to the puritan, creating the<br />
impulse for transgression. The only way out is to affirm eroticism as<br />
experience, not as a libertine but as a human something more than<br />
animalistic mechanism.<br />
