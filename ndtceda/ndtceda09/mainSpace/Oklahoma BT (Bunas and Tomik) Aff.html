 Biopolitical governmentality engages in a technological framing of the social which sacrifices life in the name of saving populations  <br />

<br />
The challenge is to criticize these modalities of technology – the attempt to control populations is ultimately a plurality of technologies of the body which regulate political rationalities, knowledges and discourses. This power regime of truth encourages the violence which plagues the international system  <br />

<br />
The nuclear arsenal presents us with an opportunity to engage in critical resistance against this biopolitical control. Truman’s decision to introduce the nuclear arsenal into our war fighting capacity has created a normalized technology of violence which engages in an acceptance of the radical negation of the other. We refuse to accept Truman’s decision to use the bomb and instead offer the opinion of Leo Szilard, who brought us the knowledge necessary to utilize the nuclear chain reaction, as written in a 1945 Petition to the President of the United States  <br />

Saying no to Truman’s decision may seem piecemeal or anti-revolutionary, however, this act of refusal is resistance to the master-narrative of the nuclear arsenal  <br />

This historical investigation presents us with the opportunity to be critical intellectuals, our method is essential to producing resistance across the spectrum of political struggles. Voting affirmative embraces the counter-art of being not governed quite so much. We aren’t promising anything radical, just a chance a different aesthetic of resistance<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">  </span><br />
Resistance comes first – though many misread Foucault’s analysis of power as subordinating resistance to power, it is resistance which ontologically precedes power. Our act of resistance is necessary for the creation of a subject because it opens the possibility of resistance against the self.  <br />

<br />
This act of resistance is an ethical –political response – our refusal of the master-narrative of history is act of self-relation which produces a politics which is capable of ethical actions.<br />

Our resistance is outside of the notion of politics as war – this epistemology of power structures the totality of the way we know the political which guarantees continued violence <br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;">P 432 “weapons that can destroy…you decide”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Nuclear buildup structues itself around the notion of a threat out there that we must protect ourselves against, a dangerous other who wants to do us harm. During the cold war this image was that of Russia eagter to destroy, not just everything we hold valuable and good, but the country as well. With theend of the cold war a new threat has presenced itself, the image of the terrorist. This new enemy is invisible however, always lurking and waiting for our mistakes ready to strike. The united states becomes viewed as merely looking to defend itself, removing any check on its power.<br />

<span style="font-family: Arial;">“every power structure has to rely…the real criminal”<br />
<br />
The world is will to power and nothing besides. The image of the dangerous other we must protect ourselves against is a power seizure, it is the realization of only one possibility and only one explanation of the world. Instead of accepting this as moral law, we should see it for what it is, what we all are, merely an expression of one will to power</span><br />

“we can begin with some…always remain possible”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">The logic of MAD is the logic of ressentiment par excellence, it attempts to make us feel secure without ever reaching us there, doing nothing to remove the dangers of threats themselves. The strange and alien become identified as evil, labeled a threat that must be dealt with. This strikes at difference itself. Deterrence strikes away at all that makes life worth while</span><br />
<br />

“one must begin with nietzsche’s idea….calculation of risks and benefits”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should permanently disarm the United States' entire nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
OUR BUILDUP OF WEAPONS IS ROOTED IN A NOTION OF DEFENSE. THIS CRETS A NEVER ENDING CYLE OF PROLIFERATION AS WE SECURITIZE LIFE IN THE NAME OF SAFETY. Instead we view disarm as a break away from the system, casing the sword down shattering it once and for all, only out of a height of feeling.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Nietzsche human all to human aphorism 284 1878<br />
“the means to real peace…and from up high”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Nuclear weapons are a part of a larger system to approach to conflict itself. Assumed to keep us safe, small scale disasters that are unimaginable under mad become incomprehensible. In fact it is the very notion that nuclear weapons deter conflict that results in grander events of violence.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">James der derian national security: an accident waiting to happen, predicting the present 27:3 2k5<br />
“it often takes a catastrophe…total war by other means”<br />
<br />
Deterrence renders us purely reactive like buzzing bees to the herd. The plan acts as a bellstroke returning us to the question of who we are.<br />
<br />
Nietzsche 1887, <u>On the Genealogy of Morality</u><br />
&quot;we are unknown to ourselves...when it comes to ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Disarm may make us more safe to break away from the web of bureaucracy and demonization, but we don’t really care about that. Our claim is not that somehow extinction is immoral, but rather that our focus should instead be on the affirmation of life itself. The number of threats we can imagine is never ending, and our responses similarly. Rather the value of the aff is the opening up of vulnerability, the acceptane of the contingency and disorder inside of the world. This reclaims life for ourselves</span><br />
