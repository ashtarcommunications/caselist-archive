1. In the forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review, the Obama administration has a chance to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy by repudiating Cold War thinking and adopting a no-first-use doctrine.<br />
<br />
Plan text: The United States Federal Government should adopt a declaratory posture committing to no first use of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: Committment Trap<br />
<br />
2. Multiple scenarios cause deterrence failure for chemical and biological weapons.<br />
<br />
3. The status quo policy of &quot;calculated ambiguity&quot; toward CBWs creates a committment trap, causing the US to escalate to nuclear first use in the event of deterrence failure in order to maintain the credibility of its threat.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: Mission Creep<br />
<br />
4. Using nuclear weapons as a deterrent to non-nuclear &quot;WMDs&quot; causes mission creep which justifies nuclear first use in an increasing number of contingencies.<br />
<br />
5. Finally, actual first use by the US would be catastrophic - it would shatter the NPT, destroy the taboo against nuclear use for terrorists and states alike, and encourage further nuclear use by Russia, China, India and Pakistan.<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Proliferation. We'll isolate three internal links.<br />
<br />
6. First, prestige. First use policies inflate the value of nuclear weapons by affirming that they are a military necessity - adopting an NFU posture is key to reinforcing international norms against nuclear acquisition and use.<br />
<br />
7. Second, negative security assurances. First use options undermine negative security assurances, which are key to the viability of the entire nonproliferation regime.<br />
<br />
8. Third, Iran. US no-first-use declaration will increase international diplomatic support for tougher measures against new proliferators like Iran. Further, US nuclear threats empower forces which favor nuclear weapons development in Iran.<br />
<br />
9. Proliferation causes extinction - nuclear arms races and miscalculated nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Advantage 3: India<br />
<br />
10. India directly models US first use &quot;hedges&quot; in their own nuclear doctrine. This increases the likelihood of nuclear escalation in future conflicts with Pakistan, and causes regional proliferation.<br />
<br />
11. India-Pakistan war means extinction.<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />
<br />
12. Declaratory policy matters. Even if the plan is only symbolic, adopting an NFU policy has &quot;trickle down&quot; effects on war planners, signaling that nuclear use is not appropriate in any contingency. Plan also changes the context for debates among both policymakers and the public regarding the usability of nuclear weapons, and reinforces international norms against the spread and use of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
13. Now is the key time - an NFU declaration ends US inconsistency regarding negative security assurances, which is key to a successful 2010 NPT Review Conference.<br />
<br />
14. Negative arguments are based on defenses of &quot;ambiguity&quot; or uncertainty, CBW deterrence, and lack of verification collapse under scrutiny. The benefits of NFU far outweigh any of their case turns.
