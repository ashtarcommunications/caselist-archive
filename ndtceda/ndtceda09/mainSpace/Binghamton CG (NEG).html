Austin Round 5 - neg vs Cornell PW (Counterinfrastructure targeting)<br />
judge: Kelly Young<br />
voted: neg<br />
1-off: Butler<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt;">The questions of survivability, or the counting nature of utility, will always fail to bring about either a protection for the social body, or for the possibility of ethics. Our bodies are social formations, always already connected to the social forms which allow us to grow and survive. We must respond to this world from the level of the body, the level of the precarious social. The only way that we can conceive of ethics is by altering the logic of utility.  </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> </span><br />
Removing the body’s precarity from considerations of war severs the interconnectivity among groups of peoples. Ignoring the body draws lines in the sand as to those worth grieving; this determines who lives and who dies. Assuming precarity as the starting point for considerations of war making is a prerequisite to ethical framing of war.<br />

<span style="font-size: 9pt;"> </span><br />
Alt: Reject the framing of intelligibility and embrace the precarity of life. <br />
<span class="CharacterStyle1"><strong>Butler 2004</strong> <span style="font-size: 7pt;">(Judith, “When Life is Grievable” p 145-151)</span></span><br />
CASE<br />
When we attempt to posit and prevent future disasters or conflicts we only bureaucratize catastrophe and create force-multipliers that cause ultracatastrophes like 9/11, Katrina, and Chernobyl. This approach will always fail because the technological enframing of each affirmative scenario relies upon the absurd assumption that the only obstacle to progress is our failure to target correctly.<br />

Switch to infrastructure targeting is rooted in urbicide – such explicit targeting commits a genocide against urban populations and is what makes nuclear war possible through dehumanization – Japan serves as an example par excellence. <br />

<br />
ASPEC<br />
<br />
Interpretation: the aff debaters should specify their relationship to the agent of the resolution<br />
<br />
Violation – the aff assumes implementation without speccing their relationship to the agent<br />
<br />
Reasons to prefer – 1 is ground: aff skews ground because they can shift out of USFG links by saying they as debaters call upon the government for change, then later say that they’re a top-down solution because the USFG acts, not the debaters<br />
<br />
2 is education: aff’s failure to specify nullifies the potential for education about activism and participation in politics that doesn’t assume roleplaying as the entire USFG itself – makes debaters believe that the only political avenue they have is endorsement of a USFG action when in fact other political options exist, which leads to bad policymaking, turning the underlying structure of their aff<br />
<br />
3 is ethics: conflating the debaters and the USFG results in an ethical distancing to actions the government takes in our name – this is an independent solvency turn since this enables the aff to say they don’t have to take a stance on what’s done with nuclear weapons or how deterrence functions post-plan in a world of conventional weapons alone<br />
<br />
4 is extratopicality – failing to spec the relationship between their affirmation and the agent of the resolution justifies infinite actors in the resolution, killing predictable research burdens and making it impossible to be negative – this kills clash and topic education because we never get to discuss the consequences of affirmative action without knowing the relationship between the debaters and the USFG.<br />
<br />
failure to specify is a reason to reject the affirmative for the impacts of<br />
education, ground, and ethics as listed above.<br />

<br />
CASE<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s rhetoric ignores the accident’s role in technology: to reveal the substance in question itself. The attempt to mitigate accidents by way of technological quick-fixes only proliferates the likelihood of catastrophe because of our ignorance of the way progress functions, while also forcing the substances themselves into standing reserve.<br />

<br />
Creation or collapse, …of the incriminated substances.<br />
<br />
The aff’s portrayal of the accident ignores our responsibility not merely for the accident itself, but for the production of these situations that further compound these accidents through a state-centric lens (think FEMA’s response in the wake of Katrina) --- this cannot come from the purely managerial approach of the aff but from a methodology that attempts to negotiate amidst the many conflicting cultures and points of view from which the accident can be understood.<br />

Generic badiou shell is below.<br />
Democratic politics today has become the administration of economic necessity, where our very subjectivity has been formed in advance by capital. The aff’s rally in the name of preventing nuclear holocaust relies upon the same process: turning the spectacle of the economy into a manufactured consent utilizing the ‘with us or against us’ binary.<br />

<strong><u>The modern name for necessity is...</u></strong><br />
<u>: death drive.</u><br />
The affirmative’s political ideals of democratic process and capitalist progress presuppose an already existing evil, an evil which must be overcome by goodness. By postulating an already existing evil instead than a primary good, the true function of evil can never be dealt with and will lead us to extinction.<br />

<strong><u>truth's very foundation&quot;</u></strong>.<br />

Rather, as autonomous ethical actors, we should stand in solidarity and say “Not In Our Name!”, all in an engagement with ethics such that we keep fidelity to the event<br />

<strong><u>only particularities and differences.</u></strong><br />
The alternative’s engagement in ethics is fidelity to the truth-event.Rather than adopt the affirmative’s intervention into the arena of purely objective knowledge, we should declare a militant fidelity to the subjective yet universal truth of the situation the affirmative describes. This requires an ethics that demands that we “keep going,” which in turn entails rejection of the affirmative’s attempts to objectify and name the event.<br />

<u>The part played by ‘ethics’...<br />
— a truth-process.</u><br />
Fidelity to the event is incompatible with state excess. The attempt to similarly code the two, as is the case with the perm, guarantees the politics of power and state violence and makes egalitarian maxims impossible.<br />
