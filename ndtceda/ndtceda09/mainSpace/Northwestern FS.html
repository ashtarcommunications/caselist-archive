<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There are two types of damage-limitation – pre-emptive and retaliatory – the plan only eliminates <u>half</u> the mission against China</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“From a military perspective, this modernization…of the past decade’s counterforce upgrades.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Their Yarynich and Starr evidence is about Lieber &amp; Press’s model of a US first strike on Russia – not China </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yarynick and Starr 07 – Valery &amp; Steven, Mary 4, “Nuclear Primacy is a Fallacy”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Lieber and Press state that, “our model does not…because a real nuclear war is possible only one time.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This distinction matters – China has 20 silos while Russia has a full triad – and Chinese silos are substantially easier to destroy</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Lieber and Press 10 – “Second Strike: is the US nuclear arsenal outmoded?” Foreign Affairs</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Kristensen, McKinzie, and Oelrich also contend…highly vulnerable to a US airburst attack.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Chinese silos aren’t hardened – counterforce strikes can easily destroy them with minimal casualties</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Declaratory Policy CP</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Executive should declare that the United States will not initiate nuclear first-strike damage limitation against China.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Competes – doesn’t restrict – plan has to be binding</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Hardy Myers, 2001, Oregon Attorney General Opinion OP-8277, 2/13</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“We begin with the ordinary meaning…govern addition or increment to”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Declaratory policy doesn’t restrict – it’d be overridden in a crisis for pre-emptive self-defense but no bolt-from-the-blue</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“The nuance is important…Review included this option.”</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Strategic Reassurance DA</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Current nuclear engagement with China is reciprocal reassurance – requiring China to commit to reassurances about its rise in exchange for potential US accommodation</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Just days before the 60th anniversary of the People’s Republic of China…world with clear reassurance about its intentions.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Unilateral NFU to China destroys the reciprocal strategic reassurance framework – causes backsliding</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“On September 24, 2009, Deputy Secretary of State…why some traditional alliances are still alive today.”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>China CP</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Text: The United States Federal Government should offer China a bilateral agreement that obligates the United States to refrain from nuclear first-strikes against China, and obligates China to refrain from nuclear first-use against the United States, so long as the agreement remains in effect. The executive should comply and order compliance with the terms of the agreement so long as it remains in effect. The United States federal government should not initiate abrogation of the agreement.</span><br />

Text: The United States federal government should move its B61 gravity bombs currently stored in Europe to the United States and offer, in conjunction with this move, to eliminate B61 gravity bombs in Europe if the Russian Federation agrees to increase the transparency of its tactical nuclear arsenal, confine its tactical nuclear weapons to central storage facilities deep within its national territories, and eliminate a portion of its tactical nuclear weapons.<br />

Withdrawing TNWs to the US and negotiating a permanent end to deployment solves – Russia will agree to transparency and centralization – spills over to TNW arsenal reductions<br />

“I believe, however, that the task of dealing with tactical nuclear weapons…then it just might come together.”<br />

Empirically proven – unilateral TNW cuts don’t cause reciprocity<br />
Miller 10 “germany opens pandora’s box”<br />
“these 200-odd…country, including Russia.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Russia says yes – none of their answers assume specifics – presume an offer simultaneous eliminate their entire arsenal. Cp more limited request means Russia agrees.<br />
<br />
<br />
Key distinctions:<br />
<br />
1. Solve unilateral key args – cp unilaterally returns us tnw to the us before negotiating a permanent end to the nuclear sharing mission – their ev says Russia this us removal is a prereq to future negotiations. Only the cp accesses that sequencing – plan’s permanent end to deployment means we have nothing to trade in negotiations.<br />
<br />
2. Asymmetric reductions – Russia has said no in the past to reciprocal tnw elimination because they have 10x as many tnw as nato – no sense to trade 2000 for 200 – cp requirement of transparency and centralized storage followed by elimination of a portion of their arsenal causes argreement – podvig and sokov. Say no presumes asking Russia to eliminate all tnw.<br />
<br />
Russia says yes:<br />
<br />
1. Broadly: Russia explicitly staked out pref for negotiated bilat controls over reciprocal cuts – bilat necessary to confirm i-status and lock in us reductions<br />
<br />
Specifically true now - Russia has multiple interests with nato<br />
Miller 10 “germany opens pandora’s box”<br />

NET BENEFIT TO CP – MEDVEDEV DA – BLOCK CARDS<br />

Domestic instability causes vicious internal conflict—draws in the military, collapses control over nuclear weapons, causing prolif –ends in nuclear war<br />
David 99 – Steven R., January-February 1999, “Saving America from the Coming Civil Wars,” Foreign Affairs<br />
“If internal war does strike Russia…the chaos that would follow a Russian civil war.”<br />
<br />
Russian economic reform is the most significant restraint on its expansionist foreign policy – failure guarantees aggressive expansionism and jacks US-Russia relations<br />
Cohen 9 – Ariel Cohen, November 2, 2009, “Russia’s Economic Crisis and US-Russia Relations: Troubled Times Ahead,” online<br />
“Clearly, the type of economy and form of government that Russia assumes…better served by cooperating with the U.S. and the West than by subverting it.”<br />
<br />
Unchecked Russian expansionism destroys hegemony<br />
Cohen 9 – Ariel Cohen, March 12, 2009, “How the Obama Administration Should Deal with Russia’s Revisionist Foreign Policy,” online<br />
“Despite the economic crisis that provided a reality check for Moscow…its institutions while offering no viable alternatives.”<br />

Russian economic decline destroys nuclear command and control – makes accidental launch inevitable<br />
Von Hippel 98 – Frank, November 1, 1998, “De-alerting Nuclear Missiles,” online<br />
“The danger of mistaken launch has been reduced by the relaxation…make it appear ripe for a new period of political instability.”<br />
<br />
Extinction<br />
Mintz 1 – Morton, February 26, 2001, “Two Minutes to Launch,” The American Prospect<br />
“Hair-trigger alert means this: the missiles carrying those warheads are armed and fueled at all times…it would be, basically, a nuclear war by checklist, by rote.”<br />
<br />
Global financial crisis makes war likely – magnifies the severity of other conflicts – WWII only became a World War because of the Depression<br />
G. Robert M. Miller, 10-25-2008, “Guns vs. Shovels – The Central Question Behind Our Next Economy”<br />
“But before we look at the modern ‘Guns versus Butter’ model, it first has to be noted that this phrase…considerably improved; this was true for many western nations.”<br />
<br />
Sustained downturn shreds the resiliency of every international check on conflict – makes global escalation likely<br />
Laitman 8 – Michael, 12-7-2008, “The Financial Crisis May Trigger A World War”<br />
“As the crisis develops, scientists are trying to predict whether a third…will sweep all countries involuntarily and uncontrollably toward World War III”<br />
<br />
START makes a reciprocal, negotiated framework inevitable – explicit TNW discussions in parallel are key<br />
Pifer 09 – Steven, May 2009, “Beyond START: Negotiating the Next Step in US and Russian Strategic Nuclear Arms Reductions”<br />
“While the focus will understandably be on negotiating…aggressive effort to constrain nuclear proliferation worldwide.”<br />
<br />
Link only goes our way – there’s zero political support in Russia for TNW reductions unless they get something for it – Russian unilateral reciprocity would be seen as giving up a bargaining chip<br />
Sokov et al. 10 – Nikolai, and William C. Potter, February 2010, Survival, Vol. 52 No. 1 pp. 75-96<br />
“With the exception of naval weapons, which are kept in reserve…without major Western concessions on issues of concern for Russia.”<br />
<br />
The Foreign Ministry’s key – they’re the only domestic player who would consider spending political resources pushing Russian TNW cuts<br />
Sokov et al. 10 – Nikolai, and William C. Potter and Miles A. Pomper, February 2010, Survival, Vol. 52 No. 1 pp. 75-96<br />
“Finally, a close look at the alignment of key Russian interest groups…the navy’s interest wins by default.”<br />
<br />
Medvedev’s economic reforms will fail now because he lacks political clout – the CP is a key win that bolsters his cred.<br />
Earth Times 3-1 – “Analysis: weak Medvedev marks two years as Russian president,” March 1, 2010, online<br />
“Russian President Dmitry Medvedev marks the halfway point…limiting the country’s nuclear arsenals which expired in December.”<br />
<br />
Russian economic outlook is good for 2010 – perception of commitment to reform is key<br />
WSJ 12-22-2009 “S&amp;P Raises Outlook on Russia to Stable”<br />
“Standard &amp; Poor’s ratings services raised its outlook on Russia’s ratings…turn out smaller by several percentage points.”<br />
<br />
Reforms are key to the economy<br />
RT 9-10-09, Russia Today, “Medvedev calls for public to route russia’s course”<br />
