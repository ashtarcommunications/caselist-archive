( ) Nuclear deflection is already illegal under international law and industrialized countries strongly prefer <u>non-nuclear</u> alternatives---in fact, they think nuclear should be a “last resort”, <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Valentine 2</span></span> – Lee Valentine, Director of the Space Studies Institute, 2002, “A Space Roadmap: Mine the Sky, Defend the Earth, Settle the Universe,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Articles/Guests/atwgBriefingLeeValentine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hobbyspace.com/AAdmin/archive/Articles/Guests/atwgBriefingLeeValentine.html</a><br />
&quot;Deflection technology is not the sole purview of <span class="underline">the Defense Department</span>, most particularly since their <span class="underline">preferred solution &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
&quot;for the purpose of NEO deflection is something that NASA should have on the front burner.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) International opinion controls what method we’d use---opposition means zero chance it’d be nuclear <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">NYT 7</span></span> – New York Times, April 3, 2007, “Finding Doomsday Asteroids,” lexis <br />
&quot;Developing ways to deflect asteroids is more problematic. <span class="underline">NASA suggests that the best solution would be to explode a &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
&quot;wait to see whether a real threat even exists.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) Their Schweickart ev only says the public would demand it if there weren’t <u>any</u> other options---which makes nukes a last resort <u>now</u>, or <u>after</u> an impact from an NEO, which causes extinction anyway according to the 1AC <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schweickart ‘4</span></span> (Russell, Chair of the B612 Foundation, former astronaut, Executive Vice President of CTA Commercial Systems, Inc. and Director of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Systems and research, and scientist at the Experimental Astronomy Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), “Asteroid Deflection; Hopes and Fears,” Aug., Presented at the World Federation of Scientists Workshop on Planetary Emergencies, Erice, Sicily, August 2004, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.b612foundation.org/papers/Asteroid_Deflection.doc</a>)<br />
&quot;Finally, any nuclear explosive option is and will remain inextricably intertwined with global geopolitics and, in fact, raise to &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;option is the only one available to protect the Earth from asteroid impacts.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) International opinion ensures that nukes would be a last resort now <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schweickart 7</span></span> – Russell L. Schweickart, former Apollo astronaut, chairman of the B612 Foundation, March 19, 2007, “Independent Analysis of Alternatives that could be employed to divert a NEO on a likely collision course with Earth,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=23661" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=23661</a><br />
&quot;The other <span class="underline">obvious considerations re the nuclear option are the international legal prohibitions and the world-wide public &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
&quot;timely NEO deflection decisions.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) Non-nuclear tech exists now and we’d only use nukes against an asteroid that required them---highly unlikely and means they’re already a last resort <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schweickart 7</span></span> – Russell L. Schweickart, former Apollo astronaut, chairman of the B612 Foundation, March 19, 2007, “Independent Analysis of Alternatives that could be employed to divert a NEO on a likely collision course with Earth,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=23661" rel="nofollow">http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=23661</a><br />
&quot;# <span class="underline">There are three current NEO deflection concepts which I consider</span> in this analysis to be essentially <span class="boldunderline">ready for &quot; </span><br />
<span class="boldunderline">AND </span><br />
&quot;deflected will not be left on a trajectory with a near term return impact.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) Nuclear roles in deflection will be phased out by 2020---and they won’t be used before then <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schweickart &amp; Graham 8</span></span> – Russell, former astronaut who flew on Apollo 9, heads the B612 Foundation, &amp; Thomas, special representative of the president for arms control in the 1990s and now chairs Thorium Power Ltd., “NASA's Flimsy Argument for Nuclear Weapons,” Scientific American, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nasas-flimsy-argument-for-nuclear-weapons" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nasas-flimsy-argument-for-nuclear-weapons</a><br />
&quot;As NASA continues to find big NEOs, the calculations of risk change accordingly. A decade ago, before astronomers began &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;Extraterrestrial dangers need not be considered.&quot;<br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 12pt;"><br />
</span><br />
( ) Two arguments take out their NASA nuclear reliance internal link:<br />
<u>1) Politics</u>---NASA was under political pressure to include nukes in their report---a nuclear role in deflection is just a pretext, not an actual plan <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Orion 8</span></span> – Egan Orion, July 28, 2008, “Nuking an incoming asteroid is a daft idea,” The Inquirer, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037211/nuking-incoming-asteroid-daft-idea" rel="nofollow">http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1037211/nuking-incoming-asteroid-daft-idea</a><br />
&quot;The former lunar lander pilot said <span class="underline">a NASA report that made that recommendation last year was misleading</span>. He felt <span class="underline">it was &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
&quot;2015.&quot;<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2) Funding</span></u><span style="font-size: 12pt;">---NASA didn’t include any other deflection options in its report because it doesn’t have the money to fund them---it was a way of giving Congress the finger and demanding more funding  </span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schweickart 7</span></span> – Russell L. Schweickart, former Apollo astronaut, chairman of the B612 Foundation, March 16, 2007, “The Sky Is Falling. Really.,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEED71E31F935A25750C0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEED71E31F935A25750C0A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all</a><br />
&quot;The bad news? While this all looks fine on paper, scientists haven't had a chance to try it in practice. And this is where &quot;<br />
AND<br />
<span class="underline">&quot;have opted for a federal form of civil disobedience.&quot; </span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">( ) Even if they’re right that NASA is pushing nuclear deflection, it’s only for <u>very large</u> NEOs  </span></span><br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schweickart &amp; Graham 8</span></span> – Russell, former astronaut who flew on Apollo 9, heads the B612 Foundation, &amp; Thomas, special representative of the president for arms control in the 1990s and now chairs Thorium Power Ltd., “NASA's Flimsy Argument for Nuclear Weapons,” Scientific American, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nasas-flimsy-argument-for-nuclear-weapons" rel="nofollow">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nasas-flimsy-argument-for-nuclear-weapons</a><br />
&quot;Recently, however, a counterargument has been advanced—by NASA. <span class="underline">In 2005 Congress ordered the space agency to &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
<span class="underline">&quot;deflect an NEO from a collision course</span>, but it completely neglected the need for precision in such a procedure.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) Nuclear deflection’s key for large objects---this is all from their author btw <br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Schweickart 7</span></span> – Russell L. Schweickart, former Apollo astronaut, chairman of the B612 Foundation, March 16, 2007, “The Sky Is Falling.

&quot;Another problem with <span class="underline">the report</span> was that, while it outlined other possibilities, it <span class="underline">estimated that using a nuclear-armed &quot; </span><br />
<span class="underline">AND </span><br />
&quot;three-foot putt; the bigger bang is not always better.&quot;<br />
<br />
( ) Err neg – nuclear deflection methods are improving <br />

 1) Reduce and restrict a mission by eliminating one or more of the current missions for nuclear weapons, or<br />
2) Reduce and restrict the role – by decreasing the importance, of nuclear weapons in meeting security challenges<br />

(“Taking Disarmament Seriously: Prospects for Changing Strategic Doctrines, Prospects for Changing Strategic Doctrines, Nuclear Challenges and Policy Options for the Next U.S. Administration,”)<br />
One commonly advocated …the risk of nuclear elimination<br />
<br />
Reducing and restricting the role requires asset substitution<br />

Second, there are rather numerous examples…conventional weapons (forces).<br />
<br />
Asset substitutions is key to a substantial reduction<br />

Vote neg –<br />
A) more limiting – forces to replace nuclear weapons with conventional weapons, instead of theoretical policy statements like “nuclear weapons less important” give the aff advantages based on symbolic steps, but no neg DA’s because it does actualize change is using nukes – kills the topic at the NDT<br />
B) Better ground – based on strategic importance of nuclear weapons instead of small perceptual changes
