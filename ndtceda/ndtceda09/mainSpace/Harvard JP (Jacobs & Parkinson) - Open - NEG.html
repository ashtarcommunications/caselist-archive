 <strong>Thesis: the NPT makes a false claim to universality that justifies total war</strong><br />
<strong>The parameters are determined by Western, liberal democracies, which means that international regimes structurally favor these countries.</strong><br />
<strong>They also define democratic states as good in opposition to bad states that violate the international agreement – this means that decisions to go to war are couched in identitarian rather than strategic terms</strong><br />
Bishai and Behnke 2007, Linda S. Bishai and Andreas Behnke, Senior Program Officer in Education Program @ US Institute of Peace and Lecturer in Dept. of Politics and IR @ Univ. of Reading, 2007, The International Political Thought of Carl Schmitt, p. 115-7<br />
'The ... behavioural distinctions ... votes for the incumbent's list. (Reisman 2000: 243)<br />
<br />
<strong>This is particularly true for the NPT</strong><br />
<strong>First, the NPT is discriminatory – it’s structurally biased against non-nuclear weapons states and ultimately fails since it boosts the prestige of nuclear weapons</strong><br />
David Mutimer, Prof. Political Science @ York Univ., 2000, The Weapons State: Proliferation and the Framing of Security, p. 150-4<br />
India's opposition to the &quot;proliferation&quot; image...appropriate, producing outcomes that are perverse.<br />

<strong>Second, the NPT actively justifies aggressive war</strong><br />
Richard Falk ‘8 American professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University At the Nuclear Precipice: Catastrophe or Transformation? p. 47<br />
There is also a need to evaluate whether...the past uses of such weapons.<br />
<br />
<strong>Violence is inevitable and we can only control the form that it takes. The affirmative endorses the paradigm of total rather than limited war both ideologically – by designating terrorists as absolute, irrational enemies of humanity with whom negotiation is impossible – and materially – by giving the US the means to attack from nowhere, positioning it outside of conflict space. The empirically demonstrated failure of this technique guarantees unending war</strong><br />
Kam Shapiro, Asst. Prof. of Politics and Government @ Illinois St. Univ., 2008, Carl Schmitt and the Intensification of Politics, p. 104-7<br />
On the side of sovereignty, formal hostilities...ephemeral, for a wartime administration.<br />
<br />
<strong>The impact: wars of aggression, carried out under the banner of universality, cause wars to be limitless rather than circumscribed and provide the founding justification for the existence of nuclear weapons. Their appeal to the universality of the NPT guarantees the inevitability and magnification of 1AC impacts</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>The alternative: reject the affirmative’s false claim to universality and recognize the validity of enmity.</strong><br />
<strong>Some sort of violence is inevitable – the crucial question is whether this violence is total or not. The alternative allows for the creation of legitimate, symmetrical enemies that cause warfare to be bracketed</strong><br />

Third, selling the treaties on nuclear limitations... capabilities exceed the costs in security or prestige.<br />
<br />
<strong>This move of depoliticization actively constructs total war as the only government option. It follows the logic that only non-political means can deal with enemies that subvert politics</strong><br />

The critique of depoliticization reminds us...what Giorgio Agamben calls ‘killing machines’ (2005: 86).<br />
<br />
<strong>The PGS makes all conflict asymmetrical and total. Instead of two armies facing each other and fighting over space, it involves the descent of US military might from above. If the most readily available tactic of war is death from above, all enemies are reduced to inhuman statistics rather than legitimate opponents who are allowed a political voice</strong><br />

<strong>1. <u>(T) Restrict</u>:</strong><br />
A) Interpretation – “restrict” means external limitation of people or things – <em>another actor</em> OR <em>material conditions</em> must impose an external constraint on a particular mission<br />
OED 1989<br />
“Restrict: 1. Trans. To confine (some person or thing) to or within certain limits to limit or bound.”<br />
<br />
2. Missions of the nuclear weapons arsenal flow from the president – must externally constrain the president<br />
Science Daily, 4/8/2009, “Nuclear Policy on the path toward nuclear disarmament: New Report,”<br />
“The current rationale for maintaining an arsenal of nuclear weapons no longer…for eliminating all but one mission for nuclear forces.”<br />
<br />
B) Violation – Declaratory policy doesn’t restrict anything<br />
Pollack, 2009 [Joshua, consultant to the US government. He has conducted studies in several areas, including arms control, “Reducing the role of nuclear weapons.” 10/30<br />
“The entire idea of declaratory policy, after all, comes down to…NSA – boils down to “just a policy.”<br />
<br />
<strong>2. <u>Counterplan</u>:</strong><br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should preclude nuclear first use against the People’s Republic of China unless the People’s Republic of China revokes its no first use doctrine<br />
<br />
US must prepare for contingency of China’s reversal of NFU – only the Counterplan is consistent with this<br />
Baohui Zhang, 2008, Lingnan University, Hong Kong Comparative Strategy, Volume 27, Issue 2, March 2008, pages 164-182<br />
“There are indeed strong incentives for China to consider such a change due to both its inability to overcome the vast conventional gap with the United States and the current modernization…must prepare for such a likely contingency, given the overwhelming pressures on China to prevent a disastrous defeat in the Taiwan Strait.”<br />
<br />
<strong>3. <u>PGS Shift</u>:</strong><br />
China fears US conventional weapons and missile defense MORE than US nuclear developments – even though they are no designed for first strike purposes against China<br />
Hansell and Perfiyev, July 2009, “Engaging China and Russia on Nuclear Disarmament<br />
“Not only is the U.S. force to remain quite sizable, despite the two-thirds reduction codified in the Strategic Offensive Reductions…would arguably be the case if Washington sought a true first-strike option.26”<br />
<br />
3. <strong><u>Chinese Deterrence</u></strong>:<br />
Threat of nuclear first use is an asymmetric deterrent to the development of new weapons – prevent destabilizing arms races<br />
Colby 2009, Elbridge Colby, Adjunct Staff, RAND Corporation, “In the Eyes of the Experts: Analysis and Comment on America’s Strategic Posture,”<br />
“Accelerating advances across science and technology, to include in…rendering arms competitions less likely.”<br />
<br />
Credibility of US Extended Deterrent key to prevent Chinese miscalculation over Taiwan<br />
Dunn, 2007, Lewis A. Dunn, Senior VP and Deputy Group Manager @ Science Applications International Corporation, Summer 2007, “Deterrence Today: Roles, Challenges and Responses,”<br />
“Unlike the case with Russia, a U.S.-China nuclear crisis or even confrontation is…a broader reassure- ance vis-à-vis China.”<br />
<br />
Brink of war over Taiwan – strength of US Deterrent key<br />
Tom Plate, veteran US journalist, Jakarta Post, 9/15/2009, “EXAMINING BEIJING’S NEW POWELL DOCTRINE,” Lexis<br />
“China has not renounced its ‘right’ to use force to forestall…funding and the topics under investigation.”<br />

<br />
The Thesis: how we approach the question of nuclear abolition matters<br />
The plan’s endorsement of an <em>arms control approach</em> to nuclear weapons ensures that the world will never get to a world free of nuclear weapons. Complacency is fotered on two levels:<br />
- First – for the governmental decision-makers, who fail to re-orient their ways of thinking and come to believe that nuclear weapons can be made safe.<br />
- Second – for disarm movements, which are kept at bay because they are unable to sound the alarm about nuclear catastrophe.<br />
Only a full-sclae endorsement of disarmament can move the world in the right direction<br />
Schwartz and Derber, Nuclear Seduction 89 p 204-7<br />
“Many believe that nuclear arms control agreements …That requires a peace movement.”<br />
<br />
The first impact is existential threat – inevitable nuclear annihiliation – that exists as long as nuclear weapons exist. Until they are abolished, they will <em>inevitably</em> be used, causing annihilation.<br />
<br />
Ronald McCoy, Malaysian Physicians for Peace and Social Responsibility, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia (medicine, Conflict and Survival, Volume 23, Issue 4, November 2007 pp 259-66)<br />
“It is the unique nature of nuclear weapons that places them in a category of their own … nuclear weapons will almost surely follow.”<br />
<br />
The second impact is the nature of war – the existence of nuclear weapons changes the nature of war and politics. The materiality of strategy available to the military and the politicians determines how they think, and the character of the wars they fight.<br />
<br />
As long as nuclear weapons are part of military arsenal, all war becomes total war – a war in which the existence of a people is at stake, not merely a victory or loss as was the case in traditional war. This is all tied into our link story – how elites think and how citizens are mobilized. When the weapons exist, war is thought of in terms of totality, because we have to power to eliminate totally a group of people. When the weapons exist citizens are mobilized to defend entire nations, making extreme types of conflict not only likely but necessary to justify sovereign power. This makes any war fought when nuclear weapons exist inherently risky.<br />
<br />
Hannah Arendt, Heidegger’s girlfriend, The Promise of Politics, ed. Jerome Kohn, p 157-62<br />
<br />
“ A change in all this was possible only with the discovery….what had called it into existence.”<br />
<br />
AND the argument continued, but with a different author…<br />
Foucault 78 History of Sexuality vol 1 pp136-7<br />
<br />
“Since the classical age, the West has undergone…phenomena of the population.”<br />
<br />
The alternative: nuclear abolitionism.<br />
<br />
Only this alternative slves – it shifts the grounds of the debate over nuclear weaponry. The plan’s grounding in a logic of security, national interest, and preservation of the status quo permanently forecloses the possibility of disarmament for both levels of the link: nuclear elites don’t change their minds; and they continue to mobilize population in the defense of nuclear arsenals.<br />
<br />
A shift in frame is required: the case for abolition must be made in dispositive terms. Nuclear weapons must be outlawed. Only this approach reverses course and changes the minds of both the elites and the citizens.<br />
<br />
Zia Mian 09 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/abolishing_nuclear_weapons_debate.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/abolishing_nuclear_weapons_debate.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Some arguments that policy makers may advance for abolition will certainly conflict with … global security benefits that it would bring.<br />

a) The affirmative necessitates nuclear use – removing the objective of war termination means that the ONLY REMAINING JUSTIFICATIONS for nuclear weapons are either A. Pre-emption or B. Escalation. To the extent that nuclear weapons have any conceivable purpose, it’s because they could make war end quickly because of extreme damage. The affirmative removes this purpose – this means that nuclear strategists would be required to conceive of nuclear weapons ONLY AS TOOLS OF ESCALATION.<br />
When planners strategize in this way, their conceptions become reality – military planners will start to conduct wars and use nuclear weapons to escalate them.<br />

The existence of nuclear weapons creates the legitimacy deficit that nuclear states face in relation to their citizens. Because deterrence reverses the tradition relationship between the state and its citizens by forcing states to hold their own citizens hostage in the name of defense, strategies which let the state appear anti-nuclear allow it to keep citizens in check, preventing the abolition movements from working.<br />
States pursue anti-nuclear policies that come short of abolition in order to rationalize and internalize the use of nuclear weapons in their political and military doctrines.<br />
Preventing war termination is the ultimate expression of this tendency – the state claims that it won’t use nuclear weapons for a bad purpose, all the while concealing that every purpose for nuclear weapons is bad.<br />
