 First note that desire creates the illusion of the self and the suffering that defines the human condition. Our only capacity is thus to affirm the extermination of this desire in the face of perpetual death and an impermanent reality.<br />
Jonathan <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Dollimore 1998</span></span>(PhD, Professor of English at University of York, <em>Death, Desire and Loss in Western Culture</em>, p 54-56.)<br />

<br />
A rejection of this cycle of desire and the refusal to participate in dualistic binaries allows us to have an enlightened engagement with the world – the only way to achieve nirvana.<br />

The way things are here ... in their dependent co-origination.<br />
But a Buddhist ethic has to manifest in a politically engaged way. We can not remove ourselves from the system without dichotomizing us versus them - our awakening can only occur when everyone else is awakened as well.<br />

And, the threat of nuclear war through deterrence and the production of nuclear weapons represents the ultimate alienation of the self from the exterior world- the paradoxical and probabilistic ambiguities of matter and energy inherent to our collective nuclear “reality” reinforces the distinction between the self and the material, “outside” world – this view of reality risks extinction – we would destroy everything in order to save ourselves.<br />

We reject the notion of the United States federal government as an external entity distinct from ourselves — overcoming the assumption of difference is a key first step to a nondualistic framework. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />

Don’t confuse our intentions—we are not called to save the world and we recognize the impossibility of outright, systemic rejection of a self-centric, fear-based ethics of desire. But our refusal to rely on dualistic binaries and perceive the world’s ills as solvable through exterior actions entails a necessary first step to break a cultural addiction to desire and permanence.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Barnhill</span></span>, David Landis. <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2004</span></span> (Director of Environmental Studies and Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh, “Good Work: An Engaged Buddhist Response to the Dilemmas of Consumerism” <em>Buddhist-Christian Studies</em>, 24.1, p 55-63.)<br />

Our affirmation of a nondualist framework does not entail engagement with the cycle of desire we critique. Rather, it is the lynchpin to unraveling a terminal replication of systematic violence.<br />
Wayne <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Alt, 2001</span></span> (Associate Professor of Philosophy at The Community College of Baltimore County at Essex “There is no Paradox of Desire in Buddhism,” <em>Buddhism Today</em>, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/013-desire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/013-desire.htm</a>)<br />
It must be admitted that ... less than before forming the desire.<br />
<h3 id="toc3"><a name="x--Contention Three—Imagining Violence"></a>Contention Three—Imagining Violence</h3>
 As long as we have desire in our hearts, we are just like <span class="yshortcuts"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Don Quixote</span></span> - blindly flailing at windmills while ignoring the fact that we have created the enemy we are fighting. This ego-driven ideology makes violence inevitable – there will always be another crusade. Only by turning inward and rejecting the desire to make ourselves permanent can we have peace and happiness in our hearts – which is the only thing that ultimately matters. Both a framework which envisions difference and one which seeks to overcome this violence replicates the harms<br />
Ayya <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Khema, 1994</span></span> (Buddhist monk, “All of us beset by Birth, Decay, and Death.” <em>Buddhism Today,</em> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/003-allofus-5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhismtoday.com/english/philosophy/thera/003-allofus-5.htm</a>)<br />
If you have ever read ... we will always find another crusade.<br />
<br />
Moral and utilitarian codes prevent enlightenment. They are driven by fear and the desire to control others. The alternative is to overcome our sense of separation from the world and let genuine love and compassion manifest.<br />
Loy, David. 1988 ... of separation from the world.<br />
<br />
A discursive advocacy of desiring a solution to suffering is the only reason why the harms exist in the first place. Desire makes every impact inevitable.<br />

<br />
Our ethic of transcending desire comes first. Any political framework perpetuates a divisionary binary which is the root cause of all harms.<br />
Bell <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Hooks</span></span>, <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2006</span></span> (Professor of African and Afro-American Studies and English at <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University" rel="nofollow">Yale University</a></span>, “Buddhism and the Politics or Domination” in <em>Mindful Politics</em>, p 60-1)<br />
A similar door has opened ... as fixed markers in life.<br />
<br />
Last, put away your kritiks—our compounding of political action into discursive removal of the self into perpetual collective-becoming is the essential means to reactivating value.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Barnhill</span></span>, David Landis. (Director of Environmental Studies and Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh) <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2004</span></span>, “Good Work: An Engaged Buddhist Response to the Dilemmas of Consumerism” <em>Buddhist-Christian Studies</em>, 24.1, p 55-63.<br />
