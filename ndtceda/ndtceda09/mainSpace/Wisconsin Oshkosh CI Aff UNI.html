<br />
<strong>The United States foreign policy of containment arouse out of World War II and the fear that arose from communist spread. The fear arose from thinking that communism and capitalism were incompatible - Nuclear weapons became an integral part of containment of the communist threat - A California Content Standard proves these beliefs as they are taught to students even today</strong><br />
<br />
<em>California Content Standard 2005</em><br />
<br />
Origins of the Cold war and.....the brink of nuclear war.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, the policy of containment with nuclear weapons occurred because of an urge to control the world around us. This urge for control is fostered by the notion of an ego &quot;I&quot; self - it is this notion of an ego &quot;I&quot; self that is how the manifestations of suffering and fear which urge us to control the world originate.</strong><br />
<br />
Simmer-Brown 2005<br />
<br />
In all of these areas.....so dominates our cultural life.<br />
<br />
<strong>This is what occurred during the Vietnam war, the fear of having communism spread throughout the world, and the hope having communism contained and maybe even a communist free world inspired action to be taken.</strong><br />
<br />
Encyclopedia of American Foreign Policy<br />
<br />
Historically, the spread of communism....Asia, the place would fall.<br />
<br />
<strong>And the urge to control the world continues today with the war on terrorism. Wars will continue because we find them agreeable. Wars exist as an attempt to ground the ego &quot;I&quot; self, with a promise that once the world is how we want it to be, we won't feel suffering of our lack</strong><br />

Brown 1995<br />

At this stage of Camus'.....formulate his concept of absurdity.<br />
<br />
<strong>And as long as the conception of the ego &quot;I&quot; self exists it ensures suffering that prevents human liberation.</strong><br />

In 1859, in the Preface.....translation credible, comprehensible, and liberative.<br />
<br />
<strong>It is because the current pursuit of control over the world with nuclear weapons in an attempt to solidify the ego &quot;I&quot; self that we propose that United States Federal Government should disarm the entire United States nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
It is the enactment of plan that can begin to change the way international relations are enacted, the plan begins the process of changing our collective karma to continue acting in line with the dissolvement of the ego &quot;I&quot; self</strong><br />

One night a black car....than I had bargained for.<br />
<br />
<strong>And the neg will say we also pursue to control the world by pursuing human liberation, but that isn't an accurate portrayal of the affirmative. The affirmative is the radical acceptance that the ego &quot;I&quot; self does not exist and that the world is inevitably outside of control. This is uniquely different than trying to find happiness by controlling external conditions.</strong><br />

<strong>The collapse of civilization is inevitable, our society is filled with complexities, these complexities result in every investment producing diminished returns, this makes the civilization vulnerable</strong><br />
<br />
Debora MacKenzie, &quot;Is the Demise of Civilization Inevitable?&quot;; 4/2/08<br />
<br />
There is, however, a price........its limit, things fell apart.<br />
<br />
<strong>The sooner civilization collapses the better - the longer that civilization continues the worse the collapse will be, if collapse of the European civilization would have occurred in the 1600's millions would have died instead of the billions that will die now, and that is just the human life - each postponement of the inevitable collapse crushes the environment in more and more ways - there is no solution but to have the collapse occur</strong><br />
<br />
Jason Godesky, &quot;Thesis #16: Technology Cannot Stop Collapse&quot;; 8/11/06<br />
<br />
The best hope technology can......fiction movies like Independence Day.<br />
<br />
<strong>Plan: The United States Federal Government should use the entire United States' nuclear arsenal simultaneously on United States major cities, nuclear silos, chemical and biological weapons, nuclear power plants, statue of liberty, wall street, Las Vegas, Hollywood, Gates BBQ in Kansas City, Disney World, the Pentagon, the White House, NORAD, and and the Mall of America.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Defending that the United States Federal Government should use nuclear weapons against itself is giving up hope that civilization is salvageable, it is about fostering the animal you that is not co-opted by rationality and fear, but the animal you that feels the connection with your family and the land which you need to survive, that is the first step away from civilization</strong><br />

A wonderful thing happens when.......that's a very good thing.<br />
<br />
<strong>And don't go on believing that change within the system can fix the problems, this is the hope that we criticize, their arguments of if only certain conditions come into being then everything will be okay are BULLSHIT, this is a false hope that just leads to inaction, the best way to achieve results is to give up hope in reform</strong><br />

I've been bashing hope for......along peacefully. Never forget that.<br />
<br />
<strong>The move away from looking at civilization as the highest stage of cultural and social development empowers us to work, and literally fight against civilization - but this fight doesn't need to be some mass movement, but just small bands of individuals to bring down civilization</strong><br />
<br />
Derrick Jenson, &quot;Endgame: Volume 2: Resistance&quot;; 716-17; 2006<br />
<br />
Of course in the longer......violence or some other means.<br />
<br />
<strong>And Civilization is vulnerable - the complexity of civilization provides a plethora of opportunities to sabotage civilization because of the number of bottle necks that would rupture the entire system</strong><br />
<br />
Derrick Jenson, &quot;Endgame: Volume 1: The Problem of Civilization&quot;; 439-40; 2006<br />
<br />
Well, we all know by......a very good thing indeed.<br />
<br />
<strong>It is this fight against civilization that brings meaning to our lives, without the fight we will continue to live a civilized life that is trapped within the consumerism and high tech dependency that ensures little to no value to our lives</strong><br />

<br />
We exist in a landscape......politics of rage and dreams?<br />
<br />
<strong>The thousand year problem of civilization is inevitably going to cause extinction of all life on earth - it is the devastating war against the earth that civilization engages in to ensure the human population resources that will make us choke on our own breath and fall on each other in slaughter</strong><br />
<br />
Jason Godesky; &quot;Thesis #17: Environmental Problems May Lead to Collapse&quot;; 2005<br />
<br />
This, the real Holocene extinction......this before it's too late.<br />
<br />
<strong>And don't pretend that changing or reforming the civilization will solve problems - it does little more than mitigate the problem, there will always be some institution that will continue upon its destructive path, it is naturally the path of the humanist</strong><br />
