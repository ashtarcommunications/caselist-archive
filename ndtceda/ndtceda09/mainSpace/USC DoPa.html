<br />
Russia condition CP<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer to eliminate its land-based intercontinental ballistic missile nuclear warheads if Russia agrees to a reciprocal comprehensive transparency regime to confirm the dismantlement of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Observation 1 – Solvency<br />
<br />
A. They way we eliminate warheads matters- Russia would agree to reciprocal verification of dismantlement and the framework is already set<br />

Jobs Bill 1NC<br />
<br />
Unique internal link Jobs bill will pass now but Obama’s focus and leadership will be key<br />

Jobs bill key to economic recovery and avoiding a new recession<br />
Creamer 12-8 (Robert, has been a political organizer and strategist for almost four decades. He and his firm, the Strategic Consulting Group, work with many of the country’s most significant issue campaigns. He was one of the major architects and organizers of the successful campaign to defeat the privatization of Social Security&quot;, “America Needs a Jobs Bill, and the Federal Deficit Shouldn't Stand in the Way”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/america-needs-a-jobs-bill_b_384056.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/america-needs-a-jobs-bill_b_384056.html</a>)<br />

Jobs bill will be the vital internal link to democratic turn out<br />
Silver 12-4 (Nate, badass and editor of 538, “Improving Unemployment Numbers Make Political Case for Jobs Bill Stronger, Not Weaker”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/12/improving-unemployment-numbers-makes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/12/improving-unemployment-numbers-makes.html</a>)<br />
Meanwhile, it would help to get the Democratic base excited. If the base is weighing, say, health care reform without a public option, a decent financial regulation package, and the various stimulus efforts passed by the Congress this spring on the one hand, versus Afghanistan, Bernanke/Geithner, and inaction in areas like gay rights and climate change on the other, it could very easily be the presence or absence of a jobs bill that tips the balance in terms of enthusiasm<br />

Turnouts the vital internal link in key districts only way to maintain big democratic majorities<br />
