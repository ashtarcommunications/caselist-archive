<br />
ADVANTAGE 2 MISCALCULATION<br />
Top US officials have less than 30 seconds to decide whether the White House should be informed of a potential attack – this increases the risk of miscalculation where we retaliate against a perceived threat that does not actually exist<br />
<u>Blair, ‘4</u> (Bruce, “Aren’t Hair-Trigger Nuclear Missiles a Target for Terrorists?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=007" rel="nofollow">http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=007</a>)<br />
This anachronistic nuclear thinking has perpetuated ...real threat of unintentional Russian attack.<br />
<br />
Limited human cognition makes it psychologically impossible for leaders to act rationally – the rigged game of policy-making ensures offensive action by the White House<br />
<u>Blair, ‘4</u> (Bruce-Professor of Security Studies at Yale University, February 16, “Keeping Presidents in the Nuclear Dark” Center for Defense Information, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/blair/launch%E2%80%90on%E2%80%90warning.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/blair/launch%E2%80%90on%E2%80%90warning.cfm</a>)<br />
Given the awesome responsibility and authority ...in order to alleviate this danger.<br />
<br />
Policy-makers have limited cognitive capability for decision-making under stress – the short timeframe mandated by hair-trigger alert posture renders it impossible for humans to make rationally calculated decisions about their use – makes miscalculated launch more likely<br />
<u>Cullberg-Weston</u>, Vice President of Swedish Psychologists Against Nuclear War, <u>’93</u> (Marta, “Why We Cannot Rely on Decision-Makers in Times of Crisis” published in ‘Inadvertent Nuclear War: The Implications of the Changing Global Order’ by Hakan Wiberg, Ib Damgaard Petersen, and Paul Smoker, p 117-132)<br />
2.1 Cognitive aspects of ...as well in any accidental crisis.<br />
<br />
The stress and time pressure in nuclear decision-making is what makes conflict escalation most likely<br />

International Crises Getting Out of Control...may easily spread into other regions*^.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE 3 OFFENSIVE MOBILIZATION POSTURE<br />
World War one was not an intentional war – all sides mobilized for war in the belief that if they were not the first army ready on the battlefield that they were going to be the losing side – the problem with the hair-trigger alert during WWI was that when one side began the mobilization race it required the other side to reciprocate – increasing the risk of accidental conflict when mobilization began and could not be halted<br />
<u>Kahn</u>, Founder of the Hudson Institute, <u>’69</u> (Herman, “On Thermonuclear War” p 358-375)<br />
As Taylor says, World War ...prove to be really like that.<br />
<br />
The current preemptive posture of our nuclear arsenal parallels that of 1914 – making the risk of accidents and crisis decision-making more likely<br />
<u>Lebow, Government Professor at Dartmouth, ’87</u> (Richard, “Nuclear Crisis Management: A Dangerous Illusion” p 60)<br />
There is a second disturbing parallel ...expect from a superpower nuclear war.<br />
<br />
These offense postures risk war<br />
<u>Quester, Government Professor at U of Maryland, ‘2</u> (George, “Offense and Defense in the International System” p 9-12)<br />
Since the defenses of the nation ...more practicable than in the past.<br />
<br />
Public discussion of the time factor in nuclear launch is key to change policy-makers<br />
<u>Shiels</u>, Professor of Government at Mercy College, <u>’93</u> (Frederick, “Preventing the Ultimate Disaster: Misperception at the Top” published in ‘Inadvertent Nuclear War: The Implications of the Changing Global Order’ by Hakan Wiberg, Ib Damgaard Petersen, and Paul Smoker, p 133-148)<br />

<br />
SCENARIO 2 – MISCALCULATED LAUNCH<br />
<br />
Top US officials have less than 30 seconds to decide whether the White House should be informed of a potential attack – this increases the risk of miscalculation where we retaliate against a perceived threat that does not actually exist<br />
<u>Blair, ‘4</u> (Bruce, “Aren’t Hair-Trigger Nuclear Missiles a Target for Terrorists?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=007" rel="nofollow">http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=007</a>)<br />

SCENARIO 3 – UNAUTHORIZED LAUNCH<br />
<br />
High alert weapons cause highest risk of terrorism<br />
<u>Blair, ‘3</u> (Bruce- President of the World Security Institute and Professor of Security Studies at Yale University, April 29, “Hair-Trigger Missiles Risk Catastrophic Terrorism” Center for Defense Information, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/blair/hair-trigger-dangers.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/blair/hair-trigger-dangers.cfm</a>)<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE 2 - RUSSIA<br />
<br />
Likelihood of Russia misperceiving a US nuclear launch guarantees escalation – only scenario for Russia to attack the United States is a miscalculation about US actions<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE 3 – CRISIS ESCALATION<br />
<br />
Land-based ICBMs cause crisis instability – highest risk of accidental launch and lack of survivability ensures high alert posture used to escalate a conflict<br />
<u>Brooks, Vice President of the Center for Naval Analysis, ‘1</u> (Linton-Commanding Officer of USS Whale and START I Negotiator, Spring, “Arms Control and the Future Sub Force” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_11/future_subforce.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.navy.mil/navydata/cno/n87/usw/issue_11/future_subforce.html</a>)<br />

Policy-makers have limited cognitive capability for decision-making under stress – the short timeframe mandated by hair-trigger alert posture renders it impossible for humans to make rationally calculated decisions about their use – makes accidental launch more likely<br />

World War one was not an intentional war- all sides mobilized for war in the belief that if they were not the first army ready on the battlefield that they were going to be the losing side- the problem with the hair-trigger alert during the WWI was that when one side began the mobilization race it required the other side to reciprocate – increasing the risk of accidental conflict when mobilization began and could not be halted<br />
