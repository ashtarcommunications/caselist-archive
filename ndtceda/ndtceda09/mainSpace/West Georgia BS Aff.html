 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">President Obama will execute disarmament of the U.S. nuclear arsenal</span><br />
<h3 id="toc4"><a name="x-West Georgia BS Aff-1ac w/ cites"></a><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong><em>1ac w/ cites</em></strong></span></h3>
 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We begin with two seemingly unrelated news stories…</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">First, President Obama has brought the U.S. to the brink of nuclear disarmament</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Edith Lederer 9</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“With President Barack Obama presiding over a historic…and assist all nations in achieving the goal.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Second, Obama’s fluid identity is interpreted in radically conflicting ways pointing to very very different outcomes</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Camille Nelson 9</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Thus, despite Obama’s skillful negotiation of his identity…unknowable other – incomprehensible, alien, foreign.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But things aren’t always what they seem…a more in-depth understanding of American history begins to reveal the connections</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Peter Knight 2002</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“As a British American studies scholar working on the culture…makes the culture of conspiracy theory more prominent.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Advantage 1: Kill Whitey</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Obama’s the biological son and ideological heir of Malcolm X – set to bring about new world order</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Koret 10</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“In august I received a curious email. As a magazine…Red states may soon take on a whole new meaning.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Obama’s nuclear policy reveals his Islamic Agenda</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Gaffney 10</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“The Obama Administration’s determined effort to reduce…Shariah by President Obama and his team.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The plan is thus a form of treason </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Noel Ignatiev 93</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“The white race is a historically constructed social…treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Obama’s disarm plan hastens the end of white supremacy and the dawn of the chocolate race</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">L. Kelly 09</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“After the G20 summit here in London, on 1 April…against the White civilian by ‘their’ ‘leadership’.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That means less genocidal possibilities</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Dylan Rodriguez 7</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“For the theoretical purposes of this essay…common sense that is organic to its ordering.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Advantage 2: Global heg</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The plan is central to a much larger plot</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">May Wells 09</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Was Barack Obama groomed by Soviet and Russian communists to…its own independent armed forces.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Only in the times of the Anti-Christ could this be possible</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mel Sanger 09</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“A new world order has been in the making for quite…a repeat of the credit crunch crisis.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And Obama’s racial and national hybridity is the key twist</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Mel Sanger 09</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“…Obama will be packaged as the Global Candidate to whom…and steps closer to world government.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even a worst-case scenario is better than the status quo</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Kai Nielsen 88</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Here I first want to bite the bullet and accept …the world government I have described.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“ </span><br />

West Georgia BS—Aff Round 1 v. USC HL<br />
<u>Decision—3-0 AFF</u><br />
<br />
<u>1AC—Nuclear Preemption</u><br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-weight: normal;">Advocacy statement: </span></u><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
Contention one: Preemption<br />
</span><br />
There should be no missions or roles of the United States federal government’s Nuclear Arsenal that use the standard of objective uncertainty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<u><span style="font-weight: normal;">Same as wiki—with addition of the following cards, on contention 3</span></u>:<br />
<br />
Bracketing out our methodological approach is soaked in conservative ideology—their implicit value commitment always favor the established order<br />
Meszaros 89 [The power of ideology, p 232-234<br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Nowhere is the myth of ideological neutrality…no social theory or philosophy can escape<br />
</span><br />
Deterrence theory is incoherent and cannot account for human error<br />
Payne 3 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Keith, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unm.edu/~gleasong/300/su2006/keith_payne_fallacies.pdf" rel="nofollow">**http://www.unm.edu/~gleasong/300/su2006/keith_payne_fallacies.pdf**</a></span><br />
The assumption of the Cold War deterrence framework, that deterrence will “work”…astrology, dreams, or an inner “voice.”<br />
<br />
Don’t buy any of the neg’s risk analysis good shwangle—debate isn’t interested in accuracy, and shouldn’t be read as forecasting, debate is interested in imagining as many possible futures are one can speculate<br />
De Goede 8 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Marieke, “Beyond Risk: Premediation and the post-9/11 Security Imagination”<br />
Premediation is a promising term to denote the discursive…<em>We can only speculate’</em><br />
<br />
</span><br />
2AC—AT: Weaponitis:<br />
<br />
Aff solves—must engage in analysis of both material and ideological basis of war system.<br />
Burke 94 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Colleen, “Women &amp; Militarism”]<br />
Militarism as a process has both material and ideological manifestations…and strict division of proper masculine and feminine roles<br />
</span><br />
Alt can’t solve—doesn’t engage in a feminist analysis of militarism<br />
Burke 94 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Colleen, Women &amp; Militarism] </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">The military ideology affects all facets of society…to roll back that militarism</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.”<br />
</span><br />
Fundamental systemic challenge to militarism cannot be separated from specific proposals to reduce nuclear reliance<br />
Weston 85 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Burns H., Univ. of Cincinnati Law Review, 54 U. Cin. L. Rev. 451] </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">Thus, in answer to the question that is the title of this essay,…somewhere near the obituary column</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.<br />
</span><br />
2AC—AT: “Selfish Ptx”<br />
<br />
The maxim “the personal is the political” is not an assertion of solipsism, but about risking who wea are to become someone else, or think differently. This requires abandoning a “rhetoric of certainty” which claims to accurately predict consequences, asses, motives, etc. Certainty means there is no need, and also no time, for this kind of self questioning<br />
<br />
Diedrich 8 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Lisa, Feminist time against nation time: gender, politics, and the nation state in an age of permanent war] </span><br />
Roy’s proposal that we should take nuclear weapons personally…not by people within the Bush Administration or even outside it.<br />
<br />
You should endorse a politics of slowing things down—their insistence on acting now, urgency, and quick time frames creates the “tyranny of emergency”. Preventing war requires a radical alternative to temporality<br />
Diedrich 8 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Lisa, Feminist time against nation time: gender, politics, and the nation state in an age of permanent war] </span><br />
<br />
Roy describes her vision of a new politics as a politics of opposition…one of her speeches, “Seize the time.”<br />
<br />
2AC—AT: Topicality<br />
<br />
Iraq has destroyed US ability to assert conventional power—a nuclear preemption doctrine exists to offset our conventional weakness, enabiling the US to project imperial dominance<br />
Schell 5 <span style="font-weight: normal;">[Jonathan, “A Revolution in American Nuclear Policy”]<br />
A metaphorical “nuclear option”—the cutoff debate in the Senate on judicial nominees…offer an all too tempting alternative<br />
</span><br />
Role of nuclear weapons…provide for conventional superiority and assist in winning wars…lots of wars…continually wars…and global disorder…and wars…<br />
Gerson 7<span style="font-weight: normal;">[Joseph, “Empire and Nuclear Weapons”<br />
<br />
Over the past six decades, the United States has used its nuclear…rules of the U.S. dominated global (dis)order<br />
</span><br />
Global strike broadens the role and creates new missions for nuclear weapons<br />
Moses 6 <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-weight: normal;">[Greg, “Do you feel safe with this man’s finger on the button?”, March 17, counterpunch</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">As our ears prick to the drumbeat…in this series is scheduled for April.<br />
<br />
Global strike broadens the role of nuclear weapons to include preemptive counter-proliferation strikes<br />
Global Research Nuclear Infomration Project 6 [“Nuclear war plan: the nuclear option in global strike” </span><br />
