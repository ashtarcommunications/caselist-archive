Despite these proposals, given the fact that Chinese authors continue to emphasize the “defensive” (fangyu xing) nature of China’s nuclear policy, derived from being “forced into developing its own limited nuclear force” (beipo fazhanle ziji youxian de heliliang) and directed toward serving as a “strategic nuclear counterattack combat capability” (zhanlue hefanji de shizhan nengli),51 China is unlikely to relinquish its sense of moral rectitude and pragmatic necessity in maintaining its nuclear forces. China’s active involvement in the nonproliferation regime is ongoing, but so is the sense among its leadership, analysts, and populace of having been victimized in the process. There is also suspicion that U.S. efforts toward disarmament constitute thinly veiled attempts to solidify its military superiority. For countries like China, nuclear weapons have been one of the few means (if not the only means) to balance overwhelming U.S. conventional military power.<br />

Military modernization is essential to CCP credibility on internal stability and separatism issues.<br />

China’s military forces crossed a watershed when the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) celebrated its 60th birthday by holding a parade of state-of-the-art hardware such as indigenously developed nuclear submarines. That the 2.4-million strong People's Liberation Army (PLA) has attained quasi-superpower status was also supported by the fact that defense delegations from 29 countries attended the festivities in the port city of Qingdao (Guardian, April 22; Time [Asia edition], April 21). Paving the way for preparations for an even bigger event on October 1—an unprecedented large-scale military show at Tiananmen Square to mark the 60th birthday of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Two factors underpin the PLA’s ostensible salience in China’s political life. Demonstrating military might is an essential component to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership’s recent decision to aggressively project hard power worldwide. With the 20th anniversary of the June 4, 1989 crackdown moving closer, the Hu Jintao administration is playing up the fact that the PLA, as well as it sister unit, the People’s Armed Police (PAP), is ready to deal a frontal blow to dissidents, separatists and other “destabilizing elements.” <br />

Collapse of the CCP control triggers a nuclear civil war and regional conflicts<br />

The fourth factor contributing to the perception of a China threat is the fear of political and economic collapse in the PRC, resulting in territorial fragmentation, civil war and waves of refugees pouring into neighbouring countries. Naturally, any or all of these scenarios would have a profoundly negative impact on regional stability. Today the Chinese leadership faces a raft of internal problems, including the increasing political demands of its citizens, a growing population, a shortage of natural resources and a deterioration in the natural environment caused by rapid industrialisation and pollution. These problems are putting a strain on the central government's ability to govern effectively. Political disintegration or a Chinese civil war might result in millions of Chinese refugees seeking asylum in neighbouring countries. Such an unprecedented exodus of refugees from a collapsed PRC would no doubt put a severe strain on the limited resources of China's neighbours. A fragmented China could also result in another nightmare scenario - nuclear weapons falling into the hands of irresponsible local provincial leaders or warlords.'2 From this perspective, a disintegrating China would also pose a threat to its neighbours and the world.<br />

China’s expert community clearly views the source of instability in the strategic nuclear relationship as U.S. military policymaking. On one level, Chinese strategists remain deeply uncomfortable with U.S. military predominance in global affairs and the perceived U.S. penchant to use military force to coerce other states to advance U.S. objectives. Many in China fear that U.S. military power, in the future, could be directed at coercing China. On a second level, on nuclear affairs the Chinese concern is that the United States seeks to develop the strategic military tool-kit, as envisioned in the 2001 NPR, with the hope of escaping relationships of mutual vulnerability with other nuclear powers, including especially China, so that it can be free to exercise military power at will. The concepts and policies in the NPR, many Chinese argue, undermine U.S.-China strategic stability because they lower the threshold for using nuclear weapons and countenance the use of nuclear weapons in a conflict over Taiwan. Most specifically, the Chinese are concerned about U.S. missile defense, ISR, and long-range conventional strike capabilities – all of which undermine their ability to possess a secure second-strike capability. These factors are having a significant impact on the “objective circumstances” for which China’s leaders must account in developing the PLA. China’s expert community argues further that China’s responses to these U.S. policies are consistent with the traditions of China’s nuclear policy and with the requirements of strategic stability. They see mutual vulnerability as stabilizing, by dampening U.S. temptations to do something rash (or to incite others, as for example Taiwanese leaders, to do something rash). They defend the modernization of China’s strategic forces as the minimum necessary to maintain a credible retaliatory capability. They reject the possibility of any arms race and deny a desire to seek nuclear parity with the United States, under any circumstances. China’s force is designed to “absorb the first blow” and counter-attack, and this requires far fewer numbers than a force designed for preemption or sustained nuclear war-fighting. To promote greater strategic stability, the Chinese urge the U.S. to adopt a no-first-use posture or agree to a bilateral no-first-use accord with China and refrain from identifying China as a target country of U.S. nuclear weapons in the 2009 NPR. <br />

The Link: their depiction of China as a threat is a discursive construct that doesn’t reflect objective reality. <br />
Chengxin Pan, Department of Political Science and International Relations, Faculty of Arts, at Deakin University, August 2004, Discourses Of ‘China’ In International Relations: A Study in Western Theory as (IR) Practice, p. 141-142<br />
These are some of the questions in the minds of Western/American strategic analysts, who are wondering how to maintain U.S. preponderance in a world of anarchy and uncertainty. The conservative realist Samuel Huntington asks: “If being an American means being committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, individualism, and private property, and if there is no evil empire out there threatening those principles, what indeed does it mean to be an American, and what becomes of American national interests?”46 Obsessed with this self-imagery, many scholars and policy planners have been keen to reinvoke the timeless, structural certainty of geopolitical rivalry, and to embrace the ‘back to the future’ scenario, maintaining that despite the dawn of the post-Cold War period little has changed—the world remains a dangerous, volatile place.47 With such searching eyes for an enemy, it would be surprising if China failed to come into view. Indeed, China makes a perfect candidate, in that “China remains the major source of uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific.”48 That is, not only do the implications of its economic transformation and military ambition remain unclear, but the resilience of the Communist government even after its roundly condemned Tiananmen suppression seems also to fly in the face of the ‘End of History’ triumphalism. Consequently, (and before September 11), the only major certainty coming out of the post-Cold War era seems to be an unpredictable and dangerous China. From the beginning, this ‘China threat,’ I suggest, is not a result of its actual challenge to the West or the United States per se, but primarily a discursive dimension of the neorealist construction of the American self in terms of global supremacy and indispensable leadership. As Huntington makes it clear, “Chinese hegemony will reduce American and Western influence [in Asia] and compel the United States to accept what it has historically attempted to prevent: domination of a key region of the world by another power.”49 In the absence of such self-fashioning, most of China’s neighbours, which might arguably be more vulnerable to a China threat if there is one, have traditionally adopted a much less alarmist view on the ‘Middle Kingdom.’50 Thus, China’s real challenge for America, as Yu Bin notes, “is perhaps more psychological and conceptual—that is, how to deal with a major power whose rise is not necessarily guided by Washington, unlike the post-World War II rise of Japan and Germany.”51 Also, it can be argued that the existence of an ‘enemy’ is indispensable to the continued imagination of the ‘indispensable nation.’ In Charles Frazier’s novel Cold Mountain, Inman, a soldier returning home from battle during the American Civil War, pondered the question: “What is the cost of not having an enemy?”52 Such a cost, then, seems very high indeed, for at stake here is what is seen as the ‘fundamental’ modern Western/American self-identity as a (global) rational being and indispensable leader. Heroic leadership would not be so needed if there was little left to fight for. Clearly mindful of this, Georgi Arbatov, Director of Moscow’s Institute for the Study of the USA and Canada, told a U.S. audience the year before the collapse of the Berlin Wall: “We are going to do something terrible to you—we are going to deprive you of an enemy.”53 While he correctly noted that for the U.S. to live without an identity-defining enemy is terrible indeed, Arbatov was only half right, for the ‘enemy’ itself often has no control over its status as an enemy. Rather, as noted before, it is primarily a ready-made discursive category built into the American self-imagination. With this discursive category as the analytical framework for understanding other actors on the world stage, Western and particularly American scholars did not simply ‘discover’ a China threat out there; it was cognitively constructed beforehand. <br />

B) The Impact: makes war inevitable <br />
Chengxin Pan, Department of Political Science and International Relations, Faculty of Arts, at Deakin University, August 2004, Discourses Of ‘China’ In International Relations: A Study in Western Theory as (IR) Practice, p. 43-44<br />
Like the liberal construction of Other touched on above, this largely realist framing of Other carries with it some profound implications in practice. That is, when the Other is depicted as a fixed geopolitical threat, waging a war (or at least preparing for war) to destroy it often becomes the only rational option to fulfilling the universal self. In this regard, Robert Young notes that “war constitutes the [Western] philosophical concept of being itself. For being is always defined as the appropriation of either difference into identity, or of identities into a greater order…. War, then, is another form of the appropriation of the other….”33 In this context, not surprisingly, war has figured prominently in U.S. foreign relations: War is always violent, bloody, and destructive. But American wars are fought for great and good ends, and they result in good for America. The Revolution created freedom, independence, and democracy. The Civil War resulted in the expansion of freedom, the destruction of slavery, the growth of industrial might and wealth, and the formation of a unified, powerful nation.34 Insofar as both liberal and realist framings of Other are derived from the same particular American self-construction, their different approaches to understanding global politics in general and China in particular are basically mutually complementary, rather than mutually exclusive. Recently, this relationship of mutual complement is particularly striking in the emergence of a ‘two worlds’ theory, and its various incarnations such as the new imperialism, liberal imperialism, the New Wilsonianism, and neo-conservatism.35 As neoconservative commentators William Kristol and Robert Kagan put it, both ‘moral clarity’ and ‘military strength’ are essential if Americans are to continue to be proud of their leading role in world affairs.36<br />

<strong><u>China Case Args</u></strong><br />
FOUR ALT CAUSES FOR CHINESE MODERNIZATION AND TENSIONS AFF CAN’T SOLVE – symbolic declaration of china as greatest potential military competitor, pacific base modernization, additional pacific battle groups and conventional trident submarines, security cooperation w/ japan and india<br />
CONETTA, YOUR AUTHOR 2006<br />
According to the 2006 review, one of the key priorities of U.S. defense policy is “shaping the choices of countries at strategic crossroads” by means of dissuasion. In this regard, the QDR breaks new ground by marking China as the nation with the “greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States.” What is important here is not the statement of fact, which is obvious, but the official declaration of concern, which is portentous. More important, the review clearly links its concern about China with a need to develop “forces capable of sustained operations at great distances into denied areas.”16<br />
China also figures centrally—and explicitly—in U.S. plans to reposition its forces globally. Currently underway is a multi-billion dollar effort to improve U.S. military headquarters and bases in the Pacific. This includes preparing Guam to receive B-1 and B-2 bombers. The navy will assign to the area an additional aircraft carrier battle group and several additional submarines, including the Trident submarines converted to carry cruise missiles. On the diplomatic front, the United States has concluded new security cooperation and military assistance agreements with both Japan and India that focus on China as a central concern. Japan, with U.S. encouragement, is developing its security ties with Taiwan—for the first time citing China-Taiwan tensions as a matter of Japanese national security interest. Commensurate with these developments, the U.S. armed forces are increasing the scale, extent, and frequency of their military exercises overall and with other nations.<br />

MISSILE DEFENSE + SPACE WEAPONIZATION<br />

<br />
As discussed above, prevailing Chinese nuclear threat perceptions revolve around at least four issues: the 2001 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review and its inclusion of China as one of the seven target countries; U.S. missile defenses, in particular as they are deployed in the East Asian region; space weaponization; and the U.S. ability to use precisionguided conventional weapons to attack Chinese nuclear infrastructure. These developments undermine U.S.-China strategic stability by eroding the credibility of China’s nuclear deterrence.50 Given China’s small nuclear arsenal and the weaknesses of its current intercontinental ballistic missile inventory, which is very old (deployment of modern weapons is only beginning), U.S. missile defenses in East Asia could threaten to neutralize Chinese nuclear deterrence capabilities. Washington’s declared policy to maintain space dominance and the danger of weaponization of outer space further erode Chinese confi dence. And finally, China’s NFU policy would be seriously challenged if potential adversaries could use precision-guided munitions to attack its nuclear facilities and nuclear forces. <br />

DON’T STOP NUCLEAR UPGRADES OR MODERNIZATION - <br />
<br />
(<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>) China won’t lashout – perception of its interests <br />
David Hale, Chicago-based economist and founding chairman of Hale Advisors and China Online, March 1, 2006, The Australian<br />
There is a natural suspicion in Washington about the geo-political and military consequences of China's new status as an economic power. Many fear China will use its new wealth to develop sophisticated weapons and challenge the US's traditional military dominance in the region. Some Pentagon analysts estimate that China's defence spending could be two or three times as large as the official estimate of $22 billion. There is concern that if China continues to spend about 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product on defence, its defence budget could rise to as much as $130 billion in 10 years or become the second largest in the world after the US.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>But the fact remains that China has become so engaged in the global economy that it now has a diminishing capacity for radical foreign policy action. China has the world's third largest stock of foreign direct investment. China's ratio of exports to GDP is three times higher than the US, Europe, or Japan. China could be the world's largest exporting nation within two or three years. As a result of these circumstances, China must be a good global citizen because it now depends upon other countries to absorb nearly half of its manufacturing output.<br />

NO IMPACT TO CHINESE MODERNIZATION – ALL SIGNS POINT TO STRICTLY DEFENSIVE DEVELOPMENT. <br />

<br />
8. Modernization is China’s number one strategic priority, and thus the United States should expect China to pursue all aspects—political, military, and economic—to make this possible. This may entail multilateral, regional, or unilateral partnerships or agreements, perhaps with states that the United States does not recognize or condone, but from whom China requires resources and needed raw materials to sustain its economic development. For example, increased Chinese “influence” on the African continent has raised alarms with some in the United States, but America’s leaders should understand and appreciate the economic and domestic reasons for China’s involvement in Africa. Currently, 25 percent of China’s oil comes from the continent.74 China has trade relations with 49 African countries and bilateral trade agreements with the majority of them.75 While the U.S. position is that China’s relationship with states such as Angola, Sudan, and Zimbabwe have enabled these countries to ignore international pressure to isolate or reform them, it is understandable why China pursues its policies in the region so as to sustain its economic growth. The United States should deal with China with this basic understanding, yet continue to work with China on common ground beneficial to Africans and to further encourage China’s responsible international behavior. 9. With China’s history of invasion and intervention by foreign powers and resulting concerns for its territorial integrity and national defense, U.S. policymakers should not view modernization efforts with the PLA, Navy, and Air Force as a potential threat to U.S. security. When comparing China’s military spending as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP), China’s military spending is moderate and not out of the ordinary.76 China’s military modernization has been largely defensive in nature. China’s Navy, which receives much attention by the “China threat” adherents, currently has limited range and capabilities to act in offensive operations; has no aircraft carrier or meaningful force projection capability; and lacks the command, control, computer, and communications (C4I) necessary in modern warfare.77 It is also uncertain whether China can carry out large joint operations with its land and air forces.78 The modernization of China’s military is an attempt to fix some of these shortfalls and should be expected of any growing regional economic and political power. Nor do they pose an immediate threat to U.S. interests in the Pacific region as it remains defense-oriented, except for the case of Taiwan (see Recommendation 4). It is also worth noting that despite the fact that the United States has maintained extensive nuclear strike plans against Chinese targets for more than half a century, China has never responded by building large nuclear forces of its own and is unlikely to do so in the future.79<br />
(<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>) China won’t invade Taiwan because it would ruin their economic resurgence. <br />
Ivan Eland, Director of Defense Policy Studies at Cato Institute. “Is Chinese Military Modernization a Threat to the United States?” No. 465 January 23, 2003<br />
During the 1996 crisis in the Taiwan Strait, after the United States deployed two aircraft carriers near Taiwan, a Chinese official told Chas Freeman, a former U.S. diplomat, that the Chinese were prepared to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. West Coast if the United States intervened on behalf of Taiwan.37 Although coming to the defense of a fellow democracy against an authoritarian Chinese regime has emotional appeal, U.S. policymakers have to ask themselves whether they are willing to trade Los Angeles to save Taipei. The answer should be a resounding no. The United States should sell Taiwan the arms it needs for self-defense but should not guarantee its security. Besides, Taiwan’s security is not as hopeless without U.S. assistance as many analysts and press articles make it seem. Hostile behavior toward Taiwan could disturb China’s increasing economic linkage with the rest of the world—especially growing commercial links with Taiwan. Because China’s highest priority is economic growth, the disruption of such economic relationships is a disincentive for aggressive Chinese actions vis-à-vis Taiwan. Any attack short of invasion (using missiles or instituting a naval blockade) would likely harm the Taiwanese economy and disrupt Chinese trade and financial contacts with Taiwan and other developed nations without getting China what it most wants—control of Taiwan. An amphibious invasion—in the unlikely event that it succeeded—would provide such control but would cause even greater disruption in China’s commercial links to developed nations.<br />

Lack of diversification in US-China relations makes their doom inevitable.<br />
Wu Xinbo, professor at the Center for American Studies, Fudan University, in Shanghai. The Washington Quarterly 27.4 (2004) 115-126. “The Promise and Limitations of a Sino-U.S. Partnership.”<br />
As far as Sino-U.S. relations are concerned, the events of September 11 prompted the Bush administration to view China through a more rational lens and provided more ground for cooperation between the two countries. Even so, the United States' narrow focus on terrorism at the expense of other issues such as AIDS, poverty, and environmental degradation may strain Sino-U.S. cooperation. For China as well as for many other countries, although terrorism is a great threat to world peace and security, a more balanced agenda should be set, reflecting a wider range of concerns and serving the interests of more countries and peoples. Otherwise, cooperation on counterterrorism may not be sustainable.<br />

Nuclear policy is driven by the religious servitude to rationality and the bomb. We prescribe rationality meaningful purposes for the bomb and design rational ways of using the bomb in order to justify these tools of annihilation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>In truth, it is impossible to understand the Bomb without evaluating the religious and irrational desires for war.<br />
Chernus 85 [Ira Chernus is Associate Professor of Religion at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, LIII/ 3, “WAR AND MYTH: &quot;THE SHOW MUST GO ON&quot; Jstor <br />
The &quot;defense intellectuals&quot; who have forged America's nuclear weapons policy are often called the high priests of nuclear theology and with some justice. There is a foundation of faith buried beneath the intricate logic of their doctrines. Unlike other priesthoods, however, the &quot;defense intellectuals&quot; make logical reasoning not only the tool but the very content of their faith. Abstract, technical, mathematical reason is the god at whose throne they worship - though the Bomb seems to be seated at this god's right hand. The story of American nuclear policy is the story of their unbounded faith in the modern rational mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>These &quot;intellectuals&quot; direct their religious zeal to two related tasks. First, they must identify rationally meaningful purposes for nuclear weapons; these are pragmatic political and economic gains that the nation can reasonably hope to achieve with its nuclear arsenal. Second, they must design rational ways of using the weapons to attain these ends. The two tasks are dialectically related, for &quot;technically sweet&quot; means can dictate ends as often as ends determine means. The search for the perfectly rational combination of means and ends has been going on for nearly three decades now. Ever since the Kennedy administration, with its own faith in rationality, brought the &quot;defense intellectuals&quot; to Washington, they and their computerized creations have shaped American nuclear strategy (Kaplan).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Yet the history of that strategy speaks as loudly of the limits of rationality as it does of belief in rationality. From counterforce targeting to mutually assured destruction to flexible response to limited war and protracted war-fighting, each successive doctrine has been found wanting in some respect. While new doctrines have been developed, the old ones have lingered on. Current American nuclear strategy, as enshrined in SIOP-6 (the sixth revision of the Single Integrated Operating Plan for nuclear war), is a palimpsest in which new approaches have been laid over the old, with little apparent concern for the overall logic of the plan (Pringle and Arkin).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>For critics of the &quot;defense intellectuals,&quot; American nuclear doctrine is a quixotic quest for a logically impossible dream. The critics conclude that the &quot;defense intellectuals&quot; have actually proven the case for nuclear disarmament: No rational purpose has been found for the Bomb because no such purpose exists or can exist. There can be no rational means to attain a non-existent end. Inventing ends just to suit means is the height of suicidal perversity. Since there is no way to employ the Bomb rationally, the only logical course is to get rid of it. This line of argument is often taken further: Any nation engaged in war will inevitably use the most powerful weapons at its disposal. Therefore nuclear powers can never restrict themselves to nonnuclear conflict. Since nuclear weapons cannot be used to gain rational ends, nuclear powers can no longer fight wars. For them, war is obsolete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The very persuasiveness of this line of reasoning signifies a subtle victory for the &quot;defense intellectuals.&quot; While their conclusions are roundly rejected, their premise is accepted. Even the most vociferous critics implicitly affirm that war is necessarily a rational enterprise. They affirm that wars make sense, and will be fought, only when they promise some utilitarian gain. The critics see just two mutually exclusive alternatives-either war can be rationally motivated or else it is obsolete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>If we want to define the changes that nuclear weapons have wrought in our understanding of war, we must start by questioning this implicit assumption. Do wars, and preparations for war, begin only because nations see pragmatic gains to be had? Thomas Powers, who has done some of the most insightful thinking about past wars as well as the next war, thinks not. He suggests that the &quot;reasons&quot; for wars are post hoc inventions created by the victors to justify the slaughter. The winner decides what the war was about. In fact, Powers claims, nations go to war because they have the means to go to war. Yet nations must convince themselves that they act upon rational motives. This is more true than ever in the nuclear age, for if our infinitely destructive arsenals are not rational means to rational ends, the implications are simply too terrifying to contemplate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Powers may overstate his case a bit. Surely nations honestly hope for some pragmatic benefits whenever they go to war. But his analysis is valuable, for just as surely something other than rational purpose is fueling the nuclear arms race. Nuclear annihilation, which might occur any day now, could not possibly be initiated out of logical motivations. If we have arrived at this situation, there must be something fundamentally irrational about war. Yet Powers does not take us very far in understanding that &quot;something.&quot; &quot;It is our nature,&quot; he concludes, &quot;that makes us draw lines in the earth and grimace when anyone approaches in strange garb&quot; (1984: 55). Those of us who study human life, particularly in its religious dimensions, will understandably want to probe this matter more deeply.

ATTEMPTING TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR ARMS IS BASED ON A DESIRE FOR ONTOLOGICAL STASIS THAT RENDERS THE ENTIRE WORLD AS ALREADY DEAD. THE DRIVE FOR NUCLEAR STABILITY RITUALIZES OUR COMMITMENT TO THE BOMB AS GOD.<br />
CHERNUS, Professor of Religious Studies at UC Boulder, 1991<br />
Ira, Nuclear Madness: on Religion and Psychology in the Nuclear Age p74-76<br />
There is a nearly universal assumption that disarmament through the arms control negotiation process is the only viable way out of the nuclear trap. But this faith in arms control is faith in a process of mutual constriction. It looks forward to a day when the rational ego’s expertise will devise a set of agreements so perfectly balanced that each side will be eternally immobilized and prevented from moving against the other. The test of every prospective arms control treaty is its capacity to eliminate all risk. The disarmament movement’s most successful initiative of the eighties—the nuclear freeze—reflects the same desire to freeze reality as a way of defending ourselves. Images of political stasis, permanence, and rigidity also abound in eras of détente. If the situation can be eternally frozen, we hope, we and the whole world can be eternally safe. So the new-found friendship between the superpowers resembles the friendships developed by schizoids. They are mutually negotiated arrangements for interacting without the prerequisite of all genuine human interaction: The risk of mutual vulnerability. No new political or military initiative can gain popular support unless it is first proven to be virtually risk-free. All the emerging proposals for perfectly secure arms control treaties and negotiated settlements seem reasonable enough. In truth, though, all aim to defend us principally against the schizoid’s real enemy—the inevitable flux of reality itself, whose code name in our political discourse is “instability.” A society suffering acute ontological insecurity must see every change as a threat to its tenuous reality and therefore fear “instability” above all. No doubt the threat may be labeled differently at different times. In some eras it is “the Russians” or “the Communists”; in others it is the Bomb itself or the “terrorists” who could, with a bit of purloined plutonium and a suitcase, incinerate a city. But despite these changes our goal remains the same: “stability,” which is a political code word for the extreme of psychic numbing—a world too petrified even to contemplate change. Therefore, we increasingly pin our hopes for national security on the numbing power of the false self system and its apparently reasonable technological program. Just as we used to prize the “firmness” of a “rigid defense posture” above all, so we now prize “firmness” at the negotiating table as the only way to achieve the parity we must have at all costs. Since our goal is a stable balance that we believe will benefit the whole world, it seems perfectly reasonable, even benign, to cast ourselves as the immovable center from which the newly balanced world order proceeds, and as the rigidly vigilant center from which that balance that we believe will benefit the whole world, it seems perfectly reasonable, even benign, to cast ourselves as the immovable center from which the newly balanced world order proceeds, and as the rigidly vigilant center from which that balance is maintained—by threat of renewed force if necessary. Yet the “stability” we seek is actually the permanent petrifaction that the schizoid fears yet embraces, hoping to avoid death by becoming dead in life. If the world and the nations in it are already dead, it matters little whether a given nation be treated as enemy or friend. In either case, all danger is denied. So an enemy nation can become a friend (or vice versa) very easily, and sometimes surprisingly rapidly. Communist China was transformed from enemy to ally almost overnight by the Nixon administration. The Soviet Union was changed, more gradually but no less strikingly, from “evil empire” to dialogue partner during the Reagan administration. Such eras of détente, even more than eras of over enmity, validate Laing’s perception of the family of nations as a nexus, in which both sides cooperate in keeping the international false self system alive. As Laing notes: “The game’s the thing: not perhaps fundamentally even a matter of winning it, but of perpetuating it.” Détente means that the partners in the nexus openly admit their mutual desire to play the same game. In Laing’s analysis of the nexus, the partners continue to play the game largely because each hopes to get reality from the other. As the false self assumes more and more control, schizoids feel increasingly drained of reality, so they turn to others to try to get reality without incurring any risk. One way to do this is to let the other spy on oneself, as the superpowers do with their growing willingness for mutual inspection of military facilities and nuclear weapons tests. Indeed all the recent moves toward superpower cooperation may be seen as attempts to open oneself up to the other’s reality without risking one’s own. As in any nexus, though, the game still depends on mutual coercion masquerading as mutual concern. The transformation from enemy to ally is so easy because within the nexus one’s closest ally always remains one’s enemy. Therefore the pursuit of détente and disarmament need not mean a halt to weapons production. Most Americans believe that we must still keep up our guard, that new weapons can compel the enemy to negotiate arms reduction, that deterrence is necessary until the disarmament process is complete, and that some nuclear deterrence capability will thus be necessary for a very long time—perhaps forever. But deterrence and disarmament seem very compatible in the public mind because both reflect the same basic principle: that humanity can be saved by a technologically constructed and constricting static balance, using the Bomb itself to save us from its horrors. <br />

The Affirmative’s attempt to limit the destructive capabilities of the bomb only represses our irrational desires for death and killing that enables nuclear holocaust<br />
CHERNUS, Professor of Religious Studies at UC Boulder, 1991<br />
Ira, Nuclear Madness: on Religion and Psychology in the Nuclear Age, p 92-93<br />
Perhaps the greatest danger of the &quot;safe Bomb&quot; fantasy is that precisely because it represses our former fantasies of annihilation and omnipotence it insures their continued hold upon us. Hillman agrees with most depth psychologists that repressed thoughts, emotions, and images will inevitably return. But he stresses that, when repressed through literalism, they will return literally, in &quot;ungainly, obsessive, literalistic ways, affecting consciousness with precisely the qualities it strives to, exclude.&quot;&quot; This principle plays a central role in shap­ing our nuclear images. When we deny the call of irrational death for a place in our imaginal life, we find ourselves bedaz­zled by compelling obsessions with irrational death-and kill­ing-as physical realities. Always bent on domination, living in a world of constant challenge, and taking every conflict on the level of literal physical concreteness, we are inevitably fascinated by images of physical power, aggression, and destruction. Even when we pursue policies to control destructive technologies, we are held by nuclear images and technologies in an apparently mysterious grip. Even when political realities as well as rhetoric seem to dictate dissolving our nuclear arsenals, real progress toward that goal is agonizingly slow. Even when declaratory policy finds no reasonable use for the weapons, actual policy may plan to use them as traditional instruments of war. Hillman's theorizing helps to clear up the mystery: the shadow side, he contends, returns in its most ungainly literal form as the indispensable tool for virtuously repressing the shadow side. No matter how well intentioned our &quot;safe Bomb&quot; ideologies may be, these attempts to repress the shadow side are inevitably self-defeating because they actually preserve the shadow they hope to dispel. In light of declaratory policy, nuclear holocaust may occur only as an apparent accident, countering all the world's best intentions to avert it. Or, in light of the actual policy pursued in some military quarters, it may appear to be the most moral act of all, in a perverse conclusion to the heroic ego's perversely self-righteous morality. Regardless of declaratory or actual policies, however, holocaust remains a very real possibility because we have psychologically negated the Bomb's living actuality.<br />

THE AFFIRMATIVES DESCRIPTION OF NUCLEAR WAR POSITS THEM AS A SURVIVOR LOOKING DOWN ON A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD. WE SECRETLY DESIRE THIS WORLD TO EXPERIENCE THE INFINITE POSSIBILITY OF REBIRTH WHICH SOLIDIFIES OUR DEVOTION TO THE BOMB.<br />
CHERNUS. Professor of Religious Studies at UC Boulder, 1986<br />
Ira, Dr. Strangegod p. 86-87<br />
If this kind of mythological imagery was a common response to bombs dropped in the past, it is even more common in responding to bombs that might fall in the future. Perhaps this is inevitable. In order to think about a nuclear war at all, as we have seen, the mind is compelled to put itself in the role of survivor. It is compelled to assume that something must follow cataclysmic destruction, and so it finds itself willy-nilly in the age-old scenario of death and rebirth. Nuclear war easily comes to appear, especially in the unconscious fantasy, as the “big bang” that will wipe away the accumulated terrors of history and bring the birth of a pristine new world. The Bomb therefore comes to symbolize the endlessness of the chain of death-and-life, playing the role of destroyer and creator that was once reserved for a less technological deity. The inescapable lure of this mythic pattern is surely evident in the myriad fictional nuclear wars that have filled literature, television film, and comic books for forty years. In these science-fiction depictions, there is always at least a hint—often much more than a hint—that annihilation is acceptable, or even desirable, as the necessary prelude to new creation. The appeal of science fiction, like the appeal of myth, comes in part from the very act of experiencing the story. As reader or listener or viewer, one is taken out of the normal everyday world and projected into a “fabulous” time, in which the events are more powerful, more intense, more grandiose than any we have actually known. Thus the world of myth and science fiction is “surreal”—more real than real. Yet at the same time it is, in the modern view, unreal, as in our characteristic equation of “mythical” with “unreal.” But this, too, as we have seen, is a consolation and even an attraction when speaking of nuclear weapons; by casting them into an unreal setting we can make our own world with its precariousness and all-enveloping danger unreal as well. Thus mythicizing can make nuclear war more appealing, while the terrible danger of nuclear war makes the mythicizing of it more appealing as well. Just as we are ambivalent about the dangers of nuclear war, so are we ambivalent about the powers spoken of in myth. <br />

The similarities between the Bomb and other religious realities tells us part of what we need to know. But we must also ask how our new God differs from all previous gods, for only then can we see clearly how it affects us in unprecedented ways. One point, which has been implicit in our previous discussions, must now be brought out explicitly: this God is a machine, a technological device invented by human beings. Yet the machine, being infinitely more powerful than the humans who invented it, has become a Frankenstein’s Monster, independent of its creators and capable of turning violently upon them. And “them” is now, of course, all of us. We have the choice of either cooperating or resisting when the machine acts; because of many appealing symbolic qualities, we generally cooperate. We become partners in the machine’s action and thus, in a very real sense, parts of the machine. We are all soldiers in the front-line trenches, but the Bomb is our commander and we do its bidding. This is especially clear in the concept of MAD; the citizen of all superpowers become linked together in a single machine, which demands more and more sacrifices; the actions of one side must (according to this theory) necessarily evoke corresponding actions from the other side. The way in which we prepare for war reflects and foreshadows the way we shall wage war: “In a push-button war involving nuclear missiles, there will be no direct contact between adversaries. The techniques of war are fast becoming as impersonal and mechanized as pulling a lever to start a production chain belt. In such a setting, the best soldier is not the ‘hero’ but the ‘automaton.’” We voluntarily become automatons, mere parts of a machine, in part because of our age-old mythic dream of being heroes and our mythic desire to embody in ourselves the power inherent in the divine machine. What Moss says of the Strategic Air Command bomber pilot may be true for all of us: “He is equally remote from the human will that makes a decision on using or not using the bomb, and the human suffering that its use would cause. He sees himself as a part of a complex instrument, an agent between someone else’s will and its effect, a living button. His pride is to function in this role perfectly. He has a sense of importance.” Ultimately, though, in our symbolic perception, it may very well be the bomb itself whose will we obey, for how can any human will dare to interfere with that of the divine? Even the greatest nation al leaders are merely parts of the machine. And, as we have seen, our importance becomes not merely social or political, but in fact sacred and cosmic in scope. At the same time, psychic numbing reinforces the pattern effected by symbolic meaning. For if we are in fact “dead in life,” already suffused with the death taint of the Bomb, then it is that much easier to see ourselves as machines and to take pride in being perfectly functioning machines. Of course, this sense of the mechanization of human life was hardly created by the nuclear age. Here, as in so many other instances, the Bomb is both a reflection and a shaper of our relationship with reality. But the elevation of a machine to a central place in our symbolic world—the deification of a machine—surely makes it much more likely that we shall see ourselves as automatons. Moreover, the technologically induced problem offers itself as a solution. As this machine God intensifies our psychic numbing, we seek to escape that numbing by finding meaning in a symbolic form of immortality that is itself technological, as Lifton suggests: “Everyone in this age participates in a sense of immorality derived from the interlocking human projects we call science and technology.” Thus, as technology absorbs those provinces of life that were previously considered spiritual, it may be fair to say that technology has become the soul of the body of humanity. Yet we cannot be totally content with being machines. In fact as we saw previously, the existentialist movement may be said to have started with Dostoevski’s revolt against being a mere piano key, a part of a machine. The sense of dehumanization and the sheer boredom—the flatness of life—which afflicts automatons can be challenged only in situations of great intensity. Russian roulette may easily become, as in the film The Deer Hunter, a primary symbol for the modern world’s escape from the dehumanization of a technological God. The intensity of risk is combined with the joy of being <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>entertained in a theater of life-and-death. But for the ultimate “kick,” the stakes must be ultimately high. Thus the machine deity leads us to give ourselves over to it in a game of global Russian roulette in which we all hold the pistol. And apparently we do so willingly. Machines must inevitably see all the world as a machine: “The more a man [sic] acts on the basis of a self-image that assumes he [sic] is powerless, an impotent cog in a huge machine, the more likely he [sic] is to drift into a pattern of dehumanized thinking and action towards others.” “We have become masters of the impersonal and the inanimate. Our energy and even our emotions have gone into things; the things serve us but come between us, changing the relationship of man to man. And the thing takes on an authority that men accept without protest. The impersonality is epidemic. It is almost as though we feared direct contact, almost as though the soul of man has become septic.” Thus we find our identity not by relating to other individuals as individuals, but by seeing ourselves merely as a part of “the crowd” or “the nation,” whose emblem and savior is the Bomb, the ultimate machine. We lose the subtleties and nuances of human complexity and see the world in absolutes, “us versus them.” We view human relationships in terms of the mythic, apocalyptic vision, a vision whose ultimate promise is the annihilation of “their” machine and unlimited license for “our” machine to do whatever it wants. In fact, the ultimate goal of machine people is always to have total dominance, unlimited autonomy to manipulate the environment—both human and natural—in endless technological ways. Thus the machine God also shapes our relationship with our physical and material environment, leading us to the environmental crisis that we now face. Again, the fouling of the air, water and land was hardly begun in the nuclear age, but the symbolism of the Bomb makes it much more difficult to escape from this predicament too. Behind our callousness toward the natural realm there is not only a desire for quick and easy profit, but a more fundamental view of ourselves as radically separated from nature. In the battle of the machines to dominate the elements, we are clearly on the side of the machines—we are the machines—and this battle is seen in radically dualistic, even apocalyptic, terms. Thus, having no meaningful relationship with nature, we are free, perhaps even compelled, to manipulate it endlessly. The transformation of raw materials into manufactured goods thus becomes our primary goal and value; if the Bomb is God, the GNP is the chief of the angels. Yet our commitment to material goods as highest good may have a more complex significance. It is fostered not only by the symbol of the Bomb as divine controller, manipulator, and dominator, but also by the psychic numbing that the Bomb creates. If we dare not think about the true reality of our lives—the sword of Damocles that constantly threatens total extinction at a moment’s notice—then we must divert ourselves, making the other, numbed level so complex and interesting that we shall not have time to think about the truth. And we must make ourselves so comfortable that we shall not care to deal with the danger. Thus the Bomb and the economy are interlocked not only from the strictly economic point of view (though most people do believe that more bombs are good for the economy, despite the doubts raised by economists), but also from the psychological and symbolic standpoints. The Bomb, the economy, and our lives all form parts of one interlocking machine, offering us enough satisfaction that we refuse to ask about the deeper meaning of the machine’s life. When this question threatens to arise, the diversions of life as theater of the absurd and global Russian roulette are there to entertain us and soothe our doubts. Thus we desperately desire the security that we hope to gain from total domination and manipulation of our world, but we simultaneously demand the insecurity that will make life interesting and entertaining. And we certainly get this insecurity, for we have based our hopes of security on a God that, as we have seen, cannot provide it. We hope to dominate the Enemy with a weapon that by its very nature cannot offer the freedom that we seek through domination. We are caught in a vicious circle in which the quest for security can only breed the anxiety of insecurity. But machines can’t feel anxiety, so it may be easier, for this reason too, to live as a machine. Finally, then, we come to treat not only the natural world and our fellow human beings as machines, but ourselves as well. We offer ourselves, our thoughts and feelings, to the machine and the nation that embodies it, and we perceive those feelings, to the machine and the nation that embodies it, and we perceive those feelings and thoughts as parts of the unreality that surrounds us: “Faced with the prospect of the destruction of mankind, we feel neither violent nor guilty, as though we were all involved in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>a gigantic delusion of negation of the external and well as our internal reality. We allow ourselves to be numbed, finding it the easiest way to cope with an impossible situation, and thus we commit “partial suicide,” which in turn allows us to continue preparing for total suicide on a global scale. We commit ourselves to a machine that is infinitely violent and must wreak its violence on us if it is to be used on others. Therefore, as much as we fear the Enemy, we must fear ourselves in equal measure, and this fear of ourselves reinforces the numbing.  <br />
<br />
The alternative is to embrace a politics of despair Imagining all aspects of our total destruction is a pre-requisite to new forms of politics<br />

Ira, Dr. Strangegod: On the Symbolic Meaning of Nuclear Weapons, pg 160-162<br />
We must face more honestly and more deeply the distortions in our lives—the insecurity of a fragmented and chaotic world whose survival hangs on such a slim thread. In doing so, we must admit that we feel ourselves living in desperate times and immersed to some degree or other in feelings of despair. Joanna Rogers Macy has written eloquently on this subject, showing how our numbing leads us to repress the despair that must arise from an honest assessment of our situation: “This refusal of feelings takes a heavy toll….The energy expended in pushing down despair is diverted from more creative uses.” Macy suggests that we must allow ourselves to feel this despair if our life energy is to be freed again; this opening up of despair, as she describes it, clearly has initiatory dimensions. For in feeling the depth of our despair we may, in fact, “disintegrate.” But this is a “positive disintegration”: “It is helpful in despair work to realize that going to pieces or falling apart is not such a bad thing. Indeed, it is as essential to evolutionary and psychic transformation as the cracking of outgrown shells….Our going to pieces,’ however uncomfortable a process, can open us up to new perception, new data, new responses….There is healing in such openness, for ourselves and perhaps for the world.” In admitting our craziness, we must face our despair. And in facing despair, we deepen our craziness. Yet it is a necessary part of our initiation.<br />

TEXT:<br />
The United States federal government should totally abolish its arsenal of nuclear explosive devices<br />
<br />
Debating specific nuclear devices doesn’t matter, as long as they’re referred to as “weapons.” The only way to solve the root of nuclear danger is to re-frame the nuclear debate through language. Their deployment of the phrase ensures the continuance of the violence that causes nuclear danger in the first place.<br />

Thus <span style="background-color: yellow;">the</span> language … oppose prudential regulations.”4’<br />
<br />
the linguistic aspect of the nuclear debate is absolutely critical to the ongoing legitimacy of nuclear devices. Forcing policymakers to use our reformulated nuclear language exposes the fallacy of so-called nuclear warfighting, ensuring a quick and global de-legitimation of nuclear weapons while the aff maintains the logic that guarantees extinction.<br />

<span class="underline">In such an image the Bomb is</span> no longer seen as the fulcrum of planetary political balance; indeed it has no political function at all. If the Cold War is really over, then it seems that the Bomb can not be used. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Removed from the arena of dynamic human conflict</span>, detached from the vagaries of human decision making, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">it is seen as totally inert</span>. It is treated like <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">a gun with no bullets</span></span>, like mere matter, or perhaps <span class="underline">like <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">dirt waiting to be washed away</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">So the Bomb becomes more than ever a purely technical problem to be cleaned up by the experts</span></span>; it becomes a target for the heroic ego and its vision of progress. This would naturally heighten the ego’s fantasy of security through perfect control. Since progress means slow, steady, careful work (with perfect verification at every step) any lingering hint of urgency is taken out of the issue.<br />
If this image were to come to prominence, it would give the Bomb yet another unconsciously maintained religious meaning. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">The Bomb would retain its apocalyptic dimension, though now merged into the general category of planet-threatening pollution</span></span>. In many religious traditions there is a great concern for polluting impurity, which is often treated as if it were an almost material dirt. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Cleansing may mean restoring natural</span></span> or social <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">order</span></span>—a token of the perfect structure that every psychic image seeks. Some traditions (including Christianity) give impurity a philosophical interpretation as a mark of human finitude and morality (the stain of sin). <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">To wash it away is to gain, or regain, a sacred status beyond finitude</span></span>—the limitless openness that every psychic image seeks. Indeed the whole Western apocalyptic tradition has sometimes been interpreted as an image of cleansing the world. But in this tradition the stain of sin, far from being an inert object of manipulation, is the mark of that very dynamic and religiously charged character, the devil.<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">An image of the Bomb as polluting rubbish would therefore intensify its dynamic apocalyptic symbolism, while at the same time reducing it to an inert stasis that undermines that symbolism</span></span>, especially when it is treated in purely literal terms. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">The Bomb</span></span>’s imagery of annihilation would be heightened. Therefore it would <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">be more intently repressed</span></span>, effectively rendered unreal, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">and treated as if it did not exist</span></span>. Once again, the Bomb would mimic the two elements of a religious image while negating its religious meaning; the quest for perfect reality would once again be evoked and simultaneously denied.<br />
The appeal of this new image would be considerable, for it would satisfy all the requirements of any new nuclear image. It would confirm the social false self system in its illusion of omnipotence, as <span class="underline">the heroic ego takes upon itself the power to destroy the most powerful reality ever known. It would therefore generate a greater imagery of global destruction while offering an even more convincing assurance of survival</span>, and it would do all this in absolutely literal technological terms. The new image would also harmonize easily with existing images. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">The arms control process could be understood as a “clean up,” and it would seem perfectly logical to keep a deterrent force “just in case.” The abolition of nuclear weapons would therefore be postponed indefinitely</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">, <span class="underline">and the actualities of nuclear policy and production would simply be swept under the rug</span></span>. So the threat of unreality would mount and ontological insecurity would grow, as would the threat of annihilation. The unifying form, denying any meaning to this impending formlessness, would harbor the seeds of its own undoing. An image of the Bomb as rubbish would fulfill the prediction of the model of madness: that every new nuclear image will lead us more deeply into nuclear madness.<br />

<strong>REFUSING TO UTILIZE NUCLEAR WEAPONS DOES NOT PREVENT THE AFFIRMATIVE FROM INSTIGATING NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST – THE REPRESSION OF OUR DRIVE FOR DESTRUCTION ENSURES USE VIA ACCIDENT OR DELIBERATE ACTION REGARDLESS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY.

Yet the ego, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">single-mindedly fighting for moral virtue ultimately undermines its own aim</span></span> because it believes in its morality so literally. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Once reality is reduced to mere matter, what moral restrictions</span></span> should or <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">could be binding</span></span> upon us? <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Our selves, our relationships, and our civilization</span></span>, like our things, seem to us nothing but inert objects. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">They “are just dead.” Hillman says</span></span> (echoing Laing), “<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">so why not destroy them, they are dead anyway</span></span>.” Although the ideologies surrounding the “safe Bomb” fantasy appear to be more moral than their Cold War predecessors, they retain the same literalizing moralizing style. So they may lull us into a false sense of security while actually reinforcing our feeling that anything is permitted, since the world is “just dead anyway.”<br />
Perhaps <strong>the greatest danger of the &quot;safe Bomb&quot; fantasy is that</strong> precisely because <strong>it represses our former fantasies of annihilation and omnipotence it insures their continued hold upon us</strong> . Hillman agrees with most depth psychologists that <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">repressed</span> thoughts</span>, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">emotions</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">, <span class="underline">and images will inevitably return</span></span>. But he stresses that, <span class="underline">when repressed through literalism</span>, <span class="underline">they will return literally</span>, in &quot;ungainly, obsessive, literalistic <span class="underline">ways</span>, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">affecting consciousness with precisely the qualities it strives to</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">, <span class="underline">exclude</span></span>.&quot;&quot; This principle plays a central role in shap ing our nuclear images. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">When we deny the call of irrational death for a place in our imaginal life</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">, <span class="underline">we find ourselves bedaz zled by compelling obsessions with irrational</span></span><span class="underline"> death-and<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">kill ing-as physical realities</span></span>. Always bent on domination, living in a world of constant challenge, and taking every conflict on the level of literal physical concreteness, we are inevitably fascinated by images of physical power, aggression, and destruction.<br />
<span class="underline">Even<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> when we pursue policies to control destructive technologies</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">, <span class="underline">we are held by nuclear</span></span> images and <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">technologies in</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> <span class="underline">a</span>n</span> apparently <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">mysterious grip</span></span>.

Our initiations must be in some sense individual and private, but they must also be done in community; society as a whole must undergo the experience. Hence we can learn our path not only from the myth of the individual hero but also from the myth of the heroic rebirth of whole peoples, even of the whole world. Indeed we have such a myth, kept alive for us by the Bomb, in the traditions of the apocalypse. We can learn something valuable from this tradition too. We can learn that <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">our initiation must be acted out</span> in real history</span>—in the empirical reality of the political, social, and cultural world. And we can learn that no matter how bad things may be now, the must get worse before they get better. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">The chaos of today must be intensified; death must be given its full due before new life can begin</span></span>.<br />
We must face more honestly and more deeply the distortions in our lives—the insecurity of a fragmented and chaotic world whose survival hangs on such a slim thread. In doing so, we must admit that we feel ourselves living in desperate times and immersed to some degree or other in feelings of despair. Joanna Rogers Macy has written eloquently on this subject, showing how our <strong>numbing leads us to repress the despair that must arise from an honest assessment of our situation: “<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">This refusal of feelings takes a heavy toll….The energy expended in pushing down despair is diverted from more creative uses</span></strong> .” <strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> </span>Macy suggests that we must allow ourselves to feel this despair if our life energy is to be freed again; this opening up of despair</strong> , as she describes it, <strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> </span>clearly has initiatory dimensions</strong> <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">. </span><strong>For in feeling the depth of our despair we may</strong> , in fact, “<strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> </span>disintegrate</strong> .” <strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> </span>But this is a “positive disintegration”</strong> : “It is helpful in despair work to realize that going to pieces or falling apart is not such a bad thing. Indeed, it is as essential to evolutionary and psychic transformation as the cracking of outgrown shells….<strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> </span>Our going to pieces</strong> ,’ however uncomfortable a process, <strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;"> </span>can open us up to new perception, new data, new responses</strong> ….There is healing in such openness, for ourselves and perhaps for the world.” In admitting our craziness, we must face our despair. And in facing despair, we deepen our craziness. Yet it is a necessary part of our initiation.<br />
<strong>We may</strong> also, <strong>temporarily</strong> , <strong>deepen our numbing</strong> . In any “positive disintegration” there is resistance, a natural refusal of the psyche to fall apart, and thus there is a refusal to feel. <strong>But this</strong> , <strong>too</strong> , <strong>may have to be accepted as necessary, with trust that it is merely temporary and that those who accept the need to transcend their present state will transcend the numbing as well</strong> . <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">Every facet of our “death in life” must be tasted to its fullest.

<span class="underline">Antinuclear activists cast their appeals</span> largely <span class="underline">in moral terms</span>, <span class="underline">proclaiming that</span> &quot;<span class="underline">if you love this planet</span>&quot; (or &quot;humanity,&quot; or &quot;your children,&quot; or any one of several other moral values) <span class="underline">you should convert to the antinuclear cause</span>. <span class="underline">At the same time, they advocate literal knowledge of literal facts, assuming that enough accurate facts combined with clear logical thinking can produce the moral conversion they seek</span>. <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Behind this approach is the prior assumption that all people are logical and can eventually be shown the logical convergence of morality and self-interest</span></span>. Yet the movement's limited success to date casts doubt on the pragmatic value of this approach and on the fruitfulness of its assumptions. <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">The movement's ap parent successes</span></span>(such as the popularity of arms control negotiations) only indicate how easily it is absorbed into the fantasy system that numbs the nation and propagates the nuclear threat.<br />
Indeed it seems that <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">the antinuclear movement</span></span> is asking the public to root itself more firmly in the same cultural milieu that produces nuclear madness. So it <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none;">poses no challenge to the fundamental structures of the culture</span></span>. It <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">does sometimes challenge the technological</span></span> &quot;quick fix&quot; <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">fantasy</span></span>, <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">but it mounts that challenge in the technical terms dictated by those who</span></span> pro duce and <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">deploy the weapons</span></span>. And its alternative is another fan tasy (which James Hillman would call another monotheistic fantasy) of reason and will mobilized to vanquish moral evil. The essential image remains: &quot;the winning weapon&quot; could defeat the enemy's threat of annihilation, if only we had the will to use it. <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The rational ego might have to use a different tool, but it does not have to abandon its belief in its own total control</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">Nor does it have to abandon the radical finitude of its literalizing</span></span> &quot;<span class="underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">hard-headed realism</span></span>.&quot;<br />
<span class="underline">The antinuclear movement</span>, treating the fantasy world of the nuclear experts as the only true reality, pushes the nation further toward unreality. It <span class="underline">helps to repress the fantasy images of nuclear madness because it fails to engage those images as fantasies</span>. <span class="underline">Repression inevitably makes images more fascinating</span>, more compelling, <span class="underline">and</span> perhaps <span class="underline">more indispensable</span>. Even most of the activists themselves seem bewitched by the undeniable richness, intricacy, glamour, and sheer power of nuclear imagery. To judge from their literature, which is filled with the most detailed journeys into this imagery, they are generally content to explore new byways within its familiar boundaries. They seem caught in the grip of the unique qual ity that is &quot;absolutely essential to the notion of archetypes: their emotional possessive effect, their bedazzlement of con sciousness so that it becomes blind to its own stance.&quot; When archetypal fantasies seem to be so literally real, so eminently reasonable, and so dedicated to a safe Bomb, they are all the more difficult to resist.<br />
<span class="underline">Refusing to recognize the role of fantasy in nuclear politics</span>, <span class="underline">the disarmament movement cannot</span> see the struggle over nuclear policy as essentially a struggle over fantasy images. So it cannot see the link between its former apocalyptic imagery and its former place in the national headlines. It cannot see that apocalyptic images, by their very nature, created a demand for immediate and drastic movement that propelled support for total disarmament. Nor can it <span class="underline">see the link between its</span> present<span class="underline">support for incremental arms control and the perpetuation of the nuclear threat</span>. It believes that it is working to end reliance on the Bomb in the only logical way. In fact, though, its policies work psychologically to foster reliance on the Bomb, because they reinforce the nation's commitment to the dual track and its &quot;safe Bomb&quot; fantasies. <span class="underline">Every arms control agreement and every cleaned up weapons factory is viewed by the public as simply another step toward a risk-free nuclear arsenal</span>. <span class="underline">The nuclear fantasies of the early nineties all converge on an image of stasis that offers no motive for</span>, and perhaps no possibility of, <span class="underline">a transformation as radical as the abolition of nuclear weapons</span>.<br />

<strong>PRETENDING TO BE POLICY MAKERS ALLOWS THE AVERAGE CITIZEN ACCESS TO THE THRILLING WORLD OF NUCLEAR POLICY WHERE WE TOO CAN DIRECT THE STATES NUCLEAR WARRIORS AND CONSULT WITH THE WIZARDS OF FOREIGN POLICY.</strong><br />

<strong>As long as nuclear weapons</strong> are produced and deployed (and <strong>negotiated and debated</strong> ) <strong>the average citizen can participate in the mythic drama of creative killing committed by the paradigmatic warriors, scientists, and sovereigns</strong>of World War II. <strong>All these roles offer a mode of religious transformation<u>. They all posses a magical power that can dissolve our world and create a more perfect world, because they have been initiated into a secret wisdom.</u> But their creative acts all repeat the tragic message of this wisdom: transformation always demands a prior death</strong> for which the initiate must assume responsibility. <strong>As we repeat the paradigmatic acts narrated in this myth, acting them out on all the great and small stages of nuclear politics, we are lifted</strong> out of our circumscribed profane lives <strong>into the timeless era of beginnings, whose eternally valid events are changed with cosmic saving power</strong> .<br />
Although the myth is actually acted out only by a chosen few who work in and for the secret circles of government, the government serves here as a representative agency it was designed to be. <strong>Western democracy has afforded the average person a substantial</strong> sense of (or <strong>illusion of) participation in the heroic exploits of the political elite</strong> for two centuries or more. But only in the nuclear age has this sense of participation become so compelling, for only now are we so clearly linked, from the greatest to the smallest, by a common danger and a common fate. <strong>The elite’s capacity to destroy the world affords us all an unprecedented opportunity to participate in religious experiences that had previously been reserved for the elite alone</strong> . And now, for the first time, the elite figure of horno faber as technological wizard has stepped into the center of the myth of world destruction. <strong>Nuclear weapons offer us all a way to share in this figure’s sacred gesture: completing nature’s and time’s geological work</strong>—<strong>exhausting the full spectrum of possibilities of the earth’s life</strong>—<strong>in one convulsive instant of global cataclysm</strong>.<br />

The United States federal government should eliminate its entire arsenal of nuclear explosive devices.<br />
<br />
Debating specific nuclear devices doesn’t matter, as long as they’re referred to as “nuclear weapons.” The only way to solve the root of nuclear danger is to re-frame the nuclear debate through language. Their deployment of the phrase “nuclear weapons” ensures the continuance of the violence that causes nuclear danger in the first place.<br />

<br />
( ) Our counterplan is NOT a mere stupid semantic distinction with the aff – the ONLY way to move beyond the nuclear threat to PLANETARY SURVIVAL is the recognition that the linguistic aspect of the nuclear debate is absolutely critical to the ongoing legitimacy of nuclear devices. Forcing policymakers to use our reformulated nuclear language exposes the fallacy of so-called nuclear warfighting, ensuring a quick and global de-legitimation of nuclear weapons<br />

We affirm the nothing of the resolution by affirming desert<br />
<br />
Discourse shapes the world we live in. The important words and even the little words like “the” construct our understanding of the world and how we relate to it. When they say in their advocacy, that they affirm “the” desert, they create a singular identity that can be pointed to and understood instead of recognizing the possibility for there to be many deserts and just “a” desert.

The role of the ballot should be to interrogate our relationship to exclusion<br />

The alternative renders power visible and enables an antagonistic nation-state system grounded in reciprocal violence that limits the nature and scope of warfare. Enmity and conflict are inevitable. The attempt to eliminate them through a new political community based on vulnerability renders exclusions invisible making violence and warfare unlimited and the postmodern hope for ‘new political possibilities’ ushers in new forms of violence as we sit, paralyzed, waiting for godot.<br />

TEXT:<br />
United States missileers should choose whether or not they wish to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Contention one – Competition<br />
We leave the choice to turn the key to the people who have the keys, instead of forcing them to do so.<br />
<br />
Contention two – Net Benefit<br />
Choice is a matter of the individuals on decision, not what we decide is best for him/her. The AFF removes the choice from the missileers by using fiat to make the choice for them. Even if we are all fighting for the same goal, we should never question what others are doing and simply evaluate what we are doing.<br />
