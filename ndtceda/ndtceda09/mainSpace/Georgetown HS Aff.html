 <span style="color: black;">The role of our nuclear arsenal isn’t just deterrence. It’s internal. The nuclear serves to prop up domestic disposability.<br />

Much of the more.. Cold War United States.<br />
<br />
Civil defense projects are coded by constructions of race. Projects of nuclear survival construct identity based on who we save and who we lave behind. Our strategies constitute a covert history of eugenics and white supremacy.<br />

Civil defence pedagogies.. their class position.<br />
<br />
Defensive dispersal was both symptom and cause of urbicidal racism – it’s a nuclear fuelled legacy of invisible segregation.<br />

Materially, the conditions.. in these enactments.<br />
<br />
Urbicide never ended. The genocidal fantasies of the cold war manifest themselves today in the physical architecture of the city and the worst aspects of homeland security. Separating urban planning from policy discussions results in permanent global war.<br />
Dudley, 7 (Michael is a Research Associate with the Institute of Urban Studies at the University of Winnipeg, Revisiting Cold War Ideology in the Secure City: Towards a Political Economy of Urbicide Dudley, Michael. Theory and Event, Volume 10, Issue 2, 2007)<br />
During the Cold war.. purposes of the state.<br />
<br />
The specific ideologies of cold war civil defense connect continuously to the current racist dimensions of homeland security. This connected ideational chain propels the genocidal sacrifice of populations for the maintenance of white identity.<br />

Defensive dispersal rules our cities because of its invisibility.<br />
Dudley, ‘1 (“Sprawl as strategy,” Journal of Planning Education and Research, Vol. 21, No. 1, 52-53 (2001)<br />
Although the interpretation.. in the nuclear age.<br />
<br />
We are locked in a dynamic of escalating defense and offense against the backdrop of the city – both ideologies are bankrupt formulas for permanent war. We should refuse the easy solutions of either sacrifice of urban peoples or an uncritical embrace or the current urban formation. Tracing patterns of urbicide is the precondition to cutting the Gordian knot.<br />
Graham, 4 (Stephen is Profess of Human Geography at the University of Durham. He holds a degree on Geography. Worked in planning and economic development at Sheffield City Council)<br />
First, as the.. no greater challenge.<br />
<br />
Resisting urbicide means accepting the urban dimension of moments of fluid encounter. This politics accepts the inevitability of multiplicity, not the strident singularity of mutually exclusive bounds of ideologies.<br />
