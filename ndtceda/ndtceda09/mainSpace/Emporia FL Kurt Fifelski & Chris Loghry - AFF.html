The UN Security … nuclear arsenals.<br />
<br />
<strong>This gap between rhetoric and reality is steeped in nuclear reclusion – nuclear war is unthinkably horrifying so our common response is to just to ignore it – this also means that debates about nuclear weapons become depoliticized—leaving us paralyzed by fear</strong><br />
<strong>Fishel in 2008</strong> (Stefanie [Dept of Political Science @ John Hopkins], &quot;Nuclear Collective Memories, Hidden Histories, and Remembering the Future&quot;, Paper presented at the annual meeting of the ISA's 49th ANNUAL CONVENTION, BRIDGING MULTIPLE DIVIDES, Hilton San Francisco, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA Online, kdf)<br />

History never stands still. …makes us more secure.<br />
<br />
<strong>The culture of deterrence has naturalized all forms of conflict through the framework of depoliticization—we have become culturalized to feel safe in a world full of chaos—this is because are truly afraid to question the horrors of nuclear weapons and to recognize out complicity in the erosion of the political—ultimately resulting in the paralysis of a culture of violence</strong><br />
<strong>Brown in 2006</strong> (Wendy [ Prof of political science @ UC Berkeley]; Regulating Aversion: tolerance in the Age of Identity and Empire; p. 15-16, kdf)<br />
Part of …to culture.<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan: <em>The United States Federal Government should abolish its nuclear explosive devices.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>We must demand the impossible when it comes to nuclear weapons—each time we pass up the opportunity we fail to question the underlying political order—while it might be difficult to achieve our goal we must stay resilient—otherwise we continue to legitimate proliferation, constantly risk cosmic catastrophe, reverse trends of denuclearization, spark an arms race, and allow for the depoliticization of our culture</strong><br />
<strong>Booth and Wheeler in 92</strong> (Ken [Personal Chair in the Department of International Politics @ University of Wales] and Nicholas J. [UN Security Council]; Security Without Nuclear Weapons; ed: Regina Cowen Karp; p. 51-5; kdf)<br />
There is …appear achievable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Disarm movements continue to think complete disarmament can be easily achieved—and realist strategies have ceded to the inevitability of nuclear weapons—we reject both of these paths as failed forms of utopianism—instead we adopt a method that says because of the current political process complete disarmament will be difficult but because of the unethical nature of nuclear weapons we should tie ourselves to zero rather than seeing them as inevitable</strong><br />

More …over policy.<br />
<br />
<strong>We are a unique form of a utopian demand—all of their criticisms will assume a fictional utopia where the goal seems easily obtained—instead we are a form of process of utopianism where we project the goal at zero and then engage the political process maintaining that goal—this ordering of events is important because it reverses the trends of the current political order</strong><br />
<strong>Karp in 92</strong> (Regina Cowen [Senior Researcher and leader of the SIPRI Security Without Nuclear Weapons? Project; frmr Resident Fellow @ the Institute for East-West Security Studies]; Security Without Nuclear Weapons?; p. 1-3; kdf)<br />
In chapter … be legitimized.<br />
<br />
<strong>The current political reality considers what “is” resulting in the reclusion of nuclear weapons—the affirmative focuses on what the world “should” be in order to transcend the current order</strong><br />

[headed the nU.S. delegation to the negotiations on nuclear and space arms in Geneva from 1985 to 1989], We Should, so we Can: Life Without the Bomb, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0424-21.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0424-21.htm</a>, kdf)<br />

<br />
<strong>Through our utopian demand we examine the problems within calls for abolition—at the same time only this demand can create a break with the securization inherent in deterrence</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Voting affirmative resonates into something beyond just the act of voting—it creates the space for universal politics by exposing the violence of the current system and wills a new one into existence</strong><br />
<strong>Dean in 2005</strong> (Jodi [Associate Prof of Political Theory @ Hobart &amp; William Smith]; Zizek Against Democracy; jdeanicite.typepad.com/.../zizek_against_democracy_new_version.doc, kdf)<br />
I’ve argued thus … absent this ‘beyond’).<br />
<br />
<strong>The nuclear veil of secrecy makes standard decision making epistemologically unsound – the manufacturing of intelligence to build support for the Iraq war proves that the plans reactivation of the public sphere is a prerequisite to making any accurate political assessments</strong><br />
<strong>Masco in 2007</strong> [Joseph [Dept. of Anthropology @ U Chicago], “The Nuclear Public Sphere,” Ethnografeast III: Ethnography and the Public Sphere, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ceas.iscte.pt/" rel="nofollow">http://ceas.iscte.pt/</a> ethnografeast/papers/joseph_ masco.pdf, kdf]<br />

 <span style="font-size: small; font-weight: normal;">The recent UN resolution was a façade to extend the secrecy of nuclear expansion abroad and to whitewash the development of its own nuclear program<br />

The nuclear veil of secrecy makes standard decision making epistemologically unsound – the manufacturing of intelligence to build support for the Iraq war proves that the plans reactivation of the public sphere is a prerequisite to making any accurate political assessments<br />

Politicians love to talk about a world free of nuclear weapons – sadly, this is usually political posturing, as it is with Obama – Politics in this way results in the United States inevitably maintain nuclear weapons<br />

<br />
This gap between rhetoric and reality is steeped in nuclear reclusion – nuclear war is unthinkably horrifying so our common response is to just to ignore it – this also means that debates about nuclear weapons become depoliticized—leaving us paralyzed by fear<br />
Fishel in 2008<span style="font-weight: normal;"> (Stefanie [Dept of Political Science @ John Hopkins],</span> <span class="apple-style-span"><span style="font-weight: normal;">&quot;Nuclear Collective Memories, Hidden Histories, and Remembering the Future&quot;, Paper presented at the annual meeting of the ISA's 49th ANNUAL CONVENTION, BRIDGING MULTIPLE DIVIDES, Hilton San Francisco, SAN FRANCISCO, CA, USA Online, kdf) </span><br />

<br />
The culture of deterrence has naturalized all forms of conflict through the framework of depoliticization—we have become culturalized to feel safe in a world full of chaos—this is because are truly afraid to question the horrors of nuclear weapons and to recognize out complicity in the erosion of the political—ultimately resulting in the paralysis of a culture of violence<br />

<br />
Thus, the plan: The United States federal government should abolish its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
We must demand the impossible when it comes to nuclear weapons—each time we pass up the opportunity we fail to question the underlying political order—while it might be difficult to achieve our goal we must stay resilient—otherwise we continue to legitimate proliferation, constantly risk cosmic catastrophe, reverse trends of denuclearization, spark an arms race, and allow for the depoliticization of our culture<br />
Booth and Wheeler in 92 <span style="font-weight: normal;">(Ken [Personal Chair in the Department of International Politics @ University of Wales] and Nicholas J. [UN Security Council]; Security Without Nuclear Weapons; ed: Regina Cowen Karp; p. 51-5; kdf) </span><br />
There is …<u>appear achievable.</u><br />
<br />
Disarm movements continue to think complete disarmament can be easily achieved—and realist strategies have ceded to the inevitability of nuclear weapons—we reject both of these paths as failed forms of utopianism—instead we adopt a method that says because of the current political process complete disarmament will be difficult but because of the unethical nature of nuclear weapons we should tie ourselves to zero rather than seeing them as inevitable<br />

<br />
We are a unique form of a utopian demand—all of their criticisms will assume a fictional utopia where the goal seems easily obtained—instead we are a form of process of utopianism where we project the goal at zero and then engage the political process maintaining that goal—this ordering of events is important because it reverses the trends of the current political order<br />

The aff is a strategic demand because it creates a rupture within institutional politics by enacting a utopian imagination of abolition—anything less continues the paralysis of depoliticization which is committed to powerless and meaningless reform<br />

Through our utopian demand we examine the problems within calls for abolition—at the same time only this demand can create a break with the securization inherent in deterrence<br />
