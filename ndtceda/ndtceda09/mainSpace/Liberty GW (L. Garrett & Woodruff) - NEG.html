 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Attempts to explain violence shield individuals from any responsibility for their actions. Describing violence as the inevitable result of a chain of events naturalizes it and washes the hands of those who actually decide to commit acts of violence. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Kappeler, humanities professor at Al-Akhawayn University, 1995</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And the 1AC engages in an ordering that reinforces the notion that the ‘I’ is powerless, ultimately eliminating the possibility of agency and making real transformation impossible.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(Jayan, “Re-Framing International Law for the 21st Century: Orders of Inhumanity”, 9 Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems 599, Fall, lexis, ldg)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We are today bombarded … of self-change in relationships of solidarities.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Understanding violence as an aberration-the consequence of a flawed worldview-guarantees complicity and make it inevitable-turning the case impacts. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Violence – what we usually recognize … and we permit them to happen. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And, their ordering of the world means elimination of those that do not fit-replicating colonial violence</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Distinguishing these two meanings of &quot;… of the universal society of humankind. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our alternative is to begin our interrogations of violence with a local refusal to endorse the violence of the affirmative</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The alternative solves-it is the only way to understand our own complicity in the production of violent world orders</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Kappeler, humanities professor at Al-Akhawayn University, 1995</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(Susanne, “The Will to Violence: The Politics of Personal Behavior”, pg 258, ldg)</span><br />

 <br />
First is our defense:<br />
<br />
A. Ontological questioning must stop in the face of mass death<br />
Davidson, co-editor of Critical Inquiry, 1989<br />
(Arnold, “Questions concerning Heidegger: Opening the Debate”, Critical Inquiry, Winetr 1989, JSTOR, ldg)<br />
<br />
I understand Levinas’ work to …questioning must stop.<br />
<br />
B. Ontology and epistemology are not pre-requisites to anything.<br />
Owen, reader in political theory at the university of Southampton, 2002<br />
(David, “Re-orienting International Relations: On Pragmatism, Pluralism and Practical Reasoning”, Millennium - Journal of International Studies 2002 31: 653-673., Sage Journals, ldg)<br />
<br />
Commenting on the ‘philosophical … necessarily the most important kind.<br />
<br />
Now our offense:<br />
<br />
1. Turn – basing politics on Being leads to the acceptance of violence and death<br />
Caputo, Villanova Philosophy Professor, 1993<br />
[John D, “Against Ethics,” google books, accessed 1-4-2010, mss]<br />
<br />
That would mean you cannot have … for remembering proper names.<br />
<br />
2. Privileging being eliminates human agency. All action is reduced to judgment on its relation to being<br />
Wolin, Professor of Humanities at Rice, 1990<br />
(Richard, “The Politics of Being”, pg 153, ldg)<br />
<br />
Consequently, the major problem with …it is the “destiny of Being.”<br />
<br />
3. Binaries<br />
<br />
A. Threat construction is key create us/them binaries which are key to American ontological security<br />
Epstein, masters IR Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2007<br />
(Noa, “Explaining the War on Terrorism from an Ontological Security Perspective”, MIT International Review, ebsco, ldg)<br />
<br />
The defining aspect of the U.S. … benevolent guardian of freedom.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. The impact is the destruction of the political and infinite global violence<br />
Rienhard, PhD in Critical and Aesthetic Theory from Johns Hopkins, 2004<br />
(Kenneth, “Towards a Political Theology- Of the Neighbor” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cjs.ucla.edu/Mellon/Towards_Political_Theology.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cjs.ucla.edu/Mellon/Towards_Political_Theology.pdf</a>, ldg)<br />
<br />
If the concept of the political …because they would be identifiable” (PF 83).<br />
<br />
4. Turn—their focus on ontology creates moral blindness to atrocities and tyranny.<br />
Smith, government professor, 2002<br />
(Steven, Confronting Mass Democracy and Industrial Technology, ed. McCormick, pg 265-266, ldg)<br />
<br />
At another point, Strauss suggests …Heidegger’s forgetfulness of the political.<br />
<br />
5. Focus on ontology over the concrete benefits of the plan is a patriarchal impact calculus that perpetuates violence.<br />
Zimmerman, Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, 1990<br />
(Michael, &quot; Heidegger’s Confrontation with Modernity”, pg 268-271, ldg)<br />
<br />
Feminists argue that in focusing …in terms of &quot;transcendent&quot; awareness.<br />
<br />
6. Politics<br />
<br />
A. Turning inward for ontological questioning makes ethics and politics impossible.<br />
Biskowski, political science professor University of Georgia, 1995<br />
(Lawrence, Politics Versus Aesthetics: Arendt’s Critiques of Nietzsche and Heidegger, The Review of Politics, Vol. 57, No. 1, Winter 1995, pg 64-66, JSTOR, ldg)<br />
<br />
This turn inward and toward … caprices lionized as self-expression.<br />
<br />
B. Creates an aesthetics of self-fascination which allows external coercion.<br />
Biskowski, political science professor University of Georgia, 1995<br />
(Lawrence, Politics Versus Aesthetics: Arendt’s Critiques of Nietzsche and Heidegger, The Review of Politics, Vol. 57, No. 1, Winter 1995, pg 64-66, JSTOR, ldg)<br />
<br />
Style, however, is not beauty. Even … this goal remains within the realm of the possible.<br />
<br />
C. Turns their impact—turns people into passive objects of manipulation and administration. Only the perm can recognize the ontological importance of political action.<br />
Biskowski, political science professor University of Georgia, 1995<br />
(Lawrence, Politics Versus Aesthetics: Arendt’s Critiques of Nietzsche and Heidegger, The Review of Politics, Vol. 57, No. 1, Winter 1995, pg 64-66, JSTOR, ldg)<br />
<br />
Arendt believed that one … it also brings with it a host of dangers.<br />
<br />
Zero empirical correlation between ‘innate drives’ or ‘social institutions’ and war<br />
Sharp, Professor of Law Georgetown University, 2008<br />
(Walter, “Democracy and Deterrence Foundations for an Enduring World Peace”, May 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://aupress.au.af..mil/Books/sharp/Sharp.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://aupress.au.af..mil/Books/sharp/Sharp.pdf</a>, ldg)<br />
<br />
While classical liberals … war must address these individuals.<br />
<br />
No robust correlation between ‘root cause’ and war<br />
Moore, Professor of Law UVA, 2004<br />
(John Norton, “New Paradigm in International Relations: A Reduction of War and Terror in the World through Democratization and Deterrence”, 17 Transnat'l Law. 83 (2004), heinonline.org, ldg)<br />

2NC Overview<br />

Financial reform will pass now and is key to prevent imminent banking crisis and financial meltdown- BUT the plan eviscerates Obama’s political capital which is key to prevent reform from being watered-down and failing. Outweighs case-<br />

<br />
United States Government, the combination of federal, state, and local laws, bodies, and agencies that is responsible for carrying out the operations of the United States. The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington, D.C.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Should implies policy – it expresses that the government has a duty or obligation<br />
American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 04<br />

Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004. 20 Sep. 2006. &lt;Dictionary.com </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=should" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=should</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&gt;)<br />

aux.v. Past tense of shall<br />

<br />
Violation – Affirmative doesn’t propose a way for the United States to reduce the size of its arsenal, its role or its missions.<br />
<br />
Vote negative:<br />
<br />
1. Predictability-<br />
A. the resolution sets the topic for discussion- allowing the aff to choose their ground outside of the resolution makes it impossible for the negative to engage the affirmative. There are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies unrelated to the topic which are impossible to predict- this leaves the negative unprepared to debate<br />
<br />
B. Exploding predictable limits neutralizes the discursive benefits to debate and renders their advocacy meaningless—only our interpretation preserves the revolutionary potential of a deliberative activity<br />
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 180)<br />
<br />
'Thus far, I have argued that if the… those who reject civility and democracy.<br />
<br />
C. Aff conditionality- only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies- their framework allows aff vagueness, enabling the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground<br />
<br />
D. The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion<br />
Ruth Shively, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 181-2)<br />
The requirements given thus … words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
E. Unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that allows us to critically examine their approach- this prevents informed clash which outweighs all other impacts - fairness is a prerequisite because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously examining it.<br />
<br />
2. Fascism<br />
A. Political engagement is necessary to prevent fascism<br />
Donald S. Lutz, Professor of Political Science at the University of Houston, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics, edited by Portis, Gundersen, and Shively, “Political Theory and Constitutional Construction,” 43-44)<br />
<br />
To the extent politicians do …rhetorical moral superiority.<br />
<br />
B. Debate is a key battleground for preventing totalitarianism- focus on students is key because they will be future political leaders<br />
Donald S. Lutz, Professor of Political Science at the University of Houston, 2000 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics, edited by Portis, Gundersen, and Shively, “Political Theory and Constitutional Construction,” 36-37)<br />
<br />
Although the focus of this … justice with power in the long run.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Cultural Hegemony<br />
<br />
A. Our framework is critical to challenge fundamentalism and orthodoxy- it’s a progressive challenge to security politics<br />
English et al, Schenley Park Debate Authors Working Group scholar, 7<br />
[Eric English, Stephen Lano, Gordon Mitchell, University of Pittsburg communications professor, Catherine Morrison, John Reif, and Carly Woods, “Debate as a Weapon of Mass Destruction,” June 2007, Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/EnglishDAWG.pdf]<br />
<br />
It is our position, however, … the face of fundamentalism.<br />
<br />
B. Switch-side debate solves us vs. them dichotomies- its key to break down orthodoxy and oppression<br />

<br />
But this outcome seems paradoxical. … categories find debate so threatening.<br />
<br />
4. Process Education<br />
<br />
A. the aff will always win the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract- we can only debate the merits of arguments if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Harvard Carr Center for Human Rights Policy director and human rights practices professor, 04 (The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror, 20-21)<br />
There are two problems with a … thus respect for one right might lead us to betray another.<br />
<br />
B. Debating implementation of government policy is key to effectively challenge oppression<br />

Table 2<br />
Nuclear Missions<br />
AND<br />
15 Apply shock to terminate a regional conventional war<br />
<br />
B. Violation-The Affirmative is not a substantial reduction of the missions of the United States’ nuclear arsenal, because they eliminate a target of a mission, not the mission itself.<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to Neg<br />
<br />
1. Predictable Limits- The affirmative justifies “country of the week” affirmatives. NFU’s , removing the nuclear umbrella and removing warheads from specific countries are all topical. Reducing and restricting missions is key to fairness<br />
<br />
2. Ground- We lose deterrence links based off the scope of the plan, politics links based off plan specificity, and counterforce specific disadvantages because they assume a change in the overall posture.<br />
<br />
3. Precision- our interpretation gives meaning to the words ‘substantial’- each word in the resolution must have value and if they don’t meet part, they don’t meet any- AND ignoring its justifies non-proliferation affs that just use the US to pressure other countries over their nuclear weapons policies.<br />

Positive Peace K<br />
<br />
Focusing on war as an event produces politics of crises and control that attempt to manage outbreaks of violence. This reproduces militarism and perpetuates the structural violence of “peacetime militarism”<br />

Philosophical attention to war has AND inevitability of war and militarism.<br />

The representations of the 1AC inculcate a norm of negative peace, we should work to foster a more pacific discourse that promotes positive peace and social justice. Our alternative is to engage in positive nonviolent discourse.<br />

<br />
Ethics K<br />
<br />
The Affirmative poses the question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of institutions. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves with the reorientation of our collective institutional spheres takes precedent and in the process produces these ethics and our relationship with others merely as a background for institutional transformations. The affirmative makes the question not how much how we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationships which makes genuine ethical engagement impossible.<br />
Zupančič, 2000<br />
(Alenka, Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy @ the Slovene Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, p 10-11) cnb<br />
<br />
In other words, one cannot AND — it refers to the faculty of desire as a priori.<br />
<br />
The Affirmative will respond that the plan and the institutional plays no prominent role in the posture of the 1AC. This, however, is the premise of our whole argument. Their belief that the institution must remain in the background nonetheless, in order to generate change, is the ultimate sell-out of their ethical commitment. This act in and of itself is unethical because it admits from the get-go that the ethical posture alone is insufficient absent its capacity to generate change within the domain of institutional politics<br />
Thurschwell, 2003<br />
(Adam, Associate Professor of Law @ Cleveland State University, SYMPOSIUM: NIETZCHE AND LEGAL THEORY (PART II): SPECTERS OF NIETZSCHE: POTENTIAL FUTURES FOR THE CONCEPT OF THE POLITICAL IN AGAMBEN AND DERRIDA, March, 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 1193, l/n) cnb<br />
<br />
Thus, as Derrida puts it, &quot;ethics enjoins AND something that resembles pure faith.<br />
<br />
The Belief that our activisms must inevitably, inexorably respond to the institutional conditions of our time through the leveraging of particular institutional appeals is precisely what nullifies our ethical potential. No matter the force of its opposition, the connection of transformation with an appeal to our institutions, mediates our relationships in such a manner that ethical transformation outside this frame of mediation becomes impossible.<br />
Hershock, 1999<br />
(Peter D., Project Fellow at the EastWest Center, Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Hawaii, &quot;Changing the Way Society Changes: Transposing Social Activism into a Dramatic Key&quot;, Journal of Buddhist Ethics 6, p 158-160, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://jbe.gold.ac.uk/6/hershock991.pdf</a>) cnb<br />
<br />
I have argued at some length (Hershock, 1999) that AND definitions of ‘being right’ and ‘being wronged’.<br />
<br />
If the mediation of our ethics is the source of our ethical impoverishment and the corruption of our relationships, it’s time to withdraw from this framework of mediation. We ask you to affirm the ethical commitment of the 1AC in its immediacy. Suspending the wall that mediates our relationships constitutes the only genuine ethical act.<br />
Santilli, 2003<br />
(Paul, professor of philosophy @ Siena College, “Radical Evil, Subjection, and Alain Badiou’s Ethic of the Truth Event”, World Congress of The International Society for Universal Dialogue, May 22, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.isud.org/papers/pdfs/Santilli.pdf</a>) cnb<br />
<br />
If we retain this original sense of “radical evil” AND and no genuine morality.<br />
<br />
The displacement of our ethics onto external political institutions culminates in genocidal violence. Once we accept that our ethics are contingent on the institution all atrocities becomes possible.<br />
Zupančič, 2000<br />
(Alenka, Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy @ the Slovene Academy of Sciences in Ljubljana, Ethics of the Real: Kant and Lacan, p 96-98) cnb<br />
<br />
Another problem still remains, however: AND failure ‘fully’ to realize itself.<br />
