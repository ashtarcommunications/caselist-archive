Almighty Bombs, to whom we owe much gratitude. Forsake us not, it is in you we find our hope and safety. Lead us into an era of endless prosperity and hegemony. To you, we give our lives, so that we may gain safety. Your obliterating power has led us into a new era no one can question your ultimacy.<br />

Holy Cheesecake batman! Let’s go back to that again. Why is it that all of us pray at the nuclear altar? Why do we always focus on the bomb and never the missile? The bomb isn't the root, and neither is the missile. Eating away at my soul, the ever-watchful satellites and the missiles they control lend our lives a terrifying sense of security, while blinding us to the contents. The bomb is truly the alpha and the omega, the first and the last. We have reached the end times of human existence. Humans no longer exist except as abstract and interchangeable bodies in a world reduced to purely military space. These technologies effectively mean that every place is the same as any other, every dog like any other, every person a possible target. Virilio explains:<br />

<br />
In this brave new world, humans are simply no longer relevant, politics, philosophy, policies, NONE OF THESE MATTER! The machines we invented to make decisions are making them, running the world while we worship them. This tyrannical administration is the end of being human, the end of human beings, not in a nuclear holocaust, but through our cybernetic assimilation into the omniscient machines that control all the interchangeable spaces of the world.<br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><br />
This means that there can be no meaning, no value, no impacts. Who cares if they live or die, if being is reduced to mere biological existence. The interconnected and interchangeable world means we can't tell friend from enemy, living from dead or good from evil. All points on every physical and philosophical map are interchangeable with every other. Delilo notes: </span><br />

<strong>“He thought of the photograph of Nixon….. <u>It meant he'd been facing in the wrong direction all along.”</u></strong><br />
<br />
This indifferent mapping of the world guarantees ceaseless violence. Bodies and ideas are chosen arbitrarily as the enemy and destroyed. This world of random and constant violence is mirrored in our educational processes. Education becomes the parceling of information. My ground and your ground,. Certain teams become an enemy of debate to be excluded and destroyed.<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">Davis in 2002 (CresonC. [Prof Philo @JMU]Subversion, BBody-Politic, Scripture, <em>Strike Terror No More,</em> pp. 12-13) </span></strong><br />
<strong><u>“So we return to the question…… presuppose fear for its owner existence”</u></strong><br />
<br />
Thus, Emma and I affirm the resolution as a unique space to challenge the speed and uniquity of military technology and thought that has spilled over into our daily lives. It is not like every other space, it is impossible to discuss the nuclear arsenal without discussing it's role in a system of speed and observation that renders humans inhuman. It is in this phrase that we see a space that is not the space of 24 hour news, manufactured international emergencies, insecurity, threat and terrorism. We say the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal. This space is the space, it is our space, and is not like others. It grows and expands with us, and in opposition to every ground and education that would destroy it.<br />
Allowing for the spaces within the resolution frees us from the technology that maps us out.<br />
<br />
This space is the opposite of predictable or stable. It is not prognostication, but revelation, exposure. The catastrophes that threaten to destroy us, that kill and maim, are not some preventable accident. They appeared simultaneously with the technologies in the museum of violence, to which we were left witnessing the accident, but unconscious to the suffering inflicted. It is only through a break away from the predictable can be begin to regain our conscious and define our being in relationship to the bomb and the rest of the unconscious society.<br />

<u><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“The signing of a “joint understanding”….. “hair-trigger alert” to reduce the risk of an accidental launch.” </span></u><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">BUT WAIT! Let’s go back to that card again. It’s got the em-pha-sis on the wrong syl-abl. The INDYPENDENT, a good liberal online newsource not markedly different from the good liberal blogs and newspapers that good liberals read every good liberal day keeps on harping on the destructive power of nuclear weapons, but what is interesting is the threat that it sees without seeing, See, for all the hand-wringing over hair-trigger alerts and the danger of nuclear “ACCIDENTS” that they create, the focus is always on the nuclear event and never on the projectile that shrieks across the night horizon before it’s payload detonates and destroys each of us, as intimately as a bullet for billions.<br />
This rolling together of the missile and it’s payload, the erased difference between between the vehicle and the projectile is what interests us. Why is it that we only speak of the terminal event and the object that brings it while eliding the difference between the two?<br />
<br />
The answer, of course, is that it was never the detonation that was important, the threat of nuclear weapons isn’t this or that crisis, a flash like an old camera that vaporizes every eye that sees it, the hurricane force winds that bear every object in front of them. No, it is none of these things. The threat is the eradication of space as meaningful at all. The contraction of the world into a singularity dominated by a techno-strategic gaze that sees no humans, animals or plants, but only a continous space to be conquered by machines that do human jobs and humans that act like machines. Our military technologies are our fates. The architect and philosopher Paul Virilio notes:<br />
Virilio 77 (Paul [Auther, and cultural theorist]Speed and Politics: An Essay on Dromology. New York: Semiotext(e), 1977 [1986]pg. 23-24)<br />
“Historically, <u>if the reduction of obstacles…..</u> instruments of modern warfarer.”<br />
<br />
Let us restate our thesis in case you are at all unclear about it. It isn’t nuclear weapons we should be afraid of, it’s the missiles, the technologies of instant diagnosis and response, the satellites monitoring and mapping the earth. It is not our deaths that we should be afraid of, but our utter obliteration! Once the earth becomes only a space mapped by our nuclear observation posts, once it has been rendered utterly flat and undifferentiated, once a strategic missile can reach its target on the other side of the earth in a half hour as simply as you or I walk to the corner store. Once the world is inhabited by these giants WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO LIVE? We won’t we won’t live except as servants of the missiles, in constant fear of their speed, ubiquity and seeming omnipresence as Puritans used to fear God. Here is how Thomas Pynchon describes it:<br />
(Thomas Pynchon, <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em>, pp.2-3) </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“A screaming comes across the sky…. Will the light come before or after?” </span></u><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><br />
And so a screaming comes across the sky, but it is the flash and wind we fear, but underneath all of this is the closing off of humanity, the clausterphobically narrow vision of what it means to be human. To be human is, of course, to be afraid of nuclear weapons, while serving the missiles.<br />
<br />
It is in opposition to the obliteration of space and the people it holds that we offer the following plan: </span><br />
<strong><span style="color: black;">The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal by increasing the warning times for strategic launch vehicles. Funding and enforcement are guaranteed. </span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><br />
Here you shouldn’t confuse the plan with us, the reasons that we advocate the plan stand outside of and external to it’s literal implementation. Plan in a vacuum is a telling phrase, vacuum is, as Virilio points out, the final frontier of real-time mapping. Space is mapped so that satellites can use it as an orbital space for the constant monitoring and mapping of the actual, terrestrial space of human action, the constant panoptic observation of people, locations and spaces to identify and neutralize possible threats. The neg’s system of topical/nontopical, policy/nonpolicy, straight up or critical apes the technological systems of classification and response that we criticize.<br />
<br />
It is this twisting of space and the person into narrower and narrower spaces that Pynchon is writing about. The assumption that the space of debate is only for games playing, that to participate the discussion had to be hypothetical, topical and most of all contemporary, is itself deeply tyrannical. Cutting the newest uniqueness cards during the round we are transformed, not into participants in some democratic experience, but news tickers spewing out the latest status of the President’s political capital, US/Russian Relations, the world balance of power. We are required to conquer space by talking about referents on the map as if they were real things. In the process we become nothing. 24 hour news and reportage is the death of deliberation, of thought. The problem isn’t too little information, but too much. The facts and analysis pile higher and higher, but like the missile we shouldn’t confuse the messenger moving at the speed of light, the immediacy of internet and cable news, with the facts it purports to carry. The newest crisis in SOUTH ASIA! WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE NUCLEAR DANGER! This commitment to real time reaction to events located thousands of miles away is the tyranny of space being conquered. The need to pretend to be someone else, to roleplay the policymaking process it tyranny, is the eradication of being.<br />
Thommesen explains in 2003 : </span><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;">(</span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;">Jacom Thommesen “Virilio: From Space to Time, Freom Reality to Image”, Ephemera, Reviews.) </span><br />
<strong><u>“According to Virilio</u></strong>, <strong><u>the</u></strong> above <strong><u>‘shrinking’….. society as the military society”</u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt; line-height: 115%;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">The strategic technologies of missile delivery systems reduce the world to a set of interchangeable data points. Every place is interchangeable with every other place and every person is interchangeable with every other. They are all just blips on a radar screen. The result is the inevitable launch of missiles armed with nuclear weapons. Once the world is reduced to a series of targets the binary coding of friend and enemy, good and evil classifies the world into radar dots that must be preserved and the blips that must be destroyed to do so. The American Novelist Don Delillo describes this system in <em>Underworld:</em> </span><br />
DeLillo, 97, (Don DeLillo author of 13 books. “Underworld” pgs. 464-467,)<br />
<strong><u>“He thought of the photograph…. wrong direction all along. “</u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><br />
This inevitable process of realtime mapping of crises and binaristic decisions by satellites and computers is not the result, but the <em>cause</em> of our current political impasse. The media and intelligence establishments create a political terrain that obscures all alternatives to constant war and violence. Peace is no longer an option, instead our option become kill or be killed, terrorize others or be terrorized, bomb or be bombed. Only by rejecting this artificial machine terrain of politics can we move towards solutions. Virilio in 96 (Paul [ PHD Philo The Sorbonne, Director of Paris Special School of Architecture, <em>A Landscape of Events</em>) </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;">“The general staff of the army in 1914…. <strong><u>sudden-death machine over which we would no longer have any power.”</u></strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span><br />
Now we must look to the speed of the missiles that we are critiquing. This is because without a realization of the machines that we are puppets for we will never be able to stop worshiping the almighty missiles. Thus the only form of deterrence that must be enacted is one that solves for speed and the tyranny of real time. Virilio goes on to write </span><br />
