OBSERVATION 1: INHERENCY<br />
<br />
1) Testing is on the rise now- other countries are waiting on U.S. ratification of the CTBT in order to bring the treaty and its inspections regime into force<br />
<br />
The Economist, 6/4/09. “Making a Start”<br />
<br />
But some things … not in the mood.<br />
<br />
2) The voluntary moratorium is non-binding and does not represent a political commitment to a test ban<br />

In this vein, General Shalikashvili....interest.<br />

Advantage One is Proliferation<br />
<br />
Nuclear proliferation is spreading in the status quo<br />

<br />
Fast forward 10 years,....urgent action.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have seven internal links to proliferation:<br />
<br />
The test ban itself solves three internal links:<br />
1) The development of nuclear weapons by new states;<br />
2) Vertical proliferation through weapons buildups; and<br />
3) The development of new advanced weapons by nuclear states<br />

As Obama himself recognizes....ballistic missiles.<br />

Fourth- The CTBT is key to build the international coalitions necessary to boost diplomatic efforts on nuclear weapons programs that are outside of the NPT<br />

Sam Nunn is co-chairman of the Nuclear Threat Initiative and a former U.S. Senator. William J. Perry, a professor at Stanford University, is a former U.S. secretary of Defense., Politico.com.<br />
<br />
Let's be clear: we are not saying .....preventing nuclear dangers.<br />
<br />
Fifth- CTBT ratification restores confidence in the nuclear nonproliferation regime- this is key to preventing ally proliferation<br />
Shalikashvili 01. General John M. (USA, ret.), Special Advisor to the President and the Secretary of State for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.“Letter to the President and Report on the Findings and Recommendations Concerning the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty” (Jan. 4).<br />
<br />
Once we ratify the Test Ban Treaty, .....restraint regime.<br />
<br />
Sixth- The CTBT creates a psychological barrier to proliferation in the post Cold-War era<br />

Nancy, associate director for research at the Center for Int’l and Security Studies at Maryland. “The Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty’s relevance to global security,” United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.unidir.org/pdf/" rel="nofollow">http://www.unidir.org/pdf/</a> articles/pdf-art2488.pdf /sal<br />

Many readers are probably willing ....storage activities.<br />

Nuclear terrorism risks global nuclear war<br />

<br />
What would be the consequences of a nuclear attack ....we will all be losers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 3 is Multilateralism:<br />
<br />
Multilateralism is down now- the U.S. economic crisis has turned political attention inward as international obligations are put on the back burner<br />

CTBT ratification is the best policy for renewing America’s commitment to multilateral institutions- and this cooperation spills over to other international issues<br />
Joseph 4/09. Jofi Joseph is a senior Democratic foreign policy staffer in the United States Senate, Washington Quarterly, April 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/09april/docs/09apr_Joseph.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.twq.com/09april/docs/09apr_Joseph.pdf</a> “Renew the Drive for CTBT Ratification.”<br />
<br />
First, a pledge to work toward CTBT....commitment to disarmament.<br />
<br />
<br />
Multilateral cooperation leads to the end of nuclear war, and prevents the impacts to escalating environmental destruction<br />
Dyer 04. Gwynne, &quot;The end of war,&quot; Toronto Star, LN 12/30/2004<br />
<br />
War is deeply embedded ....existing state system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Soft power is key to maintaining heg.<br />
Fried 06 (Eli, “The Soft Power of Multilateralism,” The Jerusalem Report, Oct 16, proquest)<br />
<br />
If there is one big lesson.... and unilateralist tendencies.<br />
<br />
<br />
American leadership is vital to preventing global nuclear conflicts in every region of the world—all alternatives will fail<br />
Kagan, 7—senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Robert, “End of Dreams, Return of History”, 7/19, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/end_of_dreams_return_of_histor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2007/07/end_of_dreams_return_of_histor.html</a>)<br />
<br />
This is a good thing, and it should ....will provide an easier path.<br />
<br />
U.S. leadership deters conflict and solves their impacts through democratic consolidation—collapse results in cascading great power wars—this is the worst possible form of conflict<br />
Thayer, 6 (Bradley A., Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, The National Interest, November -December, “In Defense of Primacy”, lexis)<br />
A remarkable fact about international politics ....practical hope of solving the world's ills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Withdrawal of leadership causes multiple nuclear conflicts – the US would be forced to re-intervene<br />
Lieber, 5 – Professor of Government and International Affairs at Georgetown University (Robert J., The American Era: Power and Strategy for the 21st Century, p. 53-54)<br />
<br />
Withdrawal from foreign ....few fortified enclaves.&quot;2<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, even if they win a world without hegemony would be good, we would all die in the process of getting there—transition wars would occur in the interim<br />
Posen and Ross, 97 (Barry Posen, Professor of Political Science in the Defense and Arms Control Studies Program at MIT, Andrew Ross, Professor of National Security Studies at the Naval War College, International Security, Winter 1997)<br />
<br />
The United States can, ....not directly involved.<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact’s extinction<br />
Joseph Nye, Former Dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, Bound to Lead, 1990 p. 17<br />
<br />
Some suggest that ....know it may end.<br />
<br />
<br />
CTBT ratification will lead to a flood of ratification by other nations<br />
McGrath, 2009<br />
(Kaegan, Research Associate, Monterey Institute for International Studies - James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, July 8, Battle Lines Being Drawn in the CTBT Debate: an Analysis of the Strategic Posture Commission's Arguments against U.S., <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_us_ratification.html)MKD" rel="nofollow">http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_us_ratification.html)MKD</a><br />
<br />
Although maintaining that the treaty is held up in ....means of verification.<br />

Support for provisional entry into force bolsters the legal authority of the treaty and will bring non-signatories in during the transitory stage<br />

<br />
Unlike in 1999 and 2003...UN General Assembly.<br />

U.S. support for provisional entry into force will create greater support for global CTBT ratifications<br />

With regard to amendment...are less ideological.<br />

The CTBT is fully verifiable- synergies among monitoring tech means that cheaters will get caught<br />

<br />
How Big a Problem is Evasion?<br />
While it is prudent to assume ....might not uncover.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only an unconditional ratification of the CTBT solves- anything less will turn the perception of the treaty<br />

2) And despite Obama’s spring pledge at Prague, the U.S. has yet to ratify the CTBT. The votes just aren’t there and there has been no rush to push the treaty in the status quo<br />
