 <br />
The affirmative uses the lives and deaths of thousands of persons as justification for disarmament, legitimating state control over life.<br />
Agamben, Teh_ Pwnerer, 98<br />
(Giorgio, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, 1-3)<br />
This [life according to the good] is the greatest… that it needed<br />
<br />
<br />
This is no benign attempt to protect the population. This is the tool the state uses to assert it's sovereignty, the creation of the life as political.<br />
Agamben, Teh_ Pwnerer, 98<br />
(Giorgio, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life, 5-6)<br />
<br />
Although the existence of such a line of thinking… means of an exclusion?<br />
<br />
This attempt to control and manage drives states to conflict. Triggering the impacts of the 1AC and driving states to create new wars.<br />
Agamben, The_ Pwnerer, 2002<br />
(giorgio, prof of aesthetics @ u of verona, security aand terror, theory and event 5:4, muse, trans by carolina emcke)<br />
<br />
Neither Turgot and Quesnay nor… irreconcilable with democracy<br />
<br />
The Bare Life State is ever vulnerable to extinction.<br />
Braidotti, No Date Given<br />
(Rosi, Bio-Power and Necro-Politics Reflections on an ethics of sustainability. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft_text.php?textid=1928&amp;lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.springerin.at/dyn/heft_text.php?textid=1928&amp;lang=en</a>)<br />
This has consequences for the status of social and political… unity for our community<br />

 <br />
Schizoids attempt to control their uncontrollable imaginary world by literally experiences all of their fantasy images, this creates a kill to save mindset which will bring about their impacts inevitably. The goal of the delusion is to render reality an inert object that can be easily controlled.<br />
Chernus 1991 (Ira, Nuclear Madness: Religion and Psychology in the Nuclear Age, Professor of Religious Studies, University of Colorado, SUNY Press, p. 127)<br />
The impulse to revitalization….and therefore safe<br />
<br />
<br />
The first link that we isolate is the image of the state as a savior which perpetuates violence in the name of fantasy management<br />
Chernus 1991 (Ira, Nuclear Madness: Religion and Psychology in the Nuclear Age, Professor of Religious Studies, University of Colorado, SUNY Press, p. 127-8)<br />
The two sets of nuclear fantasies…of the superpower<br />
<br />
The second link is myth of the safe bomb. Their affirmative is centered on an idea that technology can protect us which is rooted in a fantasy of invulnerable omnipotence that would allow us to control the bomb<br />
Chernus 1991 (Ira, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology in the Nuclear Age”, Professor of Religious Studies Univ of Colorado, State University of New York, p.76-77)<br />
Underlying all these beliefs…everyone knows<br />
<br />
The way of nuclearism is innately nihilistic, which has to be oppressed by the psyche. Modernity is unable to cope with the conflict of nihilism and extinction simultaneously so it aims to suppress extinction.<br />
Chernus 1991 (Ira, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology in the Nuclear Age”, Professor of Religious Studies Univ of Colorado, State University of New York, p. 256-7)<br />
Hillman’s theoretical model bids us…of no return<br />
<br />
The schizoid self created to deal with nuclear weapons lead to the ultimate fantasy of death-in life, in order to achieve freedom and security we are willing to destroy all life.<br />
Chernus 1991 (Ira, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology in the Nuclear Age”, Professor of Religious Studies Univ of Colorado, State University of New York, p.27-8)<br />
Life in the nuclear age…the ultimate solution<br />
<br />
The alternative is to embrace peace as madness<br />
Chernus 1991 (Ira, “Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology in the Nuclear Age”, Professor of Religious Studies Univ of Colorado, State University of New York, p. 278)<br />
It would be even…to lasting peace<br />
<br />
We are caught in awe of the bomb, each attempt to break free of the madness just locks tighter into the cycle of annihilation, making extinction inevitable<br />
Chernus, 1986 (Ira, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, Dr. Strangegod: On the Symbolic Meaning of Nuclear Weapons , p. )<br />
Yet the government, fostering nuclear… becomes its own solution
