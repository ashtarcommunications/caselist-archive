However, as mentioned above, the main deficiency of the NFU idea … so its pledge towards the USA would be strategically credible.<br />
<br />
Impact is global leadership – US/China military relations underpin essential cooperation in every hotspot<br />

The United States has sent ambivalent signals about this evolution … mitigated by continuing to move forward in others.<br />

The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations … draw the United States back in under unfavorable circumstances.<br />
<br />
Specifically – China refuses nuclear dialogue until the U.S. adopts NFU. This blocks cooperation to stop arms sales<br />

Continuing Chinese missile proliferation to Pakistan will … one of the most important and difficult challenges for global nonproliferation efforts.<br />
<br />
Initiating proliferation dialogue alone shores up U.S. credibility and solves the impact<br />
Sledge 1 (Nathaniel H., Lieutenant Colonel – United States Army, “Broken Promises: The United States, China, and Nuclear Nonproliferation”, US Army War College Research Project, 1-1, Lexis)<br />
If the United States does not effectively enforce its nonproliferation … to the notion that someday it will eliminate all nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Even if relations are strong – lack of NFU cuts off mutual trust and lines of communication, ensuring future accidents, miscalculation, and escalation<br />
Lewis 9 (Dr. Jeffrey, Director of the Nuclear Strategy and Nonproliferation Initiative at the New America Foundation, “Chinese Nuclear Posture and Force Modernization”, Engaging China and Russia on Nuclear Disarmament, Ed. Hansell and Potter, p. 44-46)<br />
In the United States, we tend to think about two implications that will arise … possibility of accidents, miscalculations, or misunderstandings.<br />

Crises likely and escalate rapidly – nothing checks<br />
