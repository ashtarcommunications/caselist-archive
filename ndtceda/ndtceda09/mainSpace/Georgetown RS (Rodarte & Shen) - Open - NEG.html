TEXT: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL ENGAGE IN PRIOR<br />
BINDING CONSULTATION WITH JAPAN OVER WHETHER OR NOT [INSERT PLAN].<br />
<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SUPPORT ITS PROPOSAL DURING<br />
CONSULTATION AND WILL ADOPT THE RESULT OF CONSULTATION.  WE’LL<br />
CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
AND, THE CP IS COMPETITIVE – THE FIAT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE PLAN IS<br />
UNCONDITIONAL AND IMMEDIATE.  OTHERWISE, THEY CAN SPIKE OUT OF OUR<br />
OFFENSE BY CLAIMING THE PLAN IS DELAYED OR UNENFORCED.  CONSULTATION<br />
IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BECAUSE IT CONDITIONS THE PLAN ON JAPAN’S<br />
ACCEPTANCE<br />

The arms race in Northeast Asia and the Asia Pacific threatens to<br />
overwhelm all talk of peace in the region. Northeast Asia is where<br />
four of the world's largest military forces -- those of the United<br />
States, China, Russia, and Japan, three of them leading nuclear powers<br />
-- confront each other – in addition to the two Koreas that sit<br />
astride the most dangerous flash point. Together, the countries<br />
participating in the Six-Party Talks account for approximately 65% of<br />
world military expenditures, with the United States responsible for<br />
roughly half the global total.<br />
