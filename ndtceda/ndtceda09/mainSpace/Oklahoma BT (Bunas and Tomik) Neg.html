 Focus on subjective violence and easily identifiable flashpoints of conflict misses the boat – only focusing on the background or objective violence can solve root cause – cannot be viewed from the same stand point – the call to act will be strong but responding creates a stop-gap which prevents engaging in criticisms of capital<br />
<strong>Zizek 2008</strong> Slavoj Violence p 1-4<br />
&quot;If there is a unifying...out of respect towards its victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
Capital is the root cause of all of their impacts – you should denounce their simple relationship with violence because the system of capital produces the material reality which makes violence inevitable<br />
<strong>Zizek 2008</strong> Slavoj Violence p 11-12<br />
&quot;There is an old joke...the situation of capital.&quot;<br />
<br />
Resisting this reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Zizek and Daly 2k4</span></strong> (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)<br />
&quot;For Zizek it is imperative...in an otherwise sound matrix.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to completely withdraw from the ideology of capital – this is essential to destroy the fetish that allows capital to survive <span style="font-weight: normal;"> </span><br />

 To live in the modern age is to be terrorized!<br />
The planetary reign of technology requires a new understanding of warfare altogether – modern conflict has blurred the distinction between war and peace; no longer do great powers seek an open confrontation on the battlefield. Yet violence persists, as rivalries serve only to perpetuate themselves, resulting in a technological enframing of the globe that can only ensure the continued domination of the Will over the Earth.<br />
<strong>Mitchell, '5</strong><br />
[Andrew J. Mitchell, Stanford University. “Heidegger and Terrorism.” <em>Research in Phenomenology</em> 35 (2005): 181-218. <em>myost]<br />
&quot;</em>War is oppositional in preparing...beings have become uncommon.&quot;<br />
<br />
The prospect of nuclear war, while frightening, should merely be seen as the withdrawal of Being while we subordinate existence to the sovereign human Will – this possibility itself is much more threatening than any material destruction<br />
<strong>Caputo, '93</strong><br />
<em>[John Caputo, Villanova University.</em> Demythologizing Heidegger<em>. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1993. 139-141.</em> myost]<br />
&quot;In his essay &quot;The Thing&quot;...essential, authentic, ontological destruction.&quot;<br />
<br />
The result of this eclipse of Being is a Will which reduces the world to a stable and predictable “Standing Reserve” to be called upon as it benefits the Self and refuses to value the world as anything else. This ontology represents a constant consumption which renders all beings objects—setting the tone for global warfare in the wake of the rejection of Being itself.<br />
<strong>Zimmerman, '81</strong><br />
[Michael E. Zimmerman, Tulane University. <em>Eclipse of the Self: The Development of Heidegger's Concept of Authenticity</em>. 220-224. <em>myost]<br />
&quot;</em>In 1951 Heidegger noted...the capitalist is a rational miser.&quot;<br />
<br />
The alternative is to do nothing.<br />
Don't be fooled – this isn't a question of passivity but of a releasement from the Will to Technology and an openness to the mystery of Being which transcends activity. Only such an ontological disarmament inaugurates new modes of revealing that don't depend on the world's subordination to human motivations.<br />
<strong>McWhorter, '92</strong><br />
<em>[Ladelle McWhorter, University of Richmond.</em> Heidegger and the Earth: Issues in Environmental Philosophy<em>. Kirksville, MO: Truman State University Press, 1992. 3-7.</em> myost]<br />
&quot;Heidegger's work is a call...subjective existence in our age.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ontology is fundamental—it shapes all decision-making, and starting from an ontologically-flawed position dooms action to failure<br />
<strong>Dillon, '95</strong><br />
[Michael Dillon, Professor of Politics and International Relations at Lancaster University. <em>Moral Spaces: Rethinking Ethics and World Politics</em>. Eds. David Campbell and Michael J. Shapiro. University of Minnesota Press, 1999. 96-98.]<br />
&quot;Perhaps the most important...technocrats of decision making.&quot;<br />
