Nuclear Tipped Interceptor CP 1NC<br />
<br />
CP Text: The United States federal government should build, deploy, and offer to cooperate with Russia on long range low yield nuclear tipped interceptors as a last resort missile defense option. This system should not be designed or sized against the Russia deterrent and the United States federal government should be willing to demonstrate to Russia that this is the case. The United States federal government should support the creation of regional nuclear surveillance systems. The United States federal government should &lt;inserted plan&gt; excluding the use of long range low yield nuclear tipped interceptors as a last resort missile defense option.<br />

Other CP<br />
The United States federal government should limit the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal via the removal of nuclear naval cruise missiles from the nuclear arsenal<br />
The United States federal government should increase the role and missions of the arsenal by permitting its use by Japan in lease agreements.<br />
The United States federal government should offer the government of Japan a lease of nuclear naval cruise missiles with mapping and launch authority under U.S&gt; control if Japan agrees not to develop nuclear weapons. This agreement should include a sunset clause that the weapons must be returned when the North Korean wanes.<br />

<br />
The United States Federal Government should permanently decommission _ <u>and transfer them to storage.</u><br />
<br />
Ob 1 – Theory<br />
<br />
“Reducing nuclear weapons” is a multistep process – CP is key to testing the necessity of each of those stages<br />
Perry and Scowcroft – Council on Foreign Relations, 09<br />
(Willim J. Perry (prof at Stanford) &amp; Brent Scowcroft (Forum for International Policy), U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy, Independent Task Force Report No. 62<br />
Reducing and eliminating nuclear weapons means considerably more than transferring…other devices to make them unusable in nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Ob. 2 Solvency<br />
<br />
1) Reductions aren’t credible in the squo – CP solves secrecy and sets international standard<br />
Perry and Scowcroft – Council on Foreign Relations, 09<br />
(Willim J. Perry (prof at Stanford) &amp; Brent Scowcroft (Forum for International Policy), U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy, Independent Task Force Report No. 62<br />
A proper assessment of progress on reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons…the numbers and types of weapons awaiting dismantlement.<br />
<br />
2) No Solvency deficit – verification of dismantlement is impossible and no treaty requires it<br />
Georgie Perkovich and James M. Acton – Carnegie Endowment—09<br />
Abolishing nuclear weapons: A debate, George Perkovich and James M. Acton, editors, Carnegie endowment for International Peace, www.carnegieendowment.org/…/abolishing_nuclear_weapons_debate.pdf<br />
A central aim of verification would be to ensure that states had put declared…and detailed research into how the destruction of warheads might be verified.<br />
<br />
Russian HEU<br />
<br />
1. US weapon dismantlement floods the market with uranium<br />
Bill Ridley, 08 “When is the Uranium Price Going Up?, Issue 38 Vol. 15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://uraniumseek.com/news/UraniumSeek/1224522019.php" rel="nofollow">http://uraniumseek.com/news/UraniumSeek/1224522019.php</a><br />
The (US) government has always been a huge factor in the uranium supply chain…These numbers are all out there in various publications.<br />
<br />
2. That crowds out purchases of HEU from Russia- Megatons-to-Megawatts is funded through commercial purchases<br />
Perry and Scowcroft – Council on Foreign Relations, 09<br />
(Willim J. Perry (prof at Stanford) &amp; Brent Scowcroft (Forum for International Policy), U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy, Independent Task Force Report No. 62<br />
Another successful nuclear risk reduction program is…can succeed only with buy-in from the commercial nuclear industry.<br />
<br />
3. Russia HEU downblending key to check nuclear terrorism and scientist brain drain<br />

Signed in 1993, the US-Russia…provides employment to thousands of Russian nuclear workers.<br />

<br />
4. Leaks of nuclear material and knowledge from Russia are the most likely scenario for nuclear terrorism, spark prolif, and caluse global nuclear war<br />
