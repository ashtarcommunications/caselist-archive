China would use nuclear weapons, but it’s not inevitable – Moderating the propensity for accidents and miscalc is the key internal link to preventing nuclear escalation <br />

Scenario 1 is backsliding: <br />
<br />
US strategic posture is already pushing China to abandon its NFU <br />

<span class="underline">The rise of China has generated AND </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;">to protect its vital national interests. </span><br />
<br />
US and regional responses lead to multiple scenarios for nuclear war <br />

<br />
Scenario Two is Crisis Instability: <br />
<br />
US maintenance of counterforce options against China undermines crisis stability and makes nuclear war inevitable – Only relative parity checks launch-on-warning <br />

<br />
Scenario Three is Nuclear Modernization: <br />
<br />
Counterforce is also the driver for Chinese nuclear modernization – US posture changes can reverse this trend <br />

<span class="underline"><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% yellow;">toward a tightly coupled arms race AND undermine stability in an intense crisis.</span> </span><br />

Development of survivable systems makes crisis escalation inevitable <br />

Lack of sufficient C2 supercharges our args – Chinese reliance on survivable platforms increases the risk of accidental war <br />

&quot;This is a useful conceptual innovation in US strategic thinking about counter-terrorism. It is difficult, &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;any weapon of mass destruction against non-combatants.21&quot;<br />
<br />
And NPT collapse coupled with US willingness to consider first use will crush the nuclear taboo – plan is vital to maintain the firebreak<br />

&quot;What are the future prospects for the taboo? How might it unravel? It could unravel in several ways. It &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;pressure to consider use of nuclear weapons.&quot;<br />

Strengthening anti-nuclear norms solves even if states pursue nuclear weapons for security interests<br />

Advantage 2 is accidents<br />
The future is bleak—Russian early warning systems are worse now than in the past<br />

&quot;This is not just a hypothetical problem. In 1995, Russia’s early-warning system indicated a possible &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;which case Russia may be less willing to wait before launching a counterattack.&quot;<br />

Failures in the Russian system risk accidental launch<br />

&quot;While Russia retains the ability to conduct a deliberate nuclear attack against the United States, it has &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;false alarms.&quot;<br />
<br />
False alarms lead to full scale war—Russia dead-hand makes weapons systems automated<br />

It’s not just the Russian. US early warning systems are faulty<br />

&quot;Another source of failure is human operator error. People do make mistakes, despite elaborate &quot;<br />

&quot;Both the tactical aspect and sequence of actions aimed at de-alerting strategic arms should be carefully thought through. This means &quot;<br />

 In the 1800s, Westerners arrived in Hawaii. In the tide of immigration that followed, settlers from Europe and the US undermined Native cultures and ultimately ousted the Hawaiian queen by military coup. Since then, the US military has used Hawaii as a base for hegemonic dominance and colonialism at the expense of indigenous autonomy.<br />

Everywhere you look in Hawai'i, AND messy, inefficient, lacking competence.<br />

That security is socially constructed AND than a plea for economic help.<br />

And, international relations is premised on a strategy of silence on the issue of race. This silence causes genocide, enslavement and the disappearance of the Other from view. Endorse our critical history as a means of forgetting IR.<br />

IR discourse’s valorization and fetishization of AND preserve the ideology of IR discourse.<br />
<br />
Third, “rogue” regimes such as North Korea are a created and sustained through systems of surveillance such as those used in missile defense. Surveillance is the ultimate tool to divide the rational “civilized” state from the irrational “rogue.” This new spin on an old tale justifies militarism and global intervention.<br />

Most environmentalists care deeply about peaceAND and institutions that make war inevitable.<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan: The United States federal government should dismantle all missile defense systems in Hawaii. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Our critical history uncovers social orders of militarism in Hawaii and fosters broader examinations of American narratives of war and the state. Only the affirmative can open space for counterhegemonic stories, recounting of memories and explorations of silence.<br />

Finally, missile defense is a vital hook for militarism in Hawaii. Removing missile defense and questioning our understandings of “security” are the first steps in demilitarization and creating an ethic of respect for indigenous peoples.<br />
