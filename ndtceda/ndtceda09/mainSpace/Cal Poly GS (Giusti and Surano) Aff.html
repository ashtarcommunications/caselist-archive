 There is a widespread misperception in society that the role of nuclear weapons is limited to their function in military strategy. This interpretation is insufficient, and misses the larger cultural significance of the bomb.<br />
Ambivalence characterizes this relationship. On one hand, our public officials re-assure us that the bomb is not dangerous; our weapons are safely deployed in the triad by trained professionals, or held at various secure locations throughout the United States under a stockpile curatorship program where they can be updated to help ensure “our freedom”. On the other hand, they convince us that the bomb is a necessary measure of national security imperative to keep order in the world. This is the myth of the bomb. “The Bomb” is a textual site of contestation: the politics of signification have vested the bomb with extreme ambivalence. Gabrielle Hecht writes in 2006,<br />
Hecht 06<br />
(Hecht, Gabrielle. “Nuclear Ontologies.” Constellations 13.3 (2006): 321/329) <br />
The Niger uranium ... exceptionalism remain high. (329)<br />
This myth relies on the politics of fear to crowd out more nuanced discourses of security. The Bush administration labeled liberals, feminists, radicals etc., that they suffered from a psychosis that we need to be shocked out of.<br />
The role the bomb plays is much simpler but much more eminent than that. The bomb today serves to enable a transfer of government functions from the public sector to the private sector like blackwater. This grand narrative that public officials have used to outsource the responsibility and oversight of public institutions to those in private industry giving birth to the military industrial complex.<br />

 September 11th, 2001 fundamentally changed the relationship between defense corporations and the government; the government no longer had to ask permission to privatize, deregulate, and cut social spending, they just do so. in the interest of corporate well subverting what was once their social responsibility to the public good, Naomi Klein writes in 2007,<br />

Disaster capitalism is used by corporations to create opportunities that increase probability or even create a crisis they can economically benefit from. While in a stage of shock, people are taken advantage of which in a state of shock enabled in the name of corporate wealth. Klein continues,<br />

This privatization in our government is so perverse, that the Department of Energy now spends 94% of its budget on financing defense contractors such as Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Halliburton, and Bechtel Corporation, all of whom profit from the designing manufacturing of military technology and/or the reconstruction efforts that occur after wars or disaster. It’s no longer clear if the small amount of federal involvement in the DOE is enough to manage the contractors, or simply facilitate their work and fill their pockets. Damon Hill and Grey Mello from the Los Alamos Study Group write in 2006,<br />

The DOE, present-day landlord of the U.S. ...important distinction.<br />
<br />
And, this privatization has occurred at the heart of the nuclear weapons complex, The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory, encouraging even less transparency and more lobbying. Robinson of the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation writes in 2008,<br />

Now the national laboratories are managed by the same corporations responsible for disaster capitalism in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina, Hill and Mello continue,<br />

And this privatization creates a greater structural imperative for war and military expansionism enabled through neoliberal doctrine, Robinson continues<br />

The privatization of ... regarding these issues.<br />
We don’t know which specific crisis the limited liability partnerships are planning next, but if history is any indication, we should be more than skeptical of their managing of the nuclear weapons complex without regulation. Neoliberal economics have been behind most of the major conflicts in the past 35 years. Naomi Klien continues,<br />

 The methodology of curatorship will increase public safety, and prevent the modification of weapons under the guise of “life-extension” programs. Christopher Paine of the National Resources Defense council writes in 2009,<br />

Our methodology is called “Curatorship ... examined and tested each year.<br />
And, the unmasking of the bomb as a tool of corporate greed is what allows us to become engaged citizens and actively challenge the military industrial complex.<br />

 As engineers at the California Polytechnic State University, living in the belly of the beast and spending our professional lives working in defense industry, Donna Haraway’s image of the cyborg informs our politics might function to create a more livable world. This evidence works to frame our understanding of the need to examine our inevitable collusion with the many forces collude to produce nuclear politics.<br />
