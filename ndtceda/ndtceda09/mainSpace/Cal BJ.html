Derrida K <br />
The 1Ac invokes a flase model of agency. They are not technostrategic experts, and the attempt to try and pretend that they are is automatically short circuited by our incompetence borne our of being bracketed out of those spheres of decisionmaking. Refusing the logistical mode of decision making and celebrating our incompetence is critical ot reinvigorate agency in a way that can affirm the democracy – to- come, one which is imminently undecidable and cannot be presenced into a knowable future. This is crucial to positing ourselves as agents of responsibility – and avoid the inifinite replication of their impacts and technical violence<br />
Manfield 2006 “refusing defeatism” social semiotics, vol 16 issue 3<br />
“We are never not living this …pankicky defeatist intolerance.”<br />
<br />
Second their attempt to grandstand on political decision making is the ultimate evasion of aporia. Aporia is inevitable because our future is always uncertain, and the aff’s attempt to prescribe a moment of universal truth in the space of the law, as subject to a calculated program or schema, can never be ethical. This move evacuates decision of its ethical potential <br />
Thurschwell, 2001 Law/Text/Culture<br />
Derrida addresses the consequences… guide this decision<br />
<br />
Creating a framework of decidability converts messianic potential into messianism. While the messianic locates hope in an unseeable future which is always to come but yet always still out of grasp, the aff’s messianism treats that future as one which is plannable, knowable, and foreseeable. This logic of decisionmaking lies at the base of the most horrid forms of historical atrocity<br />
Caputo 1997 Deconstruction in a nutshell, pg 156- 164<br />
“It is clear to anyone with a Jewish ear… chosen people”<br />
<br />
Our argument engages their understanding of decision as the result of calculated role following. Our alternative justification of the ballot locates ethical justification as always to come and thus affirms a radical openness to otherness<br />
<br />
Our alternative competes by K-ing hteir decision to link the justification of the plan to a claim to knowledge, theory or rule. By repositioning ethics at the intersection of urgency and undecidability our leap of faith create an ethical foundation for international politics<br />
Zlomislic 2005 Conflict Tolerance and Hospitality online<br />
THe power or authoritative method of resolution reveals…beyond the confines of conflict”<br />
<br />
Finally as a matter of decision making, you should ground your choices in responsibility only the alternative’ intervention into madness can fulfill the ethical potential of politics. The affirmative is anti-ethical and irresponsible to the core<br />
Derrida, gift of death 1995<br />
“TO subordinate responsibility to the… for freedom and for decisions”<br />

<u>Clarification K</u><br />
In Legal debates, to clarify means to make text intelligible and free from ambiguity – in the context of the affirmative, this takes the form of their using speech to make clear the meaning of their plan text.<br />
C.J Padgett, Hawaii Supreme Court, 5/14/1992<br />
“The language of the original… does not fit with the literal.”<br />
<br />
Their elevatio fo speech over written words of the plan is mired in a violent metaphysics – this approach is unethical and must be put into question.<br />
Erica Burman, Research Methods in the Social Sciences, p.285-286, 2005<br />
“One of Derrida’s… responsibility is demanded.”<br />
<br />
It is logocentric to impose violent consistency on the world which is at the root of all porms of the eclustion – our act of deconstruction is key to dismantle hierachal ordering<br />
Mark Lilla, “The politics of Jacques Derrida,” 1998<br />
“Deconstruction was conceived… have to be forsworn.”<br />
<br />
In context of our criticism of the metaphyisc we present the following cp &lt;insert cp w/o “we’ll clarify&gt;<br />
Only the CP solves given the current political climate – we must challenge the uncritical championing of clarity which has allowed take over of the political sphere.<br />
Jonathan Sterne, 2004<br />
“Deconstruction did not lead… than the obfuscators.”<br />
<br />
An our integration of deconstruciton into legal debates solves the aff better – the metaphysic of presence actively informs hwo we read the law and thus it is at the level of text that we mucst confront it.<br />
J.M Balkin, deconstructive practice and legal theory, 1998<br />
“The purpose of… our legal system.”<br />

 <strong>State K</strong><br />
The nulear state makes extinction inevitable—while the aff may begin to challenge the bomb, it is the societal structure which gives rise to it which will ensure the destruction of humanity—voting negative is an essential act of refusal which can begin with the process of forming relationships outside of this genocidal and suicidial mentality<br />
Kovel 84 (Joel, Psychotherapist and activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 25-29)<br />
Consider her dilemma and see how relevant it is to….and call it by its right name, that of terrorization<br />
