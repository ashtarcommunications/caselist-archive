 <strong>When these weapons are decommissioned, they are dismantled, leaving tons of nuclear waste to be disposed of. But what to do with all of this waste? The government will store it of course, and where else but in rural areas! Rural America is the heartland for nuclear waste dumps for many reasons, including high levels of low class citizens, a small population, and a great deal of open land. Out of sight out of mind right? WRONG, this very thought further perpetuates ruralism, a silent form of discrimination that allows too many innocent Americans to die every year.</strong><br />
<strong>Disarmament leads to dismantling. Scientist cannot guarantee the waste from these weapons will be 100% safe in any long-term storage. Burial in rural areas is the most feasible, mostly to those that do not have to suffer with it in their own backyards.</strong><br />
<strong>Plaut 93</strong><br />
Dangerous disposal. (disposal of nuclear weapons) Science World | December 3, 1993| Plaut, Josh<br />
<br />
<strong>The aff’s reduction of the US nuclear arsenal is ruralist. If the plan is passed, the waste from the nuclear weapons that are decommissioned will be disposed of in rural America. There is no guarantee that citizens are compleltley safe from the harms from the nuclear waste.</strong><br />

<strong>Ruralism is further perpetuated by the nuclear policies set forth by individual states. In order to combat ruralist practices, we must begin with recognition of ruralism as a phenomena. This unique form of discrimination has gone overlooked for years, and recognition of the numerous disadvantages of rural dwellers is long overdue.</strong><br />

<strong>THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO ABANDON OUR BELIEF IN NEOLIBERAL MARKET IDEOLOGIES. THIS IS THE ONLY JUSTIFICATION RURAL DWELLERS HAVE FOR NUCLEAR WASTE SITES BEING LOCATED IN RURAL AMERICA. NEOLIBERALISM FAILS TO DISCLOSE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THESE WASTE SITES. INSTEAD, IT DISTORTS THE REALITIES OF THESE NUCLEAR GRAVEYARDS TO MAKE THE PLANTS SEEM AS A STIMULATOR FOR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, WHEN THEY REALLY DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD.</strong><br />
