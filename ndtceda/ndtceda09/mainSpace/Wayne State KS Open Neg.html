Link- the era of post politics radically depoliticizes the economy- this can never obtain the dimensions of universality because it precludes acts of authentic politics- we must establish a radical strategy that re-politicizes the economy in order to break free form the chains of global capitalism- vote negative to disturb the fantasy of the depoliticzed economy and engage in an authentic act of politics<br />
Zizek 1999 (The Ticklish Subject pg 352-355) what one should bear in mind…its fundamental fantasy<br />
The impact- it is not possible to solve any situation without solving them all- only a criticsm which attacks the univesial of capitalism can solve their impacts and the inevitable destruction of the earth and its people<br />
Zizek 1989 (The Sublime Object of Ideology pg 3-4) it is upon the unity of these two… rationally governed society<br />
Our alternative is to completely withdraw from the ideology of capital- this is essential to destroy the fetish that allows capital to survive-<br />
Johnston, 2004 (Adrian, Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society, December v9 i3 pg 259) perhaps the absence of a detailed… I choose fetishism<br />
Your politics is merely an ethics of talking- because you are merely creating a space for the multiplicities of identities and narratives that are all a) all preconditioned by the democratic order and B) complicit in the domination of capital<br />
Zizek 2001 (Repeating Lenin www.lacan.com/replenin) to put it briefly the east… remain neutral twards it<br />
The concept of fluid identity is only conceivable against the backdrop of capitalist globalization this system appeases sub groups in order to calculate and control their existence- this cycle of deterriorialzation and reterritorilization creates the preconditions that made Nazism possible- we must re-asser the dimension of the universial against capitalist globalization<br />
Zizek, 1999 (the ticklish subject pg 209-211) here however one must… to the roman global empire<br />
The particular narratives are not important- what is important is the universial dimension that the stories exist in. this dimension is global capitalism<br />
Zizek 2002 (I am a fighting atheist: interview with slavoj zizek, Bad Subjects Issue #59, Fe 2002) my opponent here is widely… this universial dimension<br />
