We do this in the name of fundamentally restructuring society through a campaign of violent insurgency following the footsteps of French revolutionaries that chopped the kings heads off because people were starving And south African violent revolutionaries whose continual application of strategic violence was the MAIN reason the apartheid regime was FORCE to freed Mandela.<br />

The political strategy forces us to focus on power from above which makes it epistemologically impossible for us to understand the world outside the terms defined by those who exercise power over people. Not only does this ensure domination it disempowers us politically by rendering us alienated academic spectators whose purported &quot;neutrality&quot; serves as an alibi for never engaging in solidarity with social movements from below, destroying all potential for transformative politics.<br />

Finally - Our framework is the judge should endorse who ever best performs a ruptures of systemtic violence caused by white supremacy. We argue the best way to view this is through the lens of performativity. Our integration of the voices of the Black Panthers represents a argumentive practices that steams from a pedagogy of radical dis-identification with the topic and its imperial project. Dis-identification is a performative practice that allows people to insert radical black subjectivities like embracing the apocalypse visions that destroy whiteness<br />

 They basically read their affirmative plus a movie about how black panther mothers hold their babies in one hand and a gun in the other and read a poem of similar effect. They claimed that this proved the possibility of an alternative model for parenthood.<br />
