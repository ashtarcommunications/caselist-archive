De-alerting could also strengthen crisis AND to alleviate this danger.<br />

We’ll isolate several internal links to escalation<br />
First – Nuclear signaling - Surging alert levels uniquely lead to miscalculations during crises that cause rapid escalatory nuclear conflicts<br />
Stephen J. Cimbala (professor of political science at Penn State University) 1999 “Nuclear Crisis Management and Information Warfare” Parameters<br />
Crisis management, including AND of the other's beliefs about what the first side will do.[21]<br />
<br />
Second – command authority - Rapid escalation in alert levels causes decentralized command authority – makes uncontrollable escalation inevitable<br />
Scott Sagan (professor of political science and co-director of Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation) 1990 “Nuclear Alerts and Crisis Management” in “Nuclear diplomacy and crisis management: an International security reader” p. 191-3<br />
A “NO-ALERTS” POLICY? It would AND steps might lead to uncontrolled escalation.<br />
<br />
No offense – signal of resolve is drowned out by domestic political backlash – compounds mixed signal – independently collapses the economy<br />

History bears out that AND for many decades<br />
<br />
Plan leads to strict international norms against nuclear alert that solves crisis instability and escalation – re-alerting post-plan either won’t happen or will be stable – key to prevent global nuclear war<br />
