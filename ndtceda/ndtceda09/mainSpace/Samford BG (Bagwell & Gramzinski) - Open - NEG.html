Anti Depleted Uranium activists exaggerate the effects and falsely claim it is an act of genocide:<br />

<br />
At the other extreme of the debate, some anti-DU activists, …. stirred public concern and spurred very limited political action.<br />

<br />
<br />
Turn: Blaming—focusing on the use of Depleted Uranium by the United States obscures the proliferation and use of Depleted Uranium by Russia, Pakistan, and other governments:<br />

<br />
In addition, the focus on the use of DU weapons by the US …. instruments of genocide decried by hyperbolic anti-DU activists.<br />
<br />
Use of DU not a genocide: there’s no evidence it has caused serious bodily harm, and no evidence it was used with the intent to destroy a given ethnic population of people:<br />

 <h2 id="toc20"><a name="Pre-Shirley Disclosure Information-Topicality: “Role/Missions” Violation Shell (1/2)"></a>Topicality: “Role/Missions” Violation Shell (1/2)</h2>
 A) Negative Interpretation: Roles are the purposes assigned to nuclear forces--all deal with using weapons to deter acts of aggression—our interpretation is the plan text must specify a deterrence role for nuclear weapons which the plan reduces: U.S. Defense and Energy Departments, 2008 National Security and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century, September, http: www.defenselink.mil/news/nuclearweaponspolicy.pdf, pp. 3-4 Within this more flexible portfolio...endanger international order.<br />
(--) The missions of the arsenal are to deter nuclear, conventional, and WMD attacks: Kathleen Bailey, 2007 ((Dr. Kathlenn C. Bailey et al., Senior Associate, NIPP and member, USDS International Security Advisory Board, WHITE PAPER ON THE NECESSITY OF THE U.S. NUCLEAR DETERRENT, National Institute for Public Policy, August 15, 2007, p.1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nipp.org/Adobe/Deterrence%20Paper%20-%20version%202.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://nipp.org/Adobe/Deterrence%20Paper%20-%20version%202.pdf</a>, accessed 5-25-09.) During the Cold War...employ other weapons of mass destruction (WMD).<br />
B) The Violation: The plan text doesn’t reduce a deterrence based function of our nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
C) Standards: 1) Limits: The AFF opens the door to changing elements of nuclear weapons without changing their fundamental role—examples include painting nuclear weapons a different color or changing where they are located. 2) Disad ground: Their interpretation allows for AFF’s that duck core negative ground like deterrence based disads. 3) Field context: Our evidence comes from the Department of Defense and Department of Energy: this is how the US federal government defines the role of nuclear weapons.<br />
D) Voting Issue: Fairness, Education, and Ground.<br />
<br />
Restrict = Congress Only<br />
A) Negative Interpretation: In the context of nuclear weapons policy, restrict means binding legislation against the President—this is distinct from executive action which “refrains” from taking an action: Philip Anderson et al, 2007 (Nobel Laureate in Physics, one of 22 nuclear physicists who co-wrote this letter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=4743" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=4743</a>) As physicists, members of the profession...refrain from considering nuclear weapons use against non-nuclear adversaries.<br />
B) Violation: The plan doesn’t use binding legislation from Congress.<br />
C) Standards: 1) Predictable Ground: The topic is potentially huge—the negative interpretation allows for the neg to have the predictable ground of binding legislation from the Congress.<br />
2) Field Contextual Evidence: Our evidence is from a group of physicists calling for action on nuclear weapons—better than mere dictionary definitions of restrict which de-contextualize the term.<br />
D) Voting Issue: Fairness, Education, and Ground<br />

Health Care Politics Disad<br />
A – Uniqueness: Health Care Reform Will Pass Now: Obama’s political capital is key to this effort: Norman J. Ornstein, 9-1-2009 American Enterprise Institute, Washington Post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/31/AR2009083102913.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/31/AR2009083102913.html</a> While health reform is far from a done deal...The odds have been improved, not damaged, by the president's approach.<br />
B) The plan saps Obama’s political capital Deep cuts to the size &amp; shape of the arsenal will trigger intense opposition from powerful constituencies—putting health care at risk: THOM SHANKER &amp; LANDLER, 9/8/2009 (staff writers, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/world/09arms.html?_r=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/world/09arms.html?_r=1</a>) With the clock ticking on a year-end deadline...overhaul the health care system and address global climate change.<br />
C) Impacts 1) The triggered public option will cause cost controls and solve the health care crisis: Collier, 9-8-09 Roger, CEO of a national health care consulting firm, Health Care Blog, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thehealthcareblog.com/the_health_care_blog/2009/09/happy-trails-trigger.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehealthcareblog.com/the_health_care_blog/2009/09/happy-trails-trigger.html</a> However, any trigger is probably better...below the projections of CMS actuaries.<br />
2) Controlling health care costs key to the economy: Business Week 2008 (“Want Real Stimulus? Try Universal Health Care,” 12-8, p. lexis America’s economy is buckling...economic growth in the coming years.<br />
D) Economic collapse causes global nuclear war Mead, 09 Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations (Walter Russell, The New Republic, “Only Makes You Stronger”, 2/4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&amp;p=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=571cbbb9-2887-4d81-8542-92e83915f5f8&amp;p=2</a>) If current market turmoil...we may still have to fight.<br />
<h2 id="toc22"> </h2>
 <h2 id="toc23"><a name="Pre-Shirley Disclosure Information-Counterplans"></a>Counterplans</h2>
 Diversity Forums Counterplan: Our counter advocacy is that [essentially we discuss the affirmative advocacy in non-competitive diversity forums instead of the debate round]. Discussion forums solve best- we should encourage community-wide forums to discuss their advocacy Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”] Interjecting the personalized into debate rounds... however, are, in my opinion, enormous.<br />
Three net benefits- 1. Alliance splitting- personalizing debate risks splitting alliances and fracturing solutions, causing backlash and resistance: Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”] The purpose of this essay...wrought with frustrations, anxiety, resistance and backlash.<br />
2. Structural solutions- personalized debating blocks structural solutions- our counter advocacy solves better Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”] To be sure, many have embraced...structural problems within the debate community.<br />
3. Debate rounds are bad forums- lack of time, moving advocacy target, and they deflect from community-wide discussions- turns the case Zompetti ’04 [Joe, Assistant Professor, School of Communication, Illinois State University, “Contemporary Argumentation and Debate”] The second major problem with this turn...such as resource disparity.<br />
&quot;Pictures&quot; Counterplan: We create a text with pictures only (example we put up a picture of a nuclear weapon with an X through it).<br />
Reliance upon the phonetic alphabet destabilizes the balance of human mental evolution, creating a destructive trend toward masculine values that subliminally reprograms the user. Shlain 98 Dr. Leonard Shlain is a neurosurgeon at California-Pacific Medical Center and contributor to The Encyclopedia of Creativity, The Alphabet, Versus The Godess: The Conflict Between Word and Image, 1998, pg. 66-8 Aside from the obvious benefits…by the left brain within each individual. Left-brain rational functions denigrate natural relationships, risking planetary extinction.<br />
Only re-balancing our mental spheres can revitalize connections to the earth. Reuther, 1989 Rosemary, Radford, Professor of Feminist Theology at Pacific School of Religion, “Toward an Ecological-Feminist Theology of Nature” in Healing the Wounds: the Promist of Ecofeminism ed. Judith Plant. P. 147-150 Thus we have not so much the prolidge…livable and sustainable cosmos.<br />
Imagining and privileging the counterplan through images cuts through left brain dominance and enables a fully integrated psyche. Shlain, 1998 Dr. Leonard, neurosurgeon at California-Pacific Medical Center and contributor to The Encyclopedia of Creativity, The Alphabet Versus The Goddess: The Conflict Between Word and Image, 1998, pg. 4-5 To observe an enthralled four-year-old mastering the letters of the alphabet…comprehension of written words emerges in a one-at-a-time fashion<br />
Nuclear Things CP/Kritik<br />
A) Banning the bomb will fail unless you disavow the language that authenticates the bomb’s power: Brien Hallett and Ralph Summy, 2003 (PEACE &amp; CHANGE / April 2003, accessed via Ebsco, Detooling The Language of the Master’s House: The Case of Those “Nuclear Things”) The tool of language helps to shape...nuclear power can be challenged radically.<br />

The United States federal government should:<br />
Provide funding to implement a poppy licensing program in Afghanistan<br />
Provide $5 billion in funding to expand the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program<br />
The US Congress should express its view that the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism be broadened to: encompass the development and implementation of effective international nuclear security and accounting standards for both civilian and military nuclear materials and facilities as well as for nuclear weapons<br />
The USFG should leave non strategic nuclear weapons in Europe and not cut nuclear weapon arsenal size<br />
