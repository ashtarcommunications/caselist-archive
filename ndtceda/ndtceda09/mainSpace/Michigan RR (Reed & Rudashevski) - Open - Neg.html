<strong><u>Risk Assessment Kritiq</u></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A. </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sub-point framework</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Human brains can be used for many things but in this debate they must be used as calculating machines which need to process information about the world and then produce a result that determines who wins or loses the debate</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The problem is that the affirmative has assumed that human brains are perfect calculating machines, capable of objectively performing calculations over the likelihood of the extinction of the entire human species, when the truth is that most humans lack even the basic cognitive capability to understand what the death of over six billion people truly means</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our framework for the debate is information-utility: the value of the calculation performed should come before the information that is calculated. This is the only way that we can challenge our limited scope to truly make calculations for the near-infinite future potential of the human race </span></strong><br />

<br />
To sum up: <strong><u>Information ...</u></strong><strong><u><span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow',sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"> </span>this is outright surrender.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The most pervasive fallacy engendered by this normative structure of impact calculus is the ‘conjunction fallacy’ where debaters are taught to tell specific impact scenarios that SEEM more likely to happen and therefore are better able to persuade judges. This isn’t just debaters faults, experts commit this fallacy all the time, resulting in skewed and inaccurate assessments of future threats. The fact of the matter is that logically, EVERY DETAIL ADDED TO A SCENARIO MAKES IT A PRIORI LESS LIKELY </span></strong><br />

<strong>The conjunction fallacy</strong> ....<strong><u>respond to <em>any</em> disaster</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This logically bankrupt structure of conjunctive impact calculus is paradoxically insulated from criticism BY the bias in FAVOR of skepticism within the debate community to begin with. The affirmative’s attempt to calculate risk AGAINST principles that are logically TRUE BY DEFINITION means that the impact education they provide in this debate round ONLY makes us less equipped to become future policy-makers when we’ll have to actually address real-world threats </span></strong><br />
