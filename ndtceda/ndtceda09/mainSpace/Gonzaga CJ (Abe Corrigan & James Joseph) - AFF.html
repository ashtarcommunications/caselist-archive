Utopian technology is that technology which has fallen from grace. It has been stripped of its purity and reendowed with utility. The fall is necessitated by a return to contact with humanity. Having once left the production table, the technology that lives the godly life of state-of- the-art uselessness has no further interaction with humans as users or as inventors; rather, humans serve only as a means to maintain its uselessness. The location of the most complex pure technology is of no mystery. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Deep in the core of the war machine is the missile system</span></u></strong>. Ultimately, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">all research is centered around this invisible monument to uselessness.

This idol of destruction is forever hungry, and is willing to eat all</span> resources. In return</u></strong>, however, <strong><u>it excretes objects of utility</u></strong>. Consumer communications and transportation systems, for example, have dramatically improved due to the continuous research aimed at increasing the grandeur of the apparatus of uselessness.<br />
There can be a stopping point to this process - a discovery made by the collapsing Soviet Union. For all the 'patriots of democracy' who gave a collective sigh of relief and boasted that they were at last proven right - &quot;communism doesn't work&quot; - there still may be a need to worry. The fall of the USSR had little to do with ideology. The US and USSR were competitors in producing the best apparatus of uselessness in order to prove its own respective Hegelian mastery of the globe. Modern autocrats and oligarchs have long known that a standing army puts an undue strain on the economy. To be sure, standing armies were early monuments to uselessness, but in terms of both size and cost, they are dwarfed by the standing missile system of the electronic age. As with all things that are useless, there will be no return on the investment in it. The useless represents a 100% loss of capital. Although such investment seems to go against the utilitarian grain of visible bourgeois culture, whether in socialist or in constitutional republics, the compulsive desire for a useless master is much greater (Japan is an interesting exception to this rule). Unfortunately for the USSR, they were unable to indulge in pure excess expenditure at the same rate as the US. The soviet techno-idol was a little more constipated, and could not maintain the needed rate of excretion. Consequently, once the limits of uselessness were reached, that system imploded.<br />
The US government, on the other hand, has to this day remained convinced that further progress can be made. Reagan and his Star Wars campaign issued a policy radically expanding the useless. Reagan, of course, was the perfect one to make the policy, since he was an idol to uselessness himself. He represents one of the few times that uselessness has taken an organic form in this century. (This is part of the reason he was considered such a bourgeois hero. He was willing to personally plunge into uselessness without apology. He did not let a thing stand in for him). Playing on yuppie paranoia (the fascists' friend), Reagan convinced the public loyal to him that a defensive monument (Star Wars) to uselessness was needed, just in case the offensive monument (the missile system) was not enough. He was successful enough in his plea to guarantee that years of useless research will ensue that no one will be able to stop, even if his original monumental vision (a net of laser armed satellites) should be erased. In this manner, Reagan made sure that the apparatus of uselessness would expand even if the cold war ended.<br />
Indeed, this situation has come to pass. Currently, the US has no competitors in the race to uselessness, but the monument continues to be maintained and even to grow, which is particularly odd, since even the cynical argument of deterrence is now moot. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Even though</span> the offensive monument to uselessness seems to be shrinking - <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">missiles are being defused and cut apart with the care and order of high ritual</span>, and technology costing millions of dollars is being laid to rest, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">having never done anything but exist</span></u></strong> - thanks to Reagan's farsightedness, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the general system continues to expand</span></u></strong>. Although many are still in denial, the desire of the bourgeois to subordinate themselves to the useless has become, for the moment, glaringly visible. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The research is done; the system is upgraded, but for what reason</span></u></strong>? The missiles are now aimed at the ocean, so that even if they are 'used,' they will still be useless. The fragments of Star Wars technology have not been released in pure form from the experimental labs, and even if they were, no enemy exists against which Star Wars technology would protect US citizens. The American system has achieved utter transcendental uselessness. This techno-historical moment is the highest manifestation of technological purity.<br />
In his rush to save the apparatus of the useless from stalling, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Reagan may have</span></u></strong> made one error. When he put the idea of the defensive monument in the minds of Americans, he <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">disrupted</span></u></strong>the primary sign of the war machine - <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">mutually assured destruction</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. <strong><u>He restored hope in American consciousness that perhaps utility could save US citizens from the total annihilation certain to destroy the rest of the world</u></strong>. <strong><u>The disassociation of death and uselessness took previously sacred elements of war-tech out of the privileged realm</u></strong></span>. When these elements became depurified, their value in terms of the satisfaction of bourgeois desire plummeted. This is partly why Reagan's original Star Wars vision has been dismantled.<br />
Thus far, however, most war-tech has not been depurified due to this ideological slippage, and the purity of offensive weapons of mass destruction continues to be enforced. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Nations that do not understand the code of uselessness but that have state-of-the-art military technology are a cause for great concern</span></u></strong>. Iraq, Libya, and North Korea are all good examples. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The US government is willing to take hostile action based merely on the belief that North Korea and Libya might get weapons</span></u></strong> of mass destruction and actually use them. In the case of Iraq, the code was actually broken when that government used chemical weapons. Iraq has not done well economically or militarily since that time. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The lesson</span></u></strong> to be learned is <strong><u>that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">nations that do not subordinate</span> themselves <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to the</span> bourgeois <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">idols of uselessness will be sacrificed as heretics, and</span> will be <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">denied access to the icons of uselessness</span></u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In spite of the</span> common <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">wisdom of using</span></u></strong> the variables of <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">national interest</span></u></strong> and utility <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to explain the relationship between desire and power, it is just as fruitful to do so using the principles of the anti-economy-perversity and uselessness</span></u></strong>. The economy of unchanneled desire and perversity, as suggested by Bataille, penetrates the surface of utility in a most convincing way. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Progress in the 20th century has primarily consisted of bourgeois culture looking for a new master</span>.

All things must be subordinated to neutrality - to uselessness. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">On</span>e major difference between the age of the virtual and more primitive times is that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the contemporary idols have no metaphysical referent</span></u></strong>.

As this mythic narrative continues to play itself out, the suggestion of Arthur and Marilouise Kroker begins to make more and more sense. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We are</span> not <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">witnessing </span>the decline of late <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">capital</span>, but</u></strong> instead, <strong><u>its <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">recline into its own delirious death trance</span></u></strong>.<br />

These distinctions will perhaps seem idle. But I can at this point explain myself. What struck me on first reading <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Hiroshima</span></u></strong> was that, if I had not had any other reason, the isolated view of horror would have <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">left me</span></u></strong>, as it were, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">indifferent</span></u></strong>. If, however, I read in anguish, feeling in contact with the most oppressive reality, it was because I knew: right away I related all the banal reactions to the consciousness of the possibilities opened up by the manufacture of atomic bombs. I understood then that the annual death of fifty million human beings had no humane meaning. (We cannot, indeed, avoid it—and if we could, we should soon see that we should have done nothing, that the resulting misfortunes would be more serious than a thousand Hiroshimas, since numberless death is necessary for the uninterrupted renewal of life.) But the <strong><u>death</u></strong> of sixty thousand <strong><u>is charged with meaning</u></strong>, <strong><u>in that it depended on their fellow</u></strong> men <strong><u>to kill them or to let them live</u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The</span> atom <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">bomb draws</span> its <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">meaning from its human origin</span></u></strong>: it is the possibility that the hands of man deliberately hang suspended over the future. And it is a means of action: <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the fear produced by a tidal wave or a volcano has no meaning</span></u></strong>, since <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">neither</span></u></strong> of them <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">makes one afraid in order to compel surrender</span>; <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">whereas uranium fission is a project whose goal is to impose, by fear, the will of the one who provokes it</span></u></strong>. At the same time <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it puts an end to the projects of those whom it strikes</span>. It is <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by representing possible projects</span></u></strong>, which in turn are intended to make other projects impossible, <strong><u>that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">an atom bomb takes on a human meaning</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Otherwise, it would merely have the</span> animal <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">meaning of smoking out termites</span></u></strong>.<br />
If we continue with John Hersey’s narrative, the disproportion of the effect [of the bomb to the mind’s habitual standards] soon brings us back into the depths of the termites’ nest. Those who were its witnesses, enduring the effect without dying, no longer had the strength necessary to form an intelligible representation of their misfortune: they submitted to it as the termite submits to the unintelligible destruction of its nest. At first, they could not distinguish this effect from those of ordinary bombs; then, it seems, they perceived the immensity of the disaster, but without, for all that, escaping from their inhuman daze. This very human vertigo caused by the idea of catastrophe, which supposes at least the sort of proximity created by the sensory imagination, probably also supposes a minimum of distance. The horror reached the point where reflection—which requires sustaining not only concern, but beyond concern, that hope which is its foundation—could only exert itself weakly. Brief passages cannot replace reading the whole book, with the multiplication of details, monstrous and minute. [There are, for instance,] mixed in with the dead, the ten thousand wounded, bleeding, vomiting, and dying, overflowing the stairwells, the hallways and the courtyards of a hospital, and cared for by six doctors…but that is the simplest image of calamity. Mr. Tanimoto, running through the ruins in search of his wife and his church, is represented to us as the only one uninjured among the hundreds and hundreds of wounded that he meets along the way: “The eyebrows of some were burned off and skin hung from their faces and hands. Others, because of pain, held their arms up as if carrying something in both hands. Some were vomiting as they walked. Many were naked or in shreds of clothing….Many, although injured themselves, supported relatives who were worse off. Almost all had their heads bowed, looked straight ahead, were silent, and showed no expression whatever” (my emphasis [38-39]). A little farther, Mr. Tanimoto discovered, lying on the bank of a river, some wounded who were too weak to move when the tide rose; he endeavored to save them: “He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glove-like pieces. He was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a moment.” With the help of a boat, he succeeded, with great difficulty, in lifting the bodies onto a higher part of the bank. Nevertheless, by the next day, the tide had washed them away. I do not cite this fact for the horror of such useless courage, but for a sentence that completes the account: “He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, ‘These are human beings’” (my emphasis [59]). What emerges from the entirety of the account is that whatever humanity was maintained by these unfortunate people of Hiroshima, had to be painfully kept up against a background of animal stupor.<br />
At first sight one imagines that the intelligible representations of the catastrophe whose return we must dread lack the emotive elements provided by sensory representations, and in the absence of which reflection has no effect (since it is not followed by the necessary intense reactions). But one quickly realizes that the appeal to feeling is of negligible interest. Undoubtedly, it is even at the expense of effectiveness that feeling enriches the sentimentality of those who are depressed, since the result of reflection is either a virile attitude or none at all. If, besides, as is human, we reject sentimentality and go resolutely to the limits of the possibilities of feeling, we find only the infinite “absurd” of animal suffering. And in the meaningless world into which our reflection draws us, a cataclysm is limited to the instant it takes place—and its representations exceeds any concern for subsequent consequences. So much so that feeling cannot be the point of departure for action. And one can say with certainty that the most vivid imagination can place only a negligible force at the service of those who wish to ward off the return of misfortune. The sensibility that goes to the furthest limits moves away from politics and, as is the case for the suffering animal, the world has at a certain point nothing more to it than an immense absurdity, closed in on itself. But the sensibility that looks for a way out and enters along the path of politics is always of cheap quality. It cheats, and it is clear that in serving political ends it is no more than a servile, or at least subordinated sensibility. The cheating is quite apparent. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If the misfortune of Hiroshima are faced up to freely from the perspective of a sensibility that is not faked, they cannot be isolated from other misfortunes. The</span></u></strong> tens of thousands of <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">victims of the atom bomb are on the same level as the tens of millions whom nature yearly hands over to death</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">One cannot deny the differences in age and in suffering, but origin and intensity change nothing: horror is everywhere the same</span></u></strong>. The point that, in principle, the one horror is preventable while the other is not is, in the last analysis, a matter of indifference. The standpoint of sovereign sensibility, which has nothing to do with sentimentality, or even with pity—which are equivocal—seems to me to have been represented perfectly by Malraux, when he asked the communists: “<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">At this moment</span></u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">what do you do about the man run over by a train</span></u></strong>?” Malraux was wrong to confront the communist with this difficulty, since they openly subordinate sensibility to reason. But the objection would be valid if addressed to those who think that they obey their sentiments.<br />
<strong><u>In truth</u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if one singles out Hiroshima for lamentation, it is because one does not dare to look misfortune in the face</span></u></strong>—<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">misfortune’s profound nonsense</span></u></strong>, which <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is</span></u></strong> not only the result of the avoidable violence of war, but <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a basic component of</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> human <strong><u>life</u></strong></span>.

The man [sic] of equivocal sensibility is, at the same time, the man of civilization, which he normally supports without relying any more on reason than on feeling. In his faith, he neglects the fact that civilization is made up of autonomous systems, each opposing the others. He knows well that there is evil here, but he does not want to see that <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the “civilization” that</span></u></strong> he <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">opposes</span></u></strong> to <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the savagery of wars</span></u></strong> is this same civilization—undistorted by any idealistic dream—that, since it is formed out of conflicting elements, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is itself the cause of wars</span></u></strong>. More precisely, and more generally, he (sic) defends human systems that are based on concern for the future, on anxiety about difficulties that might arise unexpectedly, and therefore on regularly pruning back the world’s possibilities. I do not mean that such systems should not be defended, nor that one can simply give up being concerned about the future. But <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">anxiety and concern</span></u></strong>, which are the foundation of civilization, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">always necessitate certain patterns of activity, which the various States that are built on them can never agree to give up</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Each civilized unit</span></u></strong>(thus, civilization) <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">proclaims the primacy of its undertakings</span>—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by which it means to secure the future</span></u></strong>—over all considerations of feelings. This means that, [when forced to choose] between the horrors of war and giving up any of the activities through which it believes it must secure its future, society chooses war. The exceptions result either from the impossibility of struggle, from mistakes, or from the apparent insignificance of the concessions. Thus each nation responds without reservation to the demands of activity, and concedes only a minimum to those sensibility. It is strange that concern for the future at the level of the State immediately diminishes the individual’s security and chances of survival. But <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this is precisely the sign of human indifference towards the present instant</span>—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in which we suffer and in which we die</span></u></strong>—[an indifference] <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that leaves powerless the desire to live. The need to make life secure wins out over the need to live</span></u></strong>. On one point only does the sensibility of feeling coincide with the rational interest of the State. The destruction of life does not just affect the moment of the individual’s death: it can bring disorder and depression to the collectivity as well. For the State, the constant ravage of death is without importance: it is made up for by the birthrate. But the victims of wars, not to mention the fear of defeat, represent a reduction of active strength. Napoleon’s “one night of Paris,” which would restore the losses of battle, expresses rather faithfully the Nation’s point of view, but the blows struck by the enemy nevertheless threaten to sap the life from the social body. The Nation itself gives the man of equivocal sensibility his due. But it is striking that, at this point, the latter limits his sensibility rather closely to points that correspond to the rational preoccupations of States. It is true that on the surface his sensibility upsets preconceived notions: it considers the misfortunes of foreign countries, even enemies, on the same plane as those of the Nation. This is because sentimentality rationalizes (universalizes) and cannot in principle keep within the limits of State reason. But for the most part, in fact, it finds itself back within them: the majority of suffering souls are a lot more sensitive to national losses. They get from the state, in any event, the very rationalism that takes them beyond their own country: they only go (weakly) beyond geographical limits by maintain moral ones; for these souls as for the State, the only truly shattering losses are those that affect, and profoundly disrupt activity. While some will say that this is a matter of guarding against losses that might be avoided, the equivocal sensibility is nonetheless placed as a minor element in the service of this “civilization,” whose essence is limited to separate States. And one cannot say that the result of this servility justify it without question. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If one serves the very cause of the misfortunes one wants to avoid, I’m not sure one has the right to call them avoidable</span>.</u></strong> And the fact remains that in the end, nothing was avoided.<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But</span></u></strong> if it is true that sensibility is caught in a dead end, if subordination to principles external to sensibility is at the origin of the miscalculation, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it does not follow that a refusal of all subordination opens a way</span>. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">On the contrary, it closes it</span></u></strong>, or at the very least gives up on any remaining illusion that there is a way out. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In truth</span></u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the moment of sovereign sensibility differs in every respect from that of servile sentimentality</span></u></strong>. In one sense, it is quite close to pure animal sensibility, since <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is</span></u></strong> similarly <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">free from</span></u></strong> the limits of reason—that is, from all <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">concern for the future</span></u></strong>. Like an animal, the man of sovereign sensibility does not see beyond the present moment. He is not interested if one offers him, as compensation for the misfortune that is, a happiness that will be. For him, the only valid response to misfortune is the one that counts that same instant, without delay. But he differs profoundly from the animal in that immediate sensibility is what, by definition, gets subordinated to reason—as soon as the being reaches the stage of reason—whereas <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">sovereign sensibility is placed above reason, which is recognized within the limits of goal-oriented activity, but which it transcends and subordinates</span></u></strong>. It is natural that it should at first appear in the form of sentimentality; in a sense, its first movement is the vain revolt of a sensibility that remains within the limits of reason. But this still empty sentimentality, which would have liked to have operated like reason but was, for its own ends, inoperative, frees itself when feeling cuts too deep. And one shouldn’t be surprised that this liberation is confirmed at the moment when sensibility experiences this new proof of its own uselessness: when the military art of destruction gains unprecedented means. Indeed, the man of sovereign sensibility is not unrelated to the birth of the atomic bomb: his excessive nature corresponds to that of the sciences, which is to say of reason. <br />
To represent this attitude of sovereign sensibility, I will start from the “crucial” experience of sensibility found in the Christian meditation on the Cross and in the Buddhist meditation on the boneheap. Both these meditations, far from plunging the spirit into the depths of depression, create a passage and a rapid movement of “communicating vessels” from extreme anguish to “the joy that transcends joy.” But the Christian and the Buddhist sensibilities presuppose, if not a stable subordination,, at least a fundamental concession, to the sovereignty of reason. Both condemn the moment—which is to say, what exists, or the world; they condemn the sensible world, which they carry in one and the same movement to the farthest limits of the possible, and they can condemn it only in the name of the truths of an intelligible sphere. But such a trick is not so easy any more, at least to the extent that the crisis of sensibility reaches the point where it becomes unbearable. It is the instant, such as it is, without expression and without detour, that encloses being and, if one reaches an extreme state, can be neither balanced nor compensated for by anything that follows. Nietzsche was the first to experiment with this; or at least he was the first to express it with some degree of clarity. The state where extreme misery and ecstasy are blended, into which the idea of “eternal recurrence” would plunge him, is at first difficult to grasp. Apparently, the same idea, communicated to numerous readers, has not seriously affected their sensibilities. It is, however, no less possible or necessary to identify Nietzsche’s experience with the moment of sovereign sensibility, in which the instant is lived without attempt at evasion. Now, this “mystical state” of Nietzsche’s, furthermore, differs from the Buddhist or Christian religious states only in the trickery that is suddenly exposed (only in a difficulty of access which is a consequence made worse): the instant, the sensible moment, is sovereign here, no longer shifting the weight that crushes it onto a reality—or a nothingness—free from chance. And what in such a perfect gamble makes ecstasy inevitable, liberating it with a burst, transforming unimaginable exhaustion into radiance, is the suppression of hope. (Hope, conceived negatively here, is nothing more than postponement.) If the unrelieved instant that is before me, or rather within me, with each throw carries eternity in its fall, like a role of the dice—<strong><u>if there is no salvation and if the rationalized future of the world cannot alter the world’s being open to all that is possible—then nothing counts more than this</u></strong> <strong><u>cry, which</u></strong> fills the air like the wind or the light and, however powerless, <strong><u>leaves no room for fear</u></strong>, that is to say, <strong><u>for worrying about the future</u></strong>. But if this is the case, if there is affirmed within me a boundless suffering that is joy, or a joy that is infinite suffering, if I say, if I must say: “<strong><u>Nothing counts more than this joy that situates me</u></strong>,” my affirmation immediately places me at the point where my sensibility meets its most difficult test. But this point cannot now be the suffering of Christ nailed to the Cross, extolled by a mythical narrative, nor the humble boneheap of the Buddhist, but rather, if one likes, the unequalled horror of Hiroshima. Not because any given horror should by itself grip me more than another that is less striking, but because the horror of Hiroshima holds, in fact, the attention of my fellowmen, like a lamp attracts a swarm of insects. It is not particularly surprising if Hersey’s book takes on, in this sense, the meaning of a lamp: I imagine that for a while it will give an intolerable brilliance to the possibilities of human suffering, whose symbol and sign it has become even as those possibilities exceed it indefinitely. And if it is necessary to place the cry of the instant on the level of the unbearable, the feeling evoked by Hiroshima may pass for an acceptable, if superficial, expression of it.<br />
At this point <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the first aspect of a particular attitude stands out: the man of sovereign sensibility</span></u></strong>, face-to-face with misfortune, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">no longer immediately exclaims</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, “<strong><u>At all costs let us do away with it</u></strong>,” <strong><u>but first</u></strong>, “<strong><u>Let us live it</u></strong>.” <strong><u>Let us lift, in the instant, a form of life to the level of the worst</u></strong></span>.<br />
But no one, for all that, gives up doing away with what one can.<br />
I would not have written the preceding if I had only wanted to show that it is vain to want to avoid misfortune. I have described an effort, based on evasion, that can only reduce the portion of misfortune. I merely recalled that while following the route one has already taken might stir up a vague concern, one remains powerless. And certainly it is better to live up to Hiroshima than to lament it, unable to bear the idea of it. In truth, man is equal to all possibilities, or rather, the impossible is his only measure (would the human being be fully what he is prior to the instant when the possible—or the future—disappears in front of him?). But these thoughts mark a summit, and were one to live in its vicinity, one would not for all that have let go of this human life, which goes on and which, perceived in its totality, is beautiful and admirable, and worthy of being loved. Thus at the very moment when <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the sovereignty of the instant</span></u></strong> appears to me to dominate utility, in no way do I abandon this enduring humanity: I will say that it <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is beautiful and admirable only to the extent that the instant possesses and intoxicates</span></u></strong> it, but this does not imply of my part any overestimation of the duration of the instant, doomed, from beginning to end, to a vanishing splendor. It even seems to me that <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a movement that carries me beyond limits is more helpful than an oppressive worry</span></u></strong> and a fear <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">of the future</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which lead to</span></u></strong> eloquence and <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the</span></u></strong> common <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">overemphasis on</span></u></strong> action the powerlessness of this world, established by the primary of action, and by <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the atomic bomb</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <strong><u>the latest expression of this powerlessness</u></strong></span>, is obviously detestable. And if I have spoken of a world of sovereign sensibility, it is not only because the sensible value of Hersey’s book leads me to it. It’s because-I cannot doubt it-this world of sovereign sensibility, that is, of the primacy of the instant, is the only one where the dead ends I have pointed out might be gotten around (though of itself, at least at first, this sensibility could not be the motor of action). And it is not completely utopian to evoke this possibility, if it is already given in the nature of the present economy (which does not mean that it is within quick reach nor even ever realizable).<br />

Everyone knows that <strong><u>the industrial development of the United States has reached</u></strong>, from this point on, <strong><u>such</u></strong> <strong><u>a</u></strong> high <strong><u>level that the U</u></strong>nited <strong><u>S</u></strong>tates <strong><u>must no longer expect compensation for its overproduction</u></strong>, which it has to sell abroad. This difficulty in finding outlets must itself, on the other hand, speed up the growth of its productive power. <strong><u>One cannot forget in this light that the mobilization of atomic energy</u></strong>, <strong><u>in the form of the bomb</u></strong>, <strong><u>is likely to increase to an important extent the resources of productive energy</u></strong> (the production for military purposes of explosive uranium or of plutonium could even in a short time release as a by-product large quantities of heat available for electricity.)<br />

This is impossible within the customary conditions of activity submitted to the law of profit. But the impossibility cannot be final, since renouncing such a possibility would leave one before an equivalent impossibility. At this point, but slowly, a perfect reversal of the sphere of activity takes place. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Worrying about the future is</span></u></strong> from now on <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the only foundation for worrying about the future</span></u></strong>: it is only to the extent that activity generally, by its origin, is based on this worry-and no longer due to a lack of resources-that we are still ruled by concern for the future.

The world, trapped in a corner, is doomed to abrupt metamorphosis.<br />
In the end, the old sponge of anxiety that is the world of activity, whose movement leads to destruction, remains at the mercy of the chain reactions of a morality of the instant, of the morality that says: “I am. In this instant I am. And I do not want to subordinate this instant to anything”; or, “Riches will be squandered on earth as they are in heaven.” <strong><u>It is true that a<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">morality</span></u></strong>, <strong><u>even an expressly economic one</u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">cannot overturn the foundations of economics</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But these foundations are overturned all by themselves and morality is born of this overturning like a sudden escape of light</span></u></strong>.<br />

This last point is an important one: the decision, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the plan, to give away wealth means nothing less than the destruction of the old profit system</span></u></strong>, centered as it is in “<em>isolated</em>calculations” (<em>AS</em>, 176). Bataille thus confronts a problem of the so-called “American cancer”: the purely arithmetic calculation of debt, while larger concerns are ignored. As in Dandieu and Aron,<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a plan will solve the problem; but here the “end” is nothing less than</span></u></strong> potlatch, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the “spending without return”</span></u></strong> championed in “the Notion of Expenditure.”<br />
Bataille has discarded his earlier fetishes, such as the proletariat in the street (“The solving of social problems no longer depends on street uprisings” [AS, 186]) and “’visions,’ divinities and myths” (<em>AS</em>, 189). Now lucidity will guarantee both economic development, peace, and the end of economic selfishness. Finally, the very necessity of central planning will make America look like the Soviet Union in that the former will accord more importance to state-planned and financed production. “It [the US] defends free enterprise, but it thereby increases the importance of the state. It is only advancing, as slowly as it can, toward a point where the USSR rushed headlong” (<em>AS</em>, 186).<br />
Some form of socialism will be developed in the US, then, as the opposing parties come to resemble each other. But, implicitly at least, Bataille is arguing that an <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">American Stalinism will not arise from this situation, because this state control is devoted not to accumulation</span></u></strong> (as in Russia) <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">but to expenditure</span></u></strong>. If the Marshall Plan, and the similar plans that will follow, necessarily negate purely individual concerns and enterprises, then socialist state planning will be inseparable from the giving away of massive amounts of wealth, from potlatch. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Even through law and directives will determine activity, the Stalinist “head” will be replaced by a</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">“<strong><u>headlessness</u></strong></span>.” Or we can say, following Bataille’s logic, that this nonauthoritarian direction, this “acephalite,” is already in place in America, since the Marshall Plan has been set in motion not by a “head,” an oppressive command, but by Roosevelt’s successor, who is precisely unaware of what he is doing: “Today Truman would appear to be blindly preparing for the final—and secret—apotheosis” (<em>AS</em>, 190). <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Confrontation will continue between the superpowers</span></u></strong>—it is integral to the model of potlatch, which is now being elaborated on an international scale—<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">but coercive control</span></u></strong>, at least in America, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">seems a thing of the past</span></u></strong>.<br />
<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This is</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> “<strong><u>planning without a head</u></strong></span>” in another sense as well: <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the “end” of planning is planlessness</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <strong><u>the “self-consciousness” that has “nothing as its object</u></strong></span>,” that is the “nothing of pure expenditure” (<em>AS</em>, 190). Bataille here, at the end of the chapter, reiterates the argument from “<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The Psychological Structure of Fascism</span></u></strong>”: <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">accumulation is subordinated to some future goal</span></u></strong>. (It is, in the terms of that essay, homogeneous.) <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But Bataillean self-consciousness is</span> a “<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">becoming conscious of the decisive meaning of an instant in which increase</span></u></strong> (the <strong><u>acquisition</u></strong> of <em>something</em>) <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">will resolve into expenditure</span></u></strong>” (<em>AS</em>, 190). <strong><u>Just as the most elaborately conceived planning is inseparable from potlatch, so too the most integrated, nonindividuated consciousness</u></strong> (the consciousness that arises at the end of history, through an impossible “awareness” of the [non] “object” of the Marshall Plan) <strong><u>is indissociable from the nothingness it “knows</u></strong>.” At this point one can see how Bataille’s economic project folds back into the secular mystical experience of the <em>Somme Atheologique</em>.<br />
<strong><u>We can see</u></strong> also <strong><u>how different this model is</u></strong> from Dandieu and Aron’s. Their authoritarian direction may have been meant to lead to a death of hierarchy, but only through a psychic “individuality” and “spirituality.” T<strong><u>rue, their model was based on potlatch, but <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the inner motivation of potlatch for them was not the “<em>nothing</em> of pure expenditure,” but rather the energy of the isolated “person</span></u></strong>.” So <strong><u>even while <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">their planning</span></u></strong> too <strong><u>may be conceived as a “planning to end planning,” it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is applied from outside</span></u></strong>—through an authoritarian state—<strong><u>and<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">its end is self-glorification under the protection of that same state</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Confrontation, so integral to potlatch, is completely denied</span></u></strong> (indeed the abolition of the proletariat is presented as the elimination of class conflict), and we realize that for Dandieu and Aron the affirmation of “primitive” expenditure was nothing more than a justification of a Nietzschean “personal” force.<strong><u>For Bataille</u></strong>, on the other hand, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the end of planning</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">—<strong><u>in both</u></strong></span> senses of the word “end,” both<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">goal and death</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">—<strong><u>lies in the “lucidity” of the mystical state, a lucidity that opens onto the extinction of society, the individual, and the state</u></strong></span>.<br />
Waste and Sacrifice describe the constant state of matter in the Milky Way. Objectivity, utility and scarcity are undermined by explosive speed of the universe and the abundance of the suns energy. Our political gaming must reflect this cosmological inevitability.<br />

Now, the sun, carrying its swarm of planets along with it, performs so prodigious a revolution that even at 200 miles per second it has lasted at least 250 million years. If, however, you want the full sense of man's interest touching this voyage of his, you must do more than imagine its speed and the size of its orbit. If the sun were driven by a steady movement of gravitation around a center, the universe to which <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Earth</span></u></strong> belongs could, on the whole, be considered analogous to the closed system of our planetary revolutions (only the order of magnitude would have changed). Whereas the movement described by the sun and its planets about the galactic center opens, as it were, into and through the sky. When, indeed, we do perceive this movement within infinity-driving universes like our <span style="font-size: 9pt;">own- </span>it in no way resembles the stable and geometric rings of Saturn; it <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">seems hurled into space like a whirling explosion</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> The galaxy to which we belong is composed of hundreds of millions of stars whose average size is equal to that of the sun. Its surface is so vast that light- at the speed of 186,000 miles per second - takes 100,000 years to cover its entire distance. Earth, which revolves somewhere in the middle region, is situated 30,000 light-years from the galaxy's axis, and earth dwellers would certainly never have known the form of this universe without the revelation, by means of very powerful telescopes, of worlds quite like ours, far beyond the cloud of stars within which our planet is buried. These worlds in the farthest distant parts of the sky appear rather like disks with swollen centers. Seen in profile, they look like Saturn with its two-ringed girdle, but on a much larger scale, and with a central sphere that is quite flat. But those visible head-on look stranger: they develop, rather like a Medusa's head, a number of luminous extensions winding from the core out into space (whence the name of spirals given them by astronomers). Each of these threads is really composed of specks of what has been described as &quot;stellar gas,&quot; that is, luminous matter formed by the accumulations of multitudes of swirling suns as distant from each other as the stars of our immediate sky. The whole system suggests the swirling suns of our light shows, and appears rather like a dazzling explosion of fireworks which vanished after a few seconds into the night. This image may be erroneous, and it is obvious that this swift violence, when transcribed into a chronology commensurate with the immensity of the revolving worlds, still takes the billions of years represented by a few dozen revolutions. According to Eddington (The Rotation of the Galaxy, Oxford, 1939), however, the precariousness of a universe like ours is reflected in the way it looks, and the immensely long detonation time of the spiral within which we rotate is due merely to the incomparable immensity of space involved. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The underlying nature of the world</span> from which we come <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is that of an explosive rotation of matter</span></u></strong>, nonetheless. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These considerations</span></u></strong>about ourselves have been made possible as knowledge developed (and they will surely vary, as that knowledge varies, as science advances). They <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are</span></u></strong>, in any case, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">wholly contrary to those representations which have established man and his earthly base as the seemingly immutable seat of human life- as the center and foundation of all possible reality</span></u></strong>. It would appear that man's natural anthropocentrism bears a relation to the galactic universe which is that of a feudal power to the over-distant center of imperial power. A domain has been marked off directly with the galaxy's whirlwind, such that it appears constituted as not subject to the reality of the universe, as entirely autonomous, to the point of perfect immobility set within the mad spin of it all. And <strong><u>even if <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">human existence</span> is really in the process of now discovering the universe that sustains it, this existence <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">must acknowledge the universe as a spectacle external to it or else deny itself</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">How</span></u></strong>, indeed, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">can it claim to identify with the rapture of the heavens</span></u></strong>, acknowledging itself as spectacle viewing itself, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">when the fact of looking presupposes that the viewing subject has somehow escaped from the rapturous movement of the universe</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">?</span> <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">All that we recognize as truth is necessarily linked to the error represented by the &quot;stationary earth</span></u></strong>.&quot; The spirals or galaxies, which unfurl their gigantic tentacles of light through the darkness of space, are composed of innumerable stars or stellar systems united in a &quot;movement of the whole.&quot; Stars may be simple or complex. The solar system is no exception in the sky's immensity, and the stars may therefore be accompanied by a planetary whirlwind; in like manner, the planets known to us are often doubled by satellites. The sun is a star, as the earth is a planet or the moon a satellite; and if to this cycle we add comets, four sorts of heavenly bodies appear thus united by a &quot;movement of the whole&quot; within the galaxy. But each of these heavenly bodies possesses a &quot;movement of the whole&quot; particular to it. A star such as the sun, central core of the system to which it belongs, radiates- that is, constantly projects part of its substance in the form of light and heat through space. (The considerable quantity of energy thus expended may originate in constant internal annihilation of the star's very substance.) This extraordinary loss is that of a star; whereas the radiation of a planet such as Earth is so weak as to be considered negligible. Earth, as a heavenly body, differs indeed from a star insofar as it is cold and does not shine. So that the movement of the whole which activates it does not merely differ quantitatively from that of an incandescent star, it is different in kind. Heavenly bodies of any sort are composed of atoms, but if we consider just those stars of the highest temperature, we see that the atoms of radiant stars cannot be different in composition; they are in the power of the stellar mass and its central movement. The atoms of the earthly periphery, however - those of its surrounding atmosphere - are free of this power; they can enter and be part of forces which have developed independence in relation to the force of the mass. The surface of the planet is formed not only of molecules, each composed of a small number of atoms, but of much more complex elements, some crystalline, others colloidal, the latter resulting in the autonomous forces of life in plants, animals, men, in human society. Stars of relatively low temperature, including the sun, tolerate, if necessary, the molecules' fragile autonomy, but intense radiation keeps almost all of the mass in an atomized state. Cold Earth cannot keep the atoms of her surface within the power of an almost zero radiation, and the &quot;movement of the whole&quot; which forms around her moves in a direction contrary to that of the movement formed within a star with high temperature. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The sun lavishes its force in space, while the particles which, on Earth's periphery, succeed in escaping the force of the central core and cohere to form ever higher power no longer expend, but rather consume</span></u></strong>, strength. All that which condenses and quickens on our Earth is thus marked by avidity. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Not only is each complex particle avid of infinitely available solar energy or of remaining free earthly energy, but of all the accumulated energy in the other particles</span></u></strong>. Thus, in the absence of radiation, in the cold, Earth's surface is abandoned to a &quot;movement of the whole&quot; which seems a movement of general consumption, and whose salient form is life. The crowning achievement of this tendency is anthropocentrism. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The weakening of the terrestrial globe's material energy has enabled the constitution of the autonomous human existences</span> which are so many misconceptions of the universe's movement</u></strong>. These existences may be compared to those of the feudal lord, who gains independence insofar as the central power ceases to have energetic action. But man's avidity, taken as a whole, is much greater than that of the local sovereign himself. The latter contents himself with preventing the king's agents from mixing in his affairs, while the human being loses awareness of the reality of his world - <strong><u>as the parasite is unaware of the pain or joy of those from whom it draws subsistence</u></strong>. Furthermore, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in closing off</span></u></strong> ever more tightly <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the world</span></u></strong> about him so as <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to represent the sole principle of existence</span></u></strong>, he tends to substitute his constitutive avidity for the sky's obvious prodigality; he <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">thus gradually effaces</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the image of a heavenly reality free of inherent meaning or demand</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <strong><u>replacing it with a personification</u></strong></span> (of an anthropomorphic kind) <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">of the immutable idea of the Good</span></u></strong>.

Thus, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">their only goal is that of an unquenchable greed</span></u></strong>. For the greater their wealth the more they proliferate; their productive force produces only new productive force, their greed in operation can produce only greater greed. <strong><u>The cycle of human energy began</u></strong>, therefore, <strong><u>to seem like a desperate trap</u></strong>, and men began to believe themselves condemned to observe the greed which drove them as a curse: their despair drove them to renunciation. Since the nature of things is not to be changed by a curse, they have not grown less avid; their sense of malediction was all that changed. <strong><u>There is but one way out; <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is in vain that we deny our nature</span></u></strong>, and since we do seek power, <strong><u>we can only assent to the force we must be</u></strong>.

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">David L. R., Historian Underground: Making History Relevant For Life Georges Bataille and the Notion of Gift,</span><span style="color: windowtext; font-size: 8pt; text-decoration: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sauer-thompson.com/essays/Bataille%20and%20the%20Notion%20of%20Gift.doc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.sauer-thompson.com/ essays/Bataille%20and%20the% 20Notion%20of%20Gift.doc</a></span><br />
He carried these tendencies over into his work on &quot;<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">general economy</span></u></strong>&quot;, which is found primarily in The Accursed Share2. He saw the descriptions of classical economics as having a limited understanding of the nature of economic movement. In response, Bataille conceived of a meta-category of the movement of energy to which classical economics is only a subcategory. The flow of energy in his model extends as far back as the energy received from the sun. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">As the light and its energy falls upon the plants they capture it and make energy out of it to use for their own survival</span></u></strong>. But <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">more importantly they create an excess of energy</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. <strong><u>The excess that they produce goes either into growth and reproduction or must be expended, used for the beauty of their leaves, for useless parts, or simply spilled into the ground</u></strong></span>.<br />
This model he extends to all economic phenomena. As he writes in The Accursed Share: <br />
<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">On the whole, a society always</span></u></strong> produces more than is necessary for its survival; it <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has a surplus at its disposal</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. <strong><u>It is precisely the use it makes of this surplus that determines it</u></strong></span>: The Surplus is the cause of the agitation, of the structural changes and of the entire history of society. But this surplus has more than one outlet, the most common of which is growth. And growth itself has many forms, each one of which eventually comes up against some limit. Thwarted demographic growth becomes military; it is forced to engage in conquest. Once the military limits is reached, the surplus has the sumptuary forms of religion as an outlet, along with games and spectacles that derive therefrom, or personal luxury.3 <br />
Moreover, therein lies his primary challenge to traditional economics. In contrast to the classical notion of scarcity driving economic activity, he proposed a law of surplus. While classical economic thought emphasized the need for an efficient utilization of resources to fight the ravages of the scarcity of economic resources, he analyzed history in terms of the expenditure of excess energy and production. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This put into question many of the classical historical assumptions, those of war as the competition among nations over scarce economic resources or that of the state as a Hobbesian limit placed on the competition of individuals fighting over those same resources</span></u></strong>. The impact of this refutation of classical economics cannot be underestimated.<br />

 <u>CONTENTION ONE – SACRIFICE</u><br />
Waste and Sacrifice describe the constant state of matter in the Milky Way. Objectivity, utility and scarcity are undermined by explosive speed of the universe and the abundance of the suns energy. Our political gaming must reflect this cosmological inevitability.<br />

<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">To represent the reality of Earth as unrelated to this projection into space would be wrong</span></u></strong><strong><u>; <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">for the movement of celestial bodies is no less real than their mass</span></u></strong>. Now, the sun, carrying its swarm of planets along with it, performs so prodigious a revolution that even at 200 miles per second it has lasted at least 250 million years. If, however, you want the full sense of man's interest touching this voyage of his, you must do more than imagine its speed and the size of its orbit. If the sun were driven by a steady movement of gravitation around a center, the universe to which <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Earth</span></u></strong> belongs could, on the whole, be considered analogous to the closed system of our planetary revolutions (only the order of magnitude would have changed). Whereas the movement described by the sun and its planets about the galactic center opens, as it were, into and through the sky. When, indeed, we do perceive this movement within infinity-driving universes like our <span style="font-size: 9pt;">own- </span>it in no way resembles the stable and geometric rings of Saturn; it <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">seems hurled into space like a whirling explosion</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span> The galaxy to which we belong is composed of hundreds of millions of stars whose average size is equal to that of the sun. Its surface is so vast that light- at the speed of 186,000 miles per second - takes 100,000 years to cover its entire distance. Earth, which revolves somewhere in the middle region, is situated 30,000 light-years from the galaxy's axis, and earth dwellers would certainly never have known the form of this universe without the revelation, by means of very powerful telescopes, of worlds quite like ours, far beyond the cloud of stars within which our planet is buried. These worlds in the farthest distant parts of the sky appear rather like disks with swollen centers. Seen in profile, they look like Saturn with its two-ringed girdle, but on a much larger scale, and with a central sphere that is quite flat. But those visible head-on look stranger: they develop, rather like a Medusa's head, a number of luminous extensions winding from the core out into space (whence the name of spirals given them by astronomers). Each of these threads is really composed of specks of what has been described as &quot;stellar gas,&quot; that is, luminous matter formed by the accumulations of multitudes of swirling suns as distant from each other as the stars of our immediate sky. The whole system suggests the swirling suns of our light shows, and appears rather like a dazzling explosion of fireworks which vanished after a few seconds into the night. This image may be erroneous, and it is obvious that this swift violence, when transcribed into a chronology commensurate with the immensity of the revolving worlds, still takes the billions of years represented by a few dozen revolutions. According to Eddington (The Rotation of the Galaxy, Oxford, 1939), however, the precariousness of a universe like ours is reflected in the way it looks, and the immensely long detonation time of the spiral within which we rotate is due merely to the incomparable immensity of space involved. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The underlying nature of the world</span> from which we come <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is that of an explosive rotation of matter</span></u></strong>, nonetheless. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">These considerations</span></u></strong>about ourselves have been made possible as knowledge developed (and they will surely vary, as that knowledge varies, as science advances). They <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">are</span></u></strong>, in any case, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">wholly contrary to those representations which have established man and his earthly base as the seemingly immutable seat of human life- as the center and foundation of all possible reality</span></u></strong>. It would appear that man's natural anthropocentrism bears a relation to the galactic universe which is that of a feudal power to the over-distant center of imperial power. A domain has been marked off directly with the galaxy's whirlwind, such that it appears constituted as not subject to the reality of the universe, as entirely autonomous, to the point of perfect immobility set within the mad spin of it all. And <strong><u>even if <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">human existence</span> is really in the process of now discovering the universe that sustains it, this existence <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">must acknowledge the universe as a spectacle external to it or else deny itself</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">How</span></u></strong>, indeed, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">can it claim to identify with the rapture of the heavens</span></u></strong>, acknowledging itself as spectacle viewing itself, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">when the fact of looking presupposes that the viewing subject has somehow escaped from the rapturous movement of the universe</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">?</span> <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">All that we recognize as truth is necessarily linked to the error represented by the &quot;stationary earth</span></u></strong>.&quot; The spirals or galaxies, which unfurl their gigantic tentacles of light through the darkness of space, are composed of innumerable stars or stellar systems united in a &quot;movement of the whole.&quot; Stars may be simple or complex. The solar system is no exception in the sky's immensity, and the stars may therefore be accompanied by a planetary whirlwind; in like manner, the planets known to us are often doubled by satellites. The sun is a star, as the earth is a planet or the moon a satellite; and if to this cycle we add comets, four sorts of heavenly bodies appear thus united by a &quot;movement of the whole&quot; within the galaxy. But each of these heavenly bodies possesses a &quot;movement of the whole&quot; particular to it. A star such as the sun, central core of the system to which it belongs, radiates- that is, constantly projects part of its substance in the form of light and heat through space. (The considerable quantity of energy thus expended may originate in constant internal annihilation of the star's very substance.) This extraordinary loss is that of a star; whereas the radiation of a planet such as Earth is so weak as to be considered negligible. Earth, as a heavenly body, differs indeed from a star insofar as it is cold and does not shine. So that the movement of the whole which activates it does not merely differ quantitatively from that of an incandescent star, it is different in kind. Heavenly bodies of any sort are composed of atoms, but if we consider just those stars of the highest temperature, we see that the atoms of radiant stars cannot be different in composition; they are in the power of the stellar mass and its central movement. The atoms of the earthly periphery, however - those of its surrounding atmosphere - are free of this power; they can enter and be part of forces which have developed independence in relation to the force of the mass. The surface of the planet is formed not only of molecules, each composed of a small number of atoms, but of much more complex elements, some crystalline, others colloidal, the latter resulting in the autonomous forces of life in plants, animals, men, in human society. Stars of relatively low temperature, including the sun, tolerate, if necessary, the molecules' fragile autonomy, but intense radiation keeps almost all of the mass in an atomized state. Cold Earth cannot keep the atoms of her surface within the power of an almost zero radiation, and the &quot;movement of the whole&quot; which forms around her moves in a direction contrary to that of the movement formed within a star with high temperature. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The sun lavishes its force in space, while the particles which, on Earth's periphery, succeed in escaping the force of the central core and cohere to form ever higher power no longer expend, but rather consume</span></u></strong>, strength. All that which condenses and quickens on our Earth is thus marked by avidity. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Not only is each complex particle avid of infinitely available solar energy or of remaining free earthly energy, but of all the accumulated energy in the other particles</span></u></strong>. Thus, in the absence of radiation, in the cold, Earth's surface is abandoned to a &quot;movement of the whole&quot; which seems a movement of general consumption, and whose salient form is life. The crowning achievement of this tendency is anthropocentrism. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The weakening of the terrestrial globe's material energy has enabled the constitution of the autonomous human existences</span> which are so many misconceptions of the universe's movement</u></strong>. These existences may be compared to those of the feudal lord, who gains independence insofar as the central power ceases to have energetic action. But man's avidity, taken as a whole, is much greater than that of the local sovereign himself. The latter contents himself with preventing the king's agents from mixing in his affairs, while the human being loses awareness of the reality of his world - <strong><u>as the parasite is unaware of the pain or joy of those from whom it draws subsistence</u></strong>. Furthermore, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in closing off</span></u></strong> ever more tightly <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the world</span></u></strong> about him so as <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to represent the sole principle of existence</span></u></strong>, he tends to substitute his constitutive avidity for the sky's obvious prodigality; he <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">thus gradually effaces</span></u></strong> <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the image of a heavenly reality free of inherent meaning or demand</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <strong><u>replacing it with a personification</u></strong></span> (of an anthropomorphic kind) <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">of the immutable idea of the Good</span></u></strong>. Given these unfavorable conditions, there is but one way out. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Those condemned</span></u></strong> by avidity <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to subordinate everything to the acquisition of energy</span> define all that makes for further acquisition as being &quot;of use</u></strong>.&quot; <strong><u>They <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">have delimited</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">within the system of free universes</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a world of &quot;use&quot; drawn back upon itself</span>, isolated and imprisoned</u></strong>, whose structure is composed by implements, raw materials, and work. Thus, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">their only goal is that of an unquenchable greed</span></u></strong>. For the greater their wealth the more they proliferate; their productive force produces only new productive force, their greed in operation can produce only greater greed. <strong><u>The cycle of human energy began</u></strong>, therefore, <strong><u>to seem like a desperate trap</u></strong>, and men began to believe themselves condemned to observe the greed which drove them as a curse: their despair drove them to renunciation. Since the nature of things is not to be changed by a curse, they have not grown less avid; their sense of malediction was all that changed. <strong><u>There is but one way out; <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is in vain that we deny our nature</span></u></strong>, and since we do seek power, <strong><u>we can only assent to the force we must be</u></strong>. To flee is ridiculous; one must go rather to the full limit of power. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Existence in avidity</span></u></strong> attains, when fully developed, a point of disequilibrium at which it suddenly and lavishly expends; it <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">sustains an explosive loss of the surplus of force it has so painfully accumulated</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">amount of energy which thus escapes</span></u></strong>, though by no means negligible, is relatively low; however, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is no longer part of the world of use: use is then subordinate, it becomes the slave of loss</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">.</span><br />

Sacrifices beyond the boundary between the visible and the invisible occasionally surface in everyday life. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">We all know</span> that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">many people die on the roads and highways</span></u></strong> of the US<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">every year</span></u></strong> (approximately 50,000 per year). <strong><u>These people are <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">willingly and uselessly sacrificed to show the sincerity of our desire for transportation technology</span></u></strong>. No means to end this sacrifice exists, short of closing the roads, and yet no honor is paid to those who give their life for the excess of travel - it remains forever hidden. Philosopher and artist Gregory Ulmer proposed that an addendum be made to the Viet Nam war memorial in which the names of those killed on the highway would be spooled off on a printer beside the monument. Needless to say this monument was rejected, since <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">such sacrifice</span> and excess <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">must remain hidden</span> in modern societies. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">To monumentalize death and uselessness is simply too frightening</span></u></strong>. Monuments to the sacrifices of the state are typical, but are only the beginning. Most of these monuments are abstracted bits of concrete, marble, bronze, or some other material that will signify the longevity of artificially created memory. But there are times when these monuments are brutally honest, and useless technology along with its slaves is put on public display. The USS Arizona, for example - a half sunken ship with the ship's full complement of corpses (officers included) rests silently in Pearl Harbor. This national monument, a functional item made useless through sacrifice, suggests the metaphysical moment of profound loss through its lack of function. (Woe to anyone who does not treat this sacred relic with proper respect, for it speaks of the will to excess, which is grounded in human uselessness in the face of death). But what is even more compelling about this monument is that the ship is carried on the active duty roster. This necropolis is more a symbol of the absent core of the war machine than a monument to the US soldiers who died in the battle of Pearl Harbor; it monumentalizes transcendental uselessness. Utopian technology is that technology which has fallen from grace. It has been stripped of its purity and reendowed with utility. The fall is necessitated by a return to contact with humanity. Having once left the production table, the technology that lives the godly life of state-of- the-art uselessness has no further interaction with humans as users or as inventors; rather, humans serve only as a means to maintain its uselessness. The location of the most complex pure technology is of no mystery. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Deep in the core of the war machine is the missile system</span></u></strong>. Ultimately, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">all research is centered around this invisible monument to uselessness. The bigger and more powerful it becomes, the greater its value</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But should it ever be touched by utility</span></u></strong> - <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that is</span></u></strong>, should it ever be <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">used</span></u></strong> - <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">its value becomes naught</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">To be of value, it must be maintained, upgraded, and expanded, but</span> it must <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">never actually do anything</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">. This idol of destruction is forever hungry, and is willing to eat all</span> resources. In return</u></strong>, however, <strong><u>it excretes objects of utility</u></strong>. Consumer communications and transportation systems, for example, have dramatically improved due to the continuous research aimed at increasing the grandeur of the apparatus of uselessness. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There can be a stopping point</span> to this process - <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a discovery made by the collapsing Soviet Union</span></u></strong>. For all the 'patriots of democracy' who gave a collective sigh of relief and boasted that they were at last proven right - &quot;communism doesn't work&quot; - there still may be a need to worry. <strong><u>The fall of the USSR had little to do with ideology</u></strong>. The US and USSR were competitors in producing the best apparatus of uselessness in order to prove its own respective Hegelian mastery of the globe. Modern autocrats and oligarchs have long known that a standing army puts an undue strain on the economy. To be sure, standing armies were early monuments to uselessness, but in terms of both size and cost, they are dwarfed by the standing missile system of the electronic age. As with all things that are useless, there will be no return on the investment in it. The useless represents a 100% loss of capital. Although such investment seems to go against the utilitarian grain of visible bourgeois culture, whether in socialist or in constitutional republics, the compulsive desire for a useless master is much greater (Japan is an interesting exception to this rule). Unfortunately for the USSR, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">they were unable to indulge in pure excess expenditure at the same rate as the US. The soviet techno-idol was a little more constipated, and could not maintain the needed rate of excretion. Consequently, once the limits of uselessness were reached,</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that system imploded</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The US government</span></u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">on the other hand</span></u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has</span> to this day <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">remained convinced that further progress can be made</span></u></strong>. Reagan and his Star Wars campaign issued a policy radically expanding the useless. Reagan, of course, was the perfect one to make the policy, since he was an idol to uselessness himself. He represents one of the few times that uselessness has taken an organic form in this century. (This is part of the reason he was considered such a bourgeois hero. He was willing to personally plunge into uselessness without apology. He did not let a thing stand in for him). Playing on yuppie paranoia (the fascists' friend), Reagan convinced the public loyal to him that a defensive monument (Star Wars) to uselessness was needed, just in case the offensive monument (the missile system) was not enough. He was successful enough in his plea to guarantee that years of useless research will ensue that no one will be able to stop, even if his original monumental vision (a net of laser armed satellites) should be erased. In this manner, Reagan made sure that the apparatus of uselessness would expand even if the cold war ended. Indeed, this situation has come to pass. Currently, the US has no competitors in the race to uselessness, but the monument continues to be maintained and even to grow, which is particularly odd, since even the cynical argument of deterrence is now moot.<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Even though</span> the offensive monument to uselessness seems to be shrinking - <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">missiles are being defused and cut apart with the care and order of high ritual</span>, and technology costing millions of dollars is being laid to rest, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">having never done anything but exist</span></u></strong> - thanks to Reagan's farsightedness, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the general system continues to expand</span></u></strong>. Although many are still in denial, the desire of the bourgeois to subordinate themselves to the useless has become, for the moment, glaringly visible. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The research is done; the system is upgraded, but for what reason</span></u></strong>? The missiles are now aimed at the ocean, so that even if they are 'used,' they will still be useless. The fragments of Star Wars technology have not been released in pure form from the experimental labs, and even if they were, no enemy exists against which Star Wars technology would protect US citizens. The American system has achieved utter transcendental uselessness. This techno-historical moment is the highest manifestation of technological purity. In his rush to save the apparatus of the useless from stalling, Reagan may have made one error. When he put the idea of the defensive monument in the minds of Americans, he disrupted the primary sign of the war machine - mutually assured destruction. He restored hope in American consciousness that perhaps utility could save US citizens from the total annihilation certain to destroy the rest of the world. The disassociation of death and uselessness took previously sacred elements of war-tech out of the privileged realm. When these elements became depurified, their value in terms of the satisfaction of bourgeois desire plummeted. This is partly why Reagan's original Star Wars vision has been dismantled. Thus far, however, most war-tech has not been depurified due to this ideological slippage, and the purity of offensive weapons of mass destruction continues to be enforced. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Nations that do not understand the code of uselessness but that have state-of-the-art military technology are a cause for great concern</span></u></strong>.

The economy of unchanneled desire and perversity, as suggested by Bataille, penetrates the surface of utility in a most convincing way. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Progress in the 20th century has primarily consisted of bourgeois culture looking for a new master</span>.

<span style="font-weight: normal;">These distinctions will perhaps seem idle. But I can at this point explain myself. What struck me on first reading </span><em><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Hiroshima</span></em><span style="font-weight: normal;"> was that, if I had not had any other reason, the isolated view of horror would have </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">left me</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, as it were, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">indifferent</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. If, however, I read in anguish, feeling in contact with the most oppressive reality, it was because I knew: right away I related all the </span>banal reactions to the consciousness of the possibilities opened up by the manufacture of atomic bombs. I understood then that the annual death of fifty million human beings had no humane meaning. (We cannot, indeed, avoid it—and if we could, we should soon see that we should have done nothing, that the resulting misfortunes would be more serious than a thousand Hiroshimas, since numberless death is necessary for the uninterrupted renewal of life.) But the death of sixty thousand is charged with meaning, in<span style="font-weight: normal;"> that it depended on their fellow men to kill them or to let them live. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The</span>atom <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">bomb draws</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> its </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">meaning from its human origin</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">: it is the possibility that the <em>hands of man</em>deliberately hang suspended over the future.

If we continue with John Hersey’s narrative, the disproportion of the effect [of the bomb to the mind’s habitual standards] soon brings us back into the <em>depths</em> of the termites’ nest. Those who were its witnesses, enduring the effect without dying, no longer had the strength necessary to form an intelligible representation of their misfortune: they submitted to it as the termite submits to the unintelligible destruction of its nest. At first, they could not distinguish this effect from those of ordinary bombs; then, it seems, they perceived the immensity of the disaster, but without, for all that, escaping from their inhuman daze. This very human vertigo caused by the idea of catastrophe, which supposes at least the sort of proximity created by the sensory imagination, probably also supposes a minimum of distance. The horror reached the point where reflection—which requires sustaining not only concern, but beyond concern, that hope which is its foundation—could only exert itself weakly. Brief passages cannot replace reading the whole book, with the multiplication of details, monstrous and minute. [There are, for instance,] mixed in with the dead, the ten thousand wounded, bleeding, vomiting, and dying, overflowing the stairwells, the hallways and the courtyards of a hospital, and cared for by six doctors…but that is the simplest image of calamity. Mr. Tanimoto, running through the ruins in search of his wife and his church, is represented to us as the only one uninjured among the hundreds and hundreds of wounded that he meets along the way: “The eyebrows of some were burned off and skin hung from their faces and hands. Others, because of pain, held their arms up as if carrying something in both hands. Some were vomiting as they walked. Many were naked or in shreds of clothing….Many, although injured themselves, supported relatives who were worse off. <em>Almost all had their heads bowed, looked straight ahead, were silent, and showed no expression whatever”</em> (my emphasis [38-39]). A little farther, Mr. Tanimoto discovered, lying on the bank of a river, some wounded who were too weak to move when the tide rose; he endeavored to save them: “He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge, glove-like pieces. He was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a moment.” With the help of a boat, he succeeded, with great difficulty, in lifting the bodies onto a higher part of the bank. Nevertheless, by the next day, the tide had washed them away. I do not cite this fact for the horror of such useless courage, but for a sentence that completes the account: “<em>He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, ‘These are human beings’</em>” (my emphasis [59]). What emerges from the entirety of the account is that whatever humanity was maintained by these unfortunate people of Hiroshima, had to be painfully kept up against a background of animal stupor. </span>At first sight one imagines that the intelligible representations of the catastrophe whose return we must dread lack the emotive elements provided by sensory representations, and in the absence of which reflection has no effect (since it is not followed by the ne<span style="font-weight: normal;">cessary intense reactions). But</span> one quickly realizes that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the appeal to feeling is of negligible interest</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. Undoubtedly, it is even at the expense of effectiveness that feeling enriches the sentimentality of those who are depressed, since the result of reflection is either a virile attitude or none at all. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, besides, as is human, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">we reject sentimentality and go resolutely to the limits of the possibilities of feeling, we find only the infinite “absurd”</span> of animal suffering<span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span>And in the meaningless world into which our reflection draws us, a cataclysm is limited to the instant it takes place<span style="font-weight: normal;">—</span>and its representations exceeds any concern for subsequent consequences<span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span>So much so that feeling cannot be the point of departure for action<span style="font-weight: normal;">. And one can say with certainty that the most vivid imagination can place only a negligible force at the service of those who wish to ward off the return of misfortune. </span>The sensibility that goes to the furthest limits moves away from politics and<span style="font-weight: normal;">, as is the case for the suffering animal, </span>the world has<span style="font-weight: normal;"> at a certain point nothing more to it than an</span>immense absurdity<span style="font-weight: normal;">, closed in on itself. </span>But the sensibility that looks for a way out and enters along the path of politics is always of cheap quality<span style="font-weight: normal;">. It cheats, and </span>it is clear that <em>in serving</em>political ends it is no more than a <em>servile</em><span style="font-weight: normal;">, or at least </span>subordinated sensibility<span style="font-weight: normal;">. The cheating is quite apparent. </span>If the misfortune of Hiroshima are faced up to freely <strong><u>from the perspective</u></strong> of a sensibility <strong><u>that is not faked</u></strong>, they cannot be isolated from other misfortunes. The tens of thousands of victims of the atom bomb are on the same level as the tens of millions whom nature yearly hands over to death. One cannot deny the differences in age and in suffering, but origin and intensity change nothing: horror is everywhere the same. The point that, in principle, the one horror is preventable while the other is not is<span style="font-weight: normal;">, in the last analysis, </span>a matter of indifference<span style="font-weight: normal;">. The standpoint of <em>sovereign sensibility</em>, which has nothing to do with sentimentality, or even with pity—which are equivocal—seems to me to have been represented perfectly by Malraux, when he asked the communists: “At this moment, what do you do about the man run over by a train?” Malraux was wrong to confront the communist with this difficulty, since they openly subordinate sensibility to reason. But the objection would be valid if addressed to those who think that they obey their sentiments. In truth, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">if one singles out Hiroshima for lamentation, it is because one does not dare to look misfortune in the face</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">—</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">misfortune’s profound nonsense</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, which </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> not only the result of the avoidable violence of war, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">but</span></span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"> a basic component of human life</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-weight: normal;">.</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> As a consequence,</span> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">one takes refuge in the world of activity, <strong><u>dominated by the principles of</u></strong></span> the virile<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">reason</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">But instead of responding to the concern about an impossible horror, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">one serves the ends of a narrow system</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-weight: normal;">.</span> The man<span style="font-weight: normal;"> [sic] </span>of equivocal sensibility<span style="font-weight: normal;"> is, at the same time, the man of civilization, which he normally supports without relying any more on reason than on feeling.

I do not mean that such systems should not be defended, nor that one can simply give up being concerned about the future. But <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">anxiety and concern</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, which are the foundation of civilization, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">always necessitate certain patterns of activity, which the various States that are built on them can never agree to give up</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Each civilized unit</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">(thus, civilization) </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">proclaims the primacy of its undertakings</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">—</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by which it means to secure the future</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">—over all considerations of feelings. This means that, [</span>when forced to choose<span style="font-weight: normal;">] </span>between the horrors of war and giving up<span style="font-weight: normal;"> any of </span>the activities through which it believes it must secure its future, society chooses war<span style="font-weight: normal;">. The exceptions result either from the impossibility of struggle, from mistakes, or from the apparent insignificance of the concessions. Thus each nation responds</span>without reservation to the demands of activity, and concedes only a minimum to those sensibility. It is strange that concern for the future at the level of the State immediately diminishes the individual’s security and chances of survival. But <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">this is precisely the sign of human indifference towards the present instant</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-weight: normal;">—</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">in which we suffer and in which we die</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">—[an indifference] </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that leaves powerless the desire to live</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The need to make life secure wins out over the need to live</span>. On one point only does the sensibility of feeling coincide with the rational interest of the State. The destruction of life does not just affect the moment of the individual’s death: it can bring disorder and depression to the collectivity as well. For the State, the constant ravage of death is without importance: it is made up for by the birthrate. But the victims of wars, not to mention the fear of defeat, represent a reduction of active strength. Napoleon’s “one night of Paris,” which would restore the losses of battle, expresses rather faithfully the Nation’s point of view, but the blows struck by the enemy nevertheless threaten to sap the life from the social body. The Nation itself gives the man of equivocal sensibility his due. But it is striking that, at this point, the latter limits his sensibility rather closely to points that correspond to the rational preoccupations of States. It is true that on the surface his sensibility upsets preconceived notions: it considers the misfortunes of foreign countries, even enemies, on the same plane as those of the Nation. This is because sentimentality rationalizes (universalizes) and cannot in principle keep within the limits of State reason. But for the most part, in fact, it finds itself back within them: the majority of suffering souls are a lot more sensitive to national losses. They get from the state, in any event, the very rationalism that takes them beyond their own country: they only go (weakly) beyond geographical limits by maintain moral ones; for these souls as for the State, the only truly shattering losses are those that affect, and profoundly disrupt activity. While some will say that this is a matter of guarding against losses that might be avoided, the equivocal sensibility is nonetheless placed as a minor element in the service of this “civilization,” whose essence is limited to separate States. And one cannot say that the result of this servility justify it without question. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If one serves the very cause of the misfortunes one wants to avoid, I’m not sure one has the right to call them avoidable</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">.

In one sense, </span>it is quite close to pure animal sensibility, since <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">it is</span> similarly <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">free from</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> the limits of reason—that is, from all </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">concern for the future</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. Like an animal, the man of sovereign sensibility does not see beyond the present moment. He is </span>not interested if one offers him, as compensation for the misfortune that is, a happiness that will be. For him, the only valid response to misfortune is the one that counts that same instant, without delay. But he differs profoundly from the animal in that immediate sensibility is what, by definition, gets subordinated to reason—as soon as the being reaches the s<span style="font-weight: normal;">tage of reason—whereas </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">sovereign sensibility is placed above reason, which is recognized within the limits of goal-oriented activity, but which it transcends and subordinates</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">. It is natural that it should at first appear in the form of sentimentful, and admirable, and worthy of being loved. Thus at the very moment </span>when <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the sovereignty of the instant</span> appears<span style="font-weight: normal;"> to me </span>to dominate utility<span style="font-weight: normal;">, </span>in no way do I abandon<span style="font-weight: normal;"> this enduring </span>humanity<span style="font-weight: normal;">: I will say that </span>it <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">is beautiful and admirable only to the extent that the instant possesses and intoxicates</span> it<span style="font-weight: normal;">, but this does not imply of my part any overestimation of the duration of the instant, doomed, from beginning to end, to a vanishing splendor. It even seems to me that </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a movement that carries me beyond limits is more helpful than an oppressive worry</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> and a fear </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">of the future</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; font-weight: normal;">, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">which lead to</span> eloquence and <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> common</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">overemphasis on</span> action the powerlessness of this world, established by the primary of action, and by <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the atomic bomb, the latest expression of this powerlessness,</span> <strong><u>is obviously detestable</u></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span>And if I have spoken of a world of sovereign sensibility, it is not only because the sensible value of Hersey’s book leads me to it. It’s because-I cannot doubt it-this world of sovereign sensibility, that is, of the primacy of the instant, is the only one where the dead ends I have pointed out might be gotten around (though of itself, at least at first, this sensibility could not be the motor of action). Everyone knows that the industrial development of the United States has reached, from this point on, such a high level that the United States must no longer expect compensation for its overproduction, which it has to sell abroad. This difficulty in finding outlets must itself, on the other hand, speed up the growth of its productive power. One cannot forget in this light that the mobilization of atomic energy, in the form of the bomb, is likely to increase to an important extent the resources of productive energy (the production for military purposes of explosive uranium or of plutonium could even in a short time release as a by-product large quantities of heat available for electricity.) Thus the normal and necessary progress of American activity should without particular effort lead to the outfitting of the entire globe without any corresponding compensation. And it is not completely utopian to evoke this possibility, if it is already given in the nature of the present economy (which does not mean that it is within quick reach nor even ever realizable).<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Worrying about the future is</span></u></strong> from now on <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the only foundation for worrying about the future</span></u></strong>: it is only to the extent that activity generally, by its origin, is based on this worry-and no longer due to a lack of resources-that we are still ruled by concern for the future. Supposing minds freed from such a concern, bodies would immediately be freed as well. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">This situation</span></u></strong>, from the point of view which we have taken up here, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">has</span></u></strong> moreover, other <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">consequences</span></u></strong>. Outfitting the USSR (bringing the USSR in a fairly short period of time up too the superabundant level of the United States) would be less costly to the latter than a military victory. Carrying out such an operation would even, in a sense, be easier than avoiding it. Now this would radically alter the conditions of life throughout the world: beyond a certain point of general—and superabundant—development of productive forces, economic problems each day become more serious (and more strange). They cease to be susceptible to military solutions, which are ruled out by the certainty of wealth—which only the certainty of wealth can rule out: this would be the transition from the primacy of the future to that of the present. It would obviously be childish to deny the very basic difficulties. But it would be equally childish not to see that <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a dead end demands</span></u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">despite the difficulties</span></u></strong>, <strong><u>this impossible leap</u></strong>: <span style="font-weight: normal;">in any case </span>the untenable nature of the present system is complete<span style="font-weight: normal;">. </span>The world, trapped in a corner, is doomed to abrupt metamorphosis<span style="font-weight: normal;">. In the end, </span>the old sponge of anxiety that is the world of activity, whose movement leads to destruction, remains at the mercy of the chain reactions of a morality of the instant<span style="font-weight: normal;">, of </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the morality that says</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">: “</span>I am.

<strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; color: black;">The true success of Sax’s sculpture is</span></u></strong><strong><u><span style="color: black;"> in the creation of</span></u></strong><span style="color: black;"> artistic subculture, which I have previously named <strong><u>an excremental community</u></strong>. </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">By “walk[ing] and stoop[ing] and crawl[ing] from the cockpit to the tail gun armament,” through physical union with waste, Sax was able to</span><span style="color: black;"> think “hard about weapons . . . and the men who accompanied” them (76). Thus, she </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">makes the connection between the United States’ way of dealing with waste</span><span style="color: black;"> (garbage) </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">and that nation’s impulse to “waste” or</span> to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">murder the Other</span><span style="color: black;">. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">It is her contention that </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by engaging with its own detritus the nation may be better able to deal with a history of violence</span>. She states to the reporter, We all tried to think about war but I’m not sure we knew how to do this. The poets wrote long poems with dirty words and that’s about as close as we came, actually, to a thoughtful response. Because they had brought something into the world that out-imagined the mind [nuclear weapons]. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">They didn’t even know what to call the early bomb</span></u></strong>. The thing or the gadget or something. And Oppenheimer said, It is merde. I will use the French J. Robert Oppenheimer. It is merde. He meant something that eludes naming is automatically relegated, he is saying, to the status of shit. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">You can’t name it.

It’s also shit because it’s garbage, it’s waste material. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">What I really want to get at is the ordinary thing, the ordinary life behind the thing</span></u></strong>. Because that’s the heart and soul of what we’re doing here. (76-77) <span style="color: black;">In her estimation, </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">bomb is the bowel movement of the natio</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">n</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">, or the feces</span> <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">that is so loathed</span>, that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the nation must quickly flush it off to other countries or bury it within the desert</span><span style="color: black;">. As illustrated in the first chapter, </span>Pynchon also makes this connection and he too suggests that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">our inability to deal with our own deaths, the potential overwhelming of self by an Other, fuels our desire to eliminate those deemed enemy</span><span style="color: black;">. Yet, the reader also knows that <strong><u>this</u></strong> unnamable and truly <strong><u>unfathomable product of the national body was meant as a “gift” to the evil Other</u></strong>. </span>Oddly, that abhorred turd, the excess of the nation, comes to be weapon<span style="color: black;">. Klara </span>Sax suggests that <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the United States attempted to</span> soak the other in “merde” or to <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">push the excess of the nation onto the body of the other in order to “forget” the possibility of our own death or loss; we obsessively maintain the value of our own lives</span><span style="color: black;">—we love our nation—</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">by </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">laying waste to Others</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; color: black;">.</span><span style="color: black;"> Moreover, she argues that this “merde” appears to be outside the experience of citizens (the ultimate “evil”) and yet she concludes her polemic with the metaphorical connection to something that every creature knows intimately: its own droppings. Thus, her play with metaphor, following Oppenheimer, reveals a conundrum; the excrement, garbage or bomb of the nation is the ultimate evil and “foreign” to daily experience and yet the process of excretion is a daily occurrence as the self sloughs off its “waste material.” How does excreta come to stand in for the bomb and why is it associated with evil? How can waste be such a huge part of our daily experience, “an ordinary thing,” and yet be assumed to be “outside” of “civilized” society? </span>For Sax, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">movement with the wasted planes allows her to understand </span>“lived life”—<span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the movements of the bodies</span> of men and women <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">who built the planes and then buried them</span>.

Even if fog cannot be reduced to a science without being caught up in the mechanics of critical sublimity, one might still pursue its tactical uses. <strong><u>There is no question that the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">military is committed to deploying the fog of war</span></u></strong>. <strong><u>The importance of disinformation, propaganda, jamming, covert operations, &quot;PsyOps,&quot; and so on increases as warfare becomes more dependent on technical and tactical knowledge</u></strong>. As the power of reconnaissance and surveillance grows, so does the tactical importance of stealth technology. Virilio remarks that, in the hunt, the speed of perception annuls the distance between the hunter and the quarry. Survival depends on distance: &quot;once you can see the target, you can destroy it&quot; (WC 19, 4). Thus, from now on, &quot;<strong><u>power is in disappearance: under the sea with nuclear submarines</u></strong>, in the air with U2s, spyplanes, or still higher with satellites and the space shuttle&quot; (PW 146). &quot;If %what is perceived is already lost%, it becomes necessary to invest in concealment what used to be invested in simple exploitation of one's available forces -- hence the spontaneous generation of new Stealth weapons. . . . <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">The inversion of the deterrence principle is quite clear: unlike weapons which have to be publicized if they are to have a real deterrence effect, Stealth equipment can only function if its existence is clouded with uncertainty</span></u></strong>&quot; (WC 4). For Virilio, stealth is not a matter of radar-immune bombers alone: it involves a vast &quot;aesthetics of disappearance&quot; that reaches an order of perfection in state terrorism: Until the Second World War -- until the concentration camps -- societies were societies of incarceration, of imprisonment in the Foucauldian sense. The great transparency of the world, whether through satellites or simply tourists, brought about an overexposure of these places to observation, to the press and public opinion which now ban concentration camps. You can't isolate anything in this world of ubiquity and instantaneousness. Even if some camps still exist, this overexposure of the world led to the need to surpass enclosure and imprisonment. This required another kind of repression, which is disappearance. . . . Bodies must disappear. People don't exist. There is a big fortune in this technology because it's so similar to what happened in the history of war. In war, we've seen how important disappearance, camouflage, dissimulation are -- every war is a war of cunning.^34^ The methods of strategic disappearance developed by terrorist states are the most insidious form of secrecy. That is why Virilio, the anti-technologist, believes that the technology of secrecy must be exposed. Every order of stealth weaponry is purely and simply a threat. The aesthetics of disappearance must be reappeared. For Virilio, as well as for the reconnaissance cameras whose history he records, success depends on the logistics of perception, on closing the distance between the critic and his quarry. But what if critics are not only hunters; what if they are the quarry as well? [43] Michel de Certeau points out that, for Clausewitz, the distinction between strategy and tactics is determined not only by scales of conflict (war vs. battle) but by relative magnitudes of power. Strategy is for the strong, and it is deployed in known, visible, mapped spaces; tactics is &quot;an art of the weak,&quot; of those who must operate inside territory controlled by a greater power; it takes place on the ground of the &quot;other,&quot; inside alien space.^35^ It must therefore deploy deception in the face of a power &quot;bound by its very visibility.&quot; De Certeau suggests that even in cases where the weak force has already been sighted, it might use deception to great advantage. This is another lesson from Clausewitz: &quot;trickery is possible for the weak, and often it is his only possibility, as a 'last resort': The weaker the forces at the disposition of the strategist, the more the strategist will be able to use deception.&quot; In the &quot;practice of daily life,&quot; in spaces of signification, in the contests of critical argument, such a tactics of the weak would also apply: Lacking its own place, lacking a view of the whole, limited by the blindness (which may lead to perspicacity) resulting from combat at close quarters, limited by the possibilities of the moment, a tactic is determined by the %absence of power% just as a strategy is organized by the postulation of power. From this point of view, the dialectic of a tactic may be illuminated by the ancient art of sophistic. As the author of a great &quot;strategic&quot; system, Aristotle was also very interested in the procedures of this enemy which perverted, as he saw it, the order of truth. He quotes a formula of this protean, quick, and surprising adversary that, by making explicit the basis of sophistic, can also serve finally to define a tactic as I understand it here: it is a matter, Corax said, of &quot;making the worse argument seem the better.&quot; In its paradoxical concision, this formula delineates the relationship of forces that is the starting point for an intellectual creativity that is subtle, tireless, ready for every opportunity, scattered over the terrain of the dominant order and foreign to the rules laid down and imposed by a rationality founded on established rights and property. (38) And yet it is rare that any of this ever occurs to critics, who seem to believe that &quot;subversion&quot; consists of vicarious identification with subversives, and of telling everything one knows to one's enemies. <strong><u>It is</u></strong> nonetheless already <strong><u>the case that</u></strong>, in critical discourse, <strong><u>behind all the humanistic myths of communication</u></strong>, understanding, <strong><u>and interpretive fidelity, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">one finds the tactical value of misinterpretations</span></u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">In an argument it is</span> often <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">crucial for combatants not to know their enemy</span>, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to project</span>instead a paper figure</u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">a distortion</span></u></strong><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">, <strong><u>against which they can conceive and reinforce their own positions</u></strong></span>. %Intelligence%, here, is not only knowledge of one's enemies but the tactical lies one tells about them, even to oneself. <strong><u>This is so regular a phenomenon of discursive conflict that it cannot be dismissed as an aberration that might be remedied through better communication, better listening skills, more disinterested criticism</u></strong>. One identifies one's own signal in part by jamming everyone else's, setting it off from the noise one generates around it. <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">There is</span>, in other words, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">already plenty of fog in discursive warfare, and yet we tend to remain passive in the face of it, and for the most part completely and uncritically committed to exposing ourselves to attack</span></u></strong>. Imagine what might be possible for a writing that is not insistently positional, not devoted to shoring itself up, to fixing itself in place, to laying out all its plans under the eyes of its opponents. Nothing, after all, has been more fatal for the avant-gardes than the form of the manifesto. If only surrealism had been more willing to lie, to dissimulate, to abandon the petty narcissism of the position and the desire to explain itself to anyone who would listen, and instead explored the potential offered it by the model of the secret society it also hoped to be. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Intellectual warfare must</span></u></strong> therefore <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">investigate </span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: aqua; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the tactical advantages of deception and clandestini</span><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">ty</span></u></strong> over the habitual, quasi-ethical demands of clarity and forthrightness, let alone the narcissistic demands of self-promotion and mental exhibitionism,<strong><u>from however fortified a position</u></strong>. <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">If to be seen by the enemy is to be destroyed, then intellectual warfare must pursue its own stealth technology</span></u></strong>. Self-styled intellectual warriors will explore computer networks not only as more rapid means of communication and publishing but as means for circumventing publication, as semi-clandestine lines of circulation, encoded correspondence, and semiotic speed. There will be no entirely secure secrecy, just as there are no impregnable positions -- that too is Virilio's argument -- but a shrouded nomadism is already spreading in and around major discursive conflicts. There are many more than nine grounds, but the rest are secret. IX. Cemetery: [45] When the notion that knowledge is not only power but a mode of warfare has gained sufficient currency, criticism will take it upon itself to develop the strategic implications of thought, and to combat the coordination of the &quot;knowledge industries&quot; with the military-industrial complex. Here, however, <strong><u>on this final ground, already razed by the self-consuming turbulence of battle, <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the project of war study is</span> neither to serve the state nor to oppose it, but rather <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to trivialize the very idea of war, as we trivialize everything we take up as sublime</span></u></strong>. [46] Even as it imposes itself with unprecedented force, intellectual warfare is already dead. It is death carried out by other means. <strong><u>Do not mistake this claim</u></strong>. <strong><u>It has nothing to do with saying that war talk will stop; on the contrary, we will be subjected to it as never before precisely because it is dead</u></strong>. Let me repeat this essay's fundamental law: The object of criticism is always a phenomenalization of some systemic device of discourse, and it always appears in a surrogate form at the very moment it is no longer functional. The task in respect to the knowledge and critique of war is thus not developmental but %simulacral%, a term whose own recent fate attests to its truth. Everything that Baudrillard's theory of simulation was about happened to the theory itself: the sublime disappearance of its own referent through its obscene overexposure, its precipitous reduction to a mere bit of intellectual currency that quickly expended all its value and force. But what if that is <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">the task of intellectual warfare</span></u></strong> as well: <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">not to advance</span> and defend the <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">new truths</span> of war but <span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to ruin them in the very act of construing them</span></u></strong>, <strong><u><span style="background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">to level whatever criticism has assigned to itself of war's sublimity, to recast it in the proxy forms of mental war toys and pitch them about in mock combats, in ritual battles for possession of the dead, waged in the name of the dead and on dead ground</span></u></strong>, and most of all to cast their shades across the future.<br />

Their authoritarian direction may have been meant to lead to a death of hierarchy, but only through a psychic “individuality” and “spirituality.” T**__rue, their model was based on potlatch, but the inner motivation of potlatch for them was not the “//nothing of pure expenditure,” but rather the energy of the isolated “person__**.” So **__even while their planning__** too **__may be conceived as a “planning to end planning,” it is applied from outside__**—through an authoritarian state—**__andits end is self-glorification under the protection of that same state__**. **__Confrontation, so integral to potlatch, is completely denied__** (indeed the abolition of the proletariat is presented as the elimination of class conflict), and we realize that for Dandieu and Aron the affirmation of “primitive” expenditure was nothing more than a justification of a Nietzschean “personal” force.**__For Bataille__**, on the other hand, **__the end of planning__**—**__in both__** senses of the word “end,” both**__goal and death__**—**__lies in the “lucidity” of the mystical state, a lucidity that opens onto the extinction of society, the individual, and the state.-PLAN – THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE AND RESTRICT THE ROLE AND MISSIONS OF THE UNITED STATES NUCLEAR ARSENAL THAT ARE NOT ARTISTIC."></a><strong>PLAN – THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE AND RESTRICT THE ROLE AND MISSIONS OF THE UNITED STATES NUCLEAR ARSENAL THAT ARE NOT ARTISTIC.</strong></h2>

<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Abstract language and a penchant for distinctions are</u></span></strong> typical of philosophy, intrinsically <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>unobjectionable, often a pleasure</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>It is</u></strong></span> continuous <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>abstraction while speaking of actual or imagined horror that disturbs us</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <span class="underline">Abstract discussion of warfare is both the tool and the privilege of those who imagine themselves as the</span> (<span class="underline">potential</span>) <span class="underline">users of weapons</span></span>. The victims, if they can speak at all, speak quite differently:<br />
An account of a nuclear blast’s effects by a US defense intellectual: [You have to have ways to maintain communications in a] nuclear environment, a situation bound to include EMP blackout, brute force damage to systems, a heavy jamming environment, and so on.24<br />
An account by a Hiroshima survivor:<br />
Everything was black, had vanished into the black dust, was destroyed. Only the flames that were beginning to lick their way up had any color. From the dust that was like a fog, figures began to loom up, black, hairless, faceless. They screamed with voices that were no longer human. Their screams drowned out the groans rising everywhere from the rubble, groans that seemed to rise from the very earth itself.25<br />
It should become apparent then, that our concern about abstract language is not only relevant to the framing of Question Two, but to its content – the justifiability of nuclear weapons’ use – as well. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It is easier to contemplate and “justify” the use of nuclear weapons in the abstract language of defense intellectuals than in the descriptive, emotionally resonant language of the victim</span></span>; from the perspective of the user rather than the victim. Anti-war feminists note that detailed, focal attention to the human impact of weapons’ use is not only considered out of bounds in security professionals’ discourse; it is also delegitimated by its association with the “feminine,” with insufficient masculinity, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">as is evident in this excerpt of an interview with a physicist</span></span>:<br />
“<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Several colleagues and I were working on modeling counterforce nuclear attacks, trying to get realistic estimates of the number of immediate fatalities</span></span> that would result from different deployments. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">At one point, we re-modeled a particular attack</span></span>, using slightly different assumptions, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">and found that instead of there being 36 million immediate fatalities, there would only be 30 million. And everybody was sitting around nodding, saying, ‘Oh yeh, that’s great, only 30 million,’ when all of a sudden, I heard what we were saying. And I blurted out, ‘Wait, I’ve just heard how we’re talking</span></span> -- Only 30 million! <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Only 30 million human beings killed instantly?’ Silence fell upon the room. Nobody said a word</span></span>. They didn’t even look at me. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It was awful. I felt like a woman</span></span>.”<br />
After telling this story to one of the authors, the physicist added that he was careful to never blurt out anything indicating that he was thinking about the victims again.26 <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Fear of feeling like a woman</span></span> (or being seen as unmanly) <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">silently works to maintain the boundaries of a distanced, abstract discourse</span></span>, and to sustain the tone of Question Two – <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">a tone which invites us to think abstractly, “objectively” about WMD use, without pausing with human particularities, passions and suffering</span></span>.<br />
Question Three<br />
Question Three asks whether it is ethical to develop and deploy WMD as deterrents only. That is, it asks the classic question of whether it is ethical to have weapons and threaten to use then, even if it is not ethical to use those weapons militarily. As the question is framed, then, “development” and “deployment” appear not as phenomena subject to ethical scrutiny unto themselves, but merely as way-stations, as adjuncts subsumed under what is taken to be the core ethical issue, which is seen as deterrence.<br />
This formulation does not work for us. We need to pause and recognize that there are really several questions enfolded in that one. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">We must not only ask about the ethical status of deterrence, but also whether</span></span> its entailments – <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">development and deployment</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;"> – <span class="underline">are themselves ethical</span></span>.27<br />
One of the constitutive positions of anti-war feminism is that in thinking about weapons and wars, we must accord full weight to their daily effects on the lives of women. We then find that the development and deployment of nuclear weapons, even when they are not used in warfare, exacts immense economic costs that particularly affect women. In the words of a recent Indian feminist essay:<br />
“The social costs of nuclear weaponisation in a country where the basic needs of shelter, food and water, electricity, health and education have not been met are obvious.... [S]ince patriarchal family norms place the task of looking after the daily needs of the family mainly upon women, scarcity of resources always hits women the hardest. Less food for the family inevitably means an even smaller share for women and female children just as water shortages mean an increase in women’s labour who have to spend more time and energy in fetching water from distant places at odd hours of the day.”28<br />
While the US is not as poor a nation as India, Pakistan, or Russia, it has remained, throughout the nuclear age, a country in which poverty and hunger are rife, health care still unaffordable to many, low-cost housing unavailable, with crumbling public schools and infrastructure, all while the American nuclear weapons program has come at the cost of 4.5 trillion dollars.29<br />
In addition to being economically costly, nuclear weapons development has medical and political costs. In the US program, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">many people have been exposed to high levels of radiation, including uranium miners; workers at reactors and processing facilities; the quarter of a million military personnel who took place in “atomic battlefield” exercises; “downwinders” from test sites; and Marshallese Islanders</span></span>.30 Politically, nuclear regimes require a level of secrecy and security measures that exclude the majority of citizens, and in most countries, all women, from defense policy and decision-making.”31<br />
From the perspective of women’s lives, we see not only the costs of the development of nuclear weapons, but also the spiritual, social and psychological costs of deployment.<br />
One cost, according to some feminists, is that “<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Nuclearisation produces social consent for increasing levels of violence</span></span>.32 Another cost, for many, is that <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">nuclear weapons create high levels of tension, insecurity and fear</span></span>. As Arundhati Roy puts it, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">nuclear weapons “[i]nform our dreams. They bury themselves like meat hooks deep in the base of our brains</span></span>.”33<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Further</u></span></strong>, feminists are concerned about the effect of nuclear policy on moral thought, on ideas about gender, and how the two intersect. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Nuclear development may legitimize male aggression, and breed the idea that nuclear explosions give a ‘virility’ to the nation which men as individuals can</u></span></strong> somehow also <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>share</u></span></strong>.<br />
[T]he strange character of <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>nuclear <span class="underline">policy</span></u></span></strong>- making <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">not only sidelines moral and ethical questions, but genders them</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <span class="underline">This elite gets to be represented as rational, scientific</span></span>, modern, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">and</span></span> of course <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">masculine, while ethical questions</span></span>, questions <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">about the social and environmental costs are made to seem emotional, effeminate</span></span>, regressive <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">and not modern</span></span>. This rather dangerous way of thinking, which suggests that questions about human life and welfare are somehow neither modern nor properly masculine questions, or that men have no capacity and concern for peace and morality, can have disastrous consequences for both men and women.34<br />
All in all, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>we find the daily costs of WMD development and deployment</u></span></strong> staggeringly high – <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>in</u></span></strong> and of <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>themselves sufficient to prevent deterrence from being an ethical</u></span></strong> moral <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>option</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>A so-called “realist” response</u></strong></span> to this judgement <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>might</u></span></strong> well pay lip-service to the “moral niceties” it embodies, but then argue that deterrence is worth those costs. Or, perhaps to be more accurate, it might <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">argue that the results of a nuclear attack would be so catastrophic that</span></span> the rest of <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">these considerations are</span></span> really an <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">irrelevant</span></span> distraction; deterring a WMD attack on our homeland is the precondition on which political freedom and social life depend, and so it must be thought about in a class by itself.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>We</u></span></strong> make two rejoinders to this claim. First, we <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>note that</u></span></strong> in the culture of nuclear defense intellectuals, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>even raising the issue of costs is delegitimized</u></span></strong>, in large part through its association with “the feminine.” <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>It is the kind of thing</u></span></strong> that “hysterical housewives” do; something <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>done by people</u></span></strong> not tough and hard enough to look harsh “reality” in the eye, unsentimentally; not strong enough to separate their feelings from theorizing mass death; people <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>who don’t have</u></span></strong> “<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the stones for war</u></span></strong>.” Feminist analysis rejects the cultural division of meaning which devalues anything associated with women or femininity. It sees in that same cultural valuing of the so-called “masculine” over the so-called “feminine” an explanation of why it appears so self-evident to many that what is called “military necessity” should appropriately be prioritized over all other human necessities. And it questions the assumptions that bestow the mantle of “realism” on such a constrained focus on weapons and state power. Rather than simply being an “objective” reflection of political reality, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">we understand this thought system as</span></span> 1) a partial and distorted picture of reality, and 2) <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">a major contributor to creating the very circumstances it purports to describe and protect against</span></span>.<br />
Second, just as feminists tend to be skeptical about the efficacy of violence, they might be equally skeptical about the efficacy of deterrence. Or, to put it another way, if war is a “lie,” so is deterrence. This is not, of course, to say that deterrence as a phenomena never occurs; no doubt one opponent is sometimes deterred from attacking another by the fear of retaliation. But rather deterrence as a theory, a discourse and set of practices underwritten by that discourse, is a fiction.<br />
Deterrence theory is an elaborate, abstract conceptual edifice, which posits a hypothetical relation between two different sets of weapons systems – or rather, between abstractions of two different sets of weapons systems, for in fact, as both common sense and military expertise tells us, human error and technological imperfection mean that one could not actually expect real weapons to function in the ways simply assumed in deterrence theory. Because deterrence theory sets in play the hypothetical representations of various weapons systems, rather than assessments of how they would actually perform or fail to perform in warfare, it can be nearly infinitely elaborated, in a never ending regression of intercontinental ballistic missile gaps and theater warfare gaps and tactical “mini- nuke” gaps, ad infinitum, thus legitimating both massive vertical proliferation and arms racing.<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Deterrence theory</span></span> is also a fiction in that it <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">depends upon</span></span> “<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial;

-moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">for whom what counts as</span></span> “<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial;

-moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is</span></span> the same, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">independent of culture, history, or individual difference</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial;

-moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">perfectly understanding the meaning of</span></span> “<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial;

-moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">communicated</span></span> by military actions, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">despite dependence on technologies that</span></span> sometimes <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial;

-moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">cultural difference and the lack of communication that is part of being</span></span> political enemies; despite the difficulties of ensuring mutual understanding <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial;

-moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It depends on those</span></span> same “rational <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">actors</span></span>” <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">engaging in a very specific</span></span> kind of <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">calculus that includes one set of variables</span></span> (e.g., <u>weapons size, deliverability, survivability, as well as the “credibility” of their and their opponent’s threats</u>), <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">and excludes other variables</span></span> (<u>such as domestic political pressures, economics, or individual subjectivity</u>). What is striking from a feminist perspective is that even while “realists” may worry that some opponents are so “insufficiently rational” as to be undeterrable, this does not lead them to search for a more reliable form of ensuring security, or an approach that is not so weapons-dependent.<br />
Cynthia Cockburn, in her study of women’s peace projects in conflict zones, describes one of the women’s activities as helping each other give up “dangerous day dreams.”35 From a feminist anti-war perspective, having WMD as deterrents is a dangerous dream. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">The dream of perfect rationality and control which underwrites deterrence theory</span></span> is a dangerous dream, since it <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">legitimates constructing a system that only could be</span></span> (relatively) <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">safe if that perfect</span></span> rationa lity and <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">control were actually possible</span></span>. Deterrence theory itself is a dangerous dream because it justifies producing and deploying WMD, thereby making their accidental or purposive use possible (and far more likely) than if they were not produced at all, nor deployed in such numbers. “Realists” are quick to point out the dangers of not having WMD for deterrence when other states have them. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Feminist perspectives suggest that that danger only appears so self-evidently greater than the danger of having WMD if you discount as “soft” serious attention to the costs of development and deployment</span></span>.<br />
<strong>NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY ROOTED IN THE SEPARATION BETWEEN “SPIRIT” AND “BODY” REQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DUAL SELF THAT SEPARATES AND SUPPRESSES EMOTIVE, EMBODIED FORMS OF KNOWING.

If one approaches the explosion of a nuclear weapon as if this were symptomatic of an underlying mental condition, certain facets begin to take on metaphorical meaning. <strong><u>Even <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the simplest physical aspects of a nuclear chain reaction carry</span></u></strong> a <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>psychological</u></span></strong> <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>significance</u></span></strong>. <strong><u>In order <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">for a chain reaction to be created</span>, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the atom must be split apart</span>, the fabric of <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">matter</span> has to be <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">torn asunder</span></u></strong>. In a different vein, it is important to realize that the first atomic weapons were dropped over a people regarded in the demonology of our civilization as racially inferior. Tangentially, and carrying a similar significance, the first nuclear device exploded over Bikini Atoll had a pin-up of Rita Hayworth pasted to its surface. And then, taking from a history that has largely been forgotten or ignored, the prototype of the first missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads was invented and designed in the Third Reich. And those first rockets, the German V-2 rockets, were produced in underground tunnels by prisoners of concentration camps who were worked to death in this production.<br />
These facts of the existence of nuclear weaponry can lead us to a deeper understanding of the troubled mind that has created our current nuclear crisis. To begin at one particular kind of beginning, with the history of thought, one can see the philosophical roots of our current crisis in the splitting of the atom. In the most basic terms, what occurs when the atom is split is a division between energy and matter. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Until this century, modern science assumed matter and energy to be separate. This assumption began</u></span></strong> not with scientific observation but <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>out of</u></span></strong> a <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>religious bias</u></span></strong>. Examining the early history of science, one discovers that the first scientists were associated with and supported by the church (as was most scholarship at that time) and that they asked questions derived from Christian theology. “What is the nature of light?” a question intimately bound up with the theory of relativity and quantum physics began as a religious question. And <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the guiding paradigm of the religion that posed this question has been a fundamental dualism degraded regions, belonging to the devil and corruption</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>Spirit</u></strong></span>, or the realm of pure intellect and heavenly influence, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>belonged to God</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">, <strong><u>and was</u></strong>, <strong><u>in human experience</u></strong>, <strong><u>won only at the expense of flesh</u></strong></span>.<br />
Of course, science does not recognize the categories of spirit and matter any longer, except through a process of translation. The new vocabulary, though, the old dualism has been preserved. Now, matter the equivalent of spirit, is described as a free agent, inspiring and enlivening. Newtonian physics continued the old dualism, but Einsteinian physics does not.<br />
<strong><u>When <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Einstein</span> discovered the formula that eventually led to the development of the atomic bomb, what he <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">saw</span> was <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">a continuum between matter and energy, instead of a separation</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">What we call solid matter is not solid, nor is it static</span></u></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>Matter is</u></strong></span>, instead, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>a process of continual change</u></span></strong>. <strong><u>There is no way to divide the energy of this motion from the physical property of matter.

And finally, <strong><u>with the new physics, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the</span> old <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">line between subject and object has</span> also <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">disappeared</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">According to Heisenberg’s Principle of Uncertainty, whatever we observe we change through our participation. Objectivity with its implied superiority and control has also vanished</span></u></strong>.<br />
One might imagine that with the disappearance of a scientific basis for dualism and the appearance of a physical view that is unified and whole a different philosophy might arise, one which might help us make peace with nature. But instead <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>what this civilization chose to do with this new insight was to find a way to separate matter from energy</u></span></strong> (it is spoken of as “liberating” the energy from the atom). And <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>this separation has in turn produced a technology of violence which has divided the world into two separate camps who regard each other as enemies</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. </span><br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The real enemy</u></span></strong>, however, <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">in dualistic thinking</span>, is hidden: the real enemy <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is ourselves</span></u></strong>. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The same dualism which imagines matter and energy to be separate also divides human nature, separating what we call our material existence from consciousness</u></span></strong>. This dualism is difficult to describe without using dualistic language. Actually, the mind cannot be separated from the body. The brain is part of the body, and is affect by blood flow, temperature, nourishment, muscular movement. The order and rhythm of the body, bodily metaphors, are reflect in the medium of thought, in our patterns of speech. Yet, we conceive of the mind as separate and above the body. And through a subtle process of socialization since birth, we learn to regard the body and our natural existence as something inferior, and without intelligence. Most of the rules of polite behavior are designed to conceal the demands of the body. We excuse ourselves, and refer to our bodily functions through euphemism.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>From this dualistic frame of mind two selves are born: one acknowledged and one hidden</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>The acknowledged self identifies with spirit, with intellect, with what we imagine is free of the influence of natural law. The hidden self is part of nature, earthbound, inextricable from the matrix of physical existence</u></strong></span>. We have become very seriously alienated from this denied self. So seriously that <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>our alienation has become a kind of self-hatred, and this self-hatred is leading us today toward the suicidal notion of nuclear combat</u></span></strong>.<br />
Of course, the body and mind are not separate. And ironically, the warfare incipient between our ideas of who we are and who we really are is made more intense through this unity. Consciousness cannot exclude bodily knowledge. We are inseparable from nature, dependent on the biosphere, vulnerable to the processes of natural law. We cannot destroy the air we breath without destroying ourselves. We are reliant on one another for our survival. We are all mortal. And this knowledge comes to us, whether we want to receive it or not, with every breath.<br />
<strong><u>The dominant philosophies of this civilization have attempted to posit a different order of being over and against this bodily knowledge. According to this order of being, we are separate from nature and hence above natural process. In the logic of this order, we are meant to dominate nature, control life, and in some sense felt largely unconsciously, avoid the natural event of death</u></strong>.<br />
Yet, in order to maintain a belief in this hierarchy one must repress bodily knowledge. And this is no easy task. <strong><u>Our own knowledge of our own natural existence comes to us not only with every breath, but with hunger, with intimacy, with dreams, with all the unpredictable eventualities of life</u></strong>. Our imagined superiority over nature is constantly challenged by consciousness itself. Consciousness emergence from and is immersed in material experience Consciousness is not separated from perception, which is not to sensuality, and as such cannot be separated from matter. Even through the process of the most abstract thought, we cannot entirely forget that we are part of nature. <strong><u>In the biosphere nothing is ever entirely lost. Death itself is not an absolute end, but rather a transformation. What appears to be lost in a fire becomes heat and ash. So, too, no knowledge can ever really be lost to consciousness</u></strong>. It must remain, even if disguised as a mere symbol of itself.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>If I choose to bury a part of myself, what I bury will come back to haunt me in another form, as dream, or fear, or projection</u></span></strong>. This civilization, which has buried part of the human self, has created many projections. Out of the material of self-hatred several categories of otherness have been fashioned existing on a mass scale and by social agreement, these categories form a repository for our hidden selves.<br />
<strong><u>The misogynist’s idea of women is a fundamental category of otherness for this civilization. In the ideology of misogyny, a woman is a lesser being than a man. And the root cause of her inferiority is that she is closer to the earth</u></strong>, more animal, and hence, material in her nature. She is thus described as more susceptible to temptations of the flesh (or devils, or serpents), <strong><u>more emotional and hence less capable of abstract thought than a man. Similarly in the ideology of racism, a person with dark skin is perceived as, at one and the same time, more sensual and erotic and less intelligent</u></strong>.<br />
During the rise of fascism in Europe, a fictitious document was created called the <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>. In this “document” Jewish elders plan to corrupt and eventually seize Aryan bloodlines through the rape and seduction of Aryan women. If one has projected a part of the self upon another, one must always be afraid that this self will return, perhaps even entering one’s own bloodstream. But what is equally significant about this myth, and much of the racist and anti-Semitic imagination, is that a sexual act, and especially rape, lies at the heart of its mythos.<br />
It was in writing a book on pornography that I first began to understand the ideology of misogynist protection. Since so much in pornography is violent, I began to ask myself why sexual experience is associated with violence. This is a question which poses itself again in the context of nuclear weaponry, not only because Rita Hayworth’s image happened to adorn an experimental nuclear bomb, nor simply because of the phallic shape of the missile, nor the language employed to describe the weapons—the first atomic bomb called “little boy,” the next “big boy”—but also because of the sexualization of warfare itself, the eroticization of violence in war, the supposed virility of the soldier, the test of virility which is supposed to take place on the battlefield, and the general equivalency between masculine virtues and prowess in battle.<br />
Over time in my study of pornography I began to understand pornographic imagery as an expression of the fear of sexual experience itself. Sexual experience takes one back to a direct knowledge of nature and of one’s own body before culture has intervened to create the delusion of dominance. It is part of the nature of sexual pleasure and of orgasm to lose control. And finally the feel of a woman’s breast, or of human skin against bare skin at all, must recall infancy and the powerlessness of infancy.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>As infants we all experience an understanding of dependence and vulnerability. Our first experience of a natural, material power outside ourselves was through the bodies of our mothers</u></span></strong>. In this way we have all come to associate nature with the body of a woman. It was our mother who could feed us, give us warmth and comfort, or withhold these things. She had the power of life and death over us as natural process does now.<br />
<strong><u>It was</u></strong> also <strong><u>as infants that we confronted what we have come to know as death. What we call death</u></strong>—coldness, isolation, fear, darkness, despair, trembling—<strong><u>is really the experience of an infant</u></strong>. <strong><u>What death really is lies in the dimension of the unknown. But from the infantile experience of what we call death, one can seethe psychological derivation of civilization’s association between women and death</u></strong>. (One sees this clearly in the creation myth from Genesis, as Eve the seductress brings death into the world.) <strong><u>In this sense, too, sexual experience returns one to a primal fear of death. And through this understanding one can begin to see that at the center of the impulse to rape is the desire to dominate the power of sexual experience itself, and to deny the power of nature as this is felt through sexual experience</u></strong>.<br />
The connection between sexuality and violence exists as a kind of subterranean theme in the fascists and authoritarian mentality. In several places in Jacobo Timmerman’s book, <em>Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number</em>, he points out a relationship between the violence of the dictator and a pornographic attitude toward sexuality. Imprisoned and tortured himself, he recalls that those who did not do “a good scrubbing job” when ordered to clean the prison floors, were forced to “undress, lean over with their index finger on the ground and have them rotate round and round dragging their finger on the ground without lifting it. You felt,” he writes, “as if your kidneys were bursting.” Another punishment was to force prisoners to run naked along the passageway “reciting aloud sayings dictated” tot hem, such as “my mother is a whore, I masturbate, I respect the guard, the police love me.”<br />
That, to the fascist mind, “the other” represents a denied part of the self becomes clear in the following story about Adolf Hitler. In a famous passage in <em>Mein Kampf</em> he describes the moment when he decided to devote his life’s work to anti-Semitism. He recounts that while walking through the streets of Vienna, he happened to see an old man dressed in the traditional clothes of Jewish men in that city at that time i.e., in a Kaftan. The first question he asked was, “Is this man Jewish?” and he corrected himself, and replaced that question with another, “is this man German?”<br />
If you are to project a denied self onto another, you must first establish that this other is different from yourself. Were you to notice any similarity, you would be endangered by the perception that what you project may belong to you. The question that Hitler asked himself became a standard part of German textbooks in the Third Reich. A stereotypical portrait of a Jewish man’s face was shown under the question, “Is this man German?” and the correct answer the students were taught was, of course, “No.” In fact, Germany became a nation rather late. For centuries it existed as a collection of separate tribes, and one of the oldest tribes in that nation was Jewish.<br />
Hitler’s story of the man in the Kaftan became a standard part of his orations. He would become nearly hysterical at times telling the story, and is said to have even vomited once. In the light of this history, a seemingly trivial story from Hitler’s early life becomes significant. As a young art student he bought his clothes secondhand, because like many students, he was poor. In this period most of those selling secondhand clothing were Jewish and Hitler bought from a Jewish clothes seller one item of clothing that he wore so often that he began to be identified with this apparel. And that was a Kaftan.<br />
What is also interesting historically is that the Kaftan was a form of medieval German dress. Exiled from Germany during a period of persecution, many Jews, who then lived in ghettoes, continued to wear this traditional German dress and were still fearing it when they returned to Germany centuries later. Not only did Hitler fail to recognize an image of himself encountered in the streets of Vienna, but so did an entire generation of Germans. So an entire civilization, that to which we all belong, is in conflict with a part of human nature, which we try to bury and eventually even destroy.<br />
<strong><u>The weapons that now threaten the destruction of the earth and life as we know it were developed because the allied nations feared that the fascist powers were making them</u></strong>. The missiles which are now part and parcel of nuclear weaponry were first developed in the Third Reich. <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It is crucial now in our understanding of</span> ourselves and <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">what it is in us that has led to the nuclear crisis</span> that we begin to look at the Nazi holocaust as a mirror, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">finding a self-portrait in “the other” who is persecuted and denied, and seeing a part of ourselves too in the fascist dictator who would destroy that denied self</span></u></strong>.<br />
The illusion this civilization retains, that we are somehow above nature, is so severe that in a sense we have come to believe that we can end material existence without dying. The absurdity of nuclear weaponry as a strategy for defense, when the use of those weapons would annihilate us, would in itself argue this. But if you look closely at the particulars of certain strategies within the overall nuclear strategy you again encounter the same estranged relationship with reality. A man who used to be in Reagan’s administration, T.K. Jones, actually proposed that a viable method of civil defense would be to issue each citizen a shovel.<br />
It took an eight year old boy to point out that this plan cannot work because after you dig a hole and get into it for protection, someone else must stand outside the hole and shovel dirt on top. The Pentagon refers to its strategies for waging nuclear war as SIOP. One year the Pentagon actually went through the paces of a SIOP plan. As a literary scholar I found the scenario which the Pentagon wrote for this dramatization very disturbing. The Pentagon could write this play any way that they wished, and they wrote that the President was killed with a direct hit to the self. But this death is not experienced as real. Though the earthly self dies, in the Pentagon’s version, the sky self does not die; The Vice President goes up in an airplane fully equipped to wage nuclear war by computer. There is such a plane flying above us now, and at every hour of the day and night.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The division that we experience from the natural self, the self that is material and embedded in nature, impairs our perceptions of reality</u></span></strong>. As Timmerman writes:<br />
The devices are recurrent in all totalitarian ideology, to ignore the complexities of reality, or even eliminate reality, and instead establish a simple goal and a simple means of attaining that goal.<br />
<strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Proceeding both from</span> an alienation from nature, and <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">an estrangement from the natural self, our civilization replaces reality with an idea of reality</span>. Through maintaining the supremacy of the idea, one creates a delusion of a supernatural power over nature</u></strong>.<br />
In the development of this alienation as a slate of mind, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the delusion of well-being and safety eventually becomes more important than the realistic considerations which will actually effect well-being or safety</u></span></strong>. Hannah <strong><u>Arendt writes</u></strong> <strong><u>of an illusionary world created by totalitarian movements”…in which through sheer imagination uprooted masses can feel at home, and are spared the never ending shocks which real life and real experience deal to human beings</u></strong>…” Later, in the <em>Origins of Totalitarianism</em>, she speaks of the mass state of mind under the third Reich in which people ceased to believe in what they perceived with their own eyes and ears, preferring the conflicting reports issued by the <em>Fuhrer</em>.<br />
One encounters the same failure to confront reality in Stalin’s psychology as it is described by Isaac Derutchsher in his biography:<br />
He [Stalin] was now completely possessed by the idea that he could achieve a miraculous transformation of the whole of Russia by a single <em>tour de force</em>. He seemed to live in a half-real and half-dreamy world of statistical figures and indices of industrial orders and instructions, a world in which no target and no objective seemed beyond his and the party’s grasp.<br />
<strong><u>During the period of forced collectivization of farms, Stalin destroyed actual farms before the collectivized farms were created</u></strong>. As Deutscher writes, <strong><u>it was as if a whole nation destroyed its real houses and moved “lock, stock and barrel into some illusory buildings</u></strong>.”<br />
<strong><u>We are</u></strong>, in fact, <strong><u>now living in such an illusory building, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the entire manner in which plans for a nuclear war are</span> discussed, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">rehearsed, and envisioned, partakes of</span></u></strong> a kind of unreality, an <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>anesthetized and</u></span></strong> nearly <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>automatic functioning</u></span></strong>, <strong><u>in <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">which</span> cerebration <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is</span> strangely <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">unrelated to experience or feeling</span></u></strong>. <strong><u>The Generals imagine themselves conducting nuclear war from a room without windows, with no natural light, choosing strategies and targets by looking at enormous computerized maps</u></strong>. <strong><u>The language they use to communicate their decisions is all in code. No one uses the word “war,: the word “bomb,” the word “death,” or the words “blood,” “pain,” “loss,” “grief,” “shock,” or “horror.”</u></strong> In Siegfried Sassoon’s recollection of World War I, he remembers encountering a man, a soldier like himself, who has just learned that his brother was killed. The man is half-crazy, tearing his clothes off, and cursing at war. As Sassoon passed beyond this man into the dark of the war, he could still hear “his uncouth howlings.” It is those “uncouth howlings” that those who are planning nuclear war have managed to mute in their imagination.<br />
But of course that howling is not entirely lost. In the shared imagination of our civilization, it is the “other” who carries emotion, the women who howl. And far from wishing to protect the vulnerable and the innocent, it is the secret desire of this civilization to destroy those who feel, and to silence feeling. This hidden desire becomes apparent in pornography where women are pictured in a traditional way as weaker than men and needing protection, and yet, where erotic feeling is freely mixed with the desire to brutalize and even murder women.<br />
One can find a grim picture of the insane logic of the alienated mind of our civilization in the pornographic film “Peeping Tom.” The hero of this movie is a pornographic film maker. He has a camera armed with a spear. As he photographs a woman’s naked body, the camera releases the weapon and he makes a record of her death agonies. The final victory of the alienated mind over reality is to destroy that reality (and one’s experience of it) and replace reality with a record of that destruction. One finds the same pattern in the history of actual atrocities. In California, a man lured women into the desert with a promise of work as pornographic models. There, while he tortured and murdered them, he made a photographic record of the event. The Nazis themselves kept the best documentation of atrocities committed in the concentration camps. And the most complete records of the destruction of native Americans have been kept by the United States military.<br />
Now, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the state of conflict in which this civilization finds itself has worsened</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>The enemy is not simply “the other” but life itself</u></strong></span>. And it is in keeping with the insane logic of alienation that the Pentagon has found a way that it believes we can win nuclear war. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>We have situated satellites in space that will record the process of annihilation of life, and the Pentagon counts, as a future victor, that nation which has gathered the best documentation of the destruction</u></span></strong>.<br />
There is however another form of reflection available to us by virtue of our human nature. We are our own witnesses. We can see ourselves. We are part of nature. And nature is not divided. Matter is intelligent. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Feeling</u></span></strong>, sense, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the needs of the body, all that has been consigned to the “other,” made the province of women, of darkness, contains a deeper and a sustaining wisdom</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>It remains for us to empower that knowledge and to carry it into the world</u></strong></span>.

<strong>MERE SURVIVAL IS INSUFFICIENT IN THE FACE OF ONGOING NUCLEAR WAR. DEATH IS INEVITABLE BUT AFFIRMING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FACE OF ANNIHILATION IS A LIFE AFFIRMING ACT NECESSARY FOR INDIVIDUAL VALUE TO EMERGE.</strong><br />

To focus only upon survival reveals technocratic politics as opportunistic. Doubtless, everybody wants to survive, but not everybody wants to survive in a way that values life or dignifies it. The nuclear age, after all, can be interpreted as an augury of Armageddon, and responded to as such. Thus we have a rash of survivalist periodicals, and cults to match, in the U.S. The premise of this movement is to imagine a Hobbesian society of “all against all” as a result of the bomb, and to encourage people to revert to open brutality in order to survive. For example, a recent issue of the magazine <em>Survival Guide</em> Describes how to make stone-age weapons (“Using the legacy of prehistory to survive without the benefit of conventional weapons”), and offers T-shirt with the slogans such as “Gun control is being able to hit your target” and “Peace through superior firepower.” While this sort of thing might be too repulsive for the average citizen, what is one to do about the fact that a number of those fundamentally responsible for the conduct of the war in Vietnam (for example, William Colby, former director of the CIA, and originator of the Phoenix program of assassinations in Vietnam) have clambered aboard the peace movement, evidently out of fear for their lives. The question is not whether such as Colby—or Presidential adviser McGeorge Bundy or Robert McNamara, former head of the Deparment of Defense and World Bank—are to be forgiven for their sins, now that they have declared themselves for the nuclear freeze. It is rather to establish a basis of antinuclear politics which will allow such questions to be considered. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Mere survival is not enough</u></span></strong>: everybody wants to survive, mass murderers along with innocent children. An antinuclear movement has to establish conditions where the value of life is affirmed, and then consider whether or not somebody is entitled to join it. Technocracy blurs this point and, in so doing, critically weakens the essential thrust against the state.<br />
Finally, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the use of scare tactics only fertilizes the soil once again for nuclear terror. When we experience nothing but fear, we will stop at nothing to be reassured</u></span></strong>. But who under these conditions, will reassure us best? The state with its salve and its projection of the all-justifying Soviet threat –or the peace movement, proposing the novel and risky course of disarmament? It is no contest. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Unless the peace movement can provide an affirmative vision, it is defeated in advance</u></span></strong>.<br />
If this is the value of the facts, what is the value beyond the facts? I think this can best be seen through a critique of mere survival as the ground for antinuclear politics. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The point is</u></span></strong> not only to survive, but <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>to struggle for a life worth having</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>This means the realization that nuclear war has already been going on</u></strong></span> for some time—<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>and that it has assaulted and degraded us</u></span></strong> during this time. Therefore, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>a life worth living is to be attained through the struggle against the weapons and not simply as an abstract condition for controlling</u></span></strong> or eliminating <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>them</u></span></strong>. Once one appreciates this value, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>there is no settling for arms control</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>Strategic arms are</u></strong></span> themselves <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>an abomination</u></span></strong>, wielded <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>all the time whether or not they ever get exploded</u></span></strong>. Therefore <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>only elimination will do</u></span></strong>. If Messrs, McNamara and Bundy are willing to recognize this truth and to own up to all the havoc that their decisions and ways of governing have wreaked upon the world, then I, for one, would welcome them into the peace movement. If, however, they are simply afraid for their lives because their machine has gone haywire, and wish to confine themselves to tinkering with it so that it becomes a more efficient instrument of domination, then I would prefer to keep my distance from them.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>One does not attack nuclear arms because they do not work properly, nor because they have become suddenly dangerous to their masters</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>One attacks them because they are fiendish instruments of domination</u></strong></span>.

<span class="underline">Evidence of <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">hopelessness is all around us</span></span>. The majority of young people say they do not believe there will be a future of any sort. We shake our heads in dismay, failing to see that our social arrangements produce hopelessness and require it to hold themselves intact. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">But the</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> ontological </span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">possibility for hope is always present, rooted</span></span>, ultimately, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">in “the fact of natality</span></span>.” Arendt’s metaphor, mostly fully elaborated in the following passage from <em>The Human Condition</em>, is worth quoting in full:<br />
<span class="underline">The miracle that saves the world</span>, the realm of human affairs, <span class="underline">from its normal, “natural” ruin is ultimately the fact of natality</span>, in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It is</span></span>, in other words, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the birth of new human beings and the new beginning, the action they are capable of by being born</span></span>. <strong><em><u>Only the full experience of this capacity can bestow upon human affairs faith and hope, those two essential characteristics of human existence</u></em></strong>…that found perhaps their most glorious and most succinct expression in the new words with which the Gospels accounted their “glad tiding”: ‘A Child has been born unto us.’<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The infant, like all beginnings is vulnerable. We must nurture that beginning, not knowing and not being able to control the “end” of the story</u></span></strong>.<br />
Arendt’s evocation of <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">natal imagery</span></span> through its most dramatic urrarrative <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is not</span></span> offered as <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">an abstraction to be endorsed abstractly</span></span>. Rather, she invites us to restore long atrophied dispositions of commemoration and awe; birth, she declares, is a “miracle,” a beginning that renews and irreversibly alters the world. Hers is a fragile yet haunting figuration that stirs recognition of our own vulnerable beginnings and our necessary dependency on others. <strong><u>Placed alongside the reality of human beginnings, many accounts of political beginnings construed as the actions of male hordes</u></strong> or contractionalists <strong><u>seems parodic</u></strong> in part <strong><u>because of the massive denial</u></strong> (<strong><u>of “the female”</u></strong>) <strong><u>on which they depend</u></strong>. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">A “full experience” of the “capacity” rooted in birth helps us to keep before our mind’s eye the living reality of singularities, differences, and individualities rather than a human mass as objects of possible control or manipulation</span></span>.<br />
By offering an alternative genealogy that problemzatizes collective violence and visions of triumph, Arendt devirilizes discourse, not in favor of feminization (for the feminized and masculinized emerged in tandem and both embody dangerous distortions), but politicalization, constituting her male and female objects as citizens who share alike the “faculty of action.” At this juncture, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Arendt’s</u></span></strong> discourse makes contact with that feminism I characterized as a modified vision of the beautiful soul. <span class="underline">Her bracing <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">ideal of the citizen adds political robustness to a feminist picture of women drawn to action from their sense of being and their epistemic and social location. Arendt’s citizen</span></span>, for example, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">may act from her maternal thinking but not as a mother—an important distinction that could help to chasten sentimentalism or claims of moral superiority</span></span>.<br />
But war is the central concern of this essay. Does Arendt’s discourse offer a specifiable orientation toward international relations? Her discourse shifts the ground on which we stand when we think about states and their relations. We become skeptical about the forms and the claims of the sovereign state; we deflate fantasies of control inspired by the reigning teleology of progress; we recognize the (phony) parity painted by a picture or equally “sovereign states” and are thereby alert to the many forms hegemony can take. Additionally, Arendt grants “forgiveness” a central political role as the only way human beings have to break remorseless cycles of vengeance. She embraces an “ascesis,” a refraining or withholding that allows refusal to bring one’s force to bear to surface as a strength not a weakness.<br />
Take the dilemma of the nuclear arms race that seems to have a life and dynamic of its own. From an Arendtian perspective, we see <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>current arms control efforts</u></span></strong> for what they <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>are</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">-<strong><u>the arms race under another name negotiated by a bevy of experts with a</u></strong></span> <strong><u>vested <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">interest in keeping the race alive so they can &quot;control&quot; it</span></u></strong>. On the other hand, <strong><u>her recognition of <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the limiting conditions internal to the international political order precludes a leap into utopian fantasies of world</span> order or total <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">disarmament</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">For neither</span> the arms control option</u></strong> (as currently defined) <strong><u>nor calls for immediate disarmament <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">are bold</span>-<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the first because it is a way of doing business as usual</span>; <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the second because it covertly sustains business as usual by proclaiming &quot;solutions&quot; that lie outside the reach of possibility</span></u></strong>. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Instead</u></span></strong>, Arendt's perspective invites us-<strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">as a</span> strong and dominant <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">nation of awesome potential force</span>-<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">to take unilateral initiatives in order to break symbolically the cycle of vengeance and fear signified by our nuclear arsenals</span></u></strong>. Just as action from an individual or group may disrupt the automisms of everyday life, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>action from a single state may send shock waves that reverberate throughout the system</u></span></strong>. Arendt cannot be pegged as either a &quot;systems dominance&quot; nor &quot;sub-systems dominance&quot; thinker-a form of argumentation with which she has no patience in any case. She recognizes systemic imperatives yet sees space for potentially effective change from &quot;individual (state) action.&quot; <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The war system is so deeply rooted that to begin to dismantle it in its current and highly dangerous form requires bold strokes</u></span></strong>.<br />
At this juncture, intimations of an alternative genealogy emerge. Freeman Dyson suggests the Odyssey or the theme of homecoming rather than the Iliad or the theme of remorseless force as a dominant ur-political myth if we break the deadlock of victims versus warriors. Socrates, Jesus of Nazareth, and Nietzsche, in some of his teachings, emerge as articulators of the prototypical virtues of restraint and refusal to bring all one's power to bear. For it was Nietzsche, from his disillusionment, who proclaimed the <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">only way out of &quot;armed peace&quot; to be a people</span>, distinguished by their wars and victories <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">who</span>, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">from strength</span>, not weakness, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">&quot;break the sword&quot; thereby giving peace a chance</span></u></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. &quot;<strong><u>Rather perish than hate and fear</u></strong>,&quot; <strong><u>he wrote</u></strong>, &quot;<strong><u>and twice rather perish than make onself hated and feared</u></strong></span>.&quot; 40 Historic feminist thinkers and movements who rejected politics as force take center stage rather than being relegated to the periphery in this alternative story.<br />
<strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">To take up war-as-discourse compels us to recognize the powerful sway of</span> received <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">narratives</span> and reminds us that the concepts through which we think about war, peace, and politics get repeated endlessly, shaping debates, constraining consideration of alternatives, often reassuring us that things cannot really be much different than they are</u></strong>. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>As we nod</u></span></strong> an automatic <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>yes</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;"> <strong><u>when we hear the truism</u></strong></span> (though we may despair of the truth it tells) <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">that &quot;there have always been wars,&quot; we acknowledge tacitly that &quot;there have always been war stories</span>,&quot;</u></strong> for wars are deeded to us as texts.

<strong>THE QUEST FOR PEACE IS A QUESTION OF PRACTICE. THE PROBLEM WITH NUCLEAR POLICY IS IT ATTEMPTS TO PRESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF THE FUTURE BY RESTRICTING HUMAN NATURE TO A SELECT FORM OF VIOLENT RELATIONS. THESE PREDICTIONS PROCEED FROM A STATE OF HOPELESSNESS THAT MAKES SURVIVAL IMPOSSIBLE AND NUCLEAR VIOLENCE INEVITABLE. INSTEAD, OUR REJECTION OF NUCLEARISM IS EMBODIED IN AN OPEN HOPE FOR THE FUTURE WHICH DOES NOT SEEK TO PRESCRIBE IT’S CONTENT BUT RATHER RECOGNIZES THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS SURROUNDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR CLOSE THE POSSIBILITY OF HOPE.</strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Walter, Associate Professor and Chairman of Religious Studies at Anna Maria College, Doing the Truth: Peacemaking as Hopeful Activity, <em>A Shuddering Dawn</em>, pg 163</span><br />
We now return to the theme of hope and hopelessness to examine how this sheds light on making peace and making war. As one of the theological virtues, hope proceeds from our rootedness in God. It is nevertheless far from an optimistic attitude to the future. Such an attitude might say “I am optimistic that there will be no nuclear war. Who would be so crazy? Besides, God would not allow it.” Or, “Deterrence has worked so far; it will continue to work.” The optimists have been wrong about every war we have had until now. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The trouble</u></span></strong> with such optimism <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>is</u></span></strong> that it envisions the content of the future; it <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">attempts to predict</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> and so </span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">does not take into account the freedom of history to move beyond our conceptualizations</span></span>.<br />
War-making, including preparing for war, and especially for a protracted nuclear war, involves a similar optimism—that our technological capacity and penchant for control can account for every future contingency. It, too, tries to predict the future (as Clarke Chapman clearly demonstrates in Chapter 8 of this book). <strong><u>But <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">war-making</span></u></strong> also <strong><u>proceeds from hopelessness</u></strong>. <strong><u>It envisions the future simply by extrapolating from a content currently known. From an understanding of the past and the present that is taken as the ultimate potential for the future. It assumes that the unreconciled, unpeaceful world that relies on nuclear weapons is the norm</u></strong>—that conflict is the norm and can be avoided finally only by the threat of greater conflict. <strong><u>It <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">does not see any deeper grounding for human existence than self-interest defined as current or expected benefits</span></u></strong>. To the extent that we see this extrapolation as definitive, there can be no possibility, newness, or surprise, because the ground of imagination has become closed to ongoing future experience.<br />
<strong><u>The maxim “If you want peace, prepare for war” is thus the maxim of hopelessness</u></strong>, of the failure to imagine an open future due to conceptual identification of the structure of the future within the events of the past. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>What <em>we</em> think becomes the future; our sense of its content precludes experiential awareness of the specific, concrete horizon of our being</u></span></strong>. The nuclear vision of the future is thus closed, constricted, profoundly antimetaphorical. (The examples of nuclear fatalism offered by John McDargh in Chapter 6 of this book testify to this.) If there is any saving grace in nuclear weapons, it lies in the Bomb’s power to expose this dimension of the war-making mythos. <strong><u>The prospect of the destruction of the species through war has compelled many people to see war in an entirely new attitude. This now means to see the hopelessness behind <em>all</em> war, to see how removed war is from the true horizon `of our life</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>This is not to say that it is wrong to expect benefits from the future</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>The problem arises when the <em>content</em> of what is expected is separated from awareness of human grounding in a nonmanipulable way in the absolute future, the free future</u></strong>. <span class="underline">To oppose nuclear war</span></span>, on the other hand, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is to become aware of this deepest grounding</span></span>. It is hopeful activity, even if we sense little basis for optimism in current history.

 <strong>UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT MAKES THE STATE NOT EVIL.</strong><br />
<strong><u>KOVEL</u></strong>, 19<strong><u>84</u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Joel, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, pg 190</span><br />
By unilateral disarmament we mean the initiation of disarmament measures by one state. That is, one side says in effect, I will start this thing going, whatever you do—but my beginning is meant to get you to respond in kind. Therefore, what you do is highly important. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Unilateral disarmament is meant</u></span></strong> then <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>to change the field of international relations</u></span></strong>. <strong><u>Its point is less the quantitative difference in arms, than the qualitative difference in dialogue</u></strong>. It is a different kind of discourse between states, not a withdrawal into isolationism. Specifically, <strong><u>it is meant to alter radically the paranoid relations between states that have come to be mediated by arms of increasing technological ferocity</u></strong>. It is thus the logical and necessary consequence of a nonviolent politics, and a break with the chain of historical revenge. Unilateral disarmament is, therefore, the only rational alternative to the existing march towards Armageddon.<br />
Unilateral disarmament is often unfavorably contrasted with bilateral (or multilateral) disarmament. To the commonsense mind <strong><u>it seems so much more safe and practical for all sides to lay down their arms together</u></strong>, <strong><u>after a period of</u></strong> lengthy <strong><u>negotiations</u></strong>, <strong><u>than for one to start things off</u></strong>, <strong><u>and thereby leave itself exposed to the superior force of the other</u></strong>. No doubt it would be better if all sides were to lay down their arms together at once. Better yet had there never been arms in the first place. <strong><u>But</u></strong> <u><strong>states</strong></u>, as we have known them, are not constituted so as to be able to lay down their arms all together. This is because they <strong><u>have always been</u></strong>—<strong><u>at least the ones which have expanded</u></strong>—<strong><u>paranoid apparatuses</u></strong>, <strong><u>built on inner alienation, and the outward projection of Otherness</u></strong>. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>To expect meaningful disarmament to arise from the existing nature and relations of states may seem like realism</u></span></strong>, and is paraded as such—<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>but</u></span></strong> if realism at all, then <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>it is</u></span></strong> of the crackpot kind. It is <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>that realism which rolls over at the command of the existing irrationality</u></span></strong>, and prides itself on the fact. In any case, <strong><u>the usefulness of the institutionalized bilateral means for disarmament can be measured by the fact that not one bullet has been removed from the worlds arsenal through their deliberations</u></strong>. And this is because the states that have sat down at the elegant disarmament tables at Geneva have done so without any alteration in their basic character.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The only hope is for</u></span></strong> at least one of the <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>states to let go of the paranoid structure of its relations with the others</u></span></strong>. This can only be done if the nonviolence generated by its peace movement <em>begins</em> to take hold. We emphasize the word “begins,” because <strong><u>the non violence of states should be seen in the same prefigurative light as that of individuals. It is not an absolute, but a change in direction which</u></strong>, if faithfully followed, <strong><u>will propagate itself</u></strong>. Ideally, this should take place transnationally, through the concerted actions of many peace movements upon their respective states. To some extent, this has been taking place, as the peace movements of Western Europe have influenced first each other, and then the movements in the U.S. and Eastern Europe. The <strong><u>further this process of popular nonviolent contagion can go, the better off</u></strong> <strong><u>the entire world will become</u></strong>. And if it should break through to influence the behavior of any of the state apparatuses, then the beginning we seek will have occurred. The more states affected, and the more each of them is affected, the better off we all will be. <strong><u>This is the most authentic sense of the term</u></strong> bilateral, or, more exactly, multilateral <strong><u>disarmament</u></strong>, as the ideal of disarmament: <strong><u>multi-unilateral disarmament</u></strong>. But, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>so long as one state takes the first step, the rest will have been set on the path toward a non-nuclear world, and even a world without war</u></span></strong>.<br />

A dialectical view of the cultural and economic realms makes room for many forms of oppositional struggle (both attempts to change the production of meanings as well as economic production), not simply a revolution by labor -- a point that is empowering to feminism and ecofeminism, but dismays more orthodox Marxist greens. 9 As Stuart Hall ( 1986 ) has argued, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">economic determinism</span> in Marxism <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">leaves</span></span> &quot;little or <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">no</span></span> theoretical <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">room for</span> </span>ways of conceptualizing the political and ideological dimensions, let alone ways of <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">conceptualizing other types of social differentiation</span></span> [besides class] <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">such as social divisions and contradictions arising around race, ethnicity, nationality, and gender</span></span>&quot; (10). <span class="underline">One</span> conceptual <span class="underline">result of legitimating oppositional struggle in the superstructural realm of culture and ideology is that <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">social change no longer necessarily results only</span></span> <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>from</u></span></strong> mass worker <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">revolution but in more varied and complex ways</span></span>. Ideas stemming from the neo-Marxist development of the concept of dialectical materialism are enabling for both ecofeminism's seemingly contradictory strategies for social change and its potential to effect change even though its proponents can not be subsumed under the category &quot;labor.&quot; From such a perspective, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">both</span></span> socialist ecofeminist <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">strategies for social change aimed at changing material circumstances and cultural ecofeminist strategies</span></span> for social change that are <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">geared more toward changing language, ideas,</span> spirituality, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">and culture are valid and important</span></span>. It would seem that the divergent strategies for social change within ecofeminism are not that incompatible after all.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-weight: normal;">November 7 marks the ninetieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution and the beginning of that dark future that Heine sensed was coming 75 years before Lenin and his Bolsheviks came to power. </span>Since the beginning of recorded history the state has attempted to control the economic activities of its subjects<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">, as well as commanding their personal conduct. </span>But nothing<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> in modern history </span>compared to the communist determination to mold<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> man and </span>society for an alleged paradise on earth. <span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-weight: normal;">What made this experiment in creating a new man in a new society so diabolical was precisely that many in the first generation of Bolshevik leaders truly believed in what they were doing. For example, Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founding head of the Soviet secret police, loved children and said he wanted to make a better world for all of them</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">. </span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt;">To liberate Soviet society from its enemies and make</span><span class="underline"> that better world<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">, he </span>created the vast slave-labor system<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> that became </span>known as the Gulag<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">. </span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-weight: normal;">As part of his studies of government mass murders in the twentieth century, political scientist R. J. Rummel estimated that</span> up to 64 million <span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-weight: normal;">innocent, unarmed men, women, and children</span> were killed in the Soviet Union<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> between 1917 and 1986 </span>in the name of “building socialism<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">.”</span> Sixty-four million is so large a number that it is easy to lose sight of the inhumanity of murder and terror involved<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">. The famous </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt;">Russian sociologist Pitirim A. Sorokin (who went on to found the sociology department at Harvard University) was a young professor in Petrograd (later Leningrad and now St. Petersburg) during and following the Bolshevik Revolution. After he was expelled from Russia in 1922 as an “enemy of the people,” he came to America and published</span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> Leaves from a Russian Diary (1924), which contains the following entry from 1920</span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt;">: </span>The machine of the Red Terror works incessantly. Every day and every night<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">, in Petrograd, Moscow, and all over the country the mountain of the dead grows higher. . . . Everywhere </span>people are shot, mutilated, wiped out of existence. .<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> . . </span>Every night we hear the rattle of trucks bearing new victims. Every night we hear the rifle fire of execution<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">, and often some of us hear from the ditches, where the bodies are flung, faint groans and cries of those who have not died under the guns. </span>People living near these places<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> begin to move away. They </span>cannot sleep. </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">When Sorokin wrote those words the Soviet state was still in its infancy.<span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;"> As the decades went by</span></span>, numerous histories and personal accounts were written about the “socialist experiment” by those who had either escaped or defected </span><span class="underline"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; font-weight: normal;">from the Soviet paradise. Only when the formerly secret archives of the Communist Party and the KGB were partly opened to researchers, just before and then after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, did a fuller and clearer picture come into view about the brutality of the regime. Demitri Volkogonov, a Soviet general-turned-historian, gained access to many of the closed archives during the last years of the Soviet regime and wrote a biography of Stalin titled Triumph and Tragedy (1991). Volkogonov told an American correspondent: I would come home </span></span><span style="font-size: 8.5pt;">from working in Stalin’s archives, and I would be deeply shaken. I remember coming home after reading through the day of December 12, 1938. He signed thirty lists of death sentences that day, altogether about five thousand people, including many he knew personally, his friends. . . . This is not what shook me. It turned out that, after having signed these documents, he went to his personal theater that night and watched two movies, including Happy Guys, a popular comedy of the time. I simply could not understand how, after deciding the fate of several thousand lives, he could watch such a movie. But I was beginning to realize that</span><span class="underline"> morality plays no role for dictators. That’s </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">when I understood why my father was shot, why my mother died in exile,</span><span class="underline"> why millions of people died<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">. </span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">The Donskoi Monastery and Kalitnikovsky Cemetery in Moscow served as a dumping ground for thousands of bodies. <span class="underline"><span style="font-weight: normal;">A Russian historian trying to preserve the memory of these evil times told David Remnick, author of Lenin’s Tomb (1993): “In the purges, every dog in town came to [the cemetery]. That smell you smell now was three times as bad; blood was in the air.” No End with Stalin </span></span></span><span class="underline">The Soviet nightmare did not disappear with Stalin’s death<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> in 1953; </span>it remained at the heart of the system<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> practically </span>to the end<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">. In the 1960s and 1970s Yuri Andropov was the head of the KGB (he later briefly served as general secretary of the Communist Party after Leonid Brezhnev died in 1982 until his own death in 1984). He accepted </span>a view developed by Soviet psychiatry that anyone who opposed the Marxist idea of scientific socialism was</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> by definition </span><span class="underline">mentally disturbed<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> and needed to be “treated” in a psychiatric hospital. This </span>was the fate of Alexei Nikitin<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">, a coal miner </span>who complained about the safety and health conditions in the mines<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> of the U.S.S.R. He was found guilty of subversion and committed to a mental institution in Ukraine. </span>They began using various drugs to bring him back to his socialist senses<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">. His story was told by Kevin Klose in Russia and the Russians (1984): Of all the drugs administered . . . to impose discipline, sulfazine was at the pinnacle of pain. . . . “People injected with sulfazine were groaning, sighing with pain, cursing the psychiatrists and Soviet power, cursing everything in their hearts,” Alexei told us. . . . “If they torture you and break your arms, there is a certain specific pain and you somehow can stand it. But </span>sulfazine is like a drill boring into your body<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> that gets worse and worse until it’s more than you can stand. . . </span>. It is worse than torture, because sometimes torture may end. But this kind of torture may continue for years.” Nikitin endured<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> this drug and several equally terrible ones </span>for more than two years before he was finally released on the promise that he would no longer<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> doubt or </span>question the<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;"> “correctness” of the </span>Party line<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">. Twentieth-century socialism is an unending story of crushing tyranny and oceans of blood. As Russian mathematician and Soviet dissident Igor Shafarevich expressed it in The Socialist Phenomenon (1980), a history of socialism in theory and practice through the ages: “Most </span>socialist doctrines and movements are literally saturated with the mood of death, catastrophe and destruction . . . . One could regard the death of mankind [<em>sic</em>] as the final result to which the development of socialism leads.” The 64 million killed during the nearly 75 years of the Soviet Union cry out with the truth of this conclusion<span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">.</span><br />

Without an alternative that works better than capitalism, they have no impact. Putting criticism above what would come afterwards ensures millions will die from new socialist “experiments”<br />

This</span> conviction <span class="underline">was based on a misinterpretation of trends within capitalism</span> and on a misconception of the role played by the market. The crucial misinterpretation was the centralization theory: capitalism could not last because the number of firms must become ever smaller, the ultimate limit being one big firm. The crucial misconception was the opposition to 'anarchy of production', seen as being wholly bad and manifestly inferior to 'conscious' planning.<br />
Lying behind the hostility to anarchy of production was an almost total unawareness of the economic calculation problem, and lying behind this, perhaps, was a deeper misunderstanding: the theory that anything humans create they can and should completely understand and control (Bartley 1990). Although it may be premature to say that no one will ever find a replacement for the market, it is hardly premature to say that any such replacement, like the market, will have to be characterized by anarchy of production, as some anti-market socialists implicitly recognize (O'Neill 1989; Albert and Hahnel 1991).<br />
According to Popper, the chief difference between Einstein and an amoeba is that the amoeba perishes along with its refuted theory, while Einstein can kill his theories and replace them with new ones.

<span class="underline">One of the clearest lessons of the last few decades is that capitalism is indestructible. Marx compared it to a vampire, and one of the salient points of comparison now appears to be that vampires always rise up again after being stabbed to death.

One of our goals as Marxists has been to produce a knowledge of capitalism. Yet as “that which is known,” <span class="underline">Capitalism has become the intimate enemy. We have uncloaked the ideologically-clothed, obscure monster, but we have installed a naked and visible monster in its place. In return for our labors of creation, the monster has robbed us of all force</span>. We hear – and find it easy to believe – that the left is in disarray. Part of what produces the disarray of the left is the vision of what the left is arrayed against. <span class="underline">When capitalism is represented as a unified system coextensive with the nation or even the world, when it is portrayed as crowding out all other economic forms, when it is allowed to define entire societies, it becomes something that can only be defeated and replaced by a mass collective movement</span> (or by a process of systemic dissolution that such a movement might assist). <span class="underline">The revolutionary task of replacing capitalism now seems outmoded and unrealistic, yet we do not seem to have an alternative conception of class transformation to take its place.</span> The old political economic “systems” and “structures” that call forth a vision of revolution as systemic replacement still seem to be dominant in the Marxist political imagination. The New World Order is often represented as political fragmentation founded upon economic unification. In this vision the economy appears as the last stronghold of unity and singularity in a world of diversity and plurality. But why can’t the economy be fragmented too? If we theorized it as fragmented in the United States, we could being to see a huge state sector (incorporating a variety of forms of appropriation of surplus labor), a very large sector of self-employed and family-based producers (most noncapitalist), a huge household sector (again, quite various in terms of forms of exploitation, with some households moving towards communal or collective appropriation and others operating in a traditional mode in which one adult appropriates surplus labor from another). None of these things is easy to see. <span class="underline">If capitalism takes up the available social space, there’s no room for anything else. If capitalism cannot coexist, there’s no possibility of anything else. If capitalism functions as a unity, it cannot be partially or locally replaced. My intent is to help create the discursive conception under which socialist or other noncapitalist construction becomes “realistic” present activity rather than a ludicrous or utopian goal. To achieve this I must smash Capitalism and see it in a thousand pieces</span>. I must make its unity a fantasy, visible as a denial of diversity and change.<br />

It’s inpossible to quantify the link to capitalism – if our plan could cause the transition to fail, their alternative might fall apart just by accident<br />

Marx's theory implies that it is impossible for the relations to be modified except by their having come into conflict with the forces. No reason is given by Marx for this, and it's difficult to imagine any remotely plausible reason—unless perhaps we are supposed to accept two premisses: a. that people always lack the opportunity or the will to sacrifice some gains in the forces for the sake of their preferences anent the relations; and b. that there is such a tight fit between relations and forces that people never have the opportunity to change the relations without impairing the forces. &lt; <span class="underline">Marx also seems to insinuate the unlikely premise that there is always a choice between precisely one set of relations which thwarts further development of the forces and precisely one set of relations which permits further development</span> of the forces. <span class="underline">A society may well face the possibility of several different sets of relations</span>, including perhaps more than one which permit further development of the forces, but probably <span class="underline">in different degrees</span>. <span class="underline">We wouldn't</span> normally <span class="underline">expect the members of a society to be aware</span> of all these possibilities, much less aware <span class="underline">of the precise degree to which they will permit further development of the forces</span>—but this merely underlines the hardly disputable fact that <span class="underline">the actual development of a society can be greatly influenced by 'intellectual accidents'</span>, by who happens to think of what, when.<br />

Instead, he <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">talks about the present in terms which presuppose that it will be succeeded by his [<em>sic</em>] preferred future</span></span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. When the Marxist declines to go into the workability of communism on the ground that such an analysis is 'premature', he certainly doesn't mean that it's too soon to be sure that communism is coming—exactly the reverse! Since communism is coming in any case, since all doubt about this merely evinces failure to grasp the meaning of the historical process, any discussion of its possible difficulties can only amount to useless speculation.<br />

We understand, however, that the abolition of nuclear weapons will not by itself deliver peace and security to the people of the world. <span class="underline">Organizing to abolish nuclear weapons is a significant moral and ethical undertaking that inherently defies the status quo</span>. Because nuclear weapons are so closely bound to the power of the governments which hold them, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">promoting open public debate regarding nuclear weapons policies requires us to question state authority directly</span></span>. Thus, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">efforts to abolish nuclear weapons can lead to citizens reclaiming sovereignty over society’s decision-making processes, and hence to an expansion and reinvigoration of democracy</span></span>. Secrecy plays a major role in preserving the undemocratic power of the nuclear weapons state. Secrecy is the enemy of democracy. It shields decisions regarding nuclear issues and helps to concentrate power in the hands of a few institutions and small numbers of people. Democracy demands tearing down the barriers of secrecy that surround nuclear weapons policies. A movement to eliminate nuclear weapons must consider systematically the means for reestablishing democracy. The process for getting rid of the bomb will both require and make possible increased openness, truthfulness, cooperation and citizen participation. The Abolitionist movement in the l9th century was focused on the elimination of slavery. But its participants were aware as well of the need to transform the power and wealth-driven politics that maintained slavery. The global system of corporate economic dominance now being consolidated depends in part on the threat of the bomb to &quot;stabilize&quot; and secure the global market place under the umbrella of continued United States leadership. But far from bringing security, this brandishing of annihilation in the service of endless material accumulation sows seeds of violence, insecurity and injustice at home and around the world. The brave women and men who opposed slavery knew that its elimination would not automatically create a just and secure future. They advocated reorganizing the social, political and economic realities of America. Similarly, we must understand that eliminating nuclear weapons alone will not transform a society corroded by racism, poverty, prison growth, decaying school systems, unemployment, violence against women and children, inadequate health care and homelessness. Only by tackling these social conditions will we be able to create a sustainable future and a world without war. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Building a movement for the abolition of nuclear weapons in the United States provides us with the opportunity to join together with the growing international peace and justice community that is linking the abolition of nuclear weapons to the abolition of economic exploitation and institutional oppression</span></span>. Securing a livable world requires a broad social commitment to understanding, and then transforming, the structures of power and domination, just as the Abolitionists of the l9th century named and confronted the slaveocracy.<br />

 Derrida concludes that deconstuction should not lead to disengagement with the political and historical questions of nuclear weapons. Even if the “Deconstruction Derrida” thinks we shouldn’t engage the political, the “Ethical Derrida” thinks we should.<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Wright 95 </span><br />
</span>Terence Wright, “The Ethics of Deconstruction: Derrida and Levinas. - book reviews”, Style, Winter 1995, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2342/is_n4_v29/ai_18348497/pg_4/" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2342/is_n4_v29/ai_18348497/pg_4/</a>)<br />
Much of the most influential reading theory and practice of our time . . . would confine texts to themselves, locking them up in &quot;the prison-house of language.&quot; Language is proposed as self-referring, and so are texts. So history, the world of things and people, the varied outside of texts, gets deferred, waived, put off as no longer central to what matters in reading games. Reading is reading. <span class="underline">By contrast, the argument in this book is that reading can never be simply reading</span>. Reading [the process] is, for example, also Reading [the place]. (1) <span class="underline">The act of reading</span>, in other words, <span class="underline">can never ignore the contexts in which texts are produced</span>, to which they refer, <span class="underline">and in which they are read</span>. As in Holland (the person), the villain of the piece is Saussure, or, rather, naive misreadings of Saussure that fail to notice an ambiguity about his doctrine of the arbitrariness of the sign. Saussure insists, convincingly enough, that the linguistic sign is arbitrary, in the sense that there is no necessary connection in English between the signifier &quot;cat&quot; and its signified, the mental concept of a little furry animal with four legs, a tail, and a miaow. Phonetics can quite happily study the various systems of difference that enable such signs to function in different languages. &quot;<span class="underline">What goes wrong</span>&quot; for Cunningham <span class="underline">in much second-hand understanding of structuralism, is that the proposition that signs are arbitrary . . . gets extended, glibly and strangely, to deny that signs are related to the world at all and to suggest that </span>languages, and so <span class="underline">texts</span>, <span class="underline">exist quite cut off from the things and the world that they seem to refer to. This is the fallacy of extrapolating wildly from the system of phonemic differences that comprise langue to the level of semantics and semantic operation</span>. (20) Cunningham brings in Emile Benveniste as witness to the fact that the very examples of arbitrariness provided by Saussure confirm the necessary relation of signs to the world to which they refer: whether the signs are produced in French, German, or English, boeuf, Ochs, and cow &quot;are necessarily, ungluably, attached to the mooing creatures they from then on denote&quot; (22). <span class="underline">With Derrida there is a similar confusion over the extent to which he is supposed to deny reference</span>, a confusion produced by the multiple meanings of a phrase such as the notorious &quot;Il n'y a pas de hors-texte&quot; for which Gayatri Spivak provides two possible translations: &quot;There is nothing outside of the text [there is no outside text].&quot; <span class="underline">The whole point of </span>the passage in <span class="underline">Of Grammatology </span>in which this phrase occurs <span class="underline">is that everything is textual in the sense that it is understood through cultural codes already in place</span>, hence Derek Attridge's suggested translation, in a note to Derrida's Acts of Literature, &quot;There is no outside-the-text&quot; (24). Cunningham recognizes that <span class="underline">Derrida has frequently disowned early American versions of deconstruction that denied all reference</span>, that <span class="underline">his own writing </span>of the 1970s <span class="underline">focused on the importance of context, and that he has always engaged with political issues such as </span>racism, <span class="underline">nuclear weapons</span>, and education. He quotes <span class="underline">Derrida's insistence in the &quot;Afterword</span>&quot; to Limited Inc <span class="underline">that &quot;the concept of text or of context which guides me embraces and does not exclude the world, reality, history</span>&quot; (25). This &quot;Afterword,&quot; incidentally, has the subtitle &quot;Toward an Ethic of Discussion,&quot; and <span class="underline">Derrida's main point is that discussion, like reading, needs to pay attention to the other, to the text, unlike the claims of many misreaders of his own work</span>, such as Jurgen Habermas, who manage to dismiss him without ever citing this work. <span class="underline">Such misreading is what Derrida and his followers decry in their call for an ethics of reading</span>, to which I will return in a moment.<br />
<br />
The exclusion of deconstruction from debate is irrelevant, all important components of deconstruction are already canonized in the shallow consumerism of academia. We can advocate material change and objective desciptions of reality without damaging the deconstructive trend, because we’re playing an entirely different game.<br />

That <span class="underline">Derrida has himself become a kind of specter </span>is confirmed by Stanley Fish in his recent book There's No Such Thing as Free Speech and It's a Good Thing, Too. Fish is particularly scathing about the resort of reactionaries in the academic world to a version of scaremongering about &quot;political correctness,&quot; deconstruction, and other bogies. A remark mistakenly attributed to Foucault about Derrida being &quot;the kind of philosopher who gives bullshit a bad name&quot; (traced in fact to a Princeton philosopher referring to a small portion of Derrida's work that he found less convincing than the rest of his writing) is too often trotted out for the relieved laughter of &quot;those who are happy to see the specter of their fears dissipated by a cheap and inaccurate joke&quot; (98). <span class="underline">Fish offers little comfort to those who hoped deconstruction would &quot;fade away </span>like a bad dream&quot;: &quot;<span class="underline">if there is now no vigorous discussion of deconstruction in the academy, it is because its lessons have been absorbed and its formulations-the irreducibility of difference, the priority of the signifier over the signified, the social construction of the self--have been canonized</span>&quot; (57). But, Fish is remarkably sanguine about <span class="underline">the literary profession in general. In spite of its continuing propensity to despise itself, to make itself as uncomfortable as possible, to buy Volvos and to eat anyone's shit</span>, Fish feels that &quot;<span class="underline">the revolution . . . has succeeded</span>,&quot; by which he means that <span class="underline">the institution has managed to retool to adapt itself to new circumstances</span>. <span class="underline">For change</span>, according to Fish, whose last book described the way it was achieved by <span class="underline">submission to authority, should not be frightening: it is &quot;the means by which continuity is achieved and reachieved. Tradition does not preserve itself by pushing away novelty and difference but by accommodating them</span>&quot; (271). <span class="underline">But more to do with Volvos than with politics</span>, it is a concept of revolution that not everyone will share. Fish's book exudes confidence and a sense of comfort (I don't know what he now drives). Laughing at fellow-critics who worry that their labors may be merely a vehicle for their careers, he urges them to &quot;sit back and enjoy the fruits of their professional success&quot; (256). &quot;Milton's Career and the Career of Theory,&quot; the title of one of the essays, are both going well, and so is that of Fish, who reprints here his acceptance speech on being awarded &quot;the highest honor conferred by the Milton Society of America&quot; (27). The dominant metaphor of the book is that of games, from baseball to literary criticism. Chapters 3 through 7, Fish explains, were his side of an ongoing series of debates with Dinesh D'souza in which they &quot;dined together, traveled together, and played tennis whenever we could&quot; (52). <span class="underline">When Fish addresses the question over which the New Historicists agonize, &quot;Can you at once assert the textuality of history and make specific and positive historical arguments?&quot; he has no qualms about answering in the affirmative, &quot;because the two actions . . . have nothing to do with one another. They are actions in different practices, moves in different games</span>.&quot; <span class="underline">He raises for a moment the possible objection that &quot;you will answer the question `what happened' differently if you believe that events are constructed rather than found,&quot; but rejects it, separating this &quot;general . . . belief&quot; from &quot;reference to any facts in particular&quot; </span>(248).<br />
<br />
We must ground criticism in the pre-discursive material world: refusing to found our critiques of the nuclear situation in a shared reality by which we can evaluate our beliefs about nuclear danger locks in the status quo and replicates the worst parts of the nuclear situation.<br />

All the same, <span class="underline">the nuclear referent does present a challenge to criticism, an epistemological challenge to think through the consequences of our general textualization of critical knowledge, our unrelenting deconstruction of the referent, of the belief in a physical world whose behavioral properties and dispositions can be objectively calculated and known. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">The consequences of this deconstruction</span>, as we can see in &quot;No Apocalypse, Not Now,&quot; <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">involve a suspension of knowledge and belief, an inability to choose between beliefs</span>, between logical possibilities. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">But, somehow, not only do we make such choices all the time</span> (which no one would deny), <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">but we do so on the basis of determinants that come from our knowledge of the world as well as of the word</span>.</span> Somehow, for example, we know that there is a very low probability that one might save oneself from a nuclear strike by digging a hole in the ground. But how do we know this? Is our calculation merely an expression of subjective belief? <span class="underline">To argue</span> that it is not, <span class="underline">that</span> such <span class="underline">knowledge is &quot;scientific', rather than &quot;archíval,&quot; is to argue that <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the basis of our beliefs lies in a reality that transcends our archival figurations</span>. And <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">this</span>, I think <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is the real challenge</span> that <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the nuclear referent offers</span> to <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">criticism</span>, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">a challenge to analyze the ways in which the word relates to the world, how our knowledge actuates the potentiality of a world that</span>, I shall argue, is real, that <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">subsists outside our discourse and referentially grounds it</span>. The challenge presented by the nuclear referent, in other words, is to conceive what might be called a “potentialist realism&quot; or &quot;potentialist metaphysics.&quot; <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Such a metaphysics would not be the same as classical realism, for a potentiality is not a transcendentally universal, static identity. It is dynamic</span>. It is indeed in play. But this play is not an unlimited &quot;free play.&quot; It is situationally delimited, and its dynamics can be defined only within specified circumstances</span>. In a sense, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the ontological reality of a potentiality lies somewhere between identity and difference</span>, between a universal determinism and the unrestricted play of differance, appearing to us in the form of empirical propensities, behavioral regularities that can be calculated, and thus grounding our distinctions between beliefs rather than suspending our decision. The defense of a potentialist metaphysics cannot be uncontroversial, for in our &quot;nuclear epoch&quot; we have suspended our knowledge not only of the nuclear referent but of the referent itself. </span>Scientific realism is regarded as mere meta- physics, blind to its own governing tropes. Criticism today attacks rather than defends the reality of natural order, con- tinuity, or law. So why should the attempt be made- at all? Why search for a ground, for a basis for decision? After all, criticism is not at all likely to be asked for a defense of realism. The so-called &quot;decision makers&quot; will continue to opeaâte without us. Still, I suggest that<span class="underline"> the need for such a defense comes from the pressure exerted by <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the nuclear referent</span> itself, from the intellectual <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">challenge</span> that it <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">presents to us</span>: <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">to think through the aporias of this potential phenomenon, which</span>, somehow, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">we know is real and cannot be ignored, but whose &quot;reality,&quot;</span> like the reality of more ordinary referents, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">appears to be inexplicable</span></span>. Perhaps, it may be suggested, the resolution of this refer- ential problem is a task for semantic, not critical, analy- sis-a iask for referential logicians, not for critics. But <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">in the face of the nuclear referent, the either/or</span>, true or false <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">paradigms of logical discourse are</span> simply <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">not adequate</span>. For the ontological stâtus of the nuclear referent falls somewhere between the logical alternatives &quot;exists&quot; and &quot;does not ex- ist,&quot; and so any proposition concerning it can be judged neither to be true nor to be false. The situation is simply too uncertain to admit truth conditions. But <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">this does not mean that we must simply deconstruct the nuclear predicament</span>, assimilating its uncertainties to the aporias of literary discourse. Neither should we turn the problem wholly over to the technical experts; for <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the challenge presented</span> by the nuclear referent <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">goès beyond any single discipline</span>, scientific or otherwise, crossing from physics to politics to rhetoric and beyond. The function of criticism at the present time, we might say, is to exercise its essentially Arnoldian willingness to transcend disciplinary boundaries and bring together a spectrum of relevant perspectives. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">A criticism that rejects this role, insisting upon reducing the complex elements of the nuclear referent to its own aestheticized terms, will be</span> as <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">inadequate</span> to the challenge</span> as the most rigid logical dialectic. <span class="underline">At a time, what is more, when literary critics are making a political turn from the word to the world, it is also time for criticism to rethink its rejection of the of the referent of behalf of a renewed approach to a referential reality that subsists outside the forms of textuality</span>. I shall attempt in this book to rethink that referent, using the figure of the nuclear referent as a concrete example to guide the search for a potentialist realism beyond the either/or choice between identitarian metaphysics and the deconstruction of metaphysics that seems to inevitable to so many critics today. In this way, I shall pursue not a solution to the political dilemmas of the nuclear era but another way of thinking through the more critical ones.<br />

THE NUCLEAR FATHER: WARHEAD OF THE FAMILY<br />
An uncanny image appears on the cover of a 1985 children's comic book The Outsiders. A band of tiny costumed heroes, ready for battle, approaches an enormous mushroom cloud, upon which is inscribed a face that is broadly reminiscent of a 1950s sitcom dad. A pipe juts from his mouth and his expression is a lordly know-it-all and sadistic smirk. Here is a prime portrait of the cultural figure whom I call <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the &quot;nuclear father&quot;</u></span></strong> -- the quintessential patriarch, <strong><u>the man <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">who nominally provides for and protects his dependents but who actually threatens and violates them</span></u></strong>. This &quot;nuclear father&quot; figure <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">can be found ruling over a family, a laboratory</span></span>, a corporation, a military force, a church, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">or a nation</span></span>.<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">In his astute study Fathering the Unthinkable ( 1983) Brian Easlea, a physicist and historian, points to a predominance of metaphors of male birth and fatherhood in the language of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. government's mission to develop the atom bomb. He and Carol Cohn ( 1987) perceive these metaphors as indicators of the masculinist bias steering the development of nuclear weapons. For example, at Los Alamos in 1945, as scientists struggled to produce the bomb before the war ended, they took bets on whether they would produce a dud or a success-in their lingo, a &quot;girl&quot; or a &quot;boy.&quot; Their project was a success, and the bomb dropped on Hiroshima was nicknamed &quot;Little Boy.&quot; The National Baby Association reacted to this birth/explosion by naming J. Robert Oppenheimer &quot;Father of the Year.&quot; Oppenheimer remains the paradigmatic father figure in a select nuclear club that includes such men as Edward Teller, &quot;father of the U.S. H-bomb&quot;; Glenn Seaborg, one of the &quot;five fathers of plutonium&quot;; Andrei Sakharov, &quot;father of the Soviet H-bomb&quot;; and Admiral Hyman B. Rickover, &quot;father of America's nuclear navy.&quot;<br />
Oppenheimer, Teller, and other such scientific nuclear fathers were widely heroized after World War II. Astutely, their colleague Leo Szitard observed, &quot;It is remarkable that all these scientists . . . should be listened to, but mass murderers have always commanded the attention of the public, and atomic scientists are no exception to this rule&quot; (cited in Boyer 1985 , 61). This linkage of fatherhood and mass murder is eerily reflected in the contemporary nuclear family, where murderous mayhem is an increasingly common event.<br />
Another kind of nuclear father was exemplified by forty-one-year-old Ernie Lasiter of Roswell, New Mexico, who in January 1992 strangled his wife and four of his children and then shot himself. A couple of days earlier, his seventeen-year-old daughter had been removed from the home by police, who were investigating her complaint of incestuous assault by Lasiter. In the aftermath of the atrocity, a number of friends confirmed, as is typical in such cases, that Lasiter was a &quot;good guy&quot; and fine family man. A secretary in the highway department where he worked added, &quot;He was very conscientious and a hard worker. He was almost like a machine&quot; ( Jadrnak 1992, 3E). The machine that a family (war)head like Ernie Lasiter most resembles is the unendingly lethal nuclear weapon. Not only does the apocalyptically raging nuclear father have an immediate mass kill from his &quot;blast,&quot; but the effects of his lethality linger forever in the bodies and psyches of his survivors. Eerily, the mass murder/suicide pattern of the nuclear father presages the probable fate of any nation that initiates nuclear war.<br />
Nuclear-family men such as Lasiter seem omnipresent these days. Other recent family mass murderers include John List, Jeffrey MacDonald, Ramon Salcido, George Franklin, Gene Simmons, and even the god-identified, apocalyptically aimed, and allegedly sexually abusive father figure of the Branch Davidian Christian cult, David Koresh. This lethally abusive nuclear father is also represented by fictional &quot;pop&quot; figures such as Leland Palmer in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1989-1990), Jerry Blake in The Stepfather ( 1988), &quot;De-Fens&quot; in the despicably racist Falling Down ( 1993), and Freddy Kruger in A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984).<br />
Moreover, in all sorts of stories with explicit themes of nuclear weaponry and power -- from comic books to popular films to elite literature -- abusive fathers appear as prime metaphors for the Bomb. Examples include the novels The Nuclear Age by Tim O'Brien ( 1985), Falling Angels by Barbara Gowdy ( 1990), The Mosquito Coast by Paul Theroux ( 1982), The Prince of Tides by Pat Conroy ( 1986), the films Star Wars ( 1977), Forbidden Planet ( 1956), and Desert Bloom ( 1986), and even, humorously, the current hit television show &quot;The Simpsons.&quot;<br />
Of course, in his original mythic manifestations, primarily in television sitcoms, the fictionalized head of the nuclear family is the benevolent patriarch who always &quot;knows best.&quot; During the 1950s, the heyday of atomic culture, fatherhood became a much valorized role, and Father's Day became for the first time a holiday of national significance ( May 1988 , 146). In The Feminine Mystique ( 1963) Betty Friedan connected the cult of the (white, middle-class) nuclear family with a national psyche scarred by &quot;the loneliness of the war and the unspeakableness of the bomb.&quot; These conditions, she argued, made women particularly vulnerable to &quot;the feminine mystique,&quot; the belief that the highest value for women was fulfillment in a femininity characterized by &quot;sexual passivity, male domination, and nurturing maternal love&quot; (37). At the same time, women and men also were vulnerable to a &quot;masculine mystique,&quot; the illusion that a man's rightful position was head of the family, where he was all-powerful, protective, a provider, benevolent, omniscient, essentially godlike -- attributes simultaneously ascribed to America's newest weapon. </span><br />
In truth, the bomb, while purportedly protecting actually threatens. So too does the nuclear father. <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Just as those seeking refuge in a fallout shelter</span> from an atomic bomb attack <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">might instead find themselves roasted alive, those seeking security in the nuclear family might instead find themselves under attack in the form of battery, rape</span>, incest, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">and mass murder</span></u></strong>. Affirming the connection of the political to the personal, and in subliminal recognition of the often apocalyptic experience of American family life, the phrase &quot;nuclear family&quot; established itself firmly in the national vernacular by 1947.<br />
The film Atomic Cafe ( Rafferty, Loader, Rafferty 1982) is a witty compilation of clips from 1950s government and military disinformation. These clips demonstrate the efficacy of that inflated Great White Father image to such nuclearist propaganda. Over and over, they present heavily iconic white family images: dads coming home from work; moms in the kitchen, cooking and serving; and Dick and Jane-type kids in the living room, watching TV. Simultaneously, we see white governmental father figures blithely assuring us of the safety of radiation and indeed of nuclear war itself. This genuflection to paternal authority was equally apparent in mainstream popular culture. Television boasted popular shows with such masterfully subtle titles as &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; and &quot;Make Room for Daddy.&quot; So dominant was the image of the white, middle-class, patriarchally ordered family that one critic claimed, &quot;Dad's authority around the house appeared to be the whole point of the spectacle&quot; ( Miller 1986 , 196). Of course, that televised paternal authority also served to legitimate and ordain &quot;Dad's&quot; authority around the globe.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Benevolent nuclear father imagery was resurrected with great vigor during the Reagan-Bush era</u></span></strong> when the federal government spent four billion dollars per year on the Strategic Defense Initiative or &quot;Star Wars&quot; -- Reagan's proposed space-based nuclear &quot;defense&quot; system. In order to persuade Americans to place their trust in him and his utterly specious project, Reagan smoothly donned the mask of the father protector, promising that his plan would offer a &quot;new hope for our children in the twenty-first century.&quot; (1983, 20)<br />
Reagan's &quot;good father&quot; image continued in a 1985 television commercial produced by High Frontier, a pro-Star Wars lobbying group. The spot opened with a childlike drawing of a simple house: stick figures represented a family, and there was a gloomy-faced sun. A syrupy little girl voice chirped, &quot;I asked my daddy what this Star Wars stuff is all about. He said that right now we can't protect ourselves from nuclear weapons, and that's why the president wants to build a Peace Shield.&quot; At this point, large red missiles appeared to threaten the house, but they harmlessly disintegrate when met by a blue arc in the sky. Like magic, the grumpy sun began to smile and the arc was transformed into a shimmering rainbow. This scenario was about as believable as Reagan's hair color. Yet, credibility was not really the point. The essential message of this little package was that we, the much vaunted &quot;American people,&quot; are children, in need of the loving protection of the all-powerful father/president. See, he can even make the sun smile.<br />

Electricity crackled through my father's body, and during the flash my mother saw all her bones, her arms and legs, and hips, glowing through her skin. Windows shattered, animals bled through their eyes. Bikini Atoll become debris. . . . Six hours after the &quot;Bravo&quot; blast, something rioted down on us, on our water and food.

Greetings. For many years a very special relationship has existed between the United States and the people of the trust territory. . . . Under the trusteeship, we've come to know and respect you as members of our American family. And now, as happens to all families, members grow up and leave home. I want you to know that we wish you all the best. . . . We look forward to continuing our close relationship to you in your new status. But you'll always be family to us. ( O'Rourke 1986)<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Here Reagan revealed himself as the ultimate unthinking and unthinkable father</span></span>. His own role and the &quot;American family&quot; to which he referred represented, on a global scale, the &quot;toxic parenting&quot; and &quot;dysfunctional family&quot; of scores of best-selling recovery books. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">The &quot;family&quot; he described is one afflicted by a severely disordered and abusive father -- one who more or less destroys the next generation, physically and/or psychically, and then denies his own horrendous behavior and tries to coerce everyone else into the denial as well</span></span>.<br />
Incest is the atrocity most paradigmatic of fatherly abuse. In her essay &quot;The Color of Holocaust,&quot; novelist Patricia A. Murphy (1985) uses nuclear metaphors to describe both her incest experience and the interior self of her father/perpetrator:<br />
The nuclear winter resonates through our culture reaching into our global imagery as expressed through television. It extends into the secret heart of the family and finally into that private space inside our own skins. The color of this winter is ash, which seems to be the color of all holocausts public and private. My father and I were once children of the sky. That great blue bowl which hangs over the limitless prairie where we both experienced our childhoods a generation apart. He is the color of ash now like a stain on that sky. He smudges life itself. . . . My father has surrendered to the nuclear winter within. ( Murphy 1985, unpaged)<br />
Murphy reminds us that there would not be an external bomb unless a bomb also existed in the hearts of men, and that the nuclear winter is a psychic state of blight as well as a physical one. Her father, she tells us, is an artificial season, a destroyed atmosphere, a stifler of breath, life, and color, a sorry substitute for that older, original, nurturing father she simultaneously invokes: Father Sky. Barbara Gowdy's Falling Angels ( 1990) also sets up a metaphoric link between nuclear devastation and incest. This novel tells the story of a 1960s nuclear family consisting of a tyrannical and crazed father, a nearly catatonic alcoholic mother, and three daughters. One Christmas, the father bestows minimal and despised presents on his daughters, telling them that in the summer they will take a trip to Disneyland. However, in the spring, heeding media messages of an imminent Soviet attack, the father begins frenzied work on a basement A-bomb shelter. When summer arrives, his daughters find that instead of going to one newly constructed, controlled environment, Disneyland, they are to spend two weeks together in another such environment -- their father's brandnew bomb shelter.<br />
The experience in the bomb shelter is, of course, hell on earth: the water supply is insufficient and everyone drinks whiskey incessantly; the oldest daughter gets her first period, to her unbearable shame; the tyrannical father grows increasingly cranky, angry, and unpredictable; the air is foul; the toilet backs up, and the stench is unbearable. The metaphor is unmistakable: nuclear family life, while advertised like Disneyland, to be &quot;the happiest place on earth,&quot; actually is a lot more like life in a bomb shelter: waiting in cramped quarters amid insane behavior for the &quot;bomb&quot; to drop. In Gowdy's novel, of course, some years later it does: the father eventually makes incestuous advances toward the oldest daughter, and the mother eventually kills herself by jumping off the roof of the house. The daughters, with varying degrees of damage, manage to survive.<br />
The incest-nuclear connection also appears in the 1986 film Desert Bloom, a movie that could easily be subtitled: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love My Stepfather. The setting of the film is Las Vegas in the early 1950s as the city awaits an impending bomb test. The film focuses on a family composed of a mother, Lilly, her three daughters, and a stepfather, Jack. Jack is a World War II veteran, wounded in both body and spirit, who desperately seeks esteem and power through possession of &quot;secret&quot; information obtained via his shortwave radio. Significantly, the family keeps a number of secrets of its own. Jack is an alcoholic and a bully, lording it over his stepdaughters and his wife, who placatingly calls him Daddy. Jack's relationship with Rose, the &quot;blooming&quot; pubescent oldest daughter, is charged with sexual tension: we see him verbally and physically abuse her. Moreover, Rose tells us that &quot;Momma had a way of not seeing things.&quot; In these and other ways, the film strongly implies Jack's sexual abuse of Rose.<br />
Eventually Rose, seeking safety, runs away. Ironically, she ends up at the eminently dangerous nuclear test site, where she is rounded up by the authorities and returned to Jack, who has followed her trail. As they drive back to the house, he tells her that he just wants to &quot;protect&quot; her. &quot;From whom?&quot; Rose asks pointedly. The film's parallel between the incestuous/abusive father and nuclear weapons is extremely persuasive. Each purportedly protects the family and yet each, in reality, invades it and threatens to destroy its members.<br />
&quot;TRUST ME&quot;<br />
A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power, the United States of America. And they regard this with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is right. They trust us to be fair, and restrained. They trust us to be on the side of decency. They trust us to do what's right. . . . As long as I am president we will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance and not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children. (State of the Union Address, George Bush, 1992)<br />
The incest survivor can be said to be incapable of experiencing trust. She has in fact learned that words don't mean what they say, that things are not always what they seem, and that what appears safe is generally not to be believed. ( E. Sue Blume, Secret Survivors: Uncovering Incest and its Aftereffects in Women)<br />
&quot;Trust&quot; is one of the key words linking incest and the Bomb on the Newsweek &quot;Future of the Bomb&quot; cover. Witness the similarity between the incest headline, &quot;Can Memories Be Trusted?&quot; and the bomb headline, &quot;Can We Trust the Soviets?&quot; Frankly, both of these questions desperately displace the really important concern about trust. That is: can we trust our fathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, priests, old family friends, neighbors, doctors, and teachers around issues of safety for children? At the same time, based on past deceptions by nuclear authorities, it is absurd to place much trust in the U.S. government, military, and associated nuclear facilities around issues of nuclear safety.<br />
When I was about twelve, the older boys in my neighborhood used to sexually harass girls by playing a game called &quot;Trust Me.&quot; A boy would put his hand on the top button of a girl's blouse, unbutton it, and ask &quot;Trust me?&quot; The girl was supposed to say &quot;Yes,&quot; even as he proceeded to uncover her breasts or shove his hand down her pants, all the while reiterating, &quot;Trust me?&quot;<br />
<span class="underline">During the 1950s, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">United States military and government officials played &quot;Trust Me&quot;</span> not only <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">with</span> the Pacific peoples of the United Nations &quot;trust territory&quot; but also with <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">countless U.S. citizens, including: lower-echelon military personnel</span></span> who, as part of their duties, were exposed to radiation from bomb tests; <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the residents of northern Arizona, Nevada, and Utah who regularly were hit with fallout from above-ground bomb tests; uranium miners</span></span> (a great number of whom were Lakota, Kaibab Paiute, Navaho, and Pueblo Native Americans); <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">and the residents of areas where nuclear production facilities</span></span> like Hanford and Oak Ridge <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">were located</span></span>.<br />
Throughout the era of above-ground testing ( 1951-1963), the Atomic Energy Commission and the United States government engaged in a &quot;sustained and wide-ranging effort&quot; (Boyer 1985, 318) to fool the public about the dangers associated with nuclear development and above-ground bomb testing. In the aftermath of the attacks on Japan, the U.S. government actually denied the lethal and disabling effects of the radiation from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs by dismissing statements about them as &quot;Japanese propaganda.&quot; By 1950, the Federal Civil Defense Agency was claiming that nuclear war survival was simply a matter of &quot;keeping one's head&quot; and making sure to &quot;duck and cover.&quot; In 1953, President Eisenhower advised the Atomic Energy Commission to keep the public &quot;confused&quot; about any hazards associated with radiation. Despite warnings from scientists such as Linus Pauling, the official line was that &quot;low&quot; levels of radiation were perfectly safe, that people could trust the government to protect them, and that bomb tests were in our best interest. By and large, U.S. citizens believed the government, embraced the bomb through a million popular songs and artifacts, and accepted the notion of the &quot;peaceful atom.&quot; Many of these people later developed cancer, sterility, and other serious and frequently lethal health problems in return for their trust ( Gallagher 1993).<br />

They, too, often lie harbored in the victim until they later erupt into disease or disorder. Some of the long-term effects of incest include fear, anxiety, anger, and hostility; eating disorders; allergies and asthma; shame; low self-esteem; guilt; depression; inability to trust or to establish relationships; phobias; multiple personality disorder; sexual dysfunction; a tendency toward revictimization through participating in such activities as prostitution; drug addiction; alcoholism; self-mutilation; and suicide ( Wyatt and Powell 1988).<br />
OFFICIAL SECRECY<br />
Except possibly for the word &quot;silence&quot; and maybe the word &quot;safety,&quot; the word &quot;secret&quot; recurs more than any other in feminist discussions of incest. Psychiatric social worker Florence Rush ( 1980) calls the sexual abuse of children patriarchy's &quot;best-kept secret.&quot; Sociologist Diana Russell ( 1984) speaks of incest as &quot;the secret trauma,&quot; marked by &quot;a vicious cycle of betrayal, secrecy, unaccountability, repetition, and damaged lives&quot; (16). Similarly, as any analyst of nuclear culture knows, an unprecedented and profoundly enforced official secrecy is the most prominent feature of the history of nuclear development ( Lifton and Falk 1992 , 26). Secrecy is fundamental to the abuse of power -- sexual and otherwise. Protected by the cult of secrecy, fathers molest their daughters; priests violate their flocks; governments test nuclear weapons on human populations; including their own; and weapons laboratories and defense contractors plan, manufacture, and mismanage weapons without public knowledge, scrutiny, or criticism. Secrecy in the nuclear world, moreover, creates a select club of those &quot;in the know,&quot; bestows a sense of privilege, and fosters in-group loyalty. It encourages the arms race, allows safety problems to remain uninvestigated and unresolved at any number of nuclear weapons facilities in both the United States and the former Soviet Union, and has enabled disastrous accidents to be completely covered up.<br />
So, too, the truth about child sexual abuse is covered up regularly, by individual perpetrators and the enabling culture. At the outset, children are told by abusers that their sexual activity is a secret that must never be told, frequently under threat of abandonment or death (for themselves or loved ones). If the children disregard that prohibition and tell the truth, they all too often are not believed. The invalidation of children's words, the characterization of their reports as fantasy, and massive community denial and resistance to believing in the abusive practices of paternal authorities (individual or institutional) have long histories in psychoanalytic theory and everyday practice ( Summitt 1988).<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">This scenario of silence, secrecy, denial, avoidance, erasure, initial embrace of the trusted father-figure abuser, and victim blaming unerringly mirrors the typical responses of nuclear communities to complaints against the institutional abusers in their midst. Tom Bailie ( 1990) reveals what happened when his family blew the whistle on the devastation caused by Hanford:<br />
Our patriotism has been impugned, our credibility questioned. . . . We have been slandered as the &quot;glow in the dark family&quot; by friends and strangers alike. . . . Moscow was condemned for its three days of silence after the Chernobyl nuclear accident. What about Washington's 40 years of silence? ( Bailie 1990 , 19) </span><br />
Marylia Kelley is a resident of Livermore, California -- home of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. She is also a founder of Tri-Valley CARE -- Citizens Against a Radioactive Environment. When she moved to Livermore in 1976, she knew there was some &quot;super-secret government facility&quot; where almost everyone worked, but neither she nor anyone she spoke to seemed to have a clear idea about what went on there. There was some awareness that nuclear weapons work was occurring there, but most people dismissed it as constituting only a small proportion, maybe 10 percent, of the lab's actual endeavors. (In truth, weapons work accounted for about 90 percent of the lab's activities.) As antinuclear activists increasingly converged upon Livermore in the 1980s, local residents like Kelley became interested in finding out the truth. Yet local activism faced a certain measure of resistance since so many community members were economically dependent on the nuclear facility. After several years of deliberate non - cooperation, some of the churches agreed in 1989 to sponsor a series of talks entitled &quot;Pathways to Peace,&quot; to be held in neighboring Pleasanton. Lectures were given over a six-week period, but, Kelley reports, not once did anyone mention Lawrence Livermore lab. As she told me in a 1993 conversation, &quot;I felt like the community was keeping a dirty secret, and it was breaking a taboo to speak the name Livermore in a public way.<br />
In other words, making genocidal bombs isn't taboo, but speaking out against them is. So too, as many observers note, incest is not really taboo in our culture, but speaking out against it is. The &quot;dirty secret&quot; scenario Kelley describes parallels the protection by family members of a trusted and/or economically powerful child abuser and the concomitant silencing of victims. Kelley concludes that one of the most important features of CARE's activism is to overcome this obeisance to secrecy and to get people to &quot;name things by their true names, to find their voice.&quot; Indeed, in order to thwart both child sexual abuse and nuclearism, we must, in the phrase commonly used by survivors, &quot;break silence.&quot; We must begin to spill those long held and closely guarded secrets and, concomitantly, believe the unbelievable, be it that a fine churchgoing family man is sexually abusing his daughter or that high rates of thyroid and brain cancer (such as those in Los Alamos) are due to radioactive contamination.<br />
KEEPING SECRETS FROM ONESELF<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;What was your family life like, Savannah?&quot; I asked, pretending I was conducting an interview.<br />
&quot;Hiroshima,&quot; she whispered.<br />
&quot;And what has life been like since you left the warm, abiding bosom of your nurturing, close-knit family?&quot;<br />
&quot;Nagasaki,&quot; she said, a bitter smile on her face. ( The Prince of Tides, Pat Conroy.)<br />
Victims of incest often seek temporary refuge in numbing, denial, and massive repression, keeping their worst secret even from themselves because confronting incest in their own lives is truly &quot;thinking about the unthinkable.&quot; Pat Conroy's best-selling novel, The Prince of Tides, elaborates a complex narrative, encompassing nuclear devastations, the secrets of family life, and child rape. The book's narrator, Tom Wingo, tells us that he and his twin sister Savannah &quot;entered the scene in the middle of a world war at the fearful dawning of the atomic age&quot; (9). Their childhood was simultaneously haunted by a terror of their father's recurrent brutality, directed against them and their mother. While the world anticipated nuclear war, their &quot;childhood was spent waiting for him to attack.&quot;<br />
Tom further reveals that his is &quot;a family of well-kept secrets and they all nearly end up killing us&quot; (97). His father, Henry Wingo, relentlessly batters his family. His mother, Lila Wingo, adamantly forbids her three children to reveal their father's brutality. She also conceals the fact that she has been stalked by a rapist and murderer. Yet, the repressed returns, this time with apocalyptic virulence. The stalker and two other men escape from prison and come to the family's home while Henry is absent. They rape and try to kill Lila, Tom, and Savannah and are thwarted only because Luke, the oldest son, manages to disrupt the assaults and lead a lethal attack against the invaders. Lila orders everyone to render the event permanently unspeakable and unthinkable, meaning that everyone must wipe it from memory. Tom can't stop himself from remembering; still, he brackets that knowledge and refuses to deal with its implications or speak of it. Savannah completely expunges this and other horrific memories from her consciousness. She goes on to become an extraordinarily gifted poet, yet she regularly attempts suicide. Some years later, Lila conspires to sell off the Wingo family South Carolina island home to the U.S. government so that it can build a nuclear weapons facility there. Utterly opposed to nuclear weapons, Luke becomes a one-man guerrilla army, battling the construction of the plant. In a few months, he is shot and killed.<br />
Savannah Wingo's name is not arbitrary. One of the United States'primary nuclear weapons facilities is the Savannah River Plant, located in South Carolina. For years, Savannah River was the major source of tritium for U.S. nuclear weapons, but it was closed for the first time in 1988 due to its unsafe practices. As recent investigations reveal, the Savannah River facility has a &quot;long and shocking record of serious incidents of radioactive contamination and unsafe disposal of waste,&quot; hazards that the Department of Energy &quot;has long attempted to keep . . . from public view&quot; ( Glenn 1988 ). The Savannah River, like the Columbia, is one of the most toxic bodies of water in the world. </span><br />
Numbing, repression of memory, and denial characterize the Wingo family, patterns that serve as microcosmic mirrors for larger nuclearist abuse. Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Markusen ( 1990 , 13) detail that <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">denial, numbing</span></span>, dissociation or <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">splitting, and even &quot;doubling&quot;</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;"> <span class="underline">(&quot;the formation of a functional second self&quot;</span>) <strong><u>are not only classic responses of victims of genocidal practices but also characterize victimizer consciousness</u></strong></span>. In special circles, these ways of numbing are actually celebrated and encouraged. For example, General Curtis LeMay, who oversaw the Hiroshima bombing and the creation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), was popularly portrayed, with no onus attached, as &quot;more machine than man.&quot; Spencer Weart notes that in his capacity as head of SAC, &quot;LeMay took care to select only officers like himself, men who kept their feelings under strict control&quot; ( Weart 1989 , 149). Bombing, as one writer explained in the Saturday Evening Post, &quot;had to be done 'mechanically, with swift, sure precision, undisturbed by emotion, either of fear . . . or pity' &quot; (cited in Weart 1989 , 149). LeMay himself recalled that when he flew bombers over Germany, &quot;his imagination had caught a picture of a little girl down below, horribly burned and crying for her mother. 'You have to turn away from the picture, he said, 'if you intend to keep on doing the work your Nation expects of you' &quot; (cited in Weart 1989 , 149).<br />
I wager that unapologetic incestuous abusers might sound very much like LeMay-riveted on their own conquest or pleasure and steeling themselves to turn away from the &quot;little girl down below,&quot; crying, injured, and annihilated. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Just as the survivor splits into a &quot;day child&quot; and a &quot;night child&quot;</span></span> ( Atler 1991 , 90), <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>so does the abuser create a second self, enabling him to perform atrocities and to keep the secret of his depredations even from himself</u></span></strong>. With such abusers, psychic numbing means never having to say you're sorry.<br />
<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Another method of inculcating nuclear numbing is to render weapons work an always unfinished jigsaw puzzle. General Leslie Groves, who was the military chief of the Manhattan Project, initiated a policy of &quot;compartmentalization of knowledge.&quot; This policy ensured that &quot;each man should know everything he needed to know about doing his job and nothing else&quot; ( Lifton and Falk 1992 , 26). The internalization of this mentality among nuclear workers guarantees that none of them needs to face what he or she is doing. After living in Albuquerque for over ten years and speaking to scores of people who work at either Sandia or Los Alamos national laboratories, I rarely meet anyone who acknowledges working on nuclear weapons. Nearly everyone claims to perform some specialized, unrelated task. Even those technicians who acknowledge that they are making weapons often mute their awareness with truly stunning doublethink. As one weapons designer at Lawrence Livermore lab told an interviewer, &quot;We're working on weapons of life, ones that will save people from weapons of death&quot; (cited in Broad 1985 , 47). Similarly, many incesters deny that they are grievously injuring children. In their minds, they are pleasuring the children, helping them to attain adulthood, loving them, giving them only what they want, responding to their initiation of sex play, and so on.<br />
A January 1991 issue of Time magazine opted to name George Bush not &quot;Man,&quot; but &quot;Men of the Year&quot; and actually depicted a two-faced presidential image on its cover. Such doubling nominally referred to Bush's disparate record on international and domestic affairs. Yet, this image simultaneously portrayed the &quot;doubling&quot; propensity of nuclear fathers and prepared the nation for Bush's role as commander in chief of the Persian Gulf War and mass murderous activities by the U.S. military. A similar construction appeared in a 1991 advertisement for the Army National Guard. It depicted a young man whose face was split precisely down the middle. On the right, it was a relatively normal face. On the left, the face was heavily painted camouflage style; the eye was widely opened and stared threateningly. This ad was stark testimony to the military's normative inculcation of a secret &quot;killer self&quot; within the soldier. It also portrayed the fissioned configurations of not only official femininity but also of official masculinity in the nuclear-fathered world.<br />
TABOO VIOLATION: JUST DO IT<br />
Our mission: to boldly go where no man has gone before. (Star Trek)<br />
In scores of nuclear movies such as the 1958Teenage Caveman and the 1968 Planet of the Apes, there is a recurrent motif: the &quot;forbidden zone,&quot; an area closely guarded by taboo that no one may enter. Usually, this area is contaminated by radiation from some long-ago nuclear war. In pro-technology films like Teenage Caveman the hero is the one who disregards the taboo and boldly strides into the proscribed area.<br />
The 1956 film Forbidden Planet puts a different twist on this theme. A scientist, Morbius, lives alone on the paradisiacal planet Altair with his full,grown daughter, Altaira. Domestic chores are performed by a marvelously efficient robot named Robby. A spaceship from earth arrives to find out what happened to the original landing party that came to the planet twenty years ago. Morbius attempts to make them go away. He tells them that, in essence, the entire planet is taboo to them, for there is a deadly force on the planet that killed everyone in the landing party except himself and his daughter. Nevertheless, the captain of the ship refuses to leave.<br />
As a sexual attraction develops between the captain and the daughter, the deadly planetary force again makes an appearance, threatening the men and their ship. Ultimately, we learn that the lethal force is generated by the jealous Morbius's own mind. The planet Altair formerly was inhabited by members of a technologically superior civilization, the Krell. Although they wiped themselves out years ago &quot;in a single night,&quot; the Krell left behind the agent of their own destruction, a vast nuclear-powered machine. Morbius, lusting for the Krell's technological knowledge, has been able to tap into the machine's power, allowing him to produce externally all that he can imagine, such as the marvelous Robby. But, Morbius is operating under a serious mantle of denial. He is transgressing profoundly against self-, family-, and planetary-preservative taboos in his unbounded quest for both sexual and technological knowledge. The Krell machine manifests in material reality not only his conscious wishes but also his most awful unconscious thoughts and desires, unleashing &quot;monsters from the id.&quot; The lethal planetary force, then, is actually an externalization of Morbius's unconscious. When his incestuous paradise with his &quot;forbidden partner,&quot; his daughter, is threatened, his unconscious strikes out to eliminate the threat. In the film's climactic moment, Morbius faces his own evil self and the experience does indeed destroy him. Romance, however, manages to &quot;save&quot; Altaira. She and the captain escape into space, bringing Robby with them, while Morbius and the planet that shares Altaira's name are blown to bits.<br />
The word forbidden in the film's title speaks not only to the archetypal &quot;forbidden knowledge&quot; that structures both ancient myths and mad-scientist movies, but also to the forbidden incestuous relationship that the father imposes on his daughter. Forbidden Planet is basically a conservative movie: it sets up pairs of false dichotomies and then in a tidy resolution replaces the &quot;bad&quot; heterosexual domination -- incest with her father -- with &quot;good&quot; heterosexual domination -- marriage to the captain. Similarly, the &quot;bad&quot; nuclear technology -- represented by the Krell machine -- is replaced with &quot;good&quot; nuclear technology -- in the form of Robby the Robot. </span><br />
Yet, however conventional, Forbidden Planet once again holds up for view the connection between the incestuous father and nuclearism. If we look past the film's false oppositions, we can discern an unmistakable parallel between Morbius's unbounded quest for knowledge and his incestuous depredations. As Catharine MacKinnon sums it up, &quot;Sexual metaphors for knowing are no coincidence. . . . Feminists are beginning to understand that to know has meant to fuck&quot; (1983, 636). Manifestly, in the patriarchal tradition, knowledge is power (domination) just as space exists to be invaded. It was this reigning pornographic paradigm of knowledge that fired the drive to gain nuclear knowledge or, as the most common scientific metaphors put it, &quot;to penetrate the hidden mysteries,&quot; to investigate &quot;the most intimate properties of matter,&quot; and even to &quot;smash resistant atoms&quot; (Weart 1989, 58).<br />

If one approaches the explosion of a nuclear weapon as if this were symptomatic of an underlying mental condition, certain facets begin to take on metaphorical meaning. <strong><u>Even <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the simplest physical aspects of a nuclear chain reaction carry</span></u></strong> a <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>psychological</u></span></strong> <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>significance</u></span></strong>. <strong><u>In order <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">for a chain reaction to be created</span>, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the atom must be split apart</span>, the fabric of <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">matter</span> has to be <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">torn asunder</span></u></strong>. In a different vein, it is important to realize that the first atomic weapons were dropped over a people regarded in the demonology of our civilization as racially inferior. Tangentially, and carrying a similar significance, the first nuclear device exploded over Bikini Atoll had a pin-up of Rita Hayworth pasted to its surface. And then, taking from a history that has largely been forgotten or ignored, the prototype of the first missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads was invented and designed in the Third Reich. And those first rockets, the German V-2 rockets, were produced in underground tunnels by prisoners of concentration camps who were worked to death in this production.<br />
These facts of the existence of nuclear weaponry can lead us to a deeper understanding of the troubled mind that has created our current nuclear crisis. To begin at one particular kind of beginning, with the history of thought, one can see the philosophical roots of our current crisis in the splitting of the atom. In the most basic terms, what occurs when the atom is split is a division between energy and matter. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Until this century, modern science assumed matter and energy to be separate. This assumption began</u></span></strong> not with scientific observation but <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>out of</u></span></strong> a <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>religious bias</u></span></strong>. Examining the early history of science, one discovers that the first scientists were associated with and supported by the church (as was most scholarship at that time) and that they asked questions derived from Christian theology. “What is the nature of light?” a question intimately bound up with the theory of relativity and quantum physics began as a religious question. And <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the guiding paradigm of the religion that posed this question has been a fundamental dualism degraded regions, belonging to the devil and corruption</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>Spirit</u></strong></span>, or the realm of pure intellect and heavenly influence, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>belonged to God</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">, <strong><u>and was</u></strong>, <strong><u>in human experience</u></strong>, <strong><u>won only at the expense of flesh</u></strong></span>.<br />
Of course, science does not recognize the categories of spirit and matter any longer, except through a process of translation. The new vocabulary, though, the old dualism has been preserved. Now, matter the equivalent of spirit, is described as a free agent, inspiring and enlivening. Newtonian physics continued the old dualism, but Einsteinian physics does not.<br />
<strong><u>When <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Einstein</span> discovered the formula that eventually led to the development of the atomic bomb, what he <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">saw</span> was <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">a continuum between matter and energy, instead of a separation</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">What we call solid matter is not solid, nor is it static</span></u></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>Matter is</u></strong></span>, instead, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>a process of continual change</u></span></strong>. <strong><u>There is no way to divide the energy of this motion from the physical property of matter.

And not only is there no division between matter and energy as such, but <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">to divide any single entity from any other single entity becomes an impossibility</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">No particular point exists where my skin definitely ends and the air in the atmosphere begins and this atmosphere ends and your skin begins</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">We are all in a kind of field together</span></u></strong>. And finally, <strong><u>with the new physics, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the</span> old <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">line between subject and object has</span> also <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">disappeared</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">According to Heisenberg’s Principle of Uncertainty, whatever we observe we change through our participation. Objectivity with its implied superiority and control has also vanished</span></u></strong>.<br />
One might imagine that with the disappearance of a scientific basis for dualism and the appearance of a physical view that is unified and whole a different philosophy might arise, one which might help us make peace with nature. But instead <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>what this civilization chose to do with this new insight was to find a way to separate matter from energy</u></span></strong> (it is spoken of as “liberating” the energy from the atom). And <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>this separation has in turn produced a technology of violence which has divided the world into two separate camps who regard each other as enemies</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. </span><br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The real enemy</u></span></strong>, however, <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">in dualistic thinking</span>, is hidden: the real enemy <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is ourselves</span></u></strong>. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The same dualism which imagines matter and energy to be separate also divides human nature, separating what we call our material existence from consciousness</u></span></strong>. This dualism is difficult to describe without using dualistic language. Actually, the mind cannot be separated from the body. The brain is part of the body, and is affect by blood flow, temperature, nourishment, muscular movement. The order and rhythm of the body, bodily metaphors, are reflect in the medium of thought, in our patterns of speech. Yet, we conceive of the mind as separate and above the body. And through a subtle process of socialization since birth, we learn to regard the body and our natural existence as something inferior, and without intelligence. Most of the rules of polite behavior are designed to conceal the demands of the body. We excuse ourselves, and refer to our bodily functions through euphemism.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>From this dualistic frame of mind two selves are born: one acknowledged and one hidden</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>The acknowledged self identifies with spirit, with intellect, with what we imagine is free of the influence of natural law. The hidden self is part of nature, earthbound, inextricable from the matrix of physical existence</u></strong></span>. We have become very seriously alienated from this denied self. So seriously that <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>our alienation has become a kind of self-hatred, and this self-hatred is leading us today toward the suicidal notion of nuclear combat</u></span></strong>.<br />
Of course, the body and mind are not separate. And ironically, the warfare incipient between our ideas of who we are and who we really are is made more intense through this unity. Consciousness cannot exclude bodily knowledge. We are inseparable from nature, dependent on the biosphere, vulnerable to the processes of natural law. We cannot destroy the air we breath without destroying ourselves. We are reliant on one another for our survival. We are all mortal. And this knowledge comes to us, whether we want to receive it or not, with every breath.<br />
<strong><u>The dominant philosophies of this civilization have attempted to posit a different order of being over and against this bodily knowledge. According to this order of being, we are separate from nature and hence above natural process. In the logic of this order, we are meant to dominate nature, control life, and in some sense felt largely unconsciously, avoid the natural event of death</u></strong>.<br />
Yet, in order to maintain a belief in this hierarchy one must repress bodily knowledge. And this is no easy task. <strong><u>Our own knowledge of our own natural existence comes to us not only with every breath, but with hunger, with intimacy, with dreams, with all the unpredictable eventualities of life</u></strong>. Our imagined superiority over nature is constantly challenged by consciousness itself. Consciousness emergence from and is immersed in material experience Consciousness is not separated from perception, which is not to sensuality, and as such cannot be separated from matter. Even through the process of the most abstract thought, we cannot entirely forget that we are part of nature<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>In the biosphere nothing is ever entirely lost. Death itself is not an absolute end, but rather a transformation</u></strong></span><strong><u>. What appears to be lost in a fire becomes heat and ash. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">So, too</span>, no knowledge can ever really be lost to consciousness</u></strong>. It must remain, even if disguised as a mere symbol of itself.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>If I choose to bury a part of myself, what I bury will come back to haunt me in another form, as dream, or fear, or projection</u></span></strong>. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">This civilization, which has buried part of the human self, has created many projections</span></span>. Out of the material of self-hatred several categories of otherness have been fashioned existing on a mass scale and by social agreement, these categories form a repository for our hidden selves.<br />
<strong><u>The misogynist’s idea of women is a fundamental category of otherness for this civilization. In the ideology of misogyny, a woman is a lesser being than a man. And the root cause of her inferiority is that she is closer to the earth</u></strong>, more animal, and hence, material in her nature. She is thus described as more susceptible to temptations of the flesh (or devils, or serpents), <strong><u>more emotional and hence less capable of abstract thought than a man. Similarly in the ideology of racism, a person with dark skin is perceived as, at one and the same time, more sensual and erotic and less intelligent</u></strong>.<br />
During the rise of fascism in Europe, a fictitious document was created called the <em>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</em>. In this “document” Jewish elders plan to corrupt and eventually seize Aryan bloodlines through the rape and seduction of Aryan women. If one has projected a part of the self upon another, one must always be afraid that this self will return, perhaps even entering one’s own bloodstream. But what is equally significant about this myth, and much of the racist and anti-Semitic imagination, is that a sexual act, and especially rape, lies at the heart of its mythos.<br />
It was in writing a book on pornography that I first began to understand the ideology of misogynist protection. Since so much in pornography is violent, I began to ask myself why sexual experience is associated with violence. This is a question which poses itself again in the context of nuclear weaponry, not only because Rita Hayworth’s image happened to adorn an experimental nuclear bomb, nor simply because of the phallic shape of the missile, nor the language employed to describe the weapons—the first atomic bomb called “little boy,” the next “big boy”—but also because of the sexualization of warfare itself, the eroticization of violence in war, the supposed virility of the soldier, the test of virility which is supposed to take place on the battlefield, and the general equivalency between masculine virtues and prowess in battle.<br />
Over time in my study of pornography I began to understand pornographic imagery as an expression of the fear of sexual experience itself. Sexual experience takes one back to a direct knowledge of nature and of one’s own body before culture has intervened to create the delusion of dominance. It is part of the nature of sexual pleasure and of orgasm to lose control. And finally the feel of a woman’s breast, or of human skin against bare skin at all, must recall infancy and the powerlessness of infancy.<br />
<strong><u>As infants we all experience an understanding of dependence and vulnerability</u></strong>. Our first experience of a natural, material power outside ourselves was through the bodies of our mothers. In this way we have all come to associate nature with the body of a woman. It was our mother who could feed us, give us warmth and comfort, or withhold these things. She had the power of life and death over us as natural process does now.<br />
<strong><u>It was</u></strong> also <strong><u>as infants that we confronted what we have come to know as death. What we call death</u></strong>—coldness, isolation, fear, darkness, despair, trembling—<strong><u>is really the experience of an infant</u></strong>. <strong><u>What death really is lies in the dimension of the unknown. But from the infantile experience of what we call death, one can seethe psychological derivation of civilization’s association between women and death</u></strong>. (One sees this clearly in the creation myth from Genesis, as Eve the seductress brings death into the world.) <strong><u>In this sense, too, sexual experience returns one to a primal fear of death. And through this understanding one can begin to see that at the center of the impulse to rape is the desire to dominate the power of sexual experience itself, and to deny the power of nature as this is felt through sexual experience</u></strong>.<br />
The connection between sexuality and violence exists as a kind of subterranean theme in the fascists and authoritarian mentality. In several places in Jacobo Timmerman’s book, <em>Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number</em>, he points out a relationship between the violence of the dictator and a pornographic attitude toward sexuality. Imprisoned and tortured himself, he recalls that those who did not do “a good scrubbing job” when ordered to clean the prison floors, were forced to “undress, lean over with their index finger on the ground and have them rotate round and round dragging their finger on the ground without lifting it. You felt,” he writes, “as if your kidneys were bursting.” Another punishment was to force prisoners to run naked along the passageway “reciting aloud sayings dictated” tot hem, such as “my mother is a whore, I masturbate, I respect the guard, the police love me.”<br />
That, to the fascist mind, “the other” represents a denied part of the self becomes clear in the following story about Adolf Hitler. In a famous passage in <em>Mein Kampf</em> he describes the moment when he decided to devote his life’s work to anti-Semitism. He recounts that while walking through the streets of Vienna, he happened to see an old man dressed in the traditional clothes of Jewish men in that city at that time i.e., in a Kaftan. The first question he asked was, “Is this man Jewish?” and he corrected himself, and replaced that question with another, “is this man German?”<br />
If you are to project a denied self onto another, you must first establish that this other is different from yourself. Were you to notice any similarity, you would be endangered by the perception that what you project may belong to you. The question that Hitler asked himself became a standard part of German textbooks in the Third Reich. A stereotypical portrait of a Jewish man’s face was shown under the question, “Is this man German?” and the correct answer the students were taught was, of course, “No.” In fact, Germany became a nation rather late. For centuries it existed as a collection of separate tribes, and one of the oldest tribes in that nation was Jewish.<br />
Hitler’s story of the man in the Kaftan became a standard part of his orations. He would become nearly hysterical at times telling the story, and is said to have even vomited once. In the light of this history, a seemingly trivial story from Hitler’s early life becomes significant. As a young art student he bought his clothes secondhand, because like many students, he was poor. In this period most of those selling secondhand clothing were Jewish and Hitler bought from a Jewish clothes seller one item of clothing that he wore so often that he began to be identified with this apparel. And that was a Kaftan.<br />
What is also interesting historically is that the Kaftan was a form of medieval German dress. Exiled from Germany during a period of persecution, many Jews, who then lived in ghettoes, continued to wear this traditional German dress and were still fearing it when they returned to Germany centuries later. Not only did Hitler fail to recognize an image of himself encountered in the streets of Vienna, but so did an entire generation of Germans. So an entire civilization, that to which we all belong, is in conflict with a part of human nature, which we try to bury and eventually even destroy.<br />
<strong><u>The weapons that now threaten the destruction of the earth and life as we know it were developed because the allied nations feared that the fascist powers were making them</u></strong>. The missiles which are now part and parcel of nuclear weaponry were first developed in the Third Reich. <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It is crucial now in our understanding of</span> ourselves and <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">what it is in us that has led to the nuclear crisis</span> that we begin to look at the Nazi holocaust as a mirror, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">finding a self-portrait in “the other” who is persecuted and denied, and seeing a part of ourselves too in the fascist dictator who would destroy that denied self</span></u></strong>.<br />
The illusion this civilization retains, that we are somehow above nature, is so severe that in a sense we have come to believe that we can end material existence without dying. The absurdity of nuclear weaponry as a strategy for defense, when the use of those weapons would annihilate us, would in itself argue this. But if you look closely at the particulars of certain strategies within the overall nuclear strategy you again encounter the same estranged relationship with reality. A man who used to be in Reagan’s administration, T.K. Jones, actually proposed that a viable method of civil defense would be to issue each citizen a shovel.<br />
It took an eight year old boy to point out that this plan cannot work because after you dig a hole and get into it for protection, someone else must stand outside the hole and shovel dirt on top. The Pentagon refers to its strategies for waging nuclear war as SIOP. One year the Pentagon actually went through the paces of a SIOP plan. As a literary scholar I found the scenario which the Pentagon wrote for this dramatization very disturbing. The Pentagon could write this play any way that they wished, and they wrote that the President was killed with a direct hit to the self. But this death is not experienced as real. Though the earthly self dies, in the Pentagon’s version, the sky self does not die; The Vice President goes up in an airplane fully equipped to wage nuclear war by computer. There is such a plane flying above us now, and at every hour of the day and night.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The division that we experience from the natural self, the self that is material and embedded in nature, impairs our perceptions of reality</u></span></strong>. As Timmerman writes:<br />
The devices are recurrent in all totalitarian ideology, to ignore the complexities of reality, or even eliminate reality, and instead establish a simple goal and a simple means of attaining that goal.<br />

In the development of this alienation as a slate of mind, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the delusion of well-being and safety eventually becomes more important than the realistic considerations which will actually effect well-being or safety</u></span></strong>. Hannah <strong><u>Arendt writes</u></strong> <strong><u>of an illusionary world created by totalitarian movements”…in which through sheer imagination uprooted masses can feel at home, and are spared the never ending shocks which real life and real experience deal to human beings</u></strong>…” Later, in the <em>Origins of Totalitarianism</em>, she speaks of the mass state of mind under the third Reich in which people ceased to believe in what they perceived with their own eyes and ears, preferring the conflicting reports issued by the <em>Fuhrer</em>.<br />
One encounters the same failure to confront reality in Stalin’s psychology as it is described by Isaac Derutchsher in his biography:<br />
He [Stalin] was now completely possessed by the idea that he could achieve a miraculous transformation of the whole of Russia by a single <em>tour de force</em>. He seemed to live in a half-real and half-dreamy world of statistical figures and indices of industrial orders and instructions, a world in which no target and no objective seemed beyond his and the party’s grasp.<br />
<strong><u>During the period of forced collectivization of farms, Stalin destroyed actual farms before the collectivized farms were created</u></strong>.

No one uses the word “war,: the word “bomb,” the word “death,” or the words “blood,” “pain,” “loss,” “grief,” “shock,” or “horror.”</u></strong> In Siegfried Sassoon’s recollection of World War I, he remembers encountering a man, a soldier like himself, who has just learned that his brother was killed. The man is half-crazy, tearing his clothes off, and cursing at war. As Sassoon passed beyond this man into the dark of the war, he could still hear “his uncouth howlings.” It is those “uncouth howlings” that those who are planning nuclear war have managed to mute in their imagination.<br />
But of course that howling is not entirely lost. In the shared imagination of our civilization, it is the “other” who carries emotion, the women who howl. And far from wishing to protect the vulnerable and the innocent, it is the secret desire of this civilization to destroy those who feel, and to silence feeling. This hidden desire becomes apparent in pornography where women are pictured in a traditional way as weaker than men and needing protection, and yet, where erotic feeling is freely mixed with the desire to brutalize and even murder women.<br />
One can find a grim picture of the insane logic of the alienated mind of our civilization in the pornographic film “Peeping Tom.” The hero of this movie is a pornographic film maker. He has a camera armed with a spear. As he photographs a woman’s naked body, the camera releases the weapon and he makes a record of her death agonies. The final victory of the alienated mind over reality is to destroy that reality (and one’s experience of it) and replace reality with a record of that destruction. One finds the same pattern in the history of actual atrocities. In California, a man lured women into the desert with a promise of work as pornographic models. There, while he tortured and murdered them, he made a photographic record of the event. The Nazis themselves kept the best documentation of atrocities committed in the concentration camps. And the most complete records of the destruction of native Americans have been kept by the United States military.<br />
Now, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the state of conflict in which this civilization finds itself has worsened</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>The enemy is not simply “the other” but life itself</u></strong></span>. And it is in keeping with the insane logic of alienation that the Pentagon has found a way that it believes we can win nuclear war. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>We have situated satellites in space that will record the process of annihilation of life, and the Pentagon counts, as a future victor, that nation which has gathered the best documentation of the destruction</u></span></strong>.<br />
There is however another form of reflection available to us by virtue of our human nature. We are our own witnesses. We can see ourselves. We are part of nature. And nature is not divided. Matter is intelligent. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Feeling</u></span></strong>, sense, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the needs of the body, all that has been consigned to the “other,” made the province of women, of darkness, contains a deeper and a sustaining wisdom</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>It remains for us to empower that knowledge and to carry it into the world</u></strong></span>.

<strong>MERE SURVIVAL IS INSUFFICIENT IN THE FACE OF ONGOING NUCLEAR WAR. DEATH IS INEVITABLE BUT AFFIRMING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FACE OF ANNIHILATION IS A LIFE AFFIRMING ACT NECESSARY FOR INDIVIDUAL VALUE TO EMERGE.</strong><br />

To focus only upon survival reveals technocratic politics as opportunistic. Doubtless, everybody wants to survive, but not everybody wants to survive in a way that values life or dignifies it. The nuclear age, after all, can be interpreted as an augury of Armageddon, and responded to as such. Thus we have a rash of survivalist periodicals, and cults to match, in the U.S. The premise of this movement is to imagine a Hobbesian society of “all against all” as a result of the bomb, and to encourage people to revert to open brutality in order to survive. For example, a recent issue of the magazine <em>Survival Guide</em> Describes how to make stone-age weapons (“Using the legacy of prehistory to survive without the benefit of conventional weapons”), and offers T-shirt with the slogans such as “Gun control is being able to hit your target” and “Peace through superior firepower.” While this sort of thing might be too repulsive for the average citizen, what is one to do about the fact that a number of those fundamentally responsible for the conduct of the war in Vietnam (for example, William Colby, former director of the CIA, and originator of the Phoenix program of assassinations in Vietnam) have clambered aboard the peace movement, evidently out of fear for their lives. The question is not whether such as Colby—or Presidential adviser McGeorge Bundy or Robert McNamara, former head of the Deparment of Defense and World Bank—are to be forgiven for their sins, now that they have declared themselves for the nuclear freeze. It is rather to establish a basis of antinuclear politics which will allow such questions to be considered. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Mere survival is not enough</u></span></strong>: everybody wants to survive, mass murderers along with innocent children. An antinuclear movement has to establish conditions where the value of life is affirmed, and then consider whether or not somebody is entitled to join it. Technocracy blurs this point and, in so doing, critically weakens the essential thrust against the state.<br />
Finally, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>the use of scare tactics only fertilizes the soil once again for nuclear terror. When we experience nothing but fear, we will stop at nothing to be reassured</u></span></strong>. But who under these conditions, will reassure us best? The state with its salve and its projection of the all-justifying Soviet threat –or the peace movement, proposing the novel and risky course of disarmament? It is no contest. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Unless the peace movement can provide an affirmative vision, it is defeated in advance</u></span></strong>.<br />
If this is the value of the facts, what is the value beyond the facts? I think this can best be seen through a critique of mere survival as the ground for antinuclear politics. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The point is</u></span></strong> not only to survive, but <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>to struggle for a life worth having</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>This means the realization that nuclear war has already been going on</u></strong></span> for some time—<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>and that it has assaulted and degraded us</u></span></strong> during this time. Therefore, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>a life worth living is to be attained through the struggle against the weapons and not simply as an abstract condition for controlling</u></span></strong> or eliminating <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>them</u></span></strong>. Once one appreciates this value, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>there is no settling for arms control</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>Strategic arms are</u></strong></span> themselves <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>an abomination</u></span></strong>, wielded <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>all the time whether or not they ever get exploded</u></span></strong>. Therefore <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>only elimination will do</u></span></strong>. If Messrs, McNamara and Bundy are willing to recognize this truth and to own up to all the havoc that their decisions and ways of governing have wreaked upon the world, then I, for one, would welcome them into the peace movement. If, however, they are simply afraid for their lives because their machine has gone haywire, and wish to confine themselves to tinkering with it so that it becomes a more efficient instrument of domination, then I would prefer to keep my distance from them.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>One does not attack nuclear arms because they do not work properly, nor because they have become suddenly dangerous to their masters</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>One attacks them because they are fiendish instruments of domination</u></strong></span>. The fact that they will kill us unless checked is not the main point, since <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>we</u></span></strong> are <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>all</u></span></strong> here to <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>die</u></span></strong> in any case. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>What galls us is the way this will happen, the wanton, omnicidal, future-destroying way of it, and what the system of nuclear states mean to the world</u></span></strong> right now.<br />

</span><br />
<span class="underline">Evidence of <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">hopelessness is all around us</span></span>. The majority of young people say they do not believe there will be a future of any sort. We shake our heads in dismay, failing to see that our social arrangements produce hopelessness and require it to hold themselves intact. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">But the</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> ontological </span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">possibility for hope is always present, rooted</span></span>, ultimately, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">in “the fact of natality</span></span>.” Arendt’s metaphor, mostly fully elaborated in the following passage from <em>The Human Condition</em>, is worth quoting in full:<br />
<span class="underline">The miracle that saves the world</span>, the realm of human affairs, <span class="underline">from its normal, “natural” ruin is ultimately the fact of natality</span>, in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It is</span></span>, in other words, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the birth of new human beings and the new beginning, the action they are capable of by being born</span></span>. <strong><em><u>Only the full experience of this capacity can bestow upon human affairs faith and hope, those two essential characteristics of human existence</u></em></strong>…that found perhaps their most glorious and most succinct expression in the new words with which the Gospels accounted their “glad tiding”: ‘A Child has been born unto us.’<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The infant, like all beginnings is vulnerable. We must nurture that beginning, not knowing and not being able to control the “end” of the story</u></span></strong>.<br />
Arendt’s evocation of <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">natal imagery</span></span> through its most dramatic urrarrative <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is not</span></span> offered as <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">an abstraction to be endorsed abstractly</span></span>. Rather, she invites us to restore long atrophied dispositions of commemoration and awe; birth, she declares, is a “miracle,” a beginning that renews and irreversibly alters the world. Hers is a fragile yet haunting figuration that stirs recognition of our own vulnerable beginnings and our necessary dependency on others. <strong><u>Placed alongside the reality of human beginnings, many accounts of political beginnings construed as the actions of male hordes</u></strong> or contractionalists <strong><u>seems parodic</u></strong> in part <strong><u>because of the massive denial</u></strong> (<strong><u>of “the female”</u></strong>) <strong><u>on which they depend</u></strong>. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">A “full experience” of the “capacity” rooted in birth helps us to keep before our mind’s eye the living reality of singularities, differences, and individualities rather than a human mass as objects of possible control or manipulation</span></span>.<br />
By offering an alternative genealogy that problemzatizes collective violence and visions of triumph, Arendt devirilizes discourse, not in favor of feminization (for the feminized and masculinized emerged in tandem and both embody dangerous distortions), but politicalization, constituting her male and female objects as citizens who share alike the “faculty of action.” At this juncture, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Arendt’s</u></span></strong> discourse makes contact with that feminism I characterized as a modified vision of the beautiful soul. <span class="underline">Her bracing <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">ideal of the citizen adds political robustness to a feminist picture of women drawn to action from their sense of being and their epistemic and social location. Arendt’s citizen</span></span>, for example, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">may act from her maternal thinking but not as a mother—an important distinction that could help to chasten sentimentalism or claims of moral superiority</span></span>.<br />
But war is the central concern of this essay. Does Arendt’s discourse offer a specifiable orientation toward international relations? Her discourse shifts the ground on which we stand when we think about states and their relations. We become skeptical about the forms and the claims of the sovereign state; we deflate fantasies of control inspired by the reigning teleology of progress; we recognize the (phony) parity painted by a picture or equally “sovereign states” and are thereby alert to the many forms hegemony can take. Additionally, Arendt grants “forgiveness” a central political role as the only way human beings have to break remorseless cycles of vengeance. She embraces an “ascesis,” a refraining or withholding that allows refusal to bring one’s force to bear to surface as a strength not a weakness.<br />
Take the dilemma of the nuclear arms race that seems to have a life and dynamic of its own. From an Arendtian perspective, we see <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>current arms control efforts</u></span></strong> for what they <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>are</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">-<strong><u>the arms race under another name negotiated by a bevy of experts with a</u></strong></span> <strong><u>vested <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">interest in keeping the race alive so they can &quot;control&quot; it</span></u></strong>. On the other hand, <strong><u>her recognition of <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the limiting conditions internal to the international political order precludes a leap into utopian fantasies of world</span> order or total <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">disarmament</span>. <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">For neither</span> the arms control option</u></strong> (as currently defined) <strong><u>nor calls for immediate disarmament <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">are bold</span>-<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the first because it is a way of doing business as usual</span>; <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the second because it covertly sustains business as usual by proclaiming &quot;solutions&quot; that lie outside the reach of possibility</span></u></strong>. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>Instead</u></span></strong>, Arendt's perspective invites us-<strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">as a</span> strong and dominant <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">nation of awesome potential force</span>-<span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">to take unilateral initiatives in order to break symbolically the cycle of vengeance and fear signified by our nuclear arsenals</span></u></strong>. Just as action from an individual or group may disrupt the automisms of everyday life, <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>action from a single state may send shock waves that reverberate throughout the system</u></span></strong>. Arendt cannot be pegged as either a &quot;systems dominance&quot; nor &quot;sub-systems dominance&quot; thinker-a form of argumentation with which she has no patience in any case. She recognizes systemic imperatives yet sees space for potentially effective change from &quot;individual (state) action.&quot; <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The war system is so deeply rooted that to begin to dismantle it in its current and highly dangerous form requires bold strokes</u></span></strong>.<br />
At this juncture, intimations of an alternative genealogy emerge. Freeman Dyson suggests the Odyssey or the theme of homecoming rather than the Iliad or the theme of remorseless force as a dominant ur-political myth if we break the deadlock of victims versus warriors. Socrates, Jesus of Nazareth, and Nietzsche, in some of his teachings, emerge as articulators of the prototypical virtues of restraint and refusal to bring all one's power to bear.

<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>If we were to see ourselves as universal parents</u></span></strong>, as profoundly <strong><u><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">desiring</span> not our own lives to go on</u></strong> forever <strong><u>but <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the lives of others to come into being, we would have a model highly appropriate to our time</span></u></strong>. Schell limits the model to the human species and to birth (or the simple willing of others into existence); I, on the other hand, would extend it both to other species and to nurturing activities beyond birth and feeding. Before amplifying these two points, however, I would stress that the power of the model rests on the base Schell has given it: the will deep within all of us which could be called the parental instinct, the will not to save ourselves but to bring others into existence. Most broadly, whether or not one is a biological or adoptive parent, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the parental instinct says to others</span></span>, “<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">It is good that you exist</span></span>!” <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">even if this involves a diminishment and</span></span>, in some cases, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">the demise of the self</span></span>. Or to put it a little differently, we realize, if we contemplate the possible death of our species (or worse still, the extinction of all life), that it is not our own individual end that is most appalling to us but the death of birth. We all want to be life givers, to pass life on, and when we do we can face our own deaths more easily. Therefore, <span class="underline">to suggest <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">universal parenthood</span> as a model to help <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">bring about justice through care calls upon our deepest instincts</span>, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">where life and death mingle and where the preservation of life for others takes precedence over concern for the self</span></span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. </span><br />
<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Universal parenthood</span></span>, however, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">cannot be limited to our species or to birth</span></span>. To limit it to our species displays the anthropocentric focus that fails to appreciate the interdependence and interrelatedness of all levels of life. Since <span class="underline">human beings</span> are the only “conscious” parents—that is the only ones who can, both for their own species and as surrogate parents for other species, will to help birth take place—we <span class="underline">have the special responsibility to</span> help administer the process: to <span class="underline">join God the creator-mother in so arranging the cosmic household that the birth and growth of other species will take place in an ecologically balanced way</span>, both for our own well-being and for the well-being of other species. <span class="underline">We must become the gardeners and caretakers</span> of our Eden, our beautiful, bountiful garden, <span class="underline">not taming and ruling</span> it, let alone despoiling and desecrating it, as we so often do, <span class="underline">but being to it as a universal parent, willing the existence of all species and</span>, as a good householder, <span class="underline">ordering the just distribution of the necessities of existence</span>. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">We are</span></span>, of course, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">speaking</span></span> here of an attitude, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">of a role model that</span></span>, if assumed, can begin to change both how one sees the world and how one acts in and toward it. If one thought of oneself as parent to the world, that is, if one moved oneself inside that model and walked around in it, acting the role of parent, what changes might come about in, say, how one spent one’s time, one’s money, one’s vote? <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">The universalizing of our most basic loves</span></span>, extending them <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">beyond the confines of our immediate families and</span></span> primary communities and <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">even</span></span> beyond <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">our own species</span></span>, is, I believe, the necessary direction in our search for models for behavior in an ecological, nuclear age.<br />
The other direction in which we must universalize parenthood is in extending it beyond birth and an attention to basic nurture, to an attention to the entire well-being of our successors. As creator, God the mother is concerned not only with birth and nourishment but also with fulfillment. We have noted that female deities in other religious traditions and female attributes or personas of God in ours were not limited to bearing and caring for new life but were also pictured as involved in the fulfillment of life through the ordering of justice, the impartation of wisdom, the invitation to the oppressed, the transformation of life, and so forth. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">Parenthood</span></span> is not limited to birth and nurture but <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">includes all creative activities supported the next generation—and by implication, the weak and vulnerable as well</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">This</span></span>, of course, once again <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">undercuts the split between nature and history, for in the humans species</span></span> at least, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">nurture and fulfillment involve all ranges of the body, mind, and spirit</span></span>. All people, therefore, who engage in work, paid or unpaid, that helps to sustain the present and coming generations are universal parents. The agapic, just love that we have designated as parental, the love that gives without calculating the return, that wills the existence and fulfillment of other beings—this love is manifest in ways beyond counting. It is found in the teacher who gives extra time to the slow or gifted students, in the social worker whose clients are drug-addicted pregnant women, in the librarian who lovingly restores old books, in the specialist in world population control whose days are spent on planes and in board meetings, in the zoologist who patiently studies the behavior of the great apes in the wild, in the owner of the local supermarket who employs ex-juvenile delinquents, in the politician who supports more funds for public education, in the botanist who catalogues new strains of plants, in rock stars who give their talents to famine relief. All of these are examples of universal parenthood: the examples are independent both of gender and of biological parenthood and are not limited to our own species. Nor are they unusual. In fact, much paid work in any society and almost all volunteer work have potential parental dimensions. It is these dimensions that need to be uncovered and encouraged in order to work within the ethic of God as mother-creator, the ethic of justice.<br />
Needless to say, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">individual examples alone will not accomplish revolution</span></span>. Is it possible to think of governments modeling themselves as universal parents? <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">The model in</span></span> most <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">capitalist democracies is a mechanical one</span></span>, balancing the rights and responsibilities of various constituencies while focusing on the freedom of the individual. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">In such a model the vulnerable and the weak, including children and the natural world, tend to do poorly, since they do not have a voice strong enough</span></span>—if they have any voice at all—to sway the balance of power or <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">to protect themselves against rapacious individualism</span></span>. Some forms of socialism do approach the parental model more closely, both in understanding the political order in organic rather than mechanistic terms and in providing better support for the necessities of life to the young, the sick, and the vulnerable.<br />
<span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">The intention</span></span> of these remarks on the ethic of God the mother-creator as justice <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is</span></span> not, however, to provide the blueprint for the reconstitution of society but <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">to sketch the change in attitude, the conversion of consciousness, that could come about were we to begin to live inside the model and allow it to become a lens through which we looked out on the world</span></span>, We would no longer see a world we named and ruled or, like the artist God, made: mothers and fathers to the world do not rule or fashion it. Our positive role in creation is as preservers, those who pass life along and who care for all forms of life so they may prosper. Our role as preservers is a very high calling, our peculiar calling as human beings, the calling implied in the model of God as mother.<br />

<strong>THE PROBLEM WITH NUCLEAR POLICY IS IT ATTEMPTS TO PRESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF THE FUTURE BY RESTRICTING HUMAN NATURE TO A SELECT FORM OF VIOLENT RELATIONS.

</span><br />
We now return to the theme of hope and hopelessness to examine how this sheds light on making peace and making war. As one of the theological virtues, hope proceeds from our rootedness in God. It is nevertheless far from an optimistic attitude to the future. Such an attitude might say “I am optimistic that there will be no nuclear war. Who would be so crazy? Besides, God would not allow it.” Or, “Deterrence has worked so far; it will continue to work.” The optimists have been wrong about every war we have had until now. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>The trouble</u></span></strong> with such optimism <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>is</u></span></strong> that it envisions the content of the future; it <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">attempts to predict</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"> and so </span><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">does not take into account the freedom of history to move beyond our conceptualizations</span></span>.<br />
War-making, including preparing for war, and especially for a protracted nuclear war, involves a similar optimism—that our technological capacity and penchant for control can account for every future contingency. It, too, tries to predict the future (as Clarke Chapman clearly demonstrates in Chapter 8 of this book). <strong><u>But <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">war-making</span></u></strong> also <strong><u>proceeds from hopelessness</u></strong>. <strong><u>It envisions the future simply by extrapolating from a content currently known. From an understanding of the past and the present that is taken as the ultimate potential for the future. It assumes that the unreconciled, unpeaceful world that relies on nuclear weapons is the norm</u></strong>—that conflict is the norm and can be avoided finally only by the threat of greater conflict. <strong><u>It <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">does not see any deeper grounding for human existence than self-interest defined as current or expected benefits</span></u></strong>. To the extent that we see this extrapolation as definitive, there can be no possibility, newness, or surprise, because the ground of imagination has become closed to ongoing future experience.<br />
<strong><u>The maxim “If you want peace, prepare for war” is thus the maxim of hopelessness</u></strong>, of the failure to imagine an open future due to conceptual identification of the structure of the future within the events of the past. <strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>What <em>we</em> think becomes the future; our sense of its content precludes experiential awareness of the specific, concrete horizon of our being</u></span></strong>. The nuclear vision of the future is thus closed, constricted, profoundly antimetaphorical. (The examples of nuclear fatalism offered by John McDargh in Chapter 6 of this book testify to this.) If there is any saving grace in nuclear weapons, it lies in the Bomb’s power to expose this dimension of the war-making mythos. <strong><u>The prospect of the destruction of the species through war has compelled many people to see war in an entirely new attitude. This now means to see the hopelessness behind <em>all</em> war, to see how removed war is from the true horizon `of our life</u></strong>.<br />
<strong><span style="-webkit-background-clip: initial; -webkit-background-origin: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: yellow; background-image: initial; background-origin: initial;"><u>This is not to say that it is wrong to expect benefits from the future</u></span></strong><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">. <strong><u>The problem arises when the <em>content</em> of what is expected is separated from awareness of human grounding in a nonmanipulable way in the absolute future, the free future</u></strong>. <span class="underline">To oppose nuclear war</span></span>, on the other hand, <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is to become aware of this deepest grounding</span></span>. It is hopeful activity, even if we sense little basis for optimism in current history. To write on the subject, to speak, to demonstrate, to engage in civil disobedience are concrete actions geared to change the situation. As such, <span class="underline">they themselves point to that deeper horizon, the grounding in the future. They <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">do not assign the future a specific content but</span> they <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">say</span> that <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">its reality</span>, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">its structure as presently experienced</span>, <span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">is incompatible with nuclear conceptualization</span></span>. <span class="underline"><span style="-moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; background: yellow;">They are metaphors of an open future that is known only in exploring its surprising manifestations, in committing ourselves to a practical value</span></span>. Working for peace, building a peaceful world, is not mere opposition to nuclear weapons, it is a positive expression of a specific truth—in Christian terms, the Kingdom of God that is the working out of the deepest truth of creation. <span class="underline">And in experiencing the structure of true peace while attempting to help it blossom, we encounter in the veiled metaphorical manner of our actions the Ultimate truth itself. As metaphors, these actions are experiences of the concrete reality of the Ultimate and express its shape, its structure</span>.<br />

<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">THE ROLE OF THE BALLOT IS TO EVALUATE THE DESIRABILITY OF COMPETING POLITICAL NARRATIVES</span>. THE AFFIRMATIVE WINS IF IT PRESENTS A TOPICAL STORY THAT REDUCES THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL AND IS MATERIALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY SUPERIOR TO THE POLITICAL NARRATIVE DEFENDED BY THE NEGATIVE. A POLITICAL NARRATIVE CONSISTS OF BOTH A MATERIAL COURSE OF ACTION AND THE RHETORICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THAT ACTION.<br />
<strong>2.) solves all their theoretical and politics good offense – we will unconditionally defend that it is a good idea; aff just asks judges to also consider the underlying rational for policy.</strong><br />
<strong>3.) key to fairness – it’s reciprocal with the negatives ability to read the k</strong><br />
<strong>4.) NARRATIVE ISN’T EXTRA TOPICAL; ONLY INTERNAL LINK TO POLICY education – analysis of political narratives only internal link to policy education.</strong><br />
