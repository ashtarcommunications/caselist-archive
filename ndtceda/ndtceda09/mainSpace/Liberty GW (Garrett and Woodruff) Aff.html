Four Affirmatives:<br />
<br />
1) NFU (most common affirmative)<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should adopt and implement a nuclear No First Use policy.<br />
<br />
Advantages: Proliferation (regional wars and/or militarism impacts), Prompt Global Strike (hegemony impact), Japan Relations (Asia war, hegemony, warming, terrorism, disease impacts), India Rollback (China-India war, terrorism, resource wars, Indo-Pak war impacts), China Modernization (US-China war and North Korea prolif impacts), Threat Making (perpetual conflict/depoliticizaiton impacts), China Relations (warming impact).<br />
<br />
2) NFU to Iran (one round at districts)<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should adopt a Nuclear No First Use policy towards the Islamic Republic of Iran<br />
<br />
Advantages: US Strikes (Hirsch war impact and economy) and Iran Democracy (terrorism, middle east war, proliferation, Central Asia war)<br />
<br />
3) CTBT (Richmond and Vanderbilt)<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should ratify and implement the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.<br />
<br />
Advantages: Proliferation (Utgoff, terorrism and accidents) and Leadership (soft power internals-Thayer impact)<br />
<br />
4) Covert De-Alert (one round at Kentucky)<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should issue a top secret directive covertly removing all batteries from all of its land-based nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched nuclear ballistic missiles.<br />

Dolar, philosophy professor University of Ljubljana, 2003<br />
(Mladen, “THE POWER OF THE INVISIBLE”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://static.kiberpipa.org/~break/old/dolar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://static.kiberpipa.org/~break/old/dolar.htm</a>, ldg)<br />
<br />
This leads us to the simple …moulds our behaviour in its very non-completion.<br />
<br />
Our status quo policy of threatening first strikes is like an extortionist that sells protection insurance to a local store to keep the extorionist from destroying the store. We force people into accepting security gaurentees of protection from nuclear strieks in exchange for utter submission to US security paradigms. This instrumentalizes other nations.<br />
Tilly, social science professor Columbia University, 1985<br />
(Charles, &quot;Bringing the State Back In,&quot; 1985, p. 170-171, ldg)<br />
<br />
In contemporary American parlance, … the sanctity of governments.<br />
<br />
And, even though the US would not use its nuclear weapons, the implict threat is enough. It militarizes our relations with the world and depoliticizes nuclear war as a constant spectacle from which all should flee. Thus, the US simultaneously inflates the value of nukes and asks for others to give up their freedom for their future.<br />
Dolar, philosophy professor University of Ljubljana, 2003<br />

<br />
To make a step further … which sustains its authority.<br />
<br />
Specifically, implicit threats are the worst, they push violent language underground and make the discursive violence the US employs invisible.<br />
Dolar, philosophy professor University of Ljubljana, 2003<br />

<br />
The threat works at its best, …an immaterial, a virtual existence.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, this process of instrumentalizing implied threats makes war depoliticized and necessary- it becomes self-fulfilling- we must manufacture threats to force others to seek our protection, but they only need our protection because we made up the danger. The AFF ends this vicious cycle.<br />

<br />
Contention One: Inadvertent Launch<br />
US inadvertent launch is inevitable now- 6 independent reasons<br />
<br />
1. Unauthorized launches- high alert guarantees unauthorized launches- air force mistakes PROVE safeguards alone are insufficient<br />
Blair et al, US nuclear command-and-control expert and former nuclear launch control officer, February 2008<br />
[Bruce, from 1970 to 1974, Dr. Blair served in the U.S. Air Force, serving as a Minuteman ICBM launch control officer and support officer for the Strategic Air Command’s Airborne Command Post, World Security Institute president, Global Zero co-founder, former Brookings Institution Foreign Policy Studies Program senior fellow, former project director at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, &quot;Toward True Security,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/press/_docs/Toward%20True%20Security%202008%20.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/press/_docs/Toward%20True%20Security%202008%20.pdf</a>, mss]<br />
Maintaining forces on high alert also increases the risk of unauthorized launches<br />
The military was unaware of the missing warheads for 36 hours.<br />
<br />
Status quo barriers are embarrassing- launch officers test and defeat them out of boredom with simple ingenuity and elbow grease<br />
Rosenbaum, Slate columnist, 8-31-2007<br />
[Ron, &quot;The Return of the Doomsday Machine?&quot; Slate Magazine, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2173108/pagenum/all/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2173108/pagenum/all/</a>, mss]<br />
One crew member even disclosed to me a flaw in the &quot;command<br />
American ingenuity! Can't beat it for finding a new way to end the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Human error- stress and mental breakdowns will lead to mistakes and war<br />
Pikaev et al, Non-proliferation and Arms Reduction Center head, 2001<br />
[Alexander Alexeevich, RAS IMEMO PMFC Non-Proliferation and Arms Reduction Center head, Assistant State Duma Deputy, &quot;De-alerting Russian and US nuclear weapons: A path to reducing nuclear dangers,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ieer.org/russian/pubs/dlrtbk-e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ieer.org/russian/pubs/dlrtbk-e.html</a>, mss]<br />
The Role Of The Human Factor In Causing A War<br />
it is precisely the human factor that constitutes the weakest link in the nuclear safety assurance system.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is complicated by drug and alcohol use by launch officers<br />
Boring, University of Washington computer science professor, 2001<br />
[Alan, Dr. Borning's work with Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility resulted in a definitive analysis of the role of computer failure in accidental nuclear war, &quot;Computer System Reliability and Nuclear War,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/Breakthrough/book/chapters/borning.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/Breakthrough/book/chapters/borning.html</a>, mss]<br />
Another source of failure is human operator error.<br />
about alcohol, drug abuse, and aberrant behavior among American military personnel with access to nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Computer error- complex military codes are doomed to fail<br />
Pikaev et al, Non-proliferation and Arms Reduction Center head, 2001<br />

Naturally, in the latter case, the level of nervousness<br />
tragic consequences due to their intrinsic lack of reliability.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. False warnings- the high rate of false alarms is not only intrinsically dangerous but demonstrates a significant probability that false alarms will OVERLAP increasing their credibility- spurring nuclear war<br />
Phillips, physicist and radar technician, and Starr, nuclear engineer, May-June 2004<br />
[Alan and Steven, &quot;Let's go No-LOW,&quot; Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, general onefile, mss]<br />
The most likely cause of accidental nuclear war is &quot;launch on warning&quot;<br />
when forces are placed on alert, the complexity of warning systems may not only cease to provide redundancy--it may amplify mistakes. (6)<br />
<br />
AND- Timing is key- high alert status reduces decision time forcing nuclear launch<br />
Blair, US nuclear command-and-control expert and former nuclear launch control officer, 10-13-2007<br />
[Bruce, from 1970 to 1974, Dr. Blair served in the U.S. Air Force, serving as a Minuteman ICBM launch control officer and support officer for the Strategic Air Command’s Airborne Command Post, World Security Institute president, Global Zero co-founder, former Brookings Institution Foreign Policy Studies Program senior fellow, former project director at the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, &quot;A Rebuttal of the U.S. Statement on the Alert Status of U.S. Nuclear Forces,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lcnp.org/disarmament/opstatus-blair.htm" rel="nofollow">http://lcnp.org/disarmament/opstatus-blair.htm</a>, mss]<br />
If their early warning assessment determines that a<br />
would “drive the president inevitably toward [such] a decision.”[8]<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Cyber attacks- electronic backdoors allow false launch orders and credible false-warnings<br />
Rosenbaum, Slate columnist, 5-9-2008<br />

So it's insanely short-fused as it is. But when I spoke to Blair in Washington last week<br />
powerful argument for Blair's de-alerting proposals.<br />

Creating a false signal in these early warning<br />
This could add pressure to the decision making process, and if coordinated precisely, could appear as a first round EMP burst.<br />

Despite the possibility of exaggerated claims<br />
, there would also be considerable confusion as to the coordination of a relief effort (Carfano 2008, Lewis 2002).<br />

Timing is key and makes it easy- cyber-deception need only be believable for 15 minutes<br />

would be equivalent to approximately 100,000 Hiroshima bombs (Blair 2008).<br />

Common sense might indicate that better relations<br />
succeeding in this new world will as well.<br />
<br />
NEXT- is the risk calculus- you should give massive weight to the risk of accidental launch even if they severely mitigate the case-<br />
1. Probability- each risk factor builds on the other- in the end our chance of survival is no better than in Russian roulette<br />

There would be some sense in holding defenders of the status quo to less stringent<br />
effort to move toward a global prohibition on nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
2. General nuclear incompetence is the icing on the cake- multiple recent US incidents prove the risk is too high<br />
Martin, Stanley Foundation program officer, July 2008<br />

AND- Even without intentional escalation US inadvertent launch triggers Russian doomsday machine- causes automatic extinction response<br />
Rosenbaum, Slate columnist, 8-31-2007<br />

Once initiated, the counterattack would be controlled by<br />
one mistake that could end it all.<br />
<br />
<br />
US-Russia war is the only scenario for extinction<br />
Bostrom, Oxford philosophy faculty, March 2002<br />
[Nick, “Existential Risks Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards,” Journal of Evolution and Technology, Vol. 9, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html</a>, mss]<br />
A much greater existential risk emerged with the build<br />
since it would not destroy or thwart humankind’s potential permanently.<br />
<br />
Even a one percent risk of extinction outweighs any impact or moral imperative<br />
Bostrom, Oxford philosophy professor, July 2005<br />

Now if we think about what just reducing the probability<br />
people and ignore the potential that could be loss if people went extinct it should still have a high priority.<br />

<br />
Contention Two: Solvency<br />
De-alerting completely eliminates risk of accidents<br />
Steinbruner, University of Maryland Center for International and Security Studies director, June 2009<br />

Most individuals not embedded in the contemporary<br />

They are therefore now considering other options, including<br />
A third possibility would be to replace the aerodynamic missile nose cones with flat-faced covers, which would shelter the warheads but not allow the missiles to fly a normal trajectory.<br />
<br />
Missiles don’t fly without batteries<br />
