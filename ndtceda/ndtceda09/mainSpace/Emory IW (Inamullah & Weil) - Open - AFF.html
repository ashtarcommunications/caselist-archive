If so, this new failure--the failure to develop an international system to hedge against the possibility of worldwide depression--will open their eyes to their folly. Hundreds of millions-- billions--of people around the world have pinned their hopes on the international market economy. They and their leaders have embraced market principles—and drawn closer to the West--because they believe that our system can work for them. But what if it can't? What if the global economy stagnates--or even shrinks? In that case, we will face a new period of international conflict: South against North, rich against poor. Russia, China, India--these countries with their billions of people and their nuclear weapons will pose a much greater danger to world order than Germany and Japan did in the '30s.<br />

The Stanley Foundation 08 [“US Nuclear Weapons Doctrine: Can We Adopt No First Use?” Policy Dialogue Brief, April 4, 2008]<br />
<br />
Throughout the Cold War, the United States reserved the right to … options in war plans simply because they need a mission for weapons they already have. Pg. 2<br />

CGS is not enough. NFU is key to sending the proper signal about the role of the program<br />

<br />
Instead of building modernised nuclear weapons for …establishing near-exclusive reliance on robust conventional forces will be key to that policy’s utility.<br />
<br />
NFU is key to alter risk caculations. Adversaries will be forced to account for our conventional assets<br />
DFI International 01 [“Non-Nuclear Strategic Deterrence of State and Non-State Adversaries: Potential Approaches and Prospects for Success,” A Study for The Defense Threat Reduction Agency Advanced Systems and Concepts Office, FINAL REPORT, October 2001, pg. handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA459871]<br />

No impact to Japan prolif<br />
White 8 “A nuclear japan: the least bad option?”<br />
However, it is also fair to say that I weigh some of the factors…accommodating India as a nuclear-armed country.<br />
<br />
DPJ likes the plan<br />
Cirincione 8-10<br />
“The Pendagon’s Nuclear Posture Landmine”<br />
This last theme is particularly insidious…attack countries without nuclear capability.<br />
<br />
Japanese prolif not cause more prolif<br />
Halperin 99 “The Nuclear Dimension of the U.S.-Japan Alliance”<br />
U.S. policy continues to be premised on the assumption…move to develop nuclear weapons.<br />

Zero chance<br />

<br />
IAEA built japan’s plants – impossible for them to get weapons<br />
Avery 9 “Japan’s nuclear future: policy debate, prospects, and U.S. interests”<br />
However, the ability to develop a few nuclear weapons…ideal for military use, in compliance with Japanese law.<br />
<br />
Jack the nuclear power industry – never do it<br />
Mochizuki 7 “Japan tests the nuclear taboo”<br />
If Japan wanted to move toward the development…reliable sources of natural uranium.<br />
