The use of techno-strategic language binds us into a position of power where we interpret the events surrounding nuclear weaponry from the perspective of a user. This renders the dangers of nuclear weaponry no longer as threats but as an extension of the power that has been given through this discourse.<br />

<strong><u>&quot;nuclear weapons systems become extensions of the self, rather than threats to it</u></strong>. &quot;<br />

Techno-strategic discourse replaces human life as the most important calculation with our arsenal instead. This creates a disjunction with reality that makes people expendable. Additionally, this discourse is rooted within a system that only makes sense insofar as it ignores the irrational aspect of human existence.<br />

Counter-interpretation – debate is about deciding if the resolution is right or wrong. The affirmative must prove it right by endorsing and defending a topical plan and its epistemological underpinnings. The negative must prove that the status quo, comparative policy option, or critical alternative is better. <br />
A) Our interpretation solves 100% of their policy debate good arguments. We only need to win a risk that debating critiques on the negative is beneficial to education and ground. Reasons to prefer our interpretation: <br />
1) The affirmative should not get to choose the framework. This would justify the aff framework “who should be more racist.” This also greatly constricts negative ground by allowing the affirmative to define what the negative can run against them. The aff has a side bias and the first and last speech meaning you should err negative on issues of predictability. <br />
2) Our interpretation is predictable. They choose what affirmative they want to run, they should be prepared to defend the ontological assumptions of their advantages. Affs should also be prepared to critically defend their actor and mechanism of action.  <br />
3) Our interpretation gets all of the benefits of a policy education, and allows debaters to critically negate the resolution. Our education is more real world because it provides agency to critically think in our everyday lives.  <br />
B) If we win the framework then the aff only has defend the critical assumptions of the 1ac, then they can leverage their advantages as offense. If we win our critical alternative undercuts the theory of the 1ac then vote negative. <br />

 We live in a horrifying existence that does not care of our existence or the importance that we attach to our lives. Commitments to mold the world into something that is acceptable for humans is a false desire that will result in nihilism as we are forced to confront the horror of existence. We must conceal this horror through an affirmation of the will to power and an understanding of existence that lends itself to ascertaining joy despite the suffering that is produced.<br />

&quot;Nietzsche's belief in the horror of existence is largely, if not completely, overlooked by &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;after text as we proceed. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative posits themselves as masters of the theatre of policy, able to create a new reality which more closely resembles the ideal form which makes their plan defensible. this drive towards purification and explanation, this will to truth, is an attempt to escape suffering and creative potential which negates life.<br />

&quot;The craving for absolutely general specifications results in doing metaphysics. Unlike &quot;<br />

<br />
In order to truly affirm life we must accept that life itself is the highest value and we must be willing to allow individual beings and species to perish to allow for life to exert its will. A refusal to accept individual suffering will force us to confront the horror of existence – that our extinction is meaningless creating nihilism.<br />

Our alternative is to divorce our relationship to life from one that is premised on hatred of its excess and affirm human freedom as practice. It is a refusal to run away from suffering, pain and death. Refusing to be controlled by death and catastrophe is not to bring those events close but rather to resist their ability to harm us. Only through an act of forgetting can we ever act in a manner that affirms existence.<br />

 We must affirm life in its entirety any attempt to modify our suffering within our experience dooms us to becoming slaves to our suffering as we resent the aspects that were not beneficial for us.<br />

Existence Is Meaningless<br />
Existence is meaningless because God is dead and existence is a massive multiplicity that has no order or purpose<br />

A2: Truth Exists/You Make Truth Claims<br />
Our argument isn’t that truth doesn’t exist but that truth is horrible and should be avoided. An affirmation of existence necessitates a veiling of the truth.<br />
