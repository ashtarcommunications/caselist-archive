Topicality---Size affs have to dismantle warheads/send them to Pantex<br />
<br />
Vagueness - plan doesn't specify which/how many warheads get cut<br />
<br />
Financial reform - PC Key, FR key economy<br />
<br />
Court CP - rule the retention of weapons cut by the aff violates CIL<br />
<br />
NPR CP - Presidential NSD that the NPR include a recommendation to do the plan<br />
<br />
CMR - Iran strikes impact<br />
<br />
CP - Pit stuff the warheads, don't dismantle them<br />
<br />
Pantex DA - sending more warheads overlaods it, it jacks the Ogalalla aquifer, causes water wars<br />
<br />
Tritium DA - dismantlement causes processing, that's environmental racism<br />

 <br />
DISMANTLE CP<br />
CP: the USFG will relinquish control and possession of all its conventional weapons and any other government functions to a separate land or territory within the continental united states for the descendants of African slaves. The USFG will dismantle its nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
Dismantling the arsenal is mutually exclusive with relinquishing control of it<br />
<br />
Transferring US conventional military forces gives the black nation the best possible defenses without locating political power in nuclear weapons<br />
Scoblic 8/16/09 “the hawkish case for nuclear disarmament”<br />
That is a remarkable waste of America’s…little to augment our influence abroad<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons are genocidal – they cannot ecape the legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Transferring them is immoral. As activists, we should call for them to be dismantled<br />

The human race stands on the…time for preventive action is now!<br />
<br />
PLAN PLAN: Prisons elimination<br />
Text: the Prison system of the so-called united states should be disbanded<br />
<br />
The us prison regime is a discursive part of American world ordering that uses material and discursive repression to pave the way for white supremacy neoliberals and American style democracy<br />
Dylan Rodriguez 2007 “American globality and the US prison regime” online<br />
In this meditation I am concerned…warfare, and global white supremacy<br />
<br />
The prison system is a means of projecting American white supremacy around the world<br />
Rodriguez 7 (cite above)<br />
I am suggesting a conception of…as well as professional) scholarly praxis<br />
<br />
<br />
The white supremacist violence of the prison is the formation of the state itself<br />
Rodriguez 7 (cite above)<br />
Looking closely at the current formation…dominance, occupation, and political ascendancy<br />

T- Must read a plan<br />
<br />
Deliberative argument requires an agreement established before the debate in order to determine the relevance of any argument. Without a point of stasis, debates could easily devolve into ridiculous claims the logic of the aff makes every argument relevant and therefore makes deliberative argument impossible<br />
Walton 04 “relevance in argumentation” p 126<br />
Such matters of how a chain…the problem that should be solved<br />
<br />
Only normative policy discussions open a political space for democratic empowerment<br />
Mitchell 2k2<br />

<br />
<br />
Restrictions on what can be debated protect subversion and meaningful debate<br />
Shively 2k Partisan politics and political theory p 181-4<br />
At the very least, we must agree…and other forms of tyranny<br />
<br />
<br />
T- Giving away weapons NOT TOPICAL<br />
Normal means is weapons to be reduced get sent to Pantex, where they sit in a long line behind other warheads, before they are eventually destroyed<br />
Admiral stansfield Turner 1998 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cdi.org/adm/1206/Turner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdi.org/adm/1206/Turner.html</a><br />
And originally I came up with…only be putting them in escrow<br />
<br />
Reducing the size of the arsenal means sending the warheads to Pantex for dismantling or destruction<br />

Dylan Rodriguez, Professor University of California Riverside, November 2007, Kritika Kultura “AMERICAN GLOBALITY AND THE U.S. PRISON REGIME: STATE VIOLENCE AND WHITE SUPREMACY FROM ABU GHRAIB TO STOCKTON TO BAGONG DIWA.”<br />
I am suggesting.. professional) scholarly praxis.<br />
<br />
Focusing on a kritik of white supremacy allows an understanding of the ways in which difference is produced and regulated across the entire reach of the united states. This I the method by which people of color all over the world are managed and enslaved<br />
