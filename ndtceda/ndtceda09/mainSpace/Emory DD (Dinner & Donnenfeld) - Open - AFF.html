In an era of terrorism and information warfare, staking the survival of humanity on the assumption that imperfect human and technical systems of**** nuclear command and control will forever prevent a disastrous breakdown of safeguards against mis- taken or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons is simply imprudent in the extreme. **An in-depth discussion of the potential exploitable weaknesses in nuclear command systems is beyond the scope of this analysis, but a few general observations are pertinent. First, many of the deficiencies are unknown, some will never be found, and **others will not be discovered until it is too late**. The complexity of command systems pre- vents a full reckoning of the risks run by hair-trigger postures. Periodic investigations routinely discover glaring weaknesses, however. For instance, a Pentagon investigation conducted by an independent commission in the 1990s at the behest of then Sen. Sam Nunn to evaluate the effectiveness of U.S. nuclear safeguards against unau- thorized launch found dozens of major deficiencies.14 This commission recommended a multitude of remedies, including installing a special new safeguard on Trident subs—the inner safe described earlier—to create a technical barrier to unauthorized launch. Second, many of the deficiencies that are identified and addressed turn out not to have been corrected. The introduction of “enable code” devices into Minuteman launch centers in the 1960s is a case in point. In theory, the devices required launch crews to receive an eight-digit code from higher authority in order to arm their missiles’ warheads prior to launch. In practice, the Strategic Air Command, unbeknownst to higher authority (such as former Defense Secretary Robert McNa- mara, who initiated and pressed for this safeguard), configured the devices so that they were always set to all zeros—that was the secret password known to all launch crews. This circumvention persisted until 1976, when actual codes were finally introduced. In the interim, the posture ran a higher risk of unauthorized launch by crew members or others who might have gained access to the launch centers, includ- ing terrorists.15 Third, the nuclear command systems today operate in an intense information battleground on which more than 20 nations including Russia, China, and North Korea have developed dedicated computer attack programs.16 These programs deploy viruses to disable, confuse, and delay nuclear command and warning processes in other nations. The U.S. Strategic Command is no exception. Information warfare is now one of its core missions. At the brink of conflict, nuclear command and warning networks around the world may be besieged by electronic intruders whose onslaught degrades the coherence and rationality of nuclear decisionmaking. **The potential for perverse consequences with computer-launched weapons on hair-trigger is clear**. Other information warfare programs are designed to infiltrate and collect information on, for example, the schedule of the movement of nuclear warheads during peacetime. Hacking operations of these sorts are increasing exponentially as the militaries of the world increasingly depend on computer and communications networks. The number of attempts by outside hostile actors to break into Defense Department networks has surged by tenfold in the past couple of years. Hostile intrusion attempts against Pentagon computer systems now run in the neighborhood of 1,000 per day. (China is especially active.) What is worse, some of this expanding illicit penetration involves insiders, creating a whole new dimension to the “insider” threat to nuclear systems. If insiders with knowledge of special passwords or other sensitive information related to nuclear weapons activities collude with outsiders, the integrity of nuclear command and control systems and safeguards against the unauthorized launch of nuclear weapons on launch-trigger alert may well be compromised. The guid- ing principle of nuclear safeguards during the past 50 years—the two- man rule—may be obsolete in the age of information warfare. The notion that having a second person present during any sensitive nuclear operation would prevent an accidental or intentional nuclear incident may have been sound during the labor-intensive and analog- dominated era of nuclear command and control, but in the modern age of information warfare, new safeguards may be needed to prevent the electronic compromise of missiles on hair-trigger alert. Adding terrorists to this equation gives further reason to believe that the Cold War nuclear postures are counterproductive—**they exacerbate rather than alleviate nuclear problems, and they are an accident waiting to happen**. There is a possibility that terrorists could spoof early warning sensors and thereby engender false alarms that precipitate nuclear overreactions. The possibility also exists that **terrorists**, possibly with insider help, **may get inside the command and communications networks controlling nuclear forces. They might gain information useful to interdicting and capturing weapons, or unau- thorized actors might discover ways to inject messages into the circuits. Again, the wisdom of keeping nuclear forces ready to fly instantaneously upon receipt of a short stream of computer signals is dubious. The more likely scenario is one in which nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists because of intrinsic fault lines in the nuclear postures. The simple fact that maintaining war-ready nuclear postures requires many hundreds of nuclear bombs to be moving around on alert or going back and forth between the field and bomb refurbishment facilities means that they are exposed to terrorist capture or theft during the most vulnerable phase of their operating cycle: transportation, the Achilles Heel of security.18 As long as traditional deterrent practices continue, it will be impossible to truly “lock down” the arsenals to protect them from terrorist theft. Sooner or later, the Nunn- Lugar program will fail unless the day-to-day adversarial nuclear relationship is ended. 14. An especially noteworthy example is the discovery by the commission of an unprotected electronic back door into the naval broadcast communications network used to transmit launch orders by radio to the U.S. Trident deterrent submarine fleet. Unauthorized persons, including terrorists, may have been able to seize electronic control of shore-based radio transmitters such as the very low frequency facility at Cutler, Maine, and actually inject a launch order into the network. The deficiency was taken so seriously that new launch order validation protocols had to be devised and Trident crews had to undergo special training to learn them.">Beyond the familiar arguments about the inherent danger of accidental nuclear attack triggered by false alarms, and unauthorized launches by unreliable personnel, &lt;span class=&quot;StyleHeading4UnderlinedsmalltextGaramondChar&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt;&quot;&gt;lurk shadowy new threats stemming from terrorist scenarios and growing cybernetic threats to the nuclear command and warning systems.

 <span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Both the Kremlin and the White House routinely re-issue presidential nuclear guidance that requires their respective nuclear forces to be constantly prepared to fight a largescale nuclear war with each other at a moment’s notice. These forces are assigned long lists of targets, running into the thousands on each side, to strike in the event of war, and they are expected to inflict serious damage with high probability on all target categories – opposing nuclear forces, conventional forces, war-supporting industry, and leadership. The forces cannot achieve this wartime objective of high ‘damage expectancy’ if the opposing forces destroy them first, and so both strategic arsenals kept on launch-ready alert. Their command and early warning networks maintain a constant vigil and readiness to launch the forces on warning of incoming warheads fired by the opposing side. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">This fuse is no longer today than it was during the Cold War. Both nuclear superpowers manage their strategic arsenals in almost exactly the same manner as they did during the Cold War. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">How short is this fuse? Many <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">hundreds of missiles</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> on land and sea <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">are fully armed, </span>fueled<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">, and targeted</span>.</span></span> The land-based missiles in silos will fly as soon as they receive a few short computer signals whose transmission is as simple as stroking a few keys on a keyboard, hitting ‘enter,’ repeating the sequence once more, and then turning twoaaa keys in unison. The sea-based missiles on submarines will pop out of their tubes as soon as their gyroscopes are spun up, the onboard computer uploads their wartime targets and arms their warheads, and additional computer signals open the hatches and ignite the steam generators that propel the missiles to the surface. </span><br />
<span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">If the Kremlin and the White House ordered the launch of their alert strategic missiles right now</span></span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">, this minute, without any prior notice and advance preparation, the amount of firepower unleashed and the speed of its release would be astonishingly large and rapid. U.S. land-based launch crews would receive the order almost instantaneously, remove launch keys and codes from their safes, compare the authorization codes in the launch order with those in their safes, insert their launch keys, punch in the number of the selected war plan that automatically instructs their missiles which specific target file to pull from their computer files and what trajectory to fly, key in the ‘enabling code’ contained in the launch order that arms the warheads on the missiles, and turn the launch keys that transmit the ‘fire’ command to the dispersed unmanned missiles in underground silos. </span><br />

From that point in time until missiles leave their tubes in quick succession <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">only about 12 minutes would elapse</span></span>. </span><br />
<span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Very similar procedures and timelines apply in Russia.

The combined firepower that could be unleashed within these short time frames measured in minutes is approximately 2,654 high-yield nuclear warheads (1,382 U.S. and 1,272 Russian) – the equivalent of approximately 100,000 Hiroshima bombs (assuming the Hiroshima bomb yielded 15 kilotons of explosive power). </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">A high degree of vigilance suffuses the entire U.S. and Russian chains of nuclear command and warning, from the bottom all the way to the top. In the warning centers, such as the hub of the U.S. early warning network in Colorado, crews labor under the pressure of tight deadlines to assess and report whether a satellite or land radar sensor indicating a possible threat to North America is real or false. Events happen almost daily, sometimes more than once daily, which trigger this assessment drill that is supposed to yield a preliminary assessment within three minutes after the arrival of the initial sensor data.2 Analogous drills take place under comparable deadlines in Russia. A rush of adrenalin and rote processing of checklists, often accompanied by confusion, characterize the process.3 </span><br />
<span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">If their early warning assessment determines that a nuclear missile attack is possibly underway, the entire chain of nuclear command in the U</span></span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">nited <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">S</span></span>tates <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">or Russia would immediately kick into high gear with thousands of duty crews and nuclear support personnel involved</span></span>. The same rush of adrenalin and rote decision-making by checklist drive a process whose intensity and deadlines practically rule out any chance for careful deliberation. An emergency conference involving the presidents and their top nuclear advisors would be convened, whereupon on the U.S. side <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">the commanding duty officer</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> at Strategic Command headquarters in Omaha <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">would brief the U.S. president</span> on the nature of the apparent attack</span></span>, the wide array of response options, and their anticipated consequences for Russian physical and human resources. <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The time allocated <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">for</span> this briefing is as little as <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">30 seconds</span></span></span> depending on the nature of the attack. <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">The</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> U.S. president </span></span>then would come under intense pressure to absorb this complex set of data, weigh the consequences of the various options, and choose a course of action. His<span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">decision window is typically twelve minutes</span>, although under certain extreme conditions it can be much shorter</span></span>. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">The extraordinarily brief time for such a momentous decision is driven by four factors: the 30 minute flight time for an intercontinental missile, and about one-half that for an submarine-launched missile; the time required to validate and characterize the attack, using two separate sources of warning data to ensure high confidence; the time required to convene a phone conference of the principals involved in the decision process, and the time required following presidential decision to encode and transmit that decision worldwide to the strategic nuclear forces. Any delay in transmitting the response order runs the risk of losing retaliatory forces to the other side’s attack, thus undermining the calculus of expected damage for the response option chosen by the national leadership. This risk is compounded in the event of a so-called “decapitation strike,” that is, an opening attack on the leadership. Under this circumstance, the integrity of a retaliatory response is greatly compromised, thus calling into question the very calculus upon which nuclear deterrence is based. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Given these acute conditions, it is no wonder that as much of the response process as possible is designed to be quasi-automatic. <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">It can reasonably be described as going to war by checklist</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">, enacting a prepared script, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">with little margin for human error or technical malfunction</span></span></span>. The nuclear war machinery on both sides has a hair-trigger quality. And that quality has been a constant in the nuclear equation for decades despite the Cold War’s end. <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">Both of the traditional nuclear rivals still stand ready to inflict apocalyptic devastation</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> on one another in a first or second strike whose essential course would be run <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">in less than one hour</span></span></span>. </span><br />

In an era of terrorism and information warfare, staking the survival of humanity on the assumption that imperfect human and technical systems of**** nuclear command and control will forever prevent a disastrous breakdown of safeguards against mis- taken or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons is simply imprudent in the extreme. **An in-depth discussion of the potential exploitable weaknesses in nuclear command systems is beyond the scope of this analysis, but a few general observations are pertinent. First, many of the deficiencies are unknown, some will never be found, and **others will not be discovered until it is too late**. The complexity of command systems pre- vents a full reckoning of the risks run by hair-trigger postures. Periodic investigations routinely discover glaring weaknesses, however. For instance, a Pentagon investigation conducted by an independent commission in the 1990s at the behest of then Sen. Sam Nunn to evaluate the effectiveness of U.S. nuclear safeguards against unau- thorized launch found dozens of major deficiencies.14 This commission recommended a multitude of remedies, including installing a special new safeguard on Trident subs—the inner safe described earlier—to create a technical barrier to unauthorized launch. Second, many of the deficiencies that are identified and addressed turn out not to have been corrected. The introduction of “enable code” devices into Minuteman launch centers in the 1960s is a case in point. In theory, the devices required launch crews to receive an eight-digit code from higher authority in order to arm their missiles’ warheads prior to launch. In practice, the Strategic Air Command, unbeknownst to higher authority (such as former Defense Secretary Robert McNa- mara, who initiated and pressed for this safeguard), configured the devices so that they were always set to all zeros—that was the secret password known to all launch crews. This circumvention persisted until 1976, when actual codes were finally introduced. In the interim, the posture ran a higher risk of unauthorized launch by crew members or others who might have gained access to the launch centers, includ- ing terrorists.15 Third, the nuclear command systems today operate in an intense information battleground on which more than 20 nations including Russia, China, and North Korea have developed dedicated computer attack programs.16 These programs deploy viruses to disable, confuse, and delay nuclear command and warning processes in other nations. The U.S. Strategic Command is no exception. Information warfare is now one of its core missions. At the brink of conflict, nuclear command and warning networks around the world may be besieged by electronic intruders whose onslaught degrades the coherence and rationality of nuclear decisionmaking. **The potential for perverse consequences with computer-launched weapons on hair-trigger is clear**. Other information warfare programs are designed to infiltrate and collect information on, for example, the schedule of the movement of nuclear warheads during peacetime. Hacking operations of these sorts are increasing exponentially as the militaries of the world increasingly depend on computer and communications networks. The number of attempts by outside hostile actors to break into Defense Department networks has surged by tenfold in the past couple of years. Hostile intrusion attempts against Pentagon computer systems now run in the neighborhood of 1,000 per day. (China is especially active.) What is worse, some of this expanding illicit penetration involves insiders, creating a whole new dimension to the “insider” threat to nuclear systems. If insiders with knowledge of special passwords or other sensitive information related to nuclear weapons activities collude with outsiders, the integrity of nuclear command and control systems and safeguards against the unauthorized launch of nuclear weapons on launch-trigger alert may well be compromised. The guid- ing principle of nuclear safeguards during the past 50 years—the two- man rule—may be obsolete in the age of information warfare. The notion that having a second person present during any sensitive nuclear operation would prevent an accidental or intentional nuclear incident may have been sound during the labor-intensive and analog- dominated era of nuclear command and control, but in the modern age of information warfare, new safeguards may be needed to prevent the electronic compromise of missiles on hair-trigger alert. Adding terrorists to this equation gives further reason to believe that the Cold War nuclear postures are counterproductive—**they exacerbate rather than alleviate nuclear problems, and they are an accident waiting to happen**. There is a possibility that terrorists could spoof early warning sensors and thereby engender false alarms that precipitate nuclear overreactions. The possibility also exists that **terrorists**, possibly with insider help, **may get inside the command and communications networks controlling nuclear forces. They might gain information useful to interdicting and capturing weapons, or unau- thorized actors might discover ways to inject messages into the circuits. Again, the wisdom of keeping nuclear forces ready to fly instantaneously upon receipt of a short stream of computer signals is dubious. The more likely scenario is one in which nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists because of intrinsic fault lines in the nuclear postures. The simple fact that maintaining war-ready nuclear postures requires many hundreds of nuclear bombs to be moving around on alert or going back and forth between the field and bomb refurbishment facilities means that they are exposed to terrorist capture or theft during the most vulnerable phase of their operating cycle: transportation, the Achilles Heel of security.18 As long as traditional deterrent practices continue, it will be impossible to truly “lock down” the arsenals to protect them from terrorist theft. Sooner or later, the Nunn- Lugar program will fail unless the day-to-day adversarial nuclear relationship is ended. 14. An especially noteworthy example is the discovery by the commission of an unprotected electronic back door into the naval broadcast communications network used to transmit launch orders by radio to the U.S. Trident deterrent submarine fleet. Unauthorized persons, including terrorists, may have been able to seize electronic control of shore-based radio transmitters such as the very low frequency facility at Cutler, Maine, and actually inject a launch order into the network. The deficiency was taken so seriously that new launch order validation protocols had to be devised and Trident crews had to undergo special training to learn them."></a><span class="StyleHeading4UnderlinedsmalltextGaramondChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Beyond the familiar arguments about the inherent danger of accidental nuclear attack triggered by false alarms</span></span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">, and unauthorized launches by unreliable personnel, <span class="StyleHeading4UnderlinedsmalltextGaramondChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt;">lurk shadowy new threats stemming from terrorist scenarios and growing cybernetic threats to the nuclear command and warning systems</span></span>.

Such war could involve the entire spectrum of nuclear-conflict possibilities, ranging from a nuclear attack upon a non-nuclear state to systemwide nuclear war</span></u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">. <span class="Heading5Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">How might such far-reaching consequences of nuclear terrorism come about? Perhaps the most likely way would involve a terrorist nuclear assault against a state by terrorists hosted in another state. For example, consider the following scenario: Early in the 1990s, Israel and its Arab-state neighbors finally stand ready to conclude a comprehensive, multilateral peace settlement. With a bilateral treaty between Israel and Egypt already many years old, only the interests of the Palestinians—as defined by the PLO—seem to have been left out. On the eve of the proposed signing of the peace agreement, half a dozen crude nuclear explosives in the one-kiloton range detonate in as many Israeli cities. Public grief in Israel over the many thousands dead ands maimed is matched only by the outcry for revenge. In response to the public mood, the government of Israel initiates selected strikes against terrorist strongholds in Lebanon, whereupon Lebanese Shiite forces and Syria retaliate against Israel. Before long, the entire region is ablaze, conflict has escalated to nuclear forms, and all countries in the area have suffered unprecedented destruction. Of course, such a scenario is fraught with the makings of even wider destruction. How would the United States react to the situation in the Middle East? What would be the Soviet response? It is certainly conceivable that</span></span> <u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">a chain reaction of interstate nuclear conflict could </span>ensue, one that would ultimately <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">involve</span> the superpowers or even <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">every nuclear-weapons state on the planet.</span> What, exactly, would this mean? Whether the terms of assessment be statistical or human, the consequences of nuclear war require an entirely new paradigm of death. Only such a paradigm would allow us a proper framework for absorbing the vision of near-total obliteration and the outer limits of human destructiveness. Any nuclear war would have effectively permanent and irreversible consequences. Whatever the actual extent of injuries and fatalities, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">such a war would entomb the spirit of the entire species in a planetary casket</span> strewn with shorn bodies and imbecile imaginations.</u> </span><br />

<em><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Concerns about inadvertent launch </span></em><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> In 1995, according to press reports, Russia came within minutes of launching its nuclear weapons after its early warning satellites detected the launch of a rocket off the coast of Norway. Russian officials were unable to identify the source of the launch or distinguish it from a U.S. submarine-launched Trident missile.6 This incident highlighted growing weaknesses in Russia’s early warning system and raised concerns about the possibility of an inadvertent launch of nuclear weapons. In response, analysts again called for the United States and Russia to remove their nuclear weapons from alert. They argued that, <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">even though the United States did not have gaps in its early warning system, it was also vulnerable to ambiguous warning and misunderstandings because of the short time lines associated with the decision process and the resulting pressure to launch promptly in the face of an incoming attack</span></span>. Moreover, analysts argued that, <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">if the U</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">nited <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">S</span>tates <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">removed its weapons from alert, and Russia could confirm that change in status, then <strong>Russia might feel less pressure</strong> to launch its own weapons promptly when it received incomplete or ambiguous warning data</span></span></span> <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Specifically, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">if Russia detected evidence of a missile launch, but it knew that U.S. missiles were not on alert</span> and it had observed no efforts by the United States to restore their alert status, then <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">Russia would be less likely to conclude it was under attack</span> and respond in kind</span></span>. Further, <span class="Heading4Char"><strong><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">the pressure might be reduced enough to convince Russia to remove its weapons from alert, too.</span></strong></span>  </span><br />

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Among the scenarios that might recommend or require a departure from zero alert, the following discussion treats four, beginning with the most plausible. </span><br />
<span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">The most likely circumstance is</span></span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> perhaps <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">one in which the United States would generate a nuclear threat from North Korea to US forces deployed in South Korea</span></span>. In such a case, <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">any US nuclear strike plan would involve very small numbers of US weapons.</span></span> The strategic command or a theater commander would likely draw up a plan whose nuclear component would more likely feature tactical than strategic weapons. But the strategic command could also devise limited attack options or selected attack options that would employ strategic forces against the adversary. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Regardless of the type and scale of the planned operation, however, <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">the general rule to be followed would be that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the party breaking out of the zero-alert posture would notify</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">other parties of its intentions, identify the</span> pertinent <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">weapons systems to be redeployed</span> for combat, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">and clarify the alerting steps and combat actions to be taken</span>. This norm could be strengthened by designating a special storage area from which a small number of weapons could be returned to alert if that ever proved to be necessary</span></span>. The limited number would provide reassurance that a larger regeneration was not being screened by the smaller contingency. <span class="Heading4Char"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: yellow;">This arrangement, coupled with joint monitoring already in place</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;"> and national technical means of verification, should <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">provide ample reassurance</span> to the other parties <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">to a zero-alert agreement in cases of very small operations. Preparation of a small nuclear option to deal with third world contingencies should not trigger uncontrolled escalatory interaction between</span> the <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">major nuclear powers nor warrant any significant</span> compensatory <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">response by the on looking power.</span> </span></span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Since the dawn of the nuclear age in 1945, some observers of the global military scene have once again suggested that <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">since war has become unacceptably destructive</span></span>—to a would-be aggressor and even to a supposed “victor”—<span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-highlight: yellow;">the likelihood of war has actually decreased</span></span>. Although this line of reasoning may appear somewhat comforting, it is also secretly flawed. Let s grant that <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-highlight: yellow;">nuclear war</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">, because of its potential for global annhilation, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is in a sense its own deterrent.</span> States possessing nuclear weapons</span></span> (especially the major superpowers) <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">may well be very cautious in any conflict with other nuclear weapons states</span></span>. <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">But at the same time</span></span>, theories of mutual nuclear deterrence seem to have produced the expectation that because of the seriousness of nuclear war, each side can count on the other to refrain from anything resembling a nuclear provocation, which in turn makes the world yet more “safe for conventional war.”  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">In addition, there is the great danger that in a nuclear confrontation, each side will presume that the other will be deterred by the prospect of annihilation and, therefore, expect the other to back down, while remaining determined to stand firm itself. Moreover, nuclear weapons carry with them an inhereny ambiguity: Since the consequences of using them are so extreme, the threat to do so lacks credibility. As a result, although technological “progress” in war making has undeniably made war—especially nuclear war-horrifically destructive, it remains uncertain whether such developments have actually made war any less likely. In fact, it may well be true that <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-highlight: yellow;">a nuclear conflict,</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> detonation, or accident <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is more, not less, likely in this century</span> than in the previous one<strong>. <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">This is because of the increased likelihood of “accidental”</span></strong> local</span></span> (or theater<span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">) <span class="UnderlinedChar"><strong><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">nuclear wars</span></strong></span></span><span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">, as well as the likely proliferation of small nuclear devices</span></span> (possibly deliverable in suitcases) <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">and of “rogue states” and “terrorists” seeking to acquire them. </span></span>Perhaps most disturbing of all, the fact remains that <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;">human beings, including decision makers, are influenced by many things beyond a cool, rational calculation of their perceived best interests.</span></span> <span class="UnderlinedChar"><span style="background: yellow; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-highlight: yellow;">Wars have been initiated for</span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;"> many reasons, often <strong>including <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">mistaken judgment or faulty information.</span></strong></span></span> And when war takes place, the combatants make use of whatever weapons they have.

<u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Many, if not <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">most, of the complaints heard in debate rounds have merit</span></span></u><span style="background: lime; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: lime;">. </span><u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">As a community, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">we must address the issues of exclusivity, tolerance, respect and diversity.</span> However, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">when debaters make arguments about these issues in debate rounds, the arguments become personalized, often seen as attacks against specific individuals, namely the &quot;other&quot; team</span></span></u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> (in arguments such as &quot;you don't address your privilege,&quot; or &quot;you don't do anything or aren't doing enough for diversity&quot;). <strong><u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">The so-called &quot;Other&quot; that debaters refer to as being marginalized becomes transferred onto &quot;other&quot; individuals and teams as the competitive structure of a debate necessitates</span></u></strong><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">. </span><u>The point,</u> then<u>, is not that <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">these complaints and concerns should</span> not be discussed, but that they should <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">not be discussed in actual debate rounds</span></u>. I should also add that <u>since diversity is still an on-going concern, we must question the efficacy of personalized debating at generally improving diversity in our community</u>. <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Even if other solutions fall short as well, they at least avoid the pitfalls of personalized debating</span></u> that I now begin to explore. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Frequently posts to eDebate (e.g., April 2004),1 the electronic listserv for intercollegiate policy debate, have described a controversial phenomenon in debate, namely the use of personalized discourse to articulate a specific position of progressive social change in the <strong>debate community</strong>. More specifically, the discussion centered in April 2004 on the arguments advanced by University of Louisville debaters who have essentially claimed that rap, instead of &quot;traditional&quot; forms of evidence,2 along with personal narratives should be used to support the position that the <strong>debate community</strong> is exclusionary against people of color. Their position continues to claim that they have made real advances to change the community, including their &quot;project&quot; of rejecting &quot;traditional&quot; forms of debate (privilege, evidence, flowing, styles of argument, etc.), recruiting marginalized student populations, providing scholarships to targeted high school groups, advancing a campaign of inclusion of different voices, etc. Such advances are difficult to counter since they are in large part unverifiable and do not justify by themselves the insertion of personalized arguments within the debate round. When opponents try to question their own privilege and advance ideas of changing the community, Louisville has responded with a series of arguments, including tokenism, insincerity, divide-and-conquer, and so on. The question then becomes<u>, at what point should the personal intercede into the debate round? Are the concerns and voices of individuals who feel slighted</u> in the <strong>debate community</strong> <u>appropriate for actual debate rounds? Should issues of racism, marginalization, sexism, and the like which occur in the <strong>debate community</strong> be subject to actual debates within the debate community, or should they be discussed in venues and forums that are more appropriate to discussing structural issues of the community</u>? These questions, among others, have become highlighted in the discussions on eDebate. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">The purpose of this essay is to outline what I strongly believe is <u>a fundamental problem with recent debate techniques – the personalizing of debating. The intent is not to isolate or overly criticize the arguments</u> advanced by the University of Louisville specifically, <u>but rather to locate their arguments as a case study for how debate rounds have become highly personalized</u>. Even before Louisville's project (and certainly Louisville is not the only team that currently engages in this type of debating), <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">individuals and groups alike were personalizing debate arguments, making it difficult for opponents and judges to decipher, understand, analyze and come to grips with such arguments in a forum meant for hypothetical policy-making</span>.</u> In essence<span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">, <u>the personalizing of debating has emerged wrought with frustrations, anxiety, resistance and <strong>backlash</strong></u></span>. <strong>To be sure</strong>, <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">many have embraced the idea to gain a strategic edge</span></u> in competitive debate rounds <u>as well as to be self-reflexive of their own participation in an activity that probably does need restructuring</u>. <u>However, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the central problem of </span>this new phenomenon – the <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">personalizing of debating – is twofold: <strong>it victimizes debate</strong>,</span></u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;"> <u>and</u></span> it <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">ignores deeper</span>, perhaps <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">more important structural problems within the <strong>debate community</strong></span></u>. </span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">There is no question that intercollegiate policy debate is at a crossroads</span></u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">. It suffers from a severe lack of diversity, in terms of female debaters as well as debaters of color. Stating the obvious, McRee and Cote declare that &quot;twenty years of data have begun to cement an agreement among forensics educators that there exists a serious lack of diversity in debate&quot; (2002, p. 29). This problem is especially acute when one looks at the teams clearing into elimination rounds and which debaters receive speaker awards at both regional and national tournaments. Very few would argue, I suspect, that diversity is not a problem. In fact, the opposite is true (Bartenan, 1995, 1998; Bile, 1999; Bruschke &amp; Johnson, 1994; Crenshaw, 1993a, 1993b; Hunt &amp; Simerly, 1999; Loge, 1991; McRee &amp; Cote, 2002; Rogers et al., 2003; Rowland, 1993; Sowards, 1999a, 1999b; Tuman, 1993; Wilkins &amp; Hobbs, 1997; Williams, McGee &amp; McGee, 1999; Zompetti, 1999). However, the real debate occurs as to the core causes of this problem and how to address them. In the past five years or so, some debaters and debate teams have introduced the diversity problem into actual debate rounds, arguing that &quot;traditional&quot; debate is exclusionary and problematic. <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">Their arguments focus on several core issues:</span> traditional debate excludes certain types of evidence</u> (i.e., narratives, music, etc.), <u>traditional debate privileges affluent individuals</u> (i.e., the cost of summer institutes, travel budgets, etc.), <u>traditional debate ignores the reality of many individuals who are already at a disadvantage in the activity</u> (i.e., debaters of color and women). <u>These teams then use these types of arguments</u>, coupled with a patchwork of hiphop music clips and personal testimony, <u>along with soliloquies on how the current resolution precludes their perspectives. <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">The result is a highly effective and advanced amalgamation of ad hominem attacks, fallacies of composition</span> (the part represents the whole), <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">guilt appeals and,</span> to use</u> Kenneth <u>Burke's</u> (1962) <u>term, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">victimage</span></u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">.</span> <u>In essence, many debates on college campuses have become venues for complaints about how the current order of things (aka &quot;status quo,&quot;</u> or as Rogers et al. (2003) call it, the &quot;ISM&quot;) <u>in intercollegiate debate is occurring</u>. </span><br />

<strong><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">b) The competitive framing of the debate, the time constraints, and the split identities of a team mean the debate round is counter-productive to their advocacy – a vote for us is a superior advocacy to achieve their calls </span></strong><br />

On the other hand, <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">we may want to analyze how such relationships occurred and grew when other relationships and situations were not as obvious</span>. In fact, we may want to even broaden our interpretation of such relationships – exactly how are students of color marginalized? Why do folks believe they have nothing to contribute? Why do students of color feel excluded?</u> </span><br />
<u><span style="background: lime; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: lime;">It is very difficult, if not impossible, to get at these questions during a collegiate debate round. Not only is the limited time in a round an impediment at answering these complex questions,</span></u><span style="background: lime; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-highlight: lime;"> <u>but both debaters of a single team may advance different personalized arguments,</u></span><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> creating a moving target of advocacy that the opposing team and judges have difficulty in specifically pinning down for thorough and productive examination. Or, <u>as Cloud suggests, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">such therapeutic arguments &quot;deflect</span></u> [sic] <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the energy and radicalism of activists,&quot; essentially creating a shell-game during private discussions of much larger societal problems</span></u> (1998, p. 34). In addition, <strong><u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">these questions are often skirted in debate rounds because there is a drive for competition</span></u></strong><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">.</span> <u>While some critical self-reflection has undoubtedly occurred</u> as a result of personalizing debate, <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the overwhelming majority of debaters and coaches spend less time thinking about the core problems of marginalization</span></u> (and their solutions) <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">than they do locating debate strategies to beat personalization arguments at the next tournament</span></u>. <u>During squad meetings and coaching sessions, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">one does not hear an opposing team sincerely talk about their privilege or the exclusion of women or people of color in the debate community</span>. Instead, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">one hears about what</span></u> topicality argument, <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">framework argument</span></u>, or counter-narrative <u><span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">will be deployed to win the judge's ballot.</span> The problem of therapeutic rhetoric underscores how personalized debating prevents examination of more important factors</u> such as resource disparity. </span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Thus, <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">the underlying therapeutic nature of personalized debate</span>, coupled with the competitive component of trying to win debate rounds <span style="background: lime; mso-highlight: lime;">nullifies any chance at a fruitful and productive discussion</span> </span></u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">about the problems of marginalization and their potential solutions. <u>A focus on the personal – my experience, my narrative, my feelings, how I learn, how I can engage the community – is quite seductive</u>; <u>we all want to know how we fit into the larger policies. On the other hand, we may want to analyze how such relationships occurred and grew when other relationships and situations were not as obvious</u>. In fact, we may want to even broaden our interpretation of such relationships – exactly how are students of color marginalized? Why do folks believe they have nothing to contribute?

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The <u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">ambiguists</span></u> must say &quot;no&quot; to-they <u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">must reject and limit-some ideas</span></u> and actions. In what follows, we will also find that they must say &quot;yes&quot; to some things. In particular, they must say &quot;yes&quot; to the idea of rational persuasion. This means, first, that they must recognize the role of agreement in political contest, or the basic accord that is necessary to discord. The mistake that the ambiguists make here is a common one. <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The mistake is in thinking that</span></span> agreement marks the end of contest-that <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">consensus kills debate. </span></span>But this is true only if the agreement is perfect-if there is nothing at all left to question or contest. <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">In most cases, however</span></span>, our agreements are highly imperfect. <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">We agree on</span></span> some matters but not on others, on <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">generalities but not on specifics</span></span>, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And this kind of limited agreement is the <em>starting</em> condition of contest and debate. As John Courtney Murray writes: <u>We hold certain truths; therefore we can argue about them.</u> It seems to have been one of the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true. <u>There can be no argument except on the premise, and within a context, of agreement.</u> (Murray 1960, 10) <u>In other words, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">we cannot argue about something</span> if we are not communicating: <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">if we cannot agree on the topic and terms of argument</span> or if we have utterly different ideas about what counts as evidence or good argument. At the very least, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">we must agree about what</span> it is that <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">is being debated <strong>before</strong> we can debate it.</span> For instance, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">one cannot have an argument about euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical group.</span></u> One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one's target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the sitting have no complaints. Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. <u>In other words, <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">contest is <strong>meaningless</strong> if there is a lack of agreement</span> or communication <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">about what is being contested</span>. Resisters</u>, demonstrators, <u>and <strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">debaters</span></strong><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> <strong>must</strong> have some shared ideas about the subject </span>and/or the terms <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">of their disagreements.</span></u> The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand. And <u>a demonstrator's audience must know what is being resisted.</u> In short, <u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea is and how one might</span> go about intelligibly <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">contest</span>ing <span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;">it</span>.</u> In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony. </span><br />

Because the value of a given approach may not be apparent at the beginning-game theory is an obvious example-we cannot insist that a new approach be immediately applicable to a specific research puzzle. On the whole, however, <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">the belief that scholarship in security affairs should be linked to real-world issues has prevented the field from <strong>degenerating into self-indulgent intellectualizing</strong></span></span>. And from the Golden Age to the present, security studies has probably had more real-world impact, for good or ill, than most areas of social science. Finally, the renaissance of security studies has been guided by a commitment to democratic discourse. <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Rather than confining discussion</span></span> of security issues <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">to an elite group</span></span> of the best and brightest, <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">scholars</span></span> in the renaissance <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">have</span></span> generally <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">welcomed a</span></span> more <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">fully informed debate</span></span>.

The growth of security studies within universities is one sign of broader participation, along with increased availability of information and more accessible publications for interested citizens. Although this view is by no means universal, the renaissance of security studies has been shaped by the belief that <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">a well-informed debate is the <strong>best way to avoid</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>disasters</strong> that are likely when national policy is monopolized by a few self-interested parties</span></span>. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: SimSun;">A recurring theme of this essay has been the twin dangers of separating the study of security affairs from the academic world or of shifting the focus of academic scholarship too far from real-world issues. <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The danger of war will be with us</span></span><u><span style="background: yellow; mso-highlight: yellow;"> for some time</span></u> to come, <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">and states will continue to acquire military forces</span></span> for a variety of purposes. <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Unless one believes that ignorance is preferable to expertise, the value of independent national security scholars should be apparent</span></span>. Indeed, <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">history suggests that countries that suppress debate on national security matters are <strong>more likely to blunder into disaster,</strong> because misguided policies cannot be evaluated and stopped in time</span></span>. As in other areas of public policy, <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">academic experts</span></span> in security studies <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">can help</span></span> in several ways.

The long-term effects of academic involvement may be even more significant: <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">academic research can help states learn from past mistakes and</span></span> can <span class="Style4Char"><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; mso-ansi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">provide the theoretical innovations that produce better policy choices in the future</span></span>.

 <span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Christopher C. <strong>Joyner</strong> is a Professor of International Law in the Government Department at Georgetown University, Spring, <strong>1999</strong> [5 ILSA J Int'l &amp; Comp L 377] </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">Use of the debate can be an effective pedagogical tool for education in the social sciences. Debates, like other role-playing simulations, help students understand different perspectives on a policy issue by adopting a perspective as their own</span></u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">. But, unlike other simulation games, <u>debates do not require that a student participate directly in order to realize the benefit of the game</u>. Instead of developing policy alternatives and experiencing the consequences of different choices in a traditional role-playing game, <u>debates present the alternatives and consequences in a formal, rhetorical fashion before a judgmental audience</u>. Having the class audience serve as jury helps each student develop a well-thought-out opinion on the issue by providing contrasting facts and views and enabling audience members to pose challenges to each debating team. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">These debates ask undergraduate students to examine the international legal implications of various United States foreign policy actions. Their chief tasks are to assess the aims of the policy in question, determine their relevance to United States national interests, ascertain what legal principles are involved, and conclude how the United States policy in question squares with relevant principles of international law. Debate questions are formulated as resolutions, along the lines of: &quot;Resolved: The United States should deny most-favored-nation status to China on human rights grounds;&quot; or &quot;Resolved: The United States should resort to military force to ensure inspection of Iraq's possible nuclear, chemical and biological weapons facilities;&quot; or &quot;Resolved: The United States' invasion of Grenada in 1983 was a lawful use of force;&quot; or &quot;Resolved: The United States should kill Saddam Hussein.&quot; <u>In addressing both sides of these legal propositions</u>, the student <u>debaters must consult the vast literature of international law</u>, especially the nearly 100 professional law-school-sponsored international law journals now being published in the United States. This literature furnishes an incredibly rich body of legal analysis that often treats topics affecting United States foreign policy, as well as other more esoteric international legal subjects. Although most of these journals are accessible in good law schools, they are largely unknown to the political science community specializing in international relations, much less to the average undergraduate. </span><br />
<u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">By assessing the role of international law in United States foreign policy- making, students realize that United States actions do not always measure up to international legal expectations; that at times, international legal strictures get compromised for the sake of perceived national interests, and that concepts and principles of international law</span></u><span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">, like domestic law, <u>can be interpreted and twisted in order to justify United States policy in various international circumstances. In this way, the debate format gives students the benefits ascribed to simulations and other action learning techniques, in that it makes them become actively engaged with their subjects, and not be mere passive consumers. Rather than spectators, students become legal advocates, observing, reacting to, and structuring political and legal perceptions to fit the merits of their case.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">The debate exercises carry several specific educational objectives. First, students on each team must work together to refine a cogent argument that compellingly asserts their legal position on a foreign policy issue confronting the United States. <u>In this way, they gain greater insight into the real-world legal dilemmas faced by policy makers</u>. Second, as they work with other members of their team, they realize the complexities of applying and implementing international law, and the difficulty of bridging the gaps between United States policy and international legal principles, either by reworking the former or creatively reinterpreting the latter. Finally, research for the debates forces students to become familiarized with contemporary issues on the United States foreign policy agenda and the role that international law plays in formulating and executing these policies. 8 <u>The debate thus becomes an excellent vehicle for pushing students beyond stale arguments over principles into the real world of policy analysis, political critique, and legal defense.</u> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; font-size: 10.0pt;">A debate exercise is particularly suited to an examination of United States foreign policy, which in political science courses is usually studied from a theoretical, often heavily realpolitik perspective. In such courses, international legal considerations are usually given short shrift, if discussed at all. As a result, students may come to believe that international law plays no role in United States foreign policy-making. In fact, serious consideration is usually paid by government officials to international law in the formulation of United States policy, albeit sometimes ex post facto as a justification for policy, rather than as a bona fide prior constraint on consideration of policy options. In addition, lawyers are prominent advisers at many levels of the foreign-policy-making process. Students should appreciate the relevance of international law for past and current US actions, such as the invasion of Grenada or the refusal of the United States to sign the law of the sea treaty and landmines convention, as well as for [*387] hypothetical (though subject to public discussion) United States policy options such as hunting down and arresting war criminals in Bosnia, withdrawing from the United Nations, or assassinating Saddam Hussein. </span><br />

This prevents regional conflicts from spiraling into World War III<br />

Assuming Russia does not move into absolute isolation…right choice will prevent World War III.<br />

<br />
The U.S. arsenal is perceived as a first strike force – this independently increases the likelihood of nuclear arms racing, crises and full-scale nuclear conflict<br />

Plan<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should detarget its strategic missile forces and adopt verifable de-alerting measures including missile safing and refraining from installing launch inverters. The United States federal government should put its four Trident submarines in the North Atlantic and North Pacific on modified alert.<br />

<br />
<br />
Launch inhibitors and target downloading create a survivable force that maintains deterrence, boosts confidence and solves the risk of accidental launch<br />

<br />
Procedural changes to extend the launch timeline…to cause a nuclear incident or actual firing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unilateral de-alerting will shift away from the perception of a U.S. first strike posture and induce Russian reciprocation<br />

<br />
De-alerting is feasible. Wholesale de-alerting…deterrence and would thus not be recommended.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alert status has a crucial symbolic effect – the message the plan conveys about the likelihood of conflict will have a crucial moderating effect<br />

Note that not all forms of high alert status…regular alert, they would convey the opposite message.<br />

In 1995, according to press reports, Russia came within minutes…convince Russia to remove its weapons from alert, too.<br />

Small conflicts won’t cause a large scale reconstitution of nuclear forces<br />

De-alerting will transform the deterrent relationship with Russia and be modeled by China, India and Pakistan<br />
