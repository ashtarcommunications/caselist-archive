 Observation One is the Monster in the Closet...<br />
<br />
The rhetoric of the war on terror centers on possession of weapons of mass destruction. Thes questions of who should or should not be able to possess “high-tech” weaponry cannot be seperated from the nuclear posture of the United States. Historically, the role of our nuclear arsenal has been the symbolic legitimization of state violence under the guise of fighting “clean wars” while condemning the barbarity of terrorists or rogue nations who do not possess legitimate weapons of war.<br />

“One issue in the current 'war against terror'...realm of the monstrous and unnatural”<br />
<br />
We are witnessing the uncanny return of monstrosity in terrorism studies. As children we were thrilled and terrified by stories of the boogeyman who would steal our eyes in the middle of the night. Now it seems that the Southpark nightmare of Imaginationland has come true as the image of the terrorist begins to haunt the collective American psyche. These representations are highly sexualized through techniques of normalization and discipline in which a heteronormative morality acts to seperate good from evil, normality from abnormality.<br />
<br />

<br />
“To begin, let us consider the monster...discourse of monstrosity in 'terrorism studies'”<br />
<br />
The discourse of monstrosity presupposes the existence of a “normal” psyche. In this context, terrorism is the byproduct of a sick mind – deviance that connotes a failed heterosexuality. This attempt to reduce the complexities of culture and politics to a model of sexual perversity underwrites the history of Western modernity and colonial subjugation.<br />
<br />

<br />
“What all these models and theories...practices and rituals of heteronormativity.”<br />
<br />
Observation Two is Queer and Loathing in America...<br />
<br />
Heteronormative thought establishes an invisible center – one that is definable and sanitary, constantly producing and reproducing standards for rationality, desireability, and superiority. This becomes the primary instrument for oppressive power relations and the production of knowledge. Modern institutions rely upon these unspoken rules in order to rationalize the systemic marginalization of the abnormal.<br />

<br />
“In this passage...race, class, gender, and sexuality”<br />
<br />
The political demand to universalize identity results in self-repression, violent assimilation and the eradication of others.<br />
<br />
William Connolly. Identity/Difference: Democratic Negotiations of Political Paradox. 2002, pg 176-178<br />
<br />
“Finally, then, there is a dimension...tactics of self-modification.”<br />
<br />
This is not just empty theorizing. Representations that tie queerness as sexual deviancy to the monstrous figure of the terrorist act to otherize and quarantine subjects classified as terrorists and to normalize and discipline a population through the invocation of these monstrous figures that translates into actual violence.<br />
<br />

<br />
“Yet again, we could interrogate...body of the normalized nation.”<br />
<br />
Therefore, we affirm the resolution through a rearticulation of the terrorist body as an assemblage that resists queerness-as-sexual-identity withing the dominant narrative of U.S. Nuclear exceptionalism<br />
<br />
Observation Three is They Want to Recruit our Children...<br />
<br />
Restricting the role of nuclear weapons demands a rethinking of identity. Wars are no longer fought solely on the material landscape. On the symbolic level, the normalizing function of nuclear weapons confers the status of “legitimacy” for America's “right to violence” against populations marked as enemies who lack the proper, high-tech instruments of warfare. We need to question the moralizing rhetoric of monstrosity and sexual deviancy that justifies state-based atrocities committed on a global scale.<br />
<br />
Kelly Oliver. Women as Weapons of War: Iraq, Sex, and the Media. 2007, pg 128-130<br />
<br />
“How can a few guys with box cutters...legitimate versus illegitimate violence.”<br />
<br />
Identity, intersectionality, and traditional queer studies reflect the postmodern politics of liberal-multiculturalism that conforms to the disciplinary apparatus of the state. The 1AC affirms queerness, not as an identiy or even anti-identity, but as an assemblage that is spatially and temporally contingent, dismantling the representational mandates of visibility and stability in identity politics that feed narratives of U.S. sexual exceptionalism. This is not a strategy of “queering” human subjects, but of allowing subjects to appear in all their queerness – a method that allows for the temporality of being as always becoming.<br />
<br />
Jasbir K. Puar. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times. 2007, pg 211-216<br />
<br />
“There is no entity, no identity...becoming beyond or without being.”<br />
<br />
The ballot acts as a point of rupture within the dominant narrative of U.S. sexual exceptionalism that demands conformity to heteronormative institutions and practices. This is a specific strategy of criticism which should not be excluded – attempts to define our affirmative by placing arbitrary limits on the game of debate is an extension of a conservative strategy which produces new normativities and exceptionalisms through the mastery of the unknowable. You should reject strategies that seperate the body from politics and instead affirma a queer praxis of assemblage that reshapes the terrain of intersectionality.<br />

Bogost explains that procedural criticism ...<strong><u>wholly determine their ends.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Forcing everything to fit into policy-relevance is not a benign move solely to preserve conventional notions of fairness. It is bound up in all decisions that give the prevailing order the upper-hand, ensuring debate fits inot some pre-determined notion of governmental good<br />

A. Probability - The discourse of deterrence makes weapons seem defensive and removes debate over their eexistence, making the only relevant question of whether deterrence “works.” This linguistic move allows the elites to shape the likelhood of war – the endpoint is exinction<strong>.</strong> Lichterman 09<br />
