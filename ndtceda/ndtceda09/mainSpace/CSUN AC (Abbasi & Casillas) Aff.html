Ethics Aff<br />
<hr />
<strong><em>Inherency:</em></strong><br />
<br />
It is not an accident that 2 out of the 198 of the world’s sovereign powers have 92% of the nuclear weaponry and another 7 hold the other 8%. It is no act of providence that 4% of the members of the international community hold the fate of 100% of the globe’s population in their hands.<br />
<br />
So then the reason for the disparity of power amongst nations and the enmity that it sparks, regarding nuclear weapons in particular, is due to the constraints of the system held in place by those with the technology, the means and the influence to exert policy.<br />
<br />
There is a distinct reason why 3 major nations and 8 in development opted out of the conversations on the environment and weapons control in Copenhagen. It is not without logic that 32 countries of the United Nations protested in solidarity against the last round of SORT treaty talks between the U.S. and Russia in 2002 and 11 countries stood up and left the United Nations meeting about CTBT ratification between the 5 major nuclear powers in 2006.<br />
<br />
But those acts are only symptoms and specks of a larger problem inherent in the domestic and international policies associated with nuclear weapons: injustice.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>A Theory of Justice</em></strong> <strong>and <em>The Law of Peoples</em></strong><br />
<br />
Rawls posits two Principles of Justice:<br />
<br />
First: each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive scheme of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar scheme of liberties for others.<br />
<br />
Second: all social, political and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that:<br />
<br />
(A) all political offices, employment, education, possible advantages, leverages of possible power and positions must be open to everyone – this is the principle of fair equality of opportunity to ensure egalitarian and meritocratic success systems<br />
<br />
(B) and they are to be of the greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of <span style="mso-tab-count: 1;"> </span>society – this is the difference principle to ensure a balanced society of parity<br />
<br />
And these principles, Rawls argues, would develop a well-ordered society that employs the theory of justice as fairness.<br />
<br />
Rawls moves this to an international level when criticizing nuclear weapons from within a framework of justice:<br />
<br />
As it turns out, the mere <em>existence</em> of nuclear weapons is a violation of all three principles of justice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Initially, it violates the <strong>basic equality of rights principle</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>One of the basic humyn rights that just about everyone agrees upon is that of the right to life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Nuclear weapons are an apriori violation of that right.<br />
<br />
Additionally, nuclear weapons violate the <strong>fair equality of opportunity principle</strong>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Not only is it true that not everyone has nuclear weapons, but most countries that don’t have them are constrained from ever acquiring them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />
<br />
Finally, nuclear weapons violate the <strong>difference principle.</strong> Nuclear weapons far from benefit the least advantaged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>In this system, the nuclear weapons possessed by the few further the geopolitical ambitions of that few at the expense of the least advantaged.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Plan</strong><br />
<br />
Thus we present the following plan:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The United States federal government should substantially reduce the size and restrict the role and mission of its nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Framework</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Given the inviolability of each person founded on justice, this debate should be about taking action to work towards a more just international system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Policymakers must be concerned with acting in ethical ways to protect the rights of those over which they have responsibility. This debate should be decided as a question about whether or not the affirmative plan is an ethical action that works towards the Principles of Justice<br />
<br />
We argue that there are always going to be questions of the potential political fallout of the aff plan – any number of nuclear war scenarios, preemptive strike strategies, and regional conflict escalations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Power will always be sucked into a vacuum and some IR hack at a think tank will generate multiple scenarios for nuclear war based on a decision by the United States to do….whatever.<br />
<br />
The point is twofold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>First, is that these impacts are all symptoms of the current unjust system operating in the status quo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Power projection, nuclear ambitions, etc, etc, are all a result of some members of the international system having more access to rights than others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>In a just system, these things wouldn’t happen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />
<br />
<br />
But, more importantly, if the framework for the debate is whether the affirmative acts ethically towards a just system, than linking to the disadvantages of an unjust system is non-responsive to the affirmative advocacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>We are only responsible for the actions that we take.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>As policymakers, we must recognize, as Rawls argues, that the “rights secured by justice are not subject to political bargaining or to the calculus of social interests” – meaning that we cannot and must not subject the persons within the United States to such calculations.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Role of the Ballot</strong><br />
<br />
Finally, we conclude by arguing that the role of the ballot is to determine whoever best acts ethically in the interests of the United States towards an end of justice in regards to nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
This means that the affirmative has to defend the ethical implications of a system based in justice and the two principles outlined above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>We are responsible for winning that our plan works toward that end, and that such a system would be beneficial to providing for the rights of those residing within the United States.<br />
<br />
The negative has the option of challenging that ethical system, proving that the affirmative does not further such an ethical system, or that there are disadvantages that the plan action would occur within such a system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>This leaves the negative with counterplan, disad, and critical ground, but only to the degree that it refutes the fundamental ethical claims of the affirmative.<br />
