<br />
Contention I - The Military Industrial Academic Complex<br />
<br />
Our universities have been colonized, allowing inaction in the face of genocide. False rationalizations about the infallibility of our leaders and our reliance on nuclear weapons allow militarized myths to pervade academic, becoming truths.<br />
We deflect our ever-present complicity in weapons production, not acting because we reason that we cannot PERSONALLY change the militarized landscape of academia. Inaction causes arguments about the unlikely use of nuclear weapons, and the need to keep weapons for self-defense to permeate the education complex. Our feeling of having no ethical responsibility increases chance of weapon usage.<br />
Krieger, PhD Political Science University of Hawaii, Assistant Professor San Fran State, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation President, 2003.<br />
[David, NAPF Founder, President since 1982 inception, J.D. Santa Barbara College, Political Science Assistant Professor University of Hawaii, “Remember Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki”, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, August 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2003/08/01_krieger_remembering.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2003/08/01_krieger_remembering.htm</a>, Accessed 10/15/09]<br />
Our understanding of Hiroshima and Nagasaki helps ... with horrendous consequences for humanity.<br />
<br />
The militarization of our universities is used to legitimize reliance on nuclear weapons. The state invades education, causing political science education complicit with military colonization to mislead academics into rationalizing weapons production. Complicity and passivity aren’t academia’s only crimes of genocidal nuclear dominance.<br />
Lawrence, PhD Political Economy, International Relations Professor Boston U, U West England Aerospace Research Center Director, 1996.<br />
[Philip K., University of the West of England, Bristol, UK., “Strategy, Hegemony and Ideology: the Role of Intellecutals” Political Studies (1996), XLIV, 44-59]<br />
Anxieties about nuclear security are not just a matter for the general ... of universities and colleges’.24<br />
<br />
The Military-Industrial complex’s colonization of our knowledge through the takeover of higher learning institutions surrenders knowledge production to militarism. Militarization of knowledge makes war and violence inevitable – we become literally incapable to conceptualize peace. Knowledge production as a process of war makes us not worthy of existence.<br />

THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ABOLISH ITS NUCLEAR ARSENAL.<br />

Contention II - Fiat Pax<br />
<br />
Obviously, Jacob and I are not part of the federal government. We’re not policy makers in Congress or Obama’s cabinet. We ARE students at Trinity University, members of America’s academia, and that is the context through which we advocate nuclear disarmament. Academia’s position should be that the federal government should abolish its nuclear weapons. Our advocacy is an attempt to rescue our universities from militarism.<br />
Giroux, PhD Education Carnegie-Mellon, Penn State Education Waterbury Chair Professor, Center for Education and Cultural Studies Founding Director, 2008.<br />

Large numbers of students pass through the hallowed ... through every aspect of the social order.<br />
<br />
Refusal to accept and comply with militarized knowledge production allows us to create demilitarized knowledge zones – the only place research and investigation that isn’t driven by militarism is possible.<br />

Reclaiming academia is critical to establish a domestic deterrent against U.S. imperialism. The assimilation of intellectuals into the military-industrial-complex enables nationalistic aggression against nations.<br />

Democracy in any real sense of the word is nowhere ... political candidate during an election campaign.<br />

The site of knowledge production is the uniquely critical point of resistance to escape violent ontologies that dominate and control policymaking, making militarization and war inevitable. Resistance causes an end violence and war.<br />
