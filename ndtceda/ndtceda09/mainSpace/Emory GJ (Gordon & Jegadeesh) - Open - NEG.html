<u>Text: The United States should expand military-to-military exchanges with Russia at operational facilities to include notification of satellite launches and divulging information concerning procedures for control, doctrine and technologies of command and control architecture. The United States should offer Russia early warning data, to create a Joint Data Exchange Center, to install launch warning sensors on the United States arsenal, and offer to provide the same for Russia. The United States should expand the Cooperative Threat Reduction program with Russia.<br />
