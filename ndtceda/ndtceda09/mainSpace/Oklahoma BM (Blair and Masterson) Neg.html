Round one versus UNT Chernus Nuclear Religion aff<br />
<br />
First Priority. The affirmative doesn't address the question of land rights of Native Americans and legitimates the state which perpetuates colonialism. Colonialism is the root of nuclearism because of mining, testing, and dumping on native land. The plan creates waste that would be dumped on Native land. The alternative is to reject the aff and fight towards kicking the united States off the planet.<br />
<br />
Round four versus de-alert aff with prolif adv from KCKCC<br />
<br />
Nietzsche. The plan attempt to eliminate suffering and that is an expression of hatred towards life as it exists. Securitization devalues life because it says life is only valuable when we can prevent suffering which is inevitable and even if the aff could eliminate suffering that just means they take out everything that makes life worth living. It is impossible to predict causes of violence and attempts to do so just create bureaucratic mistakes that cause the impacts of the 1AC. The alternative is to do nothing in the instance of the aff. This ontological disarmament is the only way to affirm life.<br />

Nuclear war is just a text and has never happened. Calling nuclear colonialism nuclear war causes more colonialism. Instead of trying to rupture technostrategic discourse we should deconstruct it.<br />
