<span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">We begin with a discussion of the bodies that the nuclear weapons arsenal is built on, including the bodies of those left dead and injured by the bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear testing, radiation tests, the nuclear fuel cycle, and depleted uranium weapons.<br />
<br />
The nuclear weapons regime creates these bodies in pain to make real its power and anchor its ideological belief systems.<br />

Nuclear Rites: A Weapons Laboratory at the End of the Cold War. 1998. pp. 108-109)</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />
</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black;">The marked bodies of all these...in the international power structure (Luke 1989).</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">These bodies are only allowed to appear fragmented, decontextualized, and objectifed. The transformation of bodily pain into precise, objective, scientific data erases the subjectivity, suffering and person that inhabit the body, enabling the scientific task to continue unimpeded by awareness of the real pain it inflicts. This erasure is what enables the physical destruction of these bodies.<br />

</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black;">The discourse of scientists and other experts…pain itself getting in the way (Hafferty 1991; Kenner 1987; Taussig 1980).</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Regulation of the ways bodies are allowed to appear in the public sphere leaves certain lives unmarked, able to be taken without recourse.<br />
Butler, 04</span></span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black;"> (Judith Butler, professor of rhetoric and comparative literature at UC Berkeley. Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence. 2004. pp. xx-xi)</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />
</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black;">Public policy, including foreign policy…publicly about the effects of war.</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The ongoing violence enacted against bodies is pushed out of our consciousness, discursively contained so that we never have to confront it. This is what legitimizes ongoing destruction, as the nuclear war waged against bodies deemed to be disposable is subordinated to the imaginary of a hypothetical apocalypse to come.<br />
Kato, 93 </span></span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black;">(Masahide Kato, Professor at the University of Hawaii. “Nuclear Globalism.” Alternatives. pp. 353-355)</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />

<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Judith Butler explains that the bodies of others make claims on us that we have turned away from. Contemporary conditions of representation are based on a disassociation from the precariousness of bodies, ignoring the claims made on us and subordinating them to disaster scenarios. We must work to establish new modes of public seeing and hearing that allow these lives to appear as embodied, precarious, threatened by destruction.<br />

</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black;">So the face, strictly speaking, does not speak…instigation to a sensate democracy they occasionally perform.</span></span><span style="color: black;"><br />
<br />
</span><span class="tagChar"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Lastly, bodily politics is itself a non-structuralist or preordained methodology that makes it impossible to formulate universals or models for all-encompassing applicability. Applying the multi-faceted strategies we gain from the body of the suffering other to the process of ordering our daily lives overcomes the socioengineering schemes that deny the body agency in their pursuit of transcendence through reason. Beginning with embodiment opens up space for authentic politics by retrieving context and motivating praxis.<br />

</span><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black;">It ought to be stressed here that for Gandhi, …it is always and irretrievably situated.</span></span><br />

DB8 is about activating a critical social praxis—otherwise violence is inevitable<br />
<br />
Confronting the body and consequent suffering is what leads to a real reorientation of politics. Abstract body counts are bad and smooth over lived realites.<br />

Worst way of evading politics is by ignoring the relationship to the body –worst form of solipsism
