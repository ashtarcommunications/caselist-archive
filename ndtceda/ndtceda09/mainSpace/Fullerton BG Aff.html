We begin with a discussion the bodies that the nuclear weapons arsenal is built on, including the bodies of those left dead and injured by the bombs dropped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear testing, radiation tests, the nuclear fuel cycle, and depleted uranium weapons.<br />
<br />
The nuclear weapons regime creates these bodies in pain to make real its power and anchor its ideological belief systems.<br />
Gusterson, 98 (Hugh Gusterson, Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at George Mason University. Nuclear Rites: A Weapons Laboratory at the End of the Cold War. 1998. pp. 108-109)<br />
The marked bodies of all these …dominance in the international power structure (Luke 1989).<br />
<br />
These bodies are only allowed to appear fragmented, decontextualized, and objectifed. The transformation of bodily pain into precise, objective, scientific data erases the subjectivity, suffering and person that inhabit the body, enabling the scientific task to continue unimpeded by awareness of the real pain it inflicts. This erasure is what enables the physical destruction of these bodies.<br />
Gusterson, 98 (Hugh Gusterson, Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at George Mason University. Nuclear Rites: A Weapons Laboratory at the End of the Cold War. 1998. pp. 109-111)<br />
The discourse of scientists and other experts …pain itself getting in the way (Hafferty 1991; Kenner 1987; Taussig 1980).<br />
<br />
Denial of appearance leaves lives unmarked, able to be taken without recourse.<br />
Butler, 04 (Judith Butler, professor of rhetoric and comparative literature at UC Berkeley. Precarious Life: the Powers of Mourning and Violence. 2004. pp. xx-xi)<br />
Public policy, including foreign policy…publicly about the effects of war.<br />
<br />
Techno-scientific solipsism is organized around disappearance of the body. We become mortified of the flesh and seek to empty the world of substance, resulting in hatred of living matter and extermination of entire peoples under the guise of progress.<br />
Virilio, 02. (Paul Virilio, Emeritus Professor at the Ecole Spéciale d'Architecture in Paris. Ground Zero. 2002. pp. 12-13).<br />
If, according to Francois Raspail…but the madness of the mightiest.<br />
<br />
To counter the disappearance of the body enacted by the US nuclear project, an activist group called Baring Witness has laid their bodies on the line.<br />
Garofoli, 03 (Joe Garofoli. “A Cheeky Protest: Bay Area Anti-War Activists Go Nude in Surge of Creative Vigils.” the San Francisco Chronicle. January 12, 2003. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0112-09.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0112-09.htm</a>)<br />
Even as U.S. troops inch … in San Francisco this Saturday.<br />
<br />
We ask you to use your ballot to Bare Witness to the dismembered body. Confronting the body that we have abandoned and repressed is a step necessary to challenge the role our nuclear weapons arsenal plays in dismembering the body, distancing us from it so that it can be destroyed.<br />
<br />
Public criticism is an embodied act of exile that reorients violent relations by subverting the exclusion of bodies from the domain of public representation.<br />
Kennedy, 99 (Kristen Kennedy, Visiting Assistant Professor of English at Wake Forest University. “Hipparchia the Cynic: Feminist Rhetoric and the Ethics of Embodiment,” Hypatia 14.2 (1999) Muse.)<br />
Hipparchia's use of exile as an ethical …has no need of something to conceal him.] (n.d., 135-37)<br />
<br />
Applying the lessons we gain from the body of the suffering other to the process of ordering our daily lives overcomes the socioengineering schemes that deny the body agency in their pursuit of transcendence through reason. Beginning with embodiment opens up space for authentic politics by retrieving context and motivating praxis.<br />
Rajan, 90 (Roby Rajan, School of Business at the University of Wisconsin, Parkside. Alternatives, Volume XV. 1990)<br />
It ought to be stressed here that for Gandhi, …it is always and irretrievably situated.
