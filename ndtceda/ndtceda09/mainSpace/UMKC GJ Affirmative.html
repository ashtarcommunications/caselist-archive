This focus on proliferation control functions within dominant paradigms of security discourse to frame social life and ascribe identities to particular actors in order to justify intervention into or elimination of particular groups or states<br />

The representation of “our” nuclear arsenal as unproblematic and the Others as dangerous is a racist form of orientalism that produces binary oppositions to secure our weapons<br />

This focus on security perpetuates resentment of difference-it attempts to order the world in terms of purely causal, objective relationships, locking us into a nihilistic cycle in which the only way to preserve life is by negating its value.<br />

&quot;One must begin with Nietzsche's idea of the will to power, which he clearly believed to be &quot;<br />

<br />

This negation of life manifests itself in the expansion of orientalist hierarchies that deem life as worthless in the global South and cause unending exploitation of others<br />

THUS THE PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD PERMANENTLY DISARM THE UNITED STATES’ NUCLEAR ARSENAL<br />
<br />
Disarmament is the only way to end the exceptionalist nature of the NPT-we must recognize that no country should possess nuclear weapons<br />

<br />
<br />
To break down the dichotomy between “us” and “them” we must begin by renouncing the very existence of nuclear weapons – we must start with the notion that no one should possess weapons of this magnitude<br />

Weaponization is not inevitable-beginning through a frame of disarmament allows us to focus on the structural factors that perpetuate the arms race and international violence of nuclear weapons<br />

This focus on structural violence is key-nuclear terror perpetuates a state apparatus that upholds multiple forms of domination.<br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;Culture is the linchpin between the people and the established order. It can be manipulated by the latter but &quot;<br />
AND </span><br />

<br />
<strong>We are not concerned with disarmament in any moral sense-rather, we want to engage in a politics that enjoys life <em>as</em> life. Our acceptance of the potential insecurity that accompanies nuclear disarmament is part of a rejection of world ordering mechanisms like security and capitalism. The refusal to succumb to fear is a key first step.</strong><br />

Our aff is not just about framing, it is about action-doing nothing depoliticizes the struggle against nuclear weapons and leaves the nuclear state apparatus intact and in control of the bomb<br />

<br />
You should vote to align yourself with a call to reject the hyper-securitized “rational” actions that justify the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation. This involves an understanding of the structural factors that lead to nuclear statism.<br />
