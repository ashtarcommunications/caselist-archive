The United States has been much quicker to acknowledge these deficits than………………quietly as well. There was no fuss in NATO.<br />

b.

CONSULT BAD:<br />
a. Education - By stealing the entire AFF we learn nothing about any real policy. Key question in the topic is change in U.S. policy not resolved.<br />
b. Fairness - We spend all our time researching why are AFF is a good idea, not why doing our exact plan after asking some people is good. We need to leverage that against any part of a counterplan or a disad. 100% of our AFF is stolen.<br />
c. Not Predictable - There are thousands of institutions to consult and any arbitrary interpretation can say they are predictable.<br />
d. Ground - Say no is impossible because they pick the best agency to say yes, net benefit requires adding unbelievable loads of research, and the delay is miniscule.<br />
e. Voter for fairness and education.
