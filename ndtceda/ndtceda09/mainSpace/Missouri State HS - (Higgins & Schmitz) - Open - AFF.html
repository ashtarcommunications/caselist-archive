 Contention One: No Disads<br />
<br />
The START process makes De-alerting inevitable in the future but is too slow to solve our impacts – de-alerting now is key<br />
<br />
Bruce Blair (President, world security institute) September 1999 “Back from the Brink - Interview - Dr. Bruce Blair” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.argumentations.com/Argumentations/StoryDetail_595.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.argumentations.com/Argumentations/StoryDetail_595.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Does de-alerting fit … this immediate problem.<br />
<br />
Also, the US has already de-alerted a large fraction of its forces<br />
<br />
Pavel Podvig (researcher at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University) May 2006 “Reducing the Risk of an Accidental Launch” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/21283/14_2-3" rel="nofollow">http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/21283/14_2-3</a>__Podvig.pdf<br />
<br />
As a practical step, … by de-alerting measures<br />
<br />
Plus, in 1991 both the US and Russia unilaterally de-alerted ALL of our bombers, hundreds of missiles, and ten submarines<br />

<br />
Two great presidents were … taken away from them<br />
<br />
And, recently Obama and Medvedev agreed to de-alert 200 warheads<br />

<br />
Negotiate a new treaty with Russia to replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991 (START I), which expires at the end of this year.  At a summit meeting … is still poised to launch. <br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should de-alert its nuclear forces by de-mating its land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles and place submarines on modified alert.<br />
<br />
Contention Two:  Solvency<br />
<br />
De-mating is they surest way to solve<br />
<br />

Keeping subs on ‘modified alert’ solves – doesn’t decrease survivability at all<br />

<br />
SLBMs. U.S. Trident submarines … if the forces were de-alerted.<br />
<br />
Plan is key to give Russia political cover to take their weapons off of alert<br />

While Russia’s deployed …. Russia’s remaining missiles.<br />

The presidents… and in the United States<strong>*1AC Accidental Launch Adv (1)</strong>* <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Accidental Launch Advantage<br />
<br />
The threat of miscalculation and accidents is extremely high now – false alarms happen multiple times daily with very limited time to assess.  This makes rational deliberation impossible <br />
<br />
Bruce Blair (President, World Security Institute) February 2008 “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a><br />
<br />
A high degree…be run in less than one hour.  <br />
US military command and control structure rigs the decision-making process to make massive retaliation a near certainty<br />

<br />
Given the awesome… sitting ducks for very long <br />
Now is the key time – we’ll isolate several specific internal links<br />
<br />
First - Russia is about to deploy missiles with multiple warheads making pushing Russia even closer to the trigger<br />
<br />
Bruce Blair et al (President, World Security Institute) February 2008 “toward True Security Ten Steps the Next President Should Take to Transform U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/toward-true-security.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/nwgs/toward-true-security.pdf</a><br />
<br />
With the demise of…on their numbers<br />
<br />
Second - Extremely frequent hacking and Cyber-terror attacks make accidental launch inevitable without de-alerting<br />
<br />
Bruce Blair (President, World Security Institute) February 2008 “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a><br />
<br />
There are a host…signals carries real risk.<br />
<br />
This avoids all your generic defense and ensures escalation – Cyberterrorists have empirically made attempts to hack our submarines<br />
<br />
Jason Fritz (Director of New Media Learning &amp; Development and editor of the Office of Information Technology) May 2009 “Hacking Nuclear Command and Control” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Jason_Fritz_Hacking_NC2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Jason_Fritz_Hacking_NC2.pdf</a><br />
<br />
This paper will…control centres directly.<br />
<br />
Third is Russia – multiple factors make accidental launch more likely than in the Cold War<br />
<br />
The Washington Office (public policy information and advocacy office of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church) August 2008 “Launch on Warning and the Nuclear Hair Trigger”  <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.pcusa.org/washington/issuenet/gs-001211.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcusa.org/washington/issuenet/gs-001211.htm</a><br />
<br />
Accordingly, within just…planes had been launched.<br />
<br />
The threshold for our impact is pretty low – it only takes one mishap or computer glitch to cause escalation<br />
<br />

<br />
One of the…This is inexcusably dangerous.<br />

Accidental launch from high alert weapons causes extinction<br />

<br />
President Obama and Russian…1995 remains in place today. <br />
<br />
Our impact is the fastest and most important – dealerting is key to solve global nuclear incineration that could occur in a matter of minutes – we have been lucky up until now<br />
<br />
Douglas Mattern (a Silicon Valley engineer, is president of the Association of World Citizens) at least 2005 (latest cited work) “A Critical Time in Human History - Escalating Nuclear Disarmament” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldcitizens.org/criticaltime.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcitizens.org/criticaltime.html</a><br />
<br />
In his article … continuously until the goal is reached.<br />
<br />
Our internal link is the only plausible scenario for full scale nuclear war – keeping missiles on alert is the only way for global nuclear war to happen<br />

<br />
Getting to below 2,000 …against a country other than Russia.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
India – Pakistan Advantage<br />
<br />
There is tension in South Asia now and there will be inevitably. Both countries are ramping up their nuclear capabilities<br />

The simple fact …combat-ready forces is ended<br />

I am convinced that … an arms control regime.<br />

Physical de-mating is key to ensure program success – otherwise theft is inevitable – Hair trigger alert is the Achilles heel of nuclear security.  De-alerting eliminates any threat of nuclear terrorism<br />
