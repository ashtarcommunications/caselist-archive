CONTENTION ONE: Dismantlement   <br />
FIRST NOTE-National Nuclear Safety Administration nuclear dismantlement is drastically underfunded<br />
<br />
Dr. Robert Civak, Budget Examiner with the Office of Management and Budget, April 2005 (America's One-Nation Arms Race, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.trivalleycares.org/TVC-Civiak_2006Rpt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.trivalleycares.org/TVC-Civiak_2006Rpt.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
In the summer of 2004, the … and Stockpile System Programs. <br />
<br />
This has resulted in a large backlog of nuclear weapons slated for dismantlement-at current rates retired weapons must be maintained in storage for 20 years<br />
<br />
Lewis and Lugo 2009 [Jeffrey Lewis, Director Nuclear Strategy and Nonproliferation Initiative at New America Foundation and Meri Lugo, Intern. Foreign Policy “Where Weapons go to Die” 4/13/09]<br />
<br />
Speaking in Prague … be with us for quite a while. <br />
<br />
As a result, “cut” warheads awaiting dismantlement remain at their bases<br />
<br />
Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, 18 December 2007 (White House Announces (Secret) Nuclear Weapons Cuts, FAS Strategic Security Blog, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/12/white_house_announces_secret_n.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/12/white_house_announces_secret_n.php</a>)<br />
<br />
The White House’s announcement to …Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. <br />
<br />
THERE ARE TWO IMPACT SCENARIOS— <br />
First-Accidents  <br />
Excess nuclear weapons awaiting dismantlement remain at DOD bases long after transfer to the DOE<br />
<br />
Bruce Blair and Hans Kristensen et al., February 2008 (FAS NRDC and UCS, Toward True Security, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_08021201A.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_08021201A.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
In December 2007, the United States…where it dismantles warheads. <br />
<br />
This storage at Air Force bases results in significant accounting errors and bent spear nuclear accidents<br />
<br />
Walter Pincus, Washington Post Staff Writer, 28 September 2007 (Errors Behind Warheads' Flight, Washington Post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/27/AR2007092702216.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/27/AR2007092702216.html</a>)<br />
<br />
An Air Force decision to … they were turned over to the NNSA. <br />
<br />
Status quo reforms of Air Force procedure are insufficient and accidents remain inevitable-the pervasive culture of nuclear laxity means that only reducing the number of weapons can solve<br />
<br />
Pavel Podvig, research associate at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation and former head of the Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces Research Project, 12 September 2007 (U.S. loose nukes, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, he Russian Strategic Nuclear Forces Research Project, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/pavel-podvig/us-loose-nukes" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/pavel-podvig/us-loose-nukes</a>)<br />
<br />
We simply don't know how … safe and secure manner. <br />
<br />
And, future bent spear incidents risk escalatory accidental nuclear war-reducing the number of weapons in the arsenal is key to solve<br />
<br />
Jeff Lindemyer, Policy Fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, 21 September 2007 (One Mistake Too Many, Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nuclearweapons/articles/one_mistake_too_many/" rel="nofollow">http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/nuclearweapons/articles/one_mistake_too_many/</a>)<br />
<br />
The Minot incident raises … mistakes can and do happen.  <br />
<br />
Accidental nuclear war escalates and kills billions<br />
<br />
PR Newswire 1998 (“NEJM Study Warns of Increasing Risk of Accidental Nuclear Attack; Over 6.8 Million Immediate U.S. Deaths Possible,” Apr 29, LN)<br />
<br />
An 'accidental' nuclear attack…with billions of casualties worldwide. <br />
<br />
The Second Impact Scenario is Nuclear Terrorism  <br />
<br />
The bent spear incident demonstrates the lax nuclear safety at Air Force bases-weak security makes nuclear theft and use inevitable<br />
<br />
The Independent 2008 [“Major Lapses in Nuclear Security are Routine” 5-19-08]<br />
<br />
In the US, an even-more … an explosion sooner or later. <br />
<br />
Weapons awaiting dismantlement are uniquely vulnerable to terrorist acquisition and use-they have already been striped of protective security devices<br />
<br />
Jenkins 2008 [Brian Michael Jenkins, Senior Advisor to the President of the RAND Corporation, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear? Prometheus Books: Amherst (NY) 2008. P 141]<br />
<br />
Here again, however, vulnerabilities…render the bombs usable. <br />
<br />
And, the bent spear incident proves loose U.S. nuclear weapons are vulnerable to terrorist theft and pose an existential threat – status quo reforms are insufficient – only getting rid of the weapons solves<br />
<br />
Kristensen 2007 [Hans Kristensen, Director Nuclear Information Project at FAS “Nuclear Safety and the Saga about the Missing Bent Spear” FAS Strategic Security Blog 10-31-07 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2008/02/nuclear_safety_and_the_saga_ab.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2008/02/nuclear_safety_and_the_saga_ab.php</a> ]<br />
<br />
One of the most important …quest seems like a fallacy. <br />
<br />
Terrorists have both the means and motivation to detonate a nuclear weapon-acquisition is the only remaining barrier<br />
<br />
Matthew Bunn, Harvard Senior Research Associate, Managing the Atom Project, 2004 [Securing the Bomb: An Agenda for Action, w/ Anthony Wier, May, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nti.org/e_research/analysis_cnwmupdate_052404.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nti.org/e_research/analysis_cnwmupdate_052404.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Reality: This conclusion is …in a Moscow park in 1995). <br />
<br />
Finally, nuclear terrorism escalates, culminating in nuclear war and extinction<br />
<br />
Speice 2006 – 06 JD Candidate @ College of William and Mary [Patrick F. Speice, Jr., “NEGLIGENCE AND NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION: ELIMINATING THE CURRENT LIABILITY BARRIER TO BILATERAL U.S.-RUSSIAN NONPROLIFERATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS,” William &amp; Mary Law Review, February 2006, 47 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 1427<br />
<br />
Accordingly, there is a significant…use of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: Russia<br />
<br />
Russia is existentially concerned with the U.S. nuclear arsenal-size, not reliability, is the critical factor in Russia’s security calculus<br />
<br />
Lieber and Press, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame and Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, 2006 (Keir A and Daryl G, “The Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy,” Foreign Affairs, March/April 2006)<br />
<br />
Even as Russia's nuclear forces …even more likely to succeed.) <br />
<br />
As a result, Russia responds to the U.S. failure to dismantle its nuclear weapons with aggressive force posturing<br />
<br />
Amy Woolf, Specialist in National Defense Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division, 16 May 2002 (Arms Control and Strategic Nuclear Weapons: Unilateral vs. Bilateral Reductions, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RL31222.txt" rel="nofollow">http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RL31222.txt</a>)<br />
<br />
Potential for Destabilizing Reversal….and deeply than U.S. forces.<br />
<br />
This creates three scenarios for nuclear war: accidents, crisis escalation and pre-emption<br />
<br />
Lieber and Press, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame and Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania, 2006 (Keir A and Daryl G, “The End of MAD? The Nuclear Dimension of U.S. Primacy,” International Security, Vol. 30, No. 4)<br />
<br />
The shift in the nuclear balance…the United States (e.g., in Korea).<br />
<br />
And, whether the US intended to threaten Russia is irrelevant—the perception of current nuclear primacy increases the risk of great power wars, crisis escalation, and accidental nuclear war<br />
<br />
Schwartz 2006 (Benjamin, literary editor and the national editor of The Atlantic, “The Perils of Primacy,” The Atlantic Monthly, Jan/Feb, The Agenda)<br />
<br />
To be sure., America's emerging … scrutiny and debate to begin.  <br />
<br />
Russia-U.S. nuclear war escalates-only scenario for extinction<br />
<br />
Nick Bostrom, PhD and Professor at Oxford, March, 2002 www.transhumanist.com/volume9/risks.html<br />
<br />
A much greater existential…humankind’s potential permanently. <br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY-Russia models U.S. dismantlement rates-fear of U.S. breakout capability precludes Russian dismantlement creating multiple scenarios for nuclear theft <br />
<br />
Jon Wolfsthal, deputy director for Non-Proliferation at Carnegie, 3 April 2002 (Nuclear Terrorism and Warhead Control in Russia, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=946" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=946</a>)<br />
<br />
The catch is that, if…early stages of deployment. <br />
<br />
And, Russian nuclear security is a joke – weapons are highly vulnerable to terrorist theft<br />
<br />
Allison, 2004 (Graham, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Prof of Government at Harvard, former assistance Sec. Of Defense for policy, Nuclear Terrorism, p. 9-10)<br />
<br />
The imminence of this threat…know that I don't know.&quot;&quot; <br />
<br />
Moreover, lax security means transporting a nuclear weapon would be easy<br />
<br />
Allison, ‘4 (Graham, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Prof of Government at Harvard, former assistance Sec. Of Defense for policy, Nuclear Terrorism, p. 10-11)<br />
<br />
Third, terrorists would not … smuggle in a nuclear bomb.&quot; <br />
<br />
BUT-Dismantling retired weapons would solve:  <br />
<br />
First-Upload Potential.  <br />
The massive backlog of nuclear weapons awaiting dismantlement gives the U.S. an unparalleled upload potential for massive and rapid arsenal breakout.<br />
<br />
Bukharin 2002 [Oleg Bukharin Research Scientist at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School “A Breakdown of Breakout” Arms Control Association October 2002]<br />
<br />
Despite Russia’s larger … of concern to the Russians. <br />
<br />
Settling the upload would lay the ground work for resolving all nuclear reduction disputes.<br />
<br />
Ria Novosti 2009 (“An in-depth look at the Russian press,” 4-22, Lexis)<br />
<br />
Russia ready for nuclear…seriously complicate the talks.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Second-Arms control.  <br />
As long as the U.S. maintains thousands of weapons in storage to be dismantled status quo reductions in arsenal size are little more than changes in paperwork.<br />
<br />
Jim McBride, Morris News Service, 20 October 2006 (Nuclear Security Administration proposes wider role for Pantex, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/102006/sta_102006110.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/102006/sta_102006110.shtml</a>)<br />
<br />
The NNSA wants to keep… in the warheads themselves.&quot; <br />
<br />
Fortunately, accelerating dismantlement would boost our arms control credibility, assuaging fears of a new arms race.<br />
<br />
Walter Pincus, WPost Staff Writer, 4 May 2006 (U.S. to Step Up Disassembly of Older Nuclear Warheads, washington post, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050302136.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050302136.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Members of Congress have been…in the last few years.&quot; <br />
<br />
That’s key to prevent multiple scenarios for nuclear escalation<br />
<br />
Blank 2009 (Stephen J, Strategic Studies Institute’s expert on the Soviet bloc and the post- Soviet world since 1989 “RUSSIA AND ARMS CONTROL: ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION?,” March, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf</a>.)<br />
<br />
Even if one is skeptical … if not nuclear proliferation.  <br />
<br />
Third-Transparency.  <br />
Now is a key time-Russia is cautiously optimistic about trusting Obama; future U.S. actions are key to build confidence<br />
<br />
Russia Today 1 April 2009 (Cool Russian Optimism towards USA, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://russiatoday.com/Politics/2009-04-11/Cool_Russian_optimism_towards_USA.html" rel="nofollow">http://russiatoday.com/Politics/2009-04-11/Cool_Russian_optimism_towards_USA.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Moscow is optimistic about… said the Russian Foreign Minister. <br />
<br />
And, a fulfilling dismantlement obligations would solve Russian perception of verification and U.S. implementation of arms reductions<br />
<br />
William Perry and Brent Scowcroft et al. 2009 (Former Secretary of Defense U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy under Nixon and Ford and Former Secretary of Defense Under Clinton, Council on Foreign Relations Task Force Report No. 62, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/pbei/cfr/0016410/f_0016410_14193.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/pbei/cfr/0016410/f_0016410_14193.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
A proper assessment of progress…setting an international standard.  <br />
<br />
The plan solves: backlogs contribute to a perception of covert arms racing; accelerating the rate of dismantlement reassures other powers<br />
<br />
Thomas D'Agostino, director NNSA, 9 May 2007 (The Reliable Replacement Warhead and the Future of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Program, Remarks at National Defense University, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bits.de/NRANEU/docs/speech_DAgostino_NDUHillBreakfastSeries-09May07.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bits.de/NRANEU/docs/speech_DAgostino_NDUHillBreakfastSeries-09May07.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Our near-term strategy includes…programs of North Korea and Iran. <br />
<br />
FORTUNATELY-creating a smaller more credible arsenal is able to walk the line between reassuring allies and dissuading potential nuclear adversaries  <br />
<br />
William Perry 2009 (Former Secretary of Defense U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy under Clinton, America's Strategic Posture, United States Institute of Peace Press, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usip.org/files/America's_Strategic_Posture_Auth_Ed.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.usip.org/files/America's_Strategic_Posture_Auth_Ed.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
President Obama has stated… only as a defensive last resort.  <br />
<br />
FINALLY, only dismantling nuclear weapons solves-the plan is necessary to reassure adversaries and allies of the benign yet credible U.S. arsenal and ensure that nuclear accounting errors won’t continue<br />
<br />
Hans Kristensen, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, 2 May 2007 (Estimates of the US Nuclear Weapons Stockpile, FAS Strategic Security Blog, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/05/estimates_of_us_nuclear_weapon.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2007/05/estimates_of_us_nuclear_weapon.php</a>)<br />
