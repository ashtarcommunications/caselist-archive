 <ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Nuclear weapons are instruments of mass extermination that eliminate populaces with as much efficiency as possible. Their development is a symptom of humanity’s technological understanding of being which creates the mindset that people and the environment are a standing reserve for consumption.

It was this type of technological thinking that allowed the extermination of the Jews.</strong></span></li></ul><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Zimmerman – Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University – 94 (Michael, Contesting Earth's Future, p.43)</span><br />
