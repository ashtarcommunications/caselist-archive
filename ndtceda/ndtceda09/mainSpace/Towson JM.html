The Counterplan: Hit me. w/ Nommo version of the plan text.<br />
<br />
Whitneess is a performative construct that is made and re made every time the simple everyday actions which prop it up are reiterated. Performative pedagogy is an active process of dismantling white supremacy by interrupting its reproduction and making visceral and present its invisible nature.<br />

<br />
The performance of the 1NC is an example of performative pedagogy which is the most effective means of subverting the political system of White Supremacy by approaching the transcendence of self and other.<br />

Solvency:<br />
Nommo can be understood in a post modern context as a deliberate manipulation of linguistic “norms” to cryptically express cultural knowledge which serve to deliberately construct a new reality through linguistic innovation and improvisation<br />

In traditional African culture . . . during the African Holocaust.<br />
<br />
We must decolonize the mind in order to produce a new world through nommo<br />
Leonard 2005 [ Moulard Valentine, “Revolutionary Becomings: Negritude’s Anti-Humanist Humanism” ]<br />
The term “Negritude” was coined . . . processes driven by negation.<br />
<br />
Nommo is necessarily incoherent and unassibilable to white hegemonies ideological matrix, this means that the confrontation with the impossibly of knowing the black body works back against the grammar of hegemony. This also means that nommo cannot be commodified by capitalism or any articulation of hegemony as it is currently incarnated.<br />
Frank B. Wilderson III 2007, “Warfare in the American Homeland-Policing and Prison in a Penal Democracy,” pg. 31-33]<br />
Slavery is the great leveler . . . be pursued to the death.<br />
<br />
Net Benefits:<br />
Since the aff acts within these performative constructs of whiteness that cause self hatred and Resentment in the black body, there are several net benefits to the CP:<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">- </span>We perform our kritik that brings meaning to the body, and the aff is trying to tell you how to make a soufflé without showing us how to do it. They do not account for the political system of white supremacy and how it effects the world, while we use it as a way to subvert its domination. (Morrison)<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">- </span>We use Nommo as a cultural resource to affirm our black humanity and our view of the world. (Yancy)<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">- </span>We affirm our blackness instead of negating whiteness. (Leonard)<br />
<span style="mso-list: Ignore;">- </span>We are incoherent to dominant white cultural hegemonies and cannot be co-opted by dominant hegemonies (i.e. Capitalism). (Wilderson)<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:<br />
Not focusing on white supremacy will not solve for anything because it is currently the central, political system that all forms of domination derives. This causes the terminal impact of its perpetuation.<br />
<br />
Focusing the advocacy on a kritik of white supremacy allows an understanding of the ways in which difference is produced and regulated across the entire reach of the United States. This is the method by which people of color all over the world are managed and enslaved<br />
Rodriguez, 07- ylan Rodriguez, Professor, University of California Riverside, Nov. 2007<br />
[Kritika Kultura “American Globality and the US Prison Regime: State Violence and White Supremacy from Abu Ghraib to Stockton to Bagong Diwa”]<br />
Variable, overlapping, and mutually . . . that is organic to its ordering.<br />
<br />
NEXT:<br />
The aff’s authors have a universal “View From Nowhere” which reiterates the cultural strategy of whiteness to perpetuate the political system of white supremacy. This means they have no means for solving for the black body because it is the radix for interpreting all racial experience, and their aff does nto account for that.<br />
<br />
The “View From Nowhere” that most philosophical discourse fosters cannot theorize for the black body or hope to solve for the harms of white supremacy<br />
