<br />
1) Testing is on the rise now- other countries are waiting on U.S. ratification of the CTBT in order to bring the treaty and its inspections regime into force<br />
<br />
The Economist, 6/4/09. “Making a Start” <br />
<br />
But some things … not in the mood.<br />
<br />
2) And despite Obama’s spring pledge at Prague, the U.S. has yet to ratify the CTBT. The votes just aren’t there and there has been no rush to push the treaty in the status quo<br />
<br />
PONI 9/10/09. Project on Nuclear Issues blog. “Top Chef CTBT,” Center for Strategic and International Studies. /sal <br />

Advantage – Iran/NoKo<br />
<br />
Advantage <u>) is Iran and North Korea:<br />
<br />
1) The CTBT is at the heart of America’s disarmament hypocrisy as a result the U.S. has alienated diplomatic talks with so-called “rogue states”<br />

<br />
Iran is preparing … its peaceful use.<br />
<br />
b) The specter of Iran’s nuclear weapons program has set the world on high-alert. A Middle East arms race has resulted, causing destabilizing, fast proliferation. This makes nuclear war inevitable.<br />

c) A nuclear Middle East would not be stable- deterrence will be unable to prevent cascading proliferation, nuclear war and nuclear terrorism<br />
<br />

The second choice is …second-class nuclear power. <br />
<br />
d) And a strike on Korea will lead to a regional nuclear war that will draw in the U.S.<br />
<br />
Chol, ’02 (Kim Myong, PhD in Political Science and Executive Director of the Center for Korean-American Peace. “The Agreed Framework is Brain Dead,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/0212A_Chol.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nautilus.org/fora/security/0212A_Chol.html</a>) <br />

<br />
Advantage – Multilateralism<br />

<br />
First, a pledge …so much promise. <br />
<br />
3) Multilateral cooperation leads to the end of nuclear war, and prevents the impacts to escalating environmental destruction<br />

War is deeply … existing state system.  <br />
Advantage – India-Pakistan<br />
<br />
Advantage </u>) is India-Pakistan:<br />
<br />
1) India is warming up to the CTBT now, but U.S. leadership on ratification is key to get India to actually sign it<br />

Plan Text<br />
<br />
Thus, we offer the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and support its provisional ratification. Funding and implementation are guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />

<br />
Q: What is the … toward nuclear disarmament.<br />
<br />
U.S. ratification is THE litmus test for global nonproliferation efforts by creating a strong international norm. In particular, it will strip any benefit of a nuclear program for states like North Korea and India<br />
