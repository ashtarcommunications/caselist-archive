Contention 1 Accidents<br />
<br />
The U.S. is overconfident is the safeguards on its nuclear weapons now; this makes the probability of U.S. accidental launch higher than in any other country<br />
Podvig 06 <br />
(Science and Global Security, 14:75–115, 2006 Copyright C _ Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC ISSN: 0892-9882 print / 1547-7800 online DOI: 10.1080/08929880600992990 Reducing the Risk of an Accidental Launch Pavel Podvig Center for International Security and Cooperation, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA)<br />
The situation with………. alarm may be higher.<br />
<br />
And, this overconfidence leads to the dangerous practice of safeguards being skipped over for faster launch<br />

Last month I asked Robert………. at OOOOOOOO.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Third, computer error- the probability of computer error is quickly increasing and causes accidental conflict and escalation<br />

Naturally, in the latter case……… the bottom of the ocean.  <br />
<br />
Fourth, subordinate human error- this is the weak link in the safety system, it will guarantee accidental nuclear launch if nothing else does<br />

The role of the human factor…….. nuclear safety assurance system.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And, just a single accident ensures escalation to full-scale war- launch on warning guarantees<br />

The capability of delivering a………… of massive nuclear strikes.  <br />
<br />
<br />
And, complex warning systems actually amplify this risk, not decrease it—it’s just a matter of time before nuclear conflict occurs<br />

(Alan &amp; Steven, Let’s go No-LOW, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Vol 60: No 3. May/ June 2004) <br />
The most likely cause of accidental………….. continue pulling the trigger?<br />
<br />
<br />
We don’t even need to win the number of nukes launched is large; even a small amount of warheads destroys the ozone layer, causes catastrophic climate shifts, and permanently destroys agriculture; extinction will result<br />

This article is based on material presented at a side event at the 2008 PrepCom of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Dedicated to the memory of Alan Phillips of Physicians for Global Survival, Canada.)<br />
General knowledge of nuclear……………. high-alert, launch-ready nuclear weapons <br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 2 Retaliation and Crisis Escalation<br />
<br />
High alert nuclear weapons ensure “war by checklist”—launch officers are conditioned to feel no remorse when deciding to retaliate <br />
Blair 03 <br />
(May 1, 2003,   Nuclear Recollections Author(s): Bruce Blair Dr. Blair is an expert on U.S. and Russian security policies, specializing in nuclear forces and command-control systems. He has frequently testified before Congress and has taught security studies as a visiting professor at Yale and Princeton universities. In 1999, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship Prize (the Genius Award) for his work and leadership on de-alerting nuclear forces. Dr. Blair was a senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Studies Program at the Brookings Institution from 1987 to 2000. From 1970 to 1974, Dr. Blair served in the U.S. Air Force, serving as a Minuteman ICBM launch control officer and support officer for the Strategic Air Command’s Airborne Command Post. He is the author of numerous books and articles on security issues in such publications as Scientific American, National Interest, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. His books include Strategic Command and Control (Brookings, 1985), winner of the Edgar S. Furniss Award for its contribution to the study of national security. He is currently writing a new book on U.S. strategic policy. Dr. Blair earned a Ph.D. in operations research at Yale.)<br />
Rear Adm. Eugene……………… couple of keystrokes would send our……….. down now that it's over. <br />
<br />
<br />
And, high alert status completely biases decision-makers towards nuclear launch in the event of a crisis<br />

One of the most rarefied experiences…………. nuclear footballs beware. <br />
<br />
<br />
High alert status ensures ANY crisis escalates to full scale nuclear war<br />
Blair 07 <br />
(&quot;A Rebuttal of the U.S. Statement on the Alert Status of U.S. Nuclear Forces&quot; Bruce G. Blair President, World Security Institute October 13, 2007) <br />
If the Kremlin and the White……………….. president inevitably toward [such] a decision.”[8]   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, tiny decision times ensure nuclear escalation—pro-deterrence authors agree<br />
Fortney 99 <br />
(MAJOR MICHAEL E. FORTNEY A THESIS PRESENTED TO THE FACULTY OF THE SCHOOL OF ADVANCED AIRPOWER STUDIES FOR COMPLETION OF GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED AIRPOWER STUDIES AIR UNIVERSITY MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE, ALABAMA JUNE 1999) <br />
Much of the 1990s de-alerting…………… be brought to bear.<br />
<br />
<br />
De-alert increases time crucial to prevent conflict by gathering info, allowing negotiations, and correcting false perceptions<br />

On the other hand, it………………… misperceptions, and negotiations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 3 Risk Calculus and A New Risk Paradigm<br />
<br />
Leaders make irrational decisions in a nuclear crisis—status quo risk calculus ensures that it’s only a matter of time before nuclear weapons are used<br />
Hellman 08 <br />
(Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence)<br />
Society is even less concerned about………. similar crisis have since occurred<br />
<br />
<br />
Further, the risk of deterrence failure will only go up in the coming decades as new triggers for world war are added; the status quo is unacceptable<br />
Hellman 08 <br />
(Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence)<br />
While much less accurate……… rationally and predictably.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, even a 1% of accidents is unacceptable<br />
Hellman 08 <br />
(Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence)<br />
If the failure rate of…….. reaches an acceptable level.<br />
<br />
This risk makes extinction inevitable- timeframe doesn’t matter<br />
Hellman 08 <br />
(Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence)<br />
Hiram Maxim, the inventor of the machine………… this time will be no different.<br />
<br />
<br />
History proves- every time we get a new weapon we think we won’t use it- this is due to failure to effectively calculate risk<br />
Hellman 08 <br />
(Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence)<br />
On our current path, nuclear……….. Today, it is necessary for survival.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The challenger explosion proves why nuclear optimism is flawed- it’s based upon a non-logical risk calculus that seems “common sense” but is flawed every time<br />
Hellman 09 <br />
(How Confident Should a Nuclear Optimist Be? Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence, and is described in detail at NuclearRisk.org. A summary statement has been endorsed by:      * Prof. Kenneth Arrow, Stanford University, 1972 Nobel Laureate in Economics     * Mr. D. James Bidzos, Chairman of the Board, VeriSign Inc.     * Dr. Richard Garwin, IBM Fellow Emeritus, former member President's Science Advisory Committee and Defense Science Board     * Adm. Bobby R. Inman, USN (Ret.), University of Texas at Austin, former Director National Security Agency and Deputy Director CIA     * Prof. William Kays, former Dean of Engineering, Stanford University     * Prof. Donald Kennedy, President Emeritus of Stanford University, former head of Food and Drug Administration     * Prof. Martin Perl, Stanford University, 1995 Nobel Laureate in Physics September 7, 2009) <br />
Nuclear optimism is a school……………. nuclear optimism.<br />
<br />
<br />
High alert nukes are a crisis in waiting yet we think we are safe due to experience- the same faulty risk calculus is behind the current economic collapse<br />
Steinbruner 09<br />

The idea of de-alerting nuclear forces…………. protected deployment pattern.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, history proves that bad risk calculations are behind every major war—de-alerting is critical to finally change the risk calculus we use<br />
Fortney 99 <br />
(MAJOR MICHAEL E. FORTNEY A THESIS PRESENTED TO THE FACULTY OF THE SCHOOL OF ADVANCED AIRPOWER STUDIES FOR COMPLETION OF GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS SCHOOL OF ADVANCED AIRPOWER STUDIES AIR UNIVERSITY MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE, ALABAMA JUNE 1999) <br />
This chapter is the first………….. ead to catastrophic results.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Rejecting the failures of high alert nukes is the catalyst to change our risk calculus of threats- this must happen to prevent extinction<br />
Hellman 08 <br />
(Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence)<br />
While the intermediate steps in the…………… previously thought impossible for our species. …<br />
<br />
<br />
Rejecting the deterrence failures of high alert nukes spills over to broader risk calculus—this solves multiple extinction scenarios<br />
Hellman 08 <br />
(Martin E. Hellman* * Martin E. Hellman is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and Professor Emeritus at Stanford University. His current project applies risk analysis to nuclear deterrence)<br />
Currently, there is significant………. to the others<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should issue and implement a classified decision directive to remove inverters on Submarine-launch ballistic missile and turning on safety switches on intercontinental ballistic missile
