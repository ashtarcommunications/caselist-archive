Uniqueness-German security is due to American nuclear umbrella-not proliferating now<br />
Rozoff 07/19/09-www.globalresearch.ca<br />
The nation has the third largest military budget...Germany needs to ponder building its own nuclear deterrence system.<br />
<br />
Link-Lack of secure US nuclear umbrella forces Germany to get nuclear weapons<br />
Campbell 4 (Kurt Campbell, Robert J. Einhorn, Mitchell Reiss 2004) “The nuclear tipping point: why states reconsider their nuclear choices” p. 204<br />
To be sure, some observers have speculated…might even seek its own nuclear weapons if it felt threatened.<br />
<br />
Impact-Nuclear parity is impossible-German proliferation would spiral into global conflagration<br />
Muller, 2000-www.hsfk.de/downloads.prifrep55.pdf<br />
Any country which, like Germany, has decided…Germany necessarily has an interest in nonproliferation.<br />

<strong><u>Nuclear Waste Storage</u></strong><br />
<br />
Dismantling nuclear weapons will create massive amounts of nuclear waste<br />
Baldwin 2004 (Joe, “Nuclear weapon Decommissioning, 2/29/04) as much as greenpeace and I don’t like it… OSPAR confrerence on waste dumping<br />
<br />
Risk of theft and levels of waste are directly related- the aff plan increases the odds of a terrorist attack<br />
Makhijani 2006 (“The waste problem” Newsweek 2/6/06) when the uranium fuel of a nuclear… pure (bomb-grade) plutonium<br />
<br />
Impact is extinction- Alexander 2003 (Washington times, 8-28-03) unlike their historical counterparts… there is no survival<br />
<br />
<strong><u>CMR:</u></strong><br />
A) Civil military relations working as designed in the status quo<br />
Schake 09, “ So far so good for civil military relations under Obama” Foreign Policy, 9/4<br />
-- afganistan was always going…. Decisions only he can make<br />
<br />
B) the end will fight with civilian leadership over aff plan. The end of the cold war has put CNR on the brink of collapse, fights over weapons policy and use of forse push US past the brink<br />
DESCH 99, p.30 “Civilian Control of the Military the changing security Environment”<br />
But while the United States was a model…. Have begun to crumble<br />
<br />
C) robust civil- military relations are critical to effectiveness in the war on terror<br />
Gutteri 03, Strategic Insights, Vol II, Issue 8<br />
The maerican strategic policy…. Function of democracy in wartime<br />
<br />
D) Impact is EXT<br />
ALexendar 03, Yonah, Washingtn Tims 8-28, Lexis<br />
-- contemporary terrorists have introduced …. There is no survival<br />
<br />
<strong><u>ALLIED prolif:</u></strong><br />
A) despite of global disarmamen and recent cuts and reviews, Obama will maintain a strong commitment to extended deterrence.<br />
Matishak 09, “Pentagon Says Nuclear Review Will Address Disarmament, Deterrence” Global Security Newswire<br />
--- the Obama administration’s review…. Military’ nuclear capabilities<br />
<br />
B) link and impact- any further change in US nuclear weapons policy that limits the use of numer would result in wildfire allied prolif and nuc war<br />
Feith 09, “Why Revive the cold war? Russia and the US were reducing their nuclear arsenals without arms control” Wall St Journal<br />
--- there is an important…. Costliest mistakes ever.<br />
<br />
C) Exted the aff case advantages because eah of them now become individual disad to plan<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Syria</u></strong><br />
<br />
A) Uniqueness- no Syrian prolif now- they haven’t looked to outside sources to help develop nuc weapons<br />
NTI 09, : Syria Profile: Nuclear Overview”<br />
The atomic ebergy commission…. Possess reprocessing technologies<br />
<br />
B) link- US deterrence critical to stopping strain prolif<br />
Glick 09, “ Syria’s hour trumph” Front Page Magazine<br />
But are they right?..... he left Lebanon<br />
<br />
C) Impact-<br />
1. Israel would pre-emt Syrian efforts to prolif, inevitablioty escalating to nuc war<br />
CSIS 08, “ Syrian Weapons of Mass Destriction”<br />
-- various expects have postulated…. Possibility without warning<br />
<br />
2. Nuclear exchange would kill millions<br />
Leshem 07, “ US institute; Israel could survive nuclear war”<br />
--- possible targets for an…. Its nuclear arsenal<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>NATO Cohesion</u></strong><br />
<br />
A) NATO members and Oama wont remove TNWs from Europe in fear of dividing NATO<br />
Almond and Ingram 09, “ Politics around US tactical nuclear weapons in European host states”<br />
--- NATOs member states have…. Reduced commitment to NATO<br />
<br />
B) Removing TNWs will divide and weaken the alliance<br />
Thranert 08, “ US Nuclear weapons forces in Europe to Zero? Yes but not yet”<br />
--- a START follow-on…. Relationship with Russia<br />
<br />
C) Nato is critical to prevent a number of scenarios for ext including; wmd prolif, terrorism and war<br />
Robertson 03, Speech at 9th Conference de Montreal<br />
--- in our increasingly globalised world… wherever they may come<br />

<strong>Condition Russia</strong><br />
The united states federal government should negotiate and ratify a fissile material treaty with provisions mandating the reduction of fissile material stockpiles on the condition that the Russian federation agrees to end nuclear cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran.<br />
Russia will make concessions on iran in return for us nuclear weapons cuts- baker 2009 (luke, “US says Russia arms deal may pressure iran” 7-9) Monday’s Russia –us agreement aims for… when it comes to iran<br />
Russia assistance towards iran encourages prolif- markey 2008 (Edward, “Russia, Iran, and Nuclear weapons: Implications of the Proposed US Russia Agreement” Hearing on the House Foreign Affairs Committee) let me walk through some… among other advanced weapons<br />
