Round 3 - Liberty Tournament<br />
Neg v. Wayne State JM - NFU<br />
<br />
Weaponitis K<br />
<br />
The Affirmative completely misses the forest for the trees. Changes in numbers, and/or the presence of new technologies are functionally meaningless in terms of the risk of international disaster. This focus of advocacy is disasterous- by focusing on nuclear weapons, rather than foreign policy and human decisions made by our leaders, we uphold systemic and increase the risk of potential international violence. We must, as citizens, make demands for less reckless foreign policy, rather than reducing nuclear weapons’ size or missions, because, honestly, reckless leaders can destroy countries many times over without a single non-conventional weapon. <br />
<br />
Schwartz and Derber, 1989<br />
(William A., and Charles, “The Hardwire is Not the Problem”, December 1, 1;1, p. 26-28<br />
<br />
“The pattern just described reflects a basic misunderstanding… a smoking radiating ruin at the end of two hours”<br />

<br />
War Machine K<br />
<br />
The Affirmative’s advocacy centers focus on nuclear weapons, virtually anthropomorphisizing both the weapons and the idea of war- hence the war machine. By letting humans, and political decisions off the hook, affirmative creates a self-fulfilling prophecy logic of the inevitability of conflict, It is orecisily those of us who are not military experts or policy experts who are best positioned to challenge these reified, normalized assumptions about war and military technology. <br />

Pick 1993<br />
(Daniel, “War Machine: The Rationalism of Slaughter in the modern age” p 10-12)<br />
<br />
“I focus on perceptions of the meaning of war… and virtually unstoppable once in motion”
