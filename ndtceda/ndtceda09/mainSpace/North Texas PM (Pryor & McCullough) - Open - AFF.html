THE UNITED STATES DEPLOYS TWO WARHEADS ON SUBMARINES—THE POWER AND ACCURACY OF THE W-88 WARHEAD MAKES IT THE KEY FACTOR UNDERMINING NUCLEAR STABILITY<br />

NEW UPGRADES TO THE W-88 DID NOTHING—THEY ARE STILL UNSTABLE<br />

WASHINGTON — Resting atop<br />
<br />
stronger product. <br />
ADVANTAGE ONE: ACCIDENTAL DETONATION<br />
<br />
W-88 WARHEADS ARE ACCIDENT PRONE—EVEN SMALL SHOCKS COULD CAUSE NUCLEAR DETONATION<br />

<br />
Nuclear weapons are<br />
<br />
a nuclear detonation.&quot;3 <br />
ACCIDENTAL WARHEAD DETONATION WOULD TRIGGER NUCLEAR WAR AND EXTINCTION<br />

No theoretical calculation<br />
<br />
or miscalculated use. <br />
EVEN IF SUBMARINE EXPLOSIONS DON’T CAUSE MISCALCULATION, THEY WOULD CREATE MASSIVE RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION<br />

(Samuel Upton, PhD in Engineering, Nuclear War I and Other Major Nuclear Disasters of the 20th Century161-162) <br />
Perhaps the most<br />
<br />
in the future. <br />
EVEN IF THE WARHEADS DON’T DETONATE, THE W-88 IS PRONE TO WATER DAMAGE THAT WOULD IRRADIATE THE OCEANS<br />

<br />
The world's oceans<br />
<br />
to future generations.  <br />
ADVANTAGE TWO: RUSSIA<br />
<br />
RUSSIA MAINTAINS BOTH HIGH ALERT AND THE DEAD HAND IN RESPONSE TO THE THREAT OF U.S. SUBMARINES—MANY FACTORS CAUSING INSTABILITY IN RUSSIA THREATEN TO TRIGGER THE MACHINE AND CAUSE GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR INDEPENDENTLY FROM ACCIDENTAL LAUNCH DUE TO HIGH ALERT<br />

An extreme fantasy now<br />

INDEPENDENTLY, THE W-88 IS A UNIQUE THREAT TO CRISIS STABILITY—IT CAUSES FIRST STRIKES AND GUARANTEES THAT WAR IMMEDIATELY ESCALATES<br />
