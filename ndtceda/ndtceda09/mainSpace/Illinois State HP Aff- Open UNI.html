Orientalism FL<br />
Your attempt to “preserve a culture” deploys identity categories that dehumanize the people of that culture.<br />
Vargas, Llosa 2001<br />
(Mario, “The Culture of Liberty: liberating influence of globalization” Foreign Policy (January 2001) :66 InfoTracOneFile) KZ<br />
The notion of “cultural identity…of their own invention<br />
<br />
The negative representation of women conflates Gender with sex, they assume all females are women and all males as men, this kind of totalization goes on a global search to define all females as inherently feminine creating a heterosexist matrix with gender binaries.<br />
Butler, 1990<br />
(Judith, “Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity” 1990 3rd edition, Chapter 1 Subjects of sex/gender/desire P.2.9 Jude is Maxine Elliot Professor in the Dpt of Rhetoric and Comparative Lit at Cal Berkley)<br />
For the most part, feminists…as a female one.<br />

Illinois State 1AC<br />
<br />
1. Contention 1- inherency<br />
U.S. forward deploys two hundred tactical nuclear weapons from Europe- but several recen pullouts gut link uniqueness.<br />
Pugwash Conference 09, “ Nuclear Weapons in Europe: Time for Disarmament?”,<br />
-- the total number of US tactical… warheads assigned to them<br />
2. And total pullout is inevitable- only question is when<br />
Larsen 06, “The Future of US Non- Strategic Nuclear Weapons and Implications for NATO”,<br />
-- in general however Europeans… a political decision that will end<br />
3. and current trends indicate withdrawl will occur by 2020.<br />
Larsen 06, “The Future of US Non- Strategic Nuclear Weapons and Implications for NATO”<br />
Without such a decision…. Is now foreseeable<br />
4. Contention 2:<br />
the npt is about the collapse by the 2010 conference unless the U.S. ends nucleal sharing.<br />
Avery 09, John, “The Way Is Open for a Nuclear Weapon-Free Northern Europe”<br />
-- the strongest argument for… but NWFZs are steps along the road<br />
<br />
<br />
5. The NPT is vital at stemming proliferation- it reshapes domestic politics of nuclear decision making forcing it to be a disadvantageous pursuit.<br />
Walsh 05, jim, “Lesson’s from Success: The NPT and the future of Non- Proliferation.”<br />
-- the power of the NPT… centre of gravity had shifted.<br />
6. Impact is 30 secenios for rapid horizontal prolif<br />
AP 06, U.N. IDs 30 Nations with nuke potential”<br />
-- the head of the UN nuclear agency… their programs for arms<br />
7. Rapid Prolif sparks nuclear war<br />
Stares 7, paul, “to ban the bomb, sign the peace”<br />
-- of all the crises facing…. Leading to nuclear war<br />
<br />
8. and unilateral US actions are vital on global proliferation- we shape the perception of disarm.<br />
Wulf 08, Norman A. Wolf, Addressing the Challenges Facing NPT, June 16,2008.<br />
I think we are at the point where countries….we see many other countries joining in the race .<br />
9. withdrawl allows political spillover at NPT conference causing global incentive to fulfill commitments.<br />
Beautty et all 06, Beatty, blank, domina…, “Advancing disarmament: Canada and North Atlantic Treaty Organiztion Nuclear Policy” Fall 06<br />
-- American nuclear weapons in Europe undermine… potential nuclear weapons if it not seen as acting with double standards.<br />
10. Plan text: The USFG should remove its tactical nuclear warheads from Europe.<br />
<br />
11. Iranian Dialouge:<br />
Upcoming talks with iran are at a tipping poin- Obama will be forced to drop diplomacy if prospects don’t improve by the end of September.<br />
-- in its latest offer for talks…. There are others that might miss out on the hors d’ oeuvres<br />
12. Lack of any tangible progress will make Israel strike- conflict is inevitable unless we act now.<br />
Benhorin 8/31, Yitzhak Benhorin, “Wall Street Journal: Israel attack Iran” Ynetnews.com<br />
-- The United States must curb the Iranian… the consequences of Israel acting in its own defense.<br />
13. Israeli air strike sparks middle eastern war. Additionally tougher sanctions triggers middle eastern escalation.<br />
Afrasiabi 9/4, Kaveh Afrasiabi, “US faces a tough choice on Iran” Asia Times Online.<br />
-- This is the nub of the problem… and beyond as payback for the pain inflicted.<br />
14. This causes global nuclear war<br />
John Steinbach 02, “Israeli Weapons of Mass Destruction: A Threat to Peace” Center for Research on Globalization<br />
-- meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal… conflict could trigger a world conflagration<br />
15. Turkey can act as a mediator between Iran and the US- unique position could allow for better relations and further dialogue.<br />
Thai Press Reports 09, “Turkey/ Iran/ United States Turkey Would Consider Mediating Between Iran, US” L/N<br />
-- turkey would consider serving as mediator… Iranian officials during his current visit.<br />
16. Sadly Turkey’s nuclear sharing destroy it’s ability to be diplomatic mediator- withdrawal strengthens is legitimacy soecifically in nuclear issues<br />
Almond and Ingram 09, “Politics arounf US tactical nuclear weapons in European host states”<br />
-- turkey’s location has added an element… would receive overwhelming public support<br />
17. Prolif causes ext<br />
Utgoff 02, “Proliferation, Missle Defense, and American Ambitions”<br />
-- first the dynamics of getting… cities or even whole nations<br />
18. more importantly nuclear sharinf with turkey serves as Iranin self- justification on nuclear progress as well as inhibit Turkish input<br />
Kibaroglu 05, Dec. 2005 Eurpoean Security Vol. 14 No.4 443-457<br />
-- however the tide is turning…. May do so as well.<br />

 <br />
Case outweighs, turkey has a 2 week time frame<br />
<br />
1. Perm: Do the plan and consult – not intrinsic – we garner no advatages off what is consulted and if neg can’t garner specific reasons it has to be the plan – prefer the perm. <br />
<br />
2. Japan wil say no – perceived as killing extended deterrence and leverage in negotiations. <br />
Jimbo 09<br />
(Ken Kimbo, “Japanese perceptions of Obama’s nuclear ‘twin commitments’”, March 5, japantimes.com) <br />
“Japanese strategic-military specialist … Japan without fearing retaliatory forces.” <br />
<br />
3. Perm do both: double bind<br />
a. says yes and won’t car if we do the plan OR<br />
b. There’s a possibility that Japan says no and CP can’t solve case. 1AC is a DA. <br />
<br />
4. Theoretically legit<br />
a. not intrinsic- this is world they defend if they say yes <br />
b. CP is inherently conditional – they get both worlds of yes or no. <br />
<br />
5. Counter interpretations<br />
A. Resolved means to express by rolution and vote – this is the only definition that in the context of the resolution<br />
Webster's 98<br />
B. Should is used to express probability or expectation<br />
Webster’s II 84<br />

Klingner ‘08<br />
(Bruce, October 9, The Heritage Foundation, “Forging a New Era in the U.S.-Japan Alliance”)<br />
“It is unlikely that there … dominated by an ascendant China.” <br />

8. Alliance with South Korea will fill the Vacuum <br />
Klingner ‘08<br />
(Bruce, October 9, The Heritage Foundation, “Forging a New Era in the U.S.-Japan Alliance”)<br />
“Japanese inertia, coupled with a new … reliable allies, such as South Korea.” <br />
<br />
9. Obama already committed to frequently consultation with Japan.<br />
Crowell 09<br />
(Todd, Aug 11, “Japan’s Schizophrenia Toward Nuclear Weapons”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.realclearworld.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.realclearworld.com</a>)<br />
“In July Kurt Campbell and … a kind of nuclear umbrella forum.” <br />

“To be sure, Fox seems… the final arbiter of our planet’s fate.” <br />

Heidegger’s Alt is based on dogmatic authoritarianism that can never lead to positive change.<br />
Thiele 03<br />

Transparency CP: <br />
Politics is not a net benefit to CP<br />
Generals care more about TNWs then Transparency<br />
Independent nuclear war scenario, only net benefit in the round<br />

German DA: <br />
TNW kills relations, link turns the NATO impact<br />
Terrorism supercharges the impact of NATO breakdown<br />
