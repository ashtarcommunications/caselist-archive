B. Budget cuts have yet to deter DARPA’s proposal to develop self-aware megatanks<br />

Pentagon boffinry chiefs have announced... in the entire US federal government.<br />
<br />
C. Historically, when developing non-nuclear strategy the US looks to DARPA to develop new waves of tanks equipped with other WMDs<br />

<br />
A. The picture perfect world the 1AC longs for expresses hatred for the only world we’ve got. The 1AC is only an act of creative impotence – our relationship to life is the only way to escape <em>ressentiment.</em><br />
Aydan <strong>Turanli 2003</strong> (“Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World”; The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 26 (2003) 55-63) projectMUSE<br />
The craving for absolutely general...transcendental world is the &quot;denaturalized world&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Suffering is inevitable. Even if the plan is good, its effect on the world will only be brief and fleeting. Case can’t solve.<br />
<strong>Kain 2007</strong> (Philip J. [Professor of Philosophy @ Santa Clara University] <em>Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the Horror of Existence;</em> The Nietzsche Journal) projectMUSE<br />
Knowledge of the horror of existence...it can only be concealed.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. THUS THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO EMBRACE SUFFERING. This is the only way to break free from the psychological stranglehold suffering has on life and to affirm life as it is – for both its beauty and its tragedy.<br />
<strong>Kain 2007</strong> (Philip J. [Professor of Philosophy @ Santa Clara University] <em>Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the Horror of Existence;</em> The Nietzsche Journal) projectMUSE<br />
Eternal recurrence, the fatedness of ...gain greater strength through such suffering.<br />
<br />
<br />
D. The alt is crucial in stopping the spread of <em>ressentiment</em>. This impact outweighs since it’s at the root of political violence.<br />

<u>REPS K</u><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">() Aff (re)inscribes Cold War ideological representations of danger that cement dominant political orders and fortify the ‘American’ identity by creating other, external threats located in the anarchy that exists beyond the container of our politics – that container is sovereign territory. Aff papers over the world by claiming to ‘know’ about all those threats – that prevents us from realizing that the world does not conform to our representations of it.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
David Campbell, 1998, prof of cultural and political geography @ Durham U, Writing Security (Revised Edition), p 6-9, 18-19<br />
“To suggest as much, however, is not to argue in terms …more slack and more indeterminacy than we might at first appreciate.”<br />
<br />
( </span>) Apocalyptic scenarios are the perfection of biopolitics – reducing us to passive subjects in the service of state violence.<br />
<br />
Peter Coviello, 1999, assist prof of English @ Bowdoin College, Queer Frontiers, ed b Joseph Allen Boone, p. 40-41<br />
“Perhaps. But to claim that American culture is at present decisively … seems a civic initiative that can scarcely be done without.”<br />
<br />
() This production of the population as subjects of biopower is what enables all modern warfare, genocide, and nuclear destruction.<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br />
Michel Foucault, 1978, History of Sexuality Vol. 1, trans b Robert Hurly, p 136-137<br />
“Since the classical age the West has undergone a very profound transformation … the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of population.”<br />
<br />
( </span>) VOTE NEG to reject aff’s calls to constitute our identity around representations of danger.<br />
We should realize that we are always already situated in dangerous relationships – instead of confining our politics to sovereign attempts to manage the world’s dangers we should change the American identity itself by starting with the representations we employ.<br />
<br />
David Campbell, 1998, prof of cultural and political geography @ Durham U, Writing Security (Revised Edition), p 197-199<br />
“These reflections demonstrate how many of the themes developed here … security that emerges from the retheorization of identity.”<br />
<br />
(<u>) Our representations are more fundamental to policymaking than even the decisions made by policy-makers themselves – this is because our representations constitute the social reality that policymaking takes place in.<br />
<br />
Roxanne Lyn Doty, 1993, prof @ ASU, “Foreign Policy as Social Construction: A Post-Positivist Analysis of US Counterinsurgency Policy in the Philippines,” International Studies Quarterly 37, p JSTOR<br />
“This kind of approach addresses the how-question discussed earlier because ….as well as statements made in society more generally.”<br />

<strong></u>Russia Reps K__</strong><br />
</span><br />
<strong>Reps of Russia either present it as absolutely other or as a country that could easily become Westernized—both of these views are inadequate and perpetuate problematic assumptions about relations between Russia and the West</strong>  <br />
Broda 2k2 (Marian, “Russia and the West: The Root of the Problem of Mutual Understanding,” Studies in East European Thought; Mar2002, Vol. 54 Issue 1/2, p7-24)<br />
<br />
“The question of Russia’s mental and cultural entanglements is no less evident …inacessible to empirical confirmation and verification.” <br />
<br />
<strong>Western images of Russia as naïve or wild affect Russian existence and create a self-fulfilling prophecy—this turns case</strong><br />
Zinik 2k4 (Zinovy, “The Neighbour’s Fence: On Russian Self-Alienation,” 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sakharov-museum.ru/museum/exhibitionhall/religion_notabene/zzinik2004.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sakharov-museum.ru/museum/exhibitionhall/religion_notabene/zzinik2004.htm</a>)<br />
“The Western image of Russia - Russia as seen under Western eyes … own ugliness in anticipation of our revulsion.” <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Vote neg to reject universalizing, Eurocentric discourses that reify static understandings of Russia</strong><br />
Broda 2k2 (Marian, “Russia and the West: The Root of the Problem of Mutual Understanding,” Studies in East European Thought; Mar2002, Vol. 54 Issue 1/2, p7-24)<br />
“What is more, they are treated not as independent but as de facto …which are characterized by universalist intentions and a recalcitrant eurocentrism.”
