Contention 1: The Atomic Body Politic<br />
<br />
The Sacred and The Holy are two distinct ways of orienting ourselves towards Others. While the Sacred embodies a view of innate superiority that perceives others with mistrust and disdain, the Holy strives to nonviolently actualize human dignity and respect in place of inhospitable relationships. Politics then, is merely a universe of relationships, and choices and decisions, a way of organizing our position in that universe.<br />
Fasching and deChant 2001<br />
Darell and Dell, professor and director of undergraduate studies in the department of religious studies at the University of South Florida, Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, p. 10<br />
<br />
These ideologies manifest in explicitly different ways. The Sacred takes the form of an apologetic theology, which acts out of mistrust and precipitates escalation and violence. The Holy is an alienated theology, which acts out of hope and compassion, and in so doing, de-centers the self. Questioning subjectivity lays hope for stable relationships built out of hospitality.<br />
Fasching 1993<br />
Darrell, professor of religious studies at the University of South Florida, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, p. 2-6<br />
<br />
Nuclear deterrence embodies the Sacred. The mere possession of nuclear weapons is deeply violent; it denotes a conditional willingness to slaughter masses of innocent civilians. The ultimate paradox is that in attempting to assert control, nuclear politics deprives us of control over all the beautiful features of principled living. It is preferable to take a moral stance than to subscribe to violent axioms.<br />
Dummett 1986<br />
Michael, professor of Logic at Oxford University, Nuclear Weapons, Deterrence, and Disarmament, ed. Copp, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Supplementary Volume 12<br />
<br />
More important than physical deployment of weapons, nuclear posturing is deeply wrapped up in a genocidal, institutional ideology which treats life as disposable.<br />
Lifton and Markuson 1990<br />
Robert, professor of psychiatry and psychology at the Graduate School University Center, Erik, Professor at South State University, p. 3<br />
<br />
This is a form of hostage holding. Willingness to exchange innocent life en masse for compliance with our political goals is deeply immoral. Any decision calculus which treats individuals as a means to an end must be rejected.<br />
Lee 1993<br />
Steven, Philosophy at Hobart and William Smith College, Morality, Prudence, and Nuclear Weapons, p. 45<br />
<br />
Strategizing around the necessity of instruments of genocide in this way infinitely sidelines morality for fear mongering and killing to heal. Psychic numbing, the idea that we repress anxiety in relation to the bomb, is a dangerous tool that allows us to engage in deeply violent acts without reservation.<br />
Fasching 1993<br />
Darrell, professor of religious studies at the University of South Florida, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, p. 115-120<br />
<br />
This debate is not about determining whether or not nuclear weapons are useful. Rather, it is about activating ourselves in a struggle for something true and sincere. Rejecting the false choices of technocratic thinking is the essential leap of faith for resisting psychological devastation.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, psychotherapist and activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 155-156<br />
<br />
THE PLAN –<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ABOLISH THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NUCLEAR ARSENAL.<br />
<br />
Contention 2: The Blueprint<br />
<br />
Voting aff is more than a call to quantitatively reduce warheads. It embodies a refusal to submit ourselves to the violence of nuclear reasoning, and a willingness to take a nonviolent leap of faith in the face of recurring paranoia. Disarmament rejects the violence of the Sacred and inscribes ethics in the violent space of international politics.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, Psychotherapist and Activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 201-208<br />
<br />
Finally, personal responsibility is central to the debate over nuclear deterrence. As a strategy, deterrence is underwritten by public opinion, and as citizens in a representative democracy, we have rendered ourselves either politically impotent or acquiescent. Refusing the precept that murder of millions can ever be justified is the essential criteria for ethical decision making.<br />
Patten 1986<br />
Steven, professor of philosophy at the University of Lethbridge, Nuclear Weapons, Deterrence, and Disarmament, ed. Copp, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Supplementary Volume 12<br />

<strong>AFF as of KY</strong><br />
<br />
Contention 1 is Hostage Holding.<br />
<br />
The mere possession of nuclear weapons is violent because it holds masses of innocent civilians hostage to a conditional threat of nuclear annihilation. As a decision maker, you must reject policies which subordinate ethics to risk aversion, or else moral living ceases to be an option. Appeal to consequences cannot excuse unethical choices because that expresses an unconditional acceptance of a world of violence, in which we must take risks with the lives of innocents.<br />
Dummett 1986<br />
Michael, professor of Logic at Oxford University, Nuclear Weapons, Deterrence, and Disarmament, ed. Copp, Canadian Journal of Philosophy, Supplementary Volume 12<br />
As we have seen, … do with nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Nuclear speculation is ultimately enlightened guessing which serves to nihilistically reinforce the status quo. The idea that a disadvantage has absolute probability if it is not answered directly is preposterous because our contention is that the entire enterprise of guessing should not be used to undermine ethical decision making.<br />
Cohen, Professor Philosophy at U Maryland, 1987<br />
Avner, Review: Lackey on Nuclear Deterrence: A Public Policy Critique or Applied Ethics Analysis?, Vol. 97, No. 2 (Jan., 1987), pp. 457-472<br />
To give risk a more concrete appearance, …of nuclear deterrence?<br />
<br />
This value proposition extends across all decision making. Any calculus which treats individuals as a means to an end must be rejected because it imposes harm on innocents.<br />
Lee 1993<br />
Steven, Philosophy at Hobart and William Smith College, Morality, Prudence, and Nuclear Weapons, p. 45<br />
Hostage holding is morally …be morally acceptable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuclear possession implicates all life. Even if outside the direct thinking of everyday life, our way of being is inherently structured by belief in the necessity of withholding nuclear violence as legitimate recourse. Striving to reclaim ethical orientation must always be a prior consideration to the evaluation of policy outcomes.<br />
Tucker, Professor of Politics Princeton, 1985<br />
Robert, Ethics, Vol. 95, No. 3, Special Issue: Symposium on Ethics and Nuclear Deterrence (Apr., 1985)<br />
We live in the age of deterrence. … they have to run the terrible risk of attacking us?<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate the United States federal government’s nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
<br />
Contention 2 is Nonviolent Decision Making.<br />
<br />
Choices must ultimately involve more than dogmatic adherence to continuity of life. Nuclear war has already imposed an understanding of technocracy that has compromised the values that make life worth living. Only refusal can reinvigorate decision making.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, psychotherapist and activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 155-156<br />
If this is the value of the facts… rescuing reason from the clutches of the technocratic state.<br />
<br />
Expressing ourselves authentically involves embracing risk and suffering. Nonviolent suffering is not an end to be avoided, but rather a possibility which must be embraced. Paranoia is a life negating force, and only reconciling ourselves with these feelings of insecurity can reclaim meaning from the depths of nuclear deterrence.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, psychotherapist and activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 158-162<br />
Nonviolent detachment is … fearlessness and hope.<br />
<br />
Unilateral nuclear disarmament is the critical refusal to subscribe to violent decision making which is crucial to reorient politics towards nonviolence.<br />
Kovel 1984<br />
Joel, Psychotherapist and Activist, Against the State of Nuclear Terror, p. 201-208<br />
Fresh heights of irrationality … line of a nuclear assault.<br />
<br />
Continuing to appeal to the necessity to violate the integrity of innocent life plays into the hands of a security strategy which can only reproduce unending examples of genocidal violence.<br />
Holt, BBC Commentator, 1995<br />
Jim, Morality, Reduced to Arithmetic, New York Times<br />
Can the deliberate massacre … and morality to arithmetic.<br />
<br />
Whatever decision calculus we choose must be absolute. Any expression of willingness to sacrifice innocent life for some ulterior end plays into the self-serving hands of those in power and legitimizes a might makes right mentality which ends in genocidal violence.<br />
