<br />
<strong>Observation One</strong> is The Blaming of Others:<br />
<br />
America’s current policy is to use nuclear weapons against other nations when a non-state actor obtains nuclear material to use for an attack, whether inadvertently or not<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />
Michael </span></strong><strong>Levi</strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">, September </span></strong><strong>2008</strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-weight: normal;">(Deterring State Sponsorship of Nuclear Terrorism, CFR, Special Report No. 39 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/17171/deterring_state_sponsorship_of_nuclear_terrorism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/17171/deterring_state_sponsorship_of_nuclear_terrorism.html</a>)</span></strong><br />
That debate took center stage AND <u><strong>might resort to a nuclear response.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
This is unfortunate since it is not a question of if but when a non-state actor will use nuclear materials against the US.<br />
<strong>Allison,</strong> <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">20</span></strong><strong>07</strong> <strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><u><span style="font-weight: normal;">(</span></u></span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal;">Graham T., director of Harvard’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, “How Likely is a Nuclear Terrorist Attack on the United States?,” Council on Foreign Relations, April 16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/13097/how_likely_is_a_nuclear_terrorist_attack_on_the_united_states.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/13097/how_likely_is_a_nuclear_terrorist_attack_on_the_united_states.html</a></span></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> )<br />
I also agree. This debate asks how AND drop the bomb, untested, on Hiroshima.</span><br />
<br />
Fortunately, nuclear attacks by non-state actors by themselves will not end civilization<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><br />

<u><strong>Without venturing into the absurd</strong></u> AND <u><strong>the bombing of another major city.</strong></u><br />
<br />
However, America’s response to such an attack would be morally reprehensible and create wide-spread nuclear conflict while inspiring increased violence from non-state actors.<br />
<strong>Beljac</strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> 20</span></strong><strong>08</strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (Marko, PhD at Monash University, Teaches at LaTrobe University and the University of Melbourne, &quot;The nuclear terror of Bush 'negligence policy&quot;, June 16th, Eureka Street, Vo 18 No 12, </span></strong><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=75850" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=75850</a> )<br />
It was not widely reported AND there is in military posturing.<br />
<br />
Additionally, if pressured to respond to a non-state nuclear attack with nuclear weapons, global conflict and escalation is guaranteed<br />

<u><strong>Accordingly, there is</strong></u> AND <u><strong>escalate to the use of nuclear weapons.</strong></u><br />
<br />
Ultimately, the mere maintenance of a negligence doctrine makes the possibility of a large scale non-state nuclear attack more likely<br />

<u><strong>One disturbing option</strong></u> AND <u><strong>radicalise, the entire Islamic world.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
Therefore we propose the following plan,<br />
RESOLVED: President Barack Obama should issue a Presidential Directive repudiating and banning all policies authorizing the use of nuclear weapons against a government for inadvertently releasing nuclear material that is later used in an attack against the United States or its allies.<br />
