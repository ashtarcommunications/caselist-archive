 HIROSHIMA<span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />

<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">That comes from the testimony of a Hiroshima witness named Matsuda. It is excerpted from a book that tells the story of a man who refused to stop talking about Hiroshima. Matsuda’s story reflects his rage as he slowly died over decades from the after-effects of Hiroshima. The powerful rage of his memory continues to haunt his audiences, provoking powerful reflections on life and death, war and peace.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />

</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">The affirmative is determined to plunge into a future of peace and prosperity, a world that has no room for the dead victims upon which it is built. But the dead are still with us as long as we can tell their stories. While Matsumi died decades ago, we hoped that remembering his story allowed a brief a moment of ethical identification—vote neg to embrace symathy with the dead.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />

<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">Before you decide to vote for a policy, you must first make an ethical decision about what sort of judge you want to be. In this debate, we ask you to set aside a policy-making role and use your ballot to acknowledge unconditional responsibility to the ethical call of history in Mitsuda’s story.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />

</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">We understand the desire of the Affirmative and their enjoyment of the adversarial form of debate as it has been practiced historically.

</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Georgia;">Our criticism is one of form. It appears that the Affirmative conceives of debate as adversarial but we offer a view of debate and argument as one of lovers engaged in constructive argument that we feel would be nice.</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />

 <span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">A. The affirmative makes a call for the reduction of nuclear weapons, but stops short of recognizing the need for total disarm. This betrays their true intentions, which is centered around a desire to maintain the ability to annihilate the “enemy.” The affirmative is</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />
</span><span style="font-family: Georgia;">nothing but a confession to purge themselves of guilt and apply a soothing salve to the cognitive dissonance they feel. This psychological compensation only replicates the dangers of nuclear weapons and makes the situation worse, turning the case.
