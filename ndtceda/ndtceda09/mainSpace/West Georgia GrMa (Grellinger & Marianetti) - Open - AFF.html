<strong>No Low - Vulnerability</strong><br />
Launch on warning is rooted in the cold war logic and system of hyper deterrence, which is designed to force the President to launch on warning due to the immediacy and certainty of enemy threat. Real control is illusory.<br />

 Launch on Warning is the ultimate attempt to be invulnerable because it is the culmination of military planners fixation on the remote specter of a deliberate nuclear surprise attack, thus, each country strives to ensure a powerful counter attack or preemptive retaliation which creates a negative cycle of perpetual escalation.<br />
