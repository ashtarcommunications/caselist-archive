CONTENTION ONE – THE NUCLEAR FAMILY <br />
<br />
UNDER THE GUISE OF PARENTAL OBLIGATION, AMERICAN NUCLEAR POLICY HAS TAKEN A PARTICULARLY INCESTUOUS TURN. DECADES OF URANIUM MINING AND RADIATION TESTING HAVE VIOLATED MILLIONS WHO PLACE THEIR TRUST IN THE NUCLEAR FATHER FOR PROTECTION. JUST LIKE EXPERIENCES DESCRIBED BY VICTIMS OF INCEST, DEVOTION TO THE BOMB AND ITS POLICIES FORCE THE SELF TO SPLIT FROM THE BODY, WARPING AND PERVERTING IDEAS LIKE SURVIVAL, TRUST AND FAMILY TO MAKE DAILY VIOLENCE AND PENETRATION NOT ONLY PSYCHOLOGICALLY PALATABLE BUT THE EXPECTED NORM. <br />
CAPUTI, 1994<br />

<br />
<br />
NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE PSYCHOLOGICALLY ROOTED IN THE SEPARATION BETWEEN “SPIRIT” AND “BODY” REQUIRING THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DUAL SELF THAT SEPARATES AND SUPPRESSES EMOTIVE, EMBODIED FORMS OF KNOWING. THIS DUALISM CREATES AN INTERNAL SENSE OF SELF HATRED AND A DESIRE FOR TOTAL ANNIHILATION TO ESCAPE THE FLESH OF THIS WORLD. <br />

<br />
<br />
NUCLEAR POLICY IS MAINTAINED THROUGH A STRICT SEPARATION BETWEEN THE EMOTIVE AND THE RATIONAL, THE ABSTRACT AND THE EMBODIED. THIS SEPARATION ENABLES NUMBING POLICY CONSTRUCTION THAT MAKES THE ILLUSORY DREAM OF DETERRENCE STILL DESIRABLE IN THE FACE OF THE INCALCULABLE CONSEQUENCES OF NUCLEAR POLICY ON THE MILLIONS OF “DOWNWINDERS,” INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS, AND MILITARY PERSONNEL INTENTIONALLY IRRADIATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL. <br />

MERE SURVIVAL IS INSUFFICIENT IN THE FACE OF ONGOING NUCLEAR WAR. DEATH IS INEVITABLE BUT AFFIRMING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FACE OF ANNIHILATION IS A LIFE AFFIRMING ACT NECESSARY FOR INDIVIDUAL VALUE TO EMERGE. <br />

CONTENTION TWO – PEACE AS PRACTICE<br />
<br />
UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT IS A NECESSARY BREAK WITH THE HOPELESSNESS THAT SURROUNDS ARMS CONTROL THOUGH AN AFFIRMATION OF PEACE AS PRACTICE THAT WILL REVERBERATE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM. BY BREAKING THE ATOMIC SWORD, VOTING AFFIRMATIVE DOES NOT ONLY EMBRACE A NEW POLICY BUT A NEW POLITICAL NARRATIVE OF HOPE BASED ON CONNECTION AND NATALITY RATHER THAN THE INCESTUOUS NARRATIVE OF SEPARATION AND DEATH. <br />
ELSHTAIN, FEBRUARY 1985<br />
Jean Bethke, Reflections on War and Political Discourse: Realism, Just War, and Feminism in a Nuclear Age, Political Theory, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Feb., 1985), pp. 39-57<br />
Evidence of <span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">hopelessness is all around AND possibilities that lie within our reach</span>. <br />
<br />
<br />
THE QUEST FOR PEACE IS A QUESTION OF PRACTICE. THE PROBLEM WITH NUCLEAR POLICY IS IT ATTEMPTS TO PRESCRIBE THE CONTENT OF THE FUTURE BY RESTRICTING HUMAN NATURE TO A SELECT FORM OF VIOLENT RELATIONS. THESE PREDICTIONS PROCEED FROM A STATE OF HOPELESSNESS THAT MAKES SURVIVAL IMPOSSIBLE AND NUCLEAR VIOLENCE INEVITABLE. INSTEAD, OUR REJECTION OF NUCLEARISM IS EMBODIED IN AN OPEN HOPE FOR THE FUTURE WHICH DOES NOT SEEK TO PRESCRIBE ITS CONTENT BUT RATHER RECOGNIZES THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS SURROUNDING NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR CLOSE THE POSSIBILITY OF HOPE. <br />
NOYALIS, 1989<br />

 1AC – Advantage 1<br />
<br />
Contention One: The Western Way of Life<br />
<br />
1. Status quo declaratory policy is still locked in the Reagan Administration’s desire to achieve unassailability – the Nuclear Posture Review is the epitome of the United States’ attempt to lock in its status as the shining city on a hill through its coercion of “rogue” states into succumbing to the United States security agenda through threats of nuclear first strike<br />
Huntley 4 (Wade, Program Director at the Simons Centre for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Research in the Liu Institute for Global Studies at the University of British Columbia, “Unthinking the Unthinkable: U.S. Nuclear Policy and Asymmetric Threats,” Strategic Insights, Volume II, Issue 2, February)<br />
The NPR portrays this shift as AND <span style="-moz-background-clip: border; -moz-background-inline-policy: continuous; -moz-background-origin: padding; background: aqua none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">the security threats America already faces</span>.<br />
<br />
2. Holding on to nuclear first use ensures the United States will use its nuclear weapons and the threat of their use as a means of preserving the so-called “Western Way of Life,” ignoring the millions of people abroad that would die as a result of our nuclear brinkmanship<br />
