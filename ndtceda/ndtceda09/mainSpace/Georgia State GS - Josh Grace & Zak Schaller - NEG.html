 1. Agonisma nd gander are an integral feature of the human confition we try to cover over thr rough edges of the world by describing crises in terms of specific problems that can be contained by the sovereign ego. Their understanding only reinforces a self-serving cycle of violence<br />

Conventions of security act to suppress rather than confront the fears endemic to life,…paradox—all that makes a free life worthwhile.<br />
2. their view of nuclear accidents is full of contempt for life which asts humanity as a pitiful dwarf under the threat of the accident.<br />
Seung 6 (geothe, nietzche, and wahner: their spinozan epics of love and power”)<br />
(not beginning of paragraph) May be fully conscious of the desires and beliefs that accompany…it is this pitiful piucture of human beings that will provoke Zarathustra’s greatest disgust with the small man in “The Convalascent” of Part III.<br />
3. Their framing of the Russian threat is part and parcel of a conservative logic meant to make individuals surrender pre-political power.<br />

Now this is bullshit,…to feel authority and information.<br />

“Access Denied K”<br />
No reason to vote AFF – they don’t have their hands on the nuclear levers of power.<br />

(Michael. Review of “people of the bomb: portraits of America’s nuclear complex by Hugh Gusterson”)<br />
US nuclear dominance-as-defense<br />
AND academic echo chambers.<br />
<br />
The affirmative leaves the ultimate weapon in the hands of the ultimate apparatus instead of solving the problem they feed the very system that brought about the bomb in the first place and ensure our continued helplessness.<br />
Kovel 1983<br />
(Joel. Against the state of nuclear terror. South end press. Boston. P. 5-6)<br />
Who among us has not felt utter<br />
AND impervious and secretive.<br />
<br />
Our rhetorical performance shields us for responsibility for our own contributions to material pain and suffering.<br />
Kappeler 1995<br />
(Susanne. The Will to violence: the politics of personal behavior” p. 6-7 d3)<br />
Our unwillingness to recognize the will of those<br />
AND recourse to the status quo<br />
<br />
There is no alternative! This argument functions as a gateway issue: in order to win the debate, we don’t have to prove that their system of thought will be dismantled. All we have to do is win that they have no material connection to their AFF.<br />

“Tater Talk”<br />

Agonism and danger are an integral feature of the human condition. We try to cover over the rough edges of the world by describing crises in terms of specific problems that can be contained by the soverign ego. Their understanding only reinforces a self-serving cycle of violence.<br />
Der Derian 1998<br />

Life itself is essentially appropriation, injury<br />
AND all that makes a free life worthwhile<br />

NPT is founded upon a hatred of difference.<br />

The Non-Proliferation Treaty divided the countries<br />

It is not sufficient to define bureaucracy<br />

We outweigh: our understanding enables existence to be meaningful and allows us to enjoy our lives. Their tired old impacts are a form of blackmail meant to prevent us from thinking differently about the nuclear situation. Don’t be afraid to risk the Alt.<br />
Blanchot 1997<br />
(Maurice. “Friendship” google books)<br />
Life should not be preferred to the reasons for living.<br />
AND he is not worthy of survival.”<br />

Will to power outweighs extinction.<br />
Nietzsche, 1886<br />

Psychologists should bethink themselves before<br />

The will to power exists prior to the will to self preservation<br />

The affirmative obsession with solving ___ is a manifestation of their anxiety about death. Only questioning the nature of their engagement of IR can end the cycles of destruction.<br />
