<strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[TEAM] fails to analyze and critique the oppression of non-human beings based on their species. This is an active choice that is arbitrary and speiesist.

Cultural critics have painstakingly demonstrated the… property status of non-human animals.<br />
<br />
[TEAM]’s refusal to criticize, reflect, or even just mention the ongoing oppression of non-human animals is the ultimate form of complicity, perpetuating the speciesism and the logic used to justify all oppression.<br />
Williams 8 (Nancy, philosopher at Wofford College, “Affected Ignorance and Animal Suffering” Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics (2008) 21:371-384)<br />
Affected ignorance the phenomenon of people choosing… individuals to refrain from further moral inquiry.<br />
<br />
Speciesism constructs human/animal dichotomy. This dichotomy allows for systematic beastialization, the stripping of rights of an individual because he or she is not considerd ‘human’<br />
Rossini 6 – Maneula, postdoctoral Fellow at Amsterdam School for Cultural Analysis [“To the Dogs: Companion speciesism and the new feminist materialism,’ Kritikos Volume 3, September 2006, ISSN 1552-5112 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://intertheory.org/Rossini" rel="nofollow">http://intertheory.org/Rossini</a>]<br />
The desperate cry of the historical… disproportionate effects on animals.<br />

The alternative is to confront the speciesist metaphysic by critically reorienting ourselves towards existing structures in order to break speciesism down. Bringing non-uman animals into our discussion is a first step.<br />

Weaponization K<br />
Their criticism of the government’s possessions of nuclear weapons obfuscates the realities of the institutionalization of violence and ultimately crushes any hope for addressing the problem of war<br />

There are several ways in which elites can act… inadequate for eliminating the problem of war.<br />
<br />
Focus on elimination of nukes fails to address the structural foundations of war, making worse violence possible – we need an alternative paradigm to challenge the dominant structures<br />

If all the military weapons in the world… much more than nuclear disarmament.<br />

Focus on nuclear weapons relies on a flawed paradigm that creates a culture of close-mindedness, missing the true source of concern – this risks annhiliation fo the planet<br />
Schwartz and Derber 91 – William and Charles, Harvard Nuclear Study Group [<em>The Nuclear Seduction</em>, Introduction, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.escholarship.org/edition/view?docId=ft1n39n7wg&amp;shunk.id=d0e180&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id.=d0e180&amp;brand=ucpress" rel="nofollow">http://www.escholarship.org/edition/view?docId=ft1n39n7wg&amp;shunk.id=d0e180&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id.=d0e180&amp;brand=ucpress</a>] cn<br />
For many years a striking consensus has reigned… race as the solution.<br />

Some poepole argue that the goal of civilization… is not nuclear weapons, the problem is war.<br />

The alternative is to vote negative to reject the aff’s elite-centric weaponitis in favor of bottom-up social resistance<br />

A. Commandments of Debate<br />
Through the rhetoric of Purpose – dictates a list of commandments that debaters must not violate [ gives examples ] Such things are EVIL and must be expunged from this community. However, such order is tautological. Debaters and judges will adhere to the rules of Order within a given round versus [], but will then immediately violate those rules in the next round. This violation of order behooves a corresponding re-entrenchment of order by [] in the next round, which inevitably leads to more violations. Those who break the covenant must be punished so that they may be atoned for past and future transgressions. Only through voting against the other team can the judge send a ‘signal’ that we can all cleanse ourselves from the Original Sin of racism that burdens those who participate in this hegemonic institution of debate. </span><br />

1. The perm still does the 1AC – using their advantages as the basis for action still links to the K because they still attempt to secure ‘human’ rights<br />
