The primary question is whether these weapons are really the right tools … reduce doubt that the United States would actually use nuclear weapons.<br />

Unilateral commitment to disarmament is necessary for our Article 6 commitments – the status quo risks miscalculation or theft that causes extinction<br />

Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its intercontinental ballistic missile nuclear explosive devices that are based on land.<br />
<br />
First, ground-based missiles will become obsolete in a matter of years. Simply replicating the missiles decreases the reliability of the US nuclear deterrent – shift to a nuclear dyad is essential.<br />

It’s decision time. The United States has a small … will provide a sustainable strategy for the future.<br />

Additionally, vulnerability to a first strike drastically increases the incentive to launch on warning – exacerbating crisis instability<br />

Survivability is perhaps the critical element … false alarms or even an accidental launch.<br />

Deterrence doesn’t remedy this – one failure causes global war<br />

And even if they don’t, reductions change Russian and Chinese political decision-making – it alone decreases the threat of nuclear war and terrorism<br />
