 Advantage One is Space <br />
Popular space missions critical to protecting our space assets like Operationally Responsive Space have seen massive budget cuts<br />

Considering the benefits…. enhanced in the coming decades. <br />
<br />
Nuclear and space career trajectories compete, diluting the experience base for both – recent changes give priority to nuclear missions<br />

On the other side of the balance threat to the United States.<br />
<br />
Plan: <br />
The United States Federal Government should end its damage limitation mission toward Russian central nuclear systems and eliminate warhead modifications inconsistent with a curatorship approach. <br />

Solvency <br />
Despite rhetoric to the contrary, current US nuclear policy seeks a capable nuclear first strike against Russia – eliminating this mission solves cooperation and accidental wars<br />
