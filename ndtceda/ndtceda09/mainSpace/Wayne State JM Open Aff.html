Observation One – The current role of nuclear weapons in the US arsenal is to maintain a first-strike posture.<br />
<br />
Oelrich 2005 (Ivan, Director of the Strategic Security Program at the Federation of American Scientists <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/resource/01282005175922.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/resource/01282005175922.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The NPR thus foresees ... nuclear and conventional weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus We Present the Following Plan:<br />
               The United States Federal Government should adopt a no nuclear first use declaratory policy towards Non-Nuclear Weapon States, the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, India, and Pakistan.<br />
Advantage 1 = Prolif<br />
Negative security assurances will make or break the 2010 RevCon – retention of the first use option will collapse it and the NPT<br />

<br />
As a consequence of the emphasis ... states not having them.<br />
<br />
Disputes over first use during the conference cause rapid proliferation breakout<br />

<br />
Inability to agree by 2010 ...United States give its allies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Absent an unequivocal no-first-use declaration all other non-proliferation efforts will fail<br />

Nuclear terrorism will culminate in extinction<br />
Sid-Ahmed, ’04 (Mohamed, columnist for Egypt's respected Al-Ahram newspaper and one of the Egypt's top political analysts, “Extinction!” 8/26)<br />
<br />
A nuclear attack by terrorists ..., we will all be losers.<br />
<br />
Even if the attack fails, the US would kill millions in a nuclear retaliation<br />

<br />
Concerns about extended deterrence ... diplomatic and non-proliferation benefits.<br />
<br />
NFU doesn’t lead to rogue prolif – conventional deterrent solves<br />
Berry, ’09 (Ken, ICNND Research Coordinator “DRAFT TREATY ON NON-FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS” International Commission on Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament, June 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Berry_No_First_Use_Treaty.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Berry_No_First_Use_Treaty.pdf</a>)<br />

US NFU strengthens norms against acquisition, boosts diplomatic momentum towards nonproliferation efforts<br />

<br />
NFU could also affect US policy abroad... bear against Iran’s enrichment program.<br />

US NFU is modeled and spurs regional solutions to address the root causes of proliferation<br />

<br />
In these circumstances, the next logical step in the process of stigmatizing and .. force to suppress any attempted breakout.<br />
<br />
<br />
A US no-first-use pledge would be credible to other nations.<br />

The second objection is that no-first-... be significantly enhanced.<br />

Advantage 2: South Asia<br />

Now is the key time for doctrinal decision-making – Indian scientists and military officials are ratcheting up pressure for expanding first-use<br />

US first-use policy empowers hardline strategists to caveat India’s no-first-use doctrine – will amount to a complete roll back of minimum deterrence<br />

As a result of these rising tensions ..., a punitive war may well be too costly and its outcome unpredictable.<br />

Indian MIRVing creates a unique propensity for nuclear war – economic and climatic effects are global<br />
