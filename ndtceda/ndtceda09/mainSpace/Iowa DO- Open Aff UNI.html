 Plan: The United States Supreme Court should rule that international legal obligations prohibit the United States from targeting and using its nuclear arsenal against countervalue and critical infrastructure targets. Contention<br />
<br />
1: Countervalue Despite the attempts to rename our countervalue policy the targeting continues- this causes fights within STRATCOM because they recognize its illegal under the Laws of Armed Conflict Kristensen, 5’ (Hans M., The Role of U.S. Nuclear Weapons: New Doctrine Falls Short of Bush Pledge, September,armscontrol.org) The new nuclear doctrine’s deepening …. mentality that symbolized the Cold War.<br />
<br />
Countervalue is the crucial internal link to nuclear winter -- its the only way to generate enough smoke Starr, 9’ (Steven Starr, Bulletin of Atomic Scientists and Moscow Inst.

<br />
<strong>Number of nuclear weapons is irrelevant- the major question is targeting</strong> Robock, 9’ (Alan Robock , climatology prof @ Rutgers, 2009 , “Nuclear Winter,” Earth Portal, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.earthportal.org/?p=1481" rel="nofollow">http://www.earthportal.org/?p=1481</a> ) A nuclear explosion is like …. 2,000 weapons, 150 Tg of smoke could still be produced.<br />

<br />
<strong>. Extinction is categorically different from any other impact</strong><br />

<br />
Moral imperative to reject countervalue targetting Holt, 95’ (Jim, BBC Commentator, Morality, Reduced to Arithmetic, New York Times) Can the deliberate massacre of ….. innocents to instruments and morality to arithmetic.<br />

<strong>Contention Two: British Modeling The UK follows US targeting policies- this determines their stance on the Trident</strong> Greenpeace, 5' (October 5, 2005, Internal Pentagon document reveals new aggressive US nuclear weapons policy) That s ome commanders do not believe …. helped to eliminate over half the world's nuclear arsenals.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>The Trident is inherently a countervalue weapon- Britains unwillingness to apply the ICJ decision to its countervalue policies undermines its international law credibility</strong> Ainslie, 6' (John, October 19, studied nuclear strategy while a student of international relations at Keele University, after serving in the army he left as a conscientious objector, has carried out research into nuclear issues, particularly the British Trident system, and is employed as coordinator of the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, The Future of the British Bomb,) The continued possession of nuclear ….. narrow area about which the ICJ was unclear.<br />
<br />
<strong>Massive support for ditching the Trident now – this can swing the election</strong> Glover, 9' (Julian, 7-13-2009, “Voters want Britain to scrap all nuclear weapons,” Guardian, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/13/icm-poll-nuclear-weapons" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jul/13/icm-poll-nuclear-weapons</a> ) Voters w ant Britain to scrap nuclear …. second-lowest ICM score since June last year.

<strong>Cutting now key to salvage a Labour victory</strong> Austin, 9' (Mark Austin, 9-27-2009, “Brown toast,” UK Mirror, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/09/27/brown-toast-or-toasted-115875-21703230/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/09/27/brown-toast-or-toasted-115875-21703230/</a> ) There's probably no more than 200 …. electoral reform as areas where he could act .<br />

<br />
<strong>Contention Three: International Law – We have 2 internal links 1. International legal norms – The World Court has ruled that counter-value targeting is illegal under the laws of armed conflict.</strong> Schmitt, 99’ (Michael N., Dean and Professor of International Law, George C. Marshall Center, College of International and Security Studies, 1999 Yale Human Rights &amp; Development Law Journal , “The Principle of Discrimination in 21st Century Warfare,”) At the height of the Cold War , entire populations …. conflict and the law of war .<br />
<br />
<strong>The Supreme Court is obligated under customary international law to enforce this.</strong> Boyle, 97' (Francis A, professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law,J.D. magna cum laude and A.M. and Ph.D. degrees in political science from Harvard, 'The Criminality of Nuclear Deterrence') Thus, t he International Court of Justice …. the threat and use of nuclear weapons .<br />
<br />
<strong>The mere existence of countervalue targeting renders basic principles of customary international law impotent.</strong> McGrath, '85 (Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army, Winter, 107 Mil. L. Rev. 191) Countervalue nuclear weapons ….. policy of the United States is formulated. Continues Protocol I exemplifies a rational attempt by ….. weapons so that it can insure victory. Continues While countervalue nuclear weapons ….. a much more limited distance.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, legal justifications for countervalue targeting unravels the norms of international arms restrictions – this makes use of bioweapons inevitable</strong> Moxley, '2 (Attorney and author, Spring, 8 ILSA J Int'l &amp; Comp L 447) Rather than recognizing that ….. the point. Mutual assured destruction is a policy of terror.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bioweapon use causes extinction</strong> Ochs, 2’ Richard J Ochs, 6-9-2002, has published articles in the Baltimore Sun, Baltimore Chronicle, Science magazine and is past president of the Aberdeen Proving Ground Superfund Citizens Coalition, member of the Depleted Uranium Task force of the Military Toxics Project and a member of the Chemical Weapons Working Group, “Biological Weapons Must Be Abolished Immediately,” phttp:<em>www.freefromterror.net/other_articles/abolish.html Of all the w eapons of m ass d estruction, …. EXTINCTION IS NOW POSSIBLE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Probability of extinction is high</strong> Matheny, ‘6 (Jason, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics U. of Maryland &quot;Reducing the risk of human extinction,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/papers/extinction.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/papers/extinction.htm</a> ) Of current extinction risks, ….. have an exponential effect on a population (Warrick, 2006).<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Accountability – Nuclear deference is a key area of judicial deference. It risks counter-value strikes.</strong> Kellman ‘89 (Barry, law prof at DePaul U College of Law, 1989 Duke L.J. 1597, lexis) In this era of thermonuclear weapons …. in a particular case, are judicial questions .&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Only interpreting customary international law can hold the President accountable and avoid violations of international law through countervalue strikes.</strong> Brennan, ‘99 (Louisiana JD Candidate, Summer, 59 La. L. Rev. 1195) If customary international law is not U.S….explicitly preserved in the Constitution. Court decisions on nuclear weapons cause social mobilization and will solve even if it isn’t enforced. Jenkins, ‘82 (Philosophy Professor – Alabama, Nova Law Journal, pg. 132) The second of these issues concerns the …. the political process, and human rights in general.<br />
<br />
<strong>Disads are non-unique – the courts are turning away from total deference now</strong> Knowles, 9’ (Robert, Acting Assistant Professor, New York University School of Law, 41 Ariz. St. L.J. 87 American Hegemony and the Foreign Affairs Constitution) In the wake of 9/11, the United States …. , and other competences have become more important.<br />
<br />
<strong>However, further rulings which enforce international legal norms are essential to legitimize unipolarity</strong> Knowles, 9’ (Robert, Acting Assistant Professor, New York University School of Law, 41 Ariz. St. L.J. 87 American Hegemony and the Foreign Affairs Constitution) [*153] Nonetheless, since 9/11, deferentialists …. Geneva Conventions as applied to the detainees.<br />
<br />
<strong>The convergent nature of domestic and international law makes the court essential</strong> Knowles, 9’ (Robert, Acting Assistant Professor, New York University School of Law, 41 Ariz. St. L.J. 87 American Hegemony and the Foreign Affairs Constitution) International relations scholars are still struggling …. - unipolar, hegemonic, and imperial - described above.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, denying “military necessity” by conferring human rights on non-citizens is key</strong> Knowles, 9’ (Robert, Acting Assistant Professor, New York University School of Law, 41 Ariz. St. L.J. 87 American Hegemony and the Foreign Affairs Constitution) Finally, the enemy combatant cases are …. values reflect universal human rights . 449<br />
<br />
<strong>No disads – plan strikes a flexible balance between total deference and judicial activism. This is essential to sustain hegemony, which prevents WMD terror and great power war</strong> Knowles, 9’ (Robert, Acting Assistant Professor, New York University School of Law, 41 Ariz. St. L.J. 87 American Hegemony and the Foreign Affairs Constitution) First, the &quot;hybrid&quot; hegemonic model ….. government to &quot;speak in different voices &quot; at once.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, unipolarity prevents multiple scenarios for nuclear war</strong> Brooks ‘6 (Peter, senior fellow Natl Security Affairs, Heritage Foundation and MA in Gov Johns Hopkins, Heritage Commentary, “Why they need us: Imagine a world without America,” 7-4,<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed070406a.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritage.org/Press/Commentary/ed070406a.cfm</a> ) For all the worldwide whining and bellyaching …. going door to door, hawking his nuclear wares. Only court action sets a precedent for future use of customary international law. Kundmueller, 02 (JD Candidate – Notre Dame, 28 J. Legis. 359) This section of this Note , on the legal …. and political issues yet to be determined.<br />
<br />
<strong>An international legal system is inevitable – not incorporating international law only risks legal anarchy.</strong> Martinez, 03 (Assistant Professor, Stanford Law School, November, 56 Stan. L. Rev. 429) The fact is that judicial bodies around …. or can self-organization by courts make it work?<br />
<br />
<strong>Accepting customary international legal norms is key to solving multiple global issues that risk extinction.</strong> Charney, ‘93 (Late International Law Professor – NYU, 87 A.J.I.L. 529) The international community of the late …. regardless of the objection of a small number of states. Continues This newly evolving process further enables the …. be thwarted by the objections or actions of a few obstinate states.<br />
<br />
<strong>International law will influence the US inevitably but US leadership in upholding it is critical to its success.</strong> Spiro, 2K (Law Professor – Hofstra University, Nov/Dec , Foreign Affairs) For now, however, the New Sovereigntist grip over …. respect the rule of international law. Continues Meanwhile, the international community …. chains) with lost sales, which would in turn press the federal government to respect the test ban.<br />
<br />
<strong>The only alternative to international law is genocide and nuclear war</strong> Shaw, 1’ (Sussex International Relations Professor , Review of International Studies, 27, pp. 646-7) The new politics of international relations …. international relations and politics, are intertwined.</em><br />

It appears that the United States maintains its nuclear weapons in Europe primarily because it thinks its European allies want it to continue to do so. The European DCA states, on the other hand, remain committed to the nuclear mission largely because they think the United States expects them to do so, remaining reluctant partners in the DCA mission. There is no consensus on the need for nuclear weapons in the Alliance. Both sides are talking past one another—or more accurately, not talking... is now foreseeable.<br />
