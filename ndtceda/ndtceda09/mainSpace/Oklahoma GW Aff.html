 CP:<br />
Their criticism implies a proper speech code that enframes and depoliticizes debate<br />
Wendy Brown, 2001, <u>Politics out of History</u><br />
“Speech codes kill critique…a contingent effect of historically specific social powers.”<br />
<br />
Focus on language allows for underlying assumptions to remain hegemonic<br />
Gay 98 (William, “The practice of linguistic nonviolence,” <u>Peace Review</u> Vol. 10 Iss. 4)<br />
“Many times the first step…linguistic violence and physical violence”<br />
<br />
Reject their censorship and take pleasure in the pain supposedly caused by our objectionable language. This masochistic act is the only power available to you. Censoring the word freezes it as harmful forever, by mockingly reinvoking the word, you refuse its ability to harm you.<br />
Robert Tobin, 2000, “Masochism and Identity,” in <u>One Hundred Years of Masochism</u><br />
“Symonds’s act of speaking through…clinical treatment of masochism.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Boggs DA:<br />
Ontology is uniquely key in the context of nuclear weapons<br />
Santoni 1985 (Ronald “Nuclear War” <u>Philosophical Perspectives</u>)<br />
“In contrast, Zimmerman…process means the extinction of all life.”<br />

 The rhetoric of evil is the ultimate depoliticizing move that makes violence and war inevitable<br />
Bleiker 2003 (Roland, “Aestheticising terrorism: alternative approaches to 11 September,” <u>Australian Journal of Politics and History</u>: Vol. 49 No. 3 2003<br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">Nuclear weapons have changed warfare from an external event to an ever present condition of normality that occurs more so in the immaterial realm of mutually implicated threats of terror.</span></span><br />
Chow, 2k6 (Rey, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities and Professor of Modern Culture &amp; Media Studies, Comparative Literature, and English, The Age of the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative Work, Duke University Press, pg. 33-34)<br />
The dropping of the atomic bombs effected…. powers of visibility and control.<br />
<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The paradoxical logic of weapons produced never to be used allows warfare to take on a far more insidious form of immaterial violence in the form of reducing the world to a series of targets, enframing their existence such that they might only reveal themselves as objects to be destroyed. This guarantees complacency with all forms of structural violence absent the spectacular moment of nuclear annihilation itself.</span></span><br />
Chow, 2k6 (Rey, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of the Humanities and Professor of Modern Culture &amp; Media Studies, Comparative Literature, and English, The Age of the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative Work, Duke University Press, pg. 30-33)<br />

<br />
<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">The very act of mapping and knowing the other is INDISTINGUISHABLE from the material gesture of warfare, insofar as it depoliticizes all manifestations of violence as merely peaceful endeavors.</span></span><br />
