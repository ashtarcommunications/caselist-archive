NEW AFF:<br />
<br />
Contention One is the Anxiety of Nuclear Weapons <br />
The United States retains its nuclear arsenal for the purpose of preemption and deterrence – both policies operate are produced from anxiety about the unstable nature of the world. <br />
Massumi 07 (Brian, Communication Department of the Université de Montréal , “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”)  <br />
It is certain that there will AND achieve life-defining mutuality. <br />
<br />
Our president is a hypocrite. Despite his awe-inspiring rhetoric in Prague, the policies of the NPR echo the specter of psychosis as our nuclear cuts are characterized by their ability to effectively stop the villainous Iran and North Korea. Cuts are a disguise to justify anti-proliferation policies and it is psychosis which ensures any future cuts are replaced by more insidious weapons <br />
NYT 3/1 (White House Is Rethinking Nuclear Policy, By DAVID E. SANGER and THOM SHANKER; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/us/politics/01nuke.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/us/politics/01nuke.html</a>) <br />
As President Obama begins making final AND without resorting to a nuclear option. <br />
<br />
America suffers from psychosis. Eternally scarred by past policy failure, the U.S. constantly seeks a new enemy to target. Anxiety has manifested itself into violent outburst as a coping mechanism to maintain our insecurity. This makes nuclear war inevitable. <br />
Shapiro, critical international relations theorist and a professor of Political Science at the University of Hawaii. 1993. [Michael j. “That obscure object of violence: Logistic and Desire in the Gulf War” The political subject of violence p.126-130]  <br />
Within a Lacanian frame, the AND lacks a reflective rapport with itself. <br />
<br />
Plan The United States federal government should substantially reduce the nuclear arsenal of the United States. <br />
<br />
Contention Two is Psychoanalysis <br />
This is the discussion we need to be having. Modern policy analysis focuses on the costs and benefits of deterrence while papering over the importance of leaders emotional drives. The same anxiety which drove the development of nuclear weapons creates irrational leaders who ensure deterrence failure is inevitable. Only confronting humiliation and shame can lead to a stable nuclear world <br />
Steinberg 1991 (Blema S., PhD in Political Science; &quot;Shame and Humiliation in the Cuban Missile Crisis: A Psychoanalytic Perspective&quot;; JSTOR) <br />
Conventional wisdom on the subject of AND incapable of either predicting or explaining. <br />
<br />
When faced with the desire for war our answer is an ethic of shame. Shame allows us to find comfort in ourselves without the constant drive to shape and order the world. And so we should voice our shame – our shame for a president who promised peace but only brought war, and shame for ourselves for desiring that war.  <br />
Dean and Copjec, 2006 (Jodi Dean, college professor in political science with 2 kids and Joan Copjec, Department of English, Comparative Literature, and Media Study at the University of Buffalo, where she is the Director of the Center for the Study of Psychoanalysis and Culture. “For Shame” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/04/the_world_socia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.long-sunday.net/long_sunday/2006/04/the_world_socia.html</a>) <br />
The World Socialist website includes today AND &quot;No--I have none&quot;?  <br />
<br />
The alternative to shame is an ethic of guilt. This is because the emotional impulse of anxiety splits itself between guilt and shame. Guilt is characterized by its desire to violently order and understand the world. Shame is a form of comfort where we can accept our own faults and insecurities. Unless we confront the state and our nuclear weapons with shame, psychosis becomes inevitable <br />
Copjec in 2006 (Joan, Department of English, Comparative Literature, and Media Study at the University of Buffalo, where she is the Director of the Center for the Study of Psychoanalysis and Culture: Lacan: the silent partners; May ’68, the Emotional Month) SRM <br />
It is only against this AND an interiority unbreachable even by ourselves. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, our world is already marked by guilt. The guilt we feel about our nuclear arsenal can be explained as a hatred for our violent tendencies that we have already split off and projected upon countless enemies. The history of war and violence has left an imprint upon our psyche which perpetrates the very cycle of war. It is only shame that can resolve war. <br />
Steinberg 1988 (Blema, PhD, Department of Political Science at McGill University, “Psychoanalysis and the Nuclear Threat”, book, pg. 155) <br />
In exploring the pattern of conflict AND if it is only omnipotent destruction. <br />
<br />
Finally is framework – we will defend the policy implications of the plan. Our argument is that the plan is a good idea under the overarching ethical system of shame. This does not deny the negative the ability to generate links to the effects of the plan.  <br />
