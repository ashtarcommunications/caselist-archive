The roles and/or missions of nuclear deterrence that block dissent should be substantially reduced and restricted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deterrence relies on the paradox of institutional enemy construction: the government says we must deter another country because they are irrational, but deterrence relies on the belief where the other country will have a rational response. This paradox ensures that it’s in the government’s best interest to squash dissent.<br />

&quot; In this argument, the forbearer of the Domino Theory… might trigger a nuclear response. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s all about who or what controls the frame of the debate. When argumentation reflects the practices of enemy construction that the state uses to justify policy, there is an endless cycle of imagined scenarios thought into existence. This creates a socialization whereby the justifications that undergird decionmaking become colonized by the thought of total war. Whether or not the threats constructed are true, this has real implications for how argumentation is tied to institutions that have a vested interested in eliminating dissent against the established order.<br />

<br />
&quot;It is in this context that the insecurity dilemma …<span class="underline">material basis for that policy</span>.&quot;<br />
<br />
Institutions control the terms of debate by defending deterrence in the face of total war. This creates the perpetual drive for action that subverts public dialogue.<br />

<br />
&quot;Flexibility is a central concept …<span class="underline">obligated to support such action</span>.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This creates a fixation on constructing and reconstructing governmentality. New emergencies are thought up continually in order to perpetually justify the knee-jerk impulse for policy response. This serial policy failure is evident in deterrence and debate itself. Governmentality of this kind creates a system in which we advertize and sell the best crises to policy experts in a cycle of futility. The policy experts have interests in creating a crisis to justify a policy response and keep the status quo unchanged, perpetuating the management of life.<br />
<span class="cite">Dillon &amp; Reid 2000</span>, Michael &amp; Julian, “Global Governance, Liberal Peace, and Complex Emergency,” Alternatives, Jan-Mar, Vol. 25, Issue 1<br />
&quot;As a precursor to global governance, governmentality, …biomolecular as well as Foucauldian &quot;biopower&quot; ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The more argumentation mirrors the way institutions enact crises to motivate action, the more debate is rendered meaningless. It’s always measured against the risk of total war, creating subconscious withdrawal from criticism against deterrence. This is why criticism must be an end in and of itself, because if it’s value is suspended to temporarily avoid a future crisis, that cedes debate and decisionmaking to institutions in a form of violent representation.<br />

&quot;Institutions claim that deterrence is a public good. However…<span class="underline"> paradox that can only be managed from above</span>.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Institutional deterrence logic has been reproduced in academic debate. Using debate purely as a simulation where we talk about things we have little control over detracts from the important task of determining what the political relevance of debate is IN THE FIRST PLACE. This weds debate to the same practices that institutions use to rig the game, ensuring that the control over what debate simulates remains in the hands of elites. In other words, Mitchell had it right the first time…<br />

<br />
<strong>The structures of power within international relations have always been sustained through the production of visible threats to secure sovereign authority. During the Cold War, the threat of mutually assured destruction worked to ensure that annihilation remained simply that: a threat, a gesture necessary to ensure stablility. But the politics of the status quo reveal how the transition from classic to existing power structures resulted in new forms of domination. When Iran announced its plan to resume its uranium enrichment program the U.S. responded with diplomatic pressure to ensure that they would never be able to develop nuclear weapons to challenge American military supremacy, the same logic that justified the invasion of Iraq. This denial of agonism in the international sphere reflects the way in which threats are now rendered invisible, and it is this spectrality which legitimizes the logic of preemptive strike and the moralizing claims which dehumanizes the Other in global politics.</strong><br />

 <br />
Observation One is the Monster in the Closet...<br />
<br />
The rhetoric of the war on terror centers on possession of weapons of mass destruction. Thes questions of who should or should not be able to possess “high-tech” weaponry cannot be seperated from the nuclear posture of the United States. Historically, the role of our nuclear arsenal has been the symbolic legitimization of state violence under the guise of fighting “clean wars” while condemning the barbarity of terrorists or rogue nations who do not possess legitimate weapons of war.<br />
<br />

<br />
“One issue in the current 'war against terror'...realm of the monstrous and unnatural”<br />
<br />
We are witnessing the uncanny return of monstrosity in terrorism studies. As children we were thrilled and terrified by stories of the boogeyman who would steal our eyes in the middle of the night. Now it seems that the Southpark nightmare of Imaginationland has come true as the image of the terrorist begins to haunt the collective American psyche. These representations are highly sexualized through techniques of normalization and discipline in which a heteronormative morality acts to seperate good from evil, normality from abnormality.<br />
<br />
Jasbir K. Puar and Amit S. Rai. “Monster, Terrorist, Fag: the War on Terrorism and the Production of Docile Patriots.” Social Text 20:3, 2002<br />
<br />
“To begin, let us consider the monster...discourse of monstrosity in 'terrorism studies'”<br />
<br />
The discourse of monstrosity presupposes the existence of a “normal” psyche. In this context, terrorism is the byproduct of a sick mind – deviance that connotes a failed heterosexuality. This attempt to reduce the complexities of culture and politics to a model of sexual perversity underwrites the history of Western modernity and colonial subjugation.<br />
<br />
Jasbir K. Puar and Amit S. Rai. “Monster, Terrorist, Fag: the War on Terrorism and the Production of Docile Patriots.” Social Text 20:3, 2002<br />
<br />
“What all these models and theories...practices and rituals of heteronormativity.”<br />
<br />
Observation Two is Queer and Loathing in America...<br />
<br />
Heteronormative thought establishes an invisible center – one that is definable and sanitary, constantly producing and reproducing standards for rationality, desireability, and superiority. This becomes the primary instrument for oppressive power relations and the production of knowledge. Modern institutions rely upon these unspoken rules in order to rationalize the systemic marginalization of the abnormal.<br />
<br />
Gust A. Yep. “The Violence of Heteronormativity in Communication Studies: Notes on Injury, Healing, and Queer World-Making.” Journal of Homosexuality. 45:2-3, September 2003<br />
<br />
“In this passage...race, class, gender, and sexuality”<br />
<br />
The political demand to universalize identity results in self-repression, violent assimilation and the eradication of others.<br />
<br />
William Connolly. Identity/Difference: Democratic Negotiations of Political Paradox. 2002, pg 176-178<br />
<br />
“Finally, then, there is a dimension...tactics of self-modification.”<br />
<br />
This is not just empty theorizing. Representations that tie queerness as sexual deviancy to the monstrous figure of the terrorist act to otherize and quarantine subjects classified as terrorists and to normalize and discipline a population through the invocation of these monstrous figures that translates into actual violence.<br />
<br />
Jasbir K. Puar and Amit S. Rai. “Monster, Terrorist, Fag: the War on Terrorism and the Production of Docile Patriots.” Social Text 20:3, 2002<br />
<br />
“Yet again, we could interrogate...body of the normalized nation.”<br />
<br />
Therefore, we affirm the resolution through a rearticulation of the terrorist body as an assemblage that resists queerness-as-sexual-identity withing the dominant narrative of U.S. Nuclear exceptionalism<br />
<br />
Observation Three is They Want to Recruit our Children...<br />
<br />
Restricting the role of nuclear weapons demands a rethinking of identity. Wars are no longer fought solely on the material landscape. On the symbolic level, the normalizing function of nuclear weapons confers the status of “legitimacy” for America's “right to violence” against populations marked as enemies who lack the proper, high-tech instruments of warfare. We need to question the moralizing rhetoric of monstrosity and sexual deviancy that justifies state-based atrocities committed on a global scale.<br />
<br />
Kelly Oliver. Women as Weapons of War: Iraq, Sex, and the Media. 2007, pg 128-130<br />
<br />
“How can a few guys with box cutters...legitimate versus illegitimate violence.”<br />
<br />
Identity, intersectionality, and traditional queer studies reflect the postmodern politics of liberal-multiculturalism that conforms to the disciplinary apparatus of the state. The 1AC affirms queerness, not as an identiy or even anti-identity, but as an assemblage that is spatially and temporally contingent, dismantling the representational mandates of visibility and stability in identity politics that feed narratives of U.S. sexual exceptionalism. This is not a strategy of “queering” human subjects, but of allowing subjects to appear in all their queerness – a method that allows for the temporality of being as always becoming.<br />
<br />
Jasbir K. Puar. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times. 2007, pg 211-216<br />
<br />
“There is no entity, no identity...becoming beyond or without being.”<br />
<br />
The ballot acts as a point of rupture within the dominant narrative of U.S. sexual exceptionalism that demands conformity to heteronormative institutions and practices. This is a specific strategy of criticism which should not be excluded – attempts to define our affirmative by placing arbitrary limits on the game of debate is an extension of a conservative strategy which produces new normativities and exceptionalisms through the mastery of the unknowable. You should reject strategies that seperate the body from politics and instead affirma a queer praxis of assemblage that reshapes the terrain of intersectionality.<br />
<br />
