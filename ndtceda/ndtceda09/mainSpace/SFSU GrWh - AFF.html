NCFA 1AC:<br />
<br />
We have no plan text but will hand over the 1AC before round and answer any questions.<br />
<br />
We do a genealogy of nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
We think this is necessary to be able to fully interrogate nuclear weapons policy and develop new understandings of the bomb and how it effects our lives. We think that most interrogations highlight certain histories over others and that this form of interrogation privileges certain knowledge which excludes certain perspectives and only re-entrenches a lot of harms like colonial mindsets and crisis-driven politics (these are some of the &quot;advantages&quot; so to speak). We think that by allowing for the cultural-historical overlay new tangible understanding of nuclear weapons can be gained which is better for us to better come to a place where we could do something about them.<br />
<br />
We don't defend that there is any spill over outside of the room or that there any out of round impacts from the decision of debate.<br />
<br />
We think that the most important standard and way to evaluate is through education.<br />
<br />
The role of the ballot is an endorsement of the genealogical process.<br />
<br />
Our 1AC evidence was from the first chapter of Joseph Masco's book, The Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico.<br />

I am worried about this word, this notion security. Eve Ensler describes the law of security as...<br />
( Eve Ensler, Insecure at Last, 2002, pg. 195-197)<br />
The Law of Security.....Amnesia will eventually be mistaken for security.<br />
<br />
The warmth of current US politics deny acts of vulnerability by exploiting fear and detachment. The time has come for all of us to remove these blankets and expose our weaknesses. The &quot;loss&quot; of security is necessary to rearticulate and reorient our social and political spaces.<br />
Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .40-41)<br />
I condemn on several ethical bases..... thereby making those features &quot;other to&quot; itself.<br />
<br />
Furthermore dissent and disruption are necessary strategies to oppose the static values of politics. We must maintain a critical view of politics even in a world blanketed in the stigma of security.<br />
Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .XVIII-XIXI)<br />
The Levinasian face is not precisely or exclusively...... status as a viable speaking<br />
<br />
Vulnerability is an ethical form of engagement that once recognized has the power to reconstitute itself. We are actively performing this recognition through our advocacy in our discourse.<br />
Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .40-41)<br />
By insisting on a &quot;common&quot; corporeal vulnerability..... their continuing and expanded operation.<br />
<br />
We all posses vulnerability in our bodies. But it is the mindfulness of that vulnerability that leads to productive non-military solutions. We must disrupt the fantasy of mastery that is implicit in our politics surrounding nuclear weapons to stop systemic violence.<br />
Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .28-29)<br />
Mourning, fear, anxiety, rage.......devastating exposure to this condition?<br />
<br />
ADVOCACY: Thus, we are resolved that the United States Federal Government should disarm its nuclear arsenal because to do otherwise would be to enslave ourselves to the security that nulear weapons are thought to provide. Through disarming we can mourn the loss of the nuclear bomb, which reorients how we come to know ourselves, the vulnerability that is borne into our bodies and that discourses that occur in and out of nuclear weapons. Our advocacy reveals that nuclear weapons are more than just instruments of war.<br />
<br />
A re-oreintation towards feminist politics offers the greatest possibility to collectively deal with our fundemental politics of security. Vulnerability avoids dominant masculine political discourse by not drawing a line between assimilation or erasure. We can no longer be &quot;us or them&quot; because we can be &quot;we&quot;<br />
Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .42)<br />
Feminism surely could provide all kinds......the line that must be walked between the two.<br />
<br />
THis form of political resistance and public postitioning generate change. It counters fragmentation and mobilizes collective discourse and provides accountability.<br />
Brown 1995 (Wendy Brown, States of Injury, Professor at UC Santat Cruz, pg 49-51)<br />
Resistance, the practice most widely associated.....taste for political argument.
