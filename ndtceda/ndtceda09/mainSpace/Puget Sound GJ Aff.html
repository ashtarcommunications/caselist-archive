 The Obama administration is poised to modernize all elements of the nuclear arsenal. This extension of our nuclear legacy is conducted through Stockpile Stewardship, which surveys the complex to ensure that “unsafe” elements are sanitized and replaced<br />

Stewardship triggers a constant monitoring of both external and internal conditions, as our fear of contaminations extends into new governmental control of ecology. Nuclear scientists become our predictors of the future and new ecosocial orders are created that open all forms of life to policing and warfare<br />

In particular, stewardship practices view life simply for its instrumentality. The honeybee is militarized in order to monitor mutant ecologies, opening the floodgates to invasive forms of surveillance that reorient the human relation to nature in a purely technological manner<br />
Joseph <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Masco</span></span>, Professor of Anthropology at U. Chicago, <u>The Nuclear Borderlands</u> <span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2006</span></span><br />

<span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span><br />
This interaction with the honeybee embodies an ontological commitment that has defined human relations with other animals in increasingly violent terms. The worst states of subjugation and ongoing genocides have become the norm because our unidirectional relations of instrumentality turn all life into a standing reserve. In this framework <em>survival</em> becomes a means of extermination.<br />

<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This logic of care frames the “steward” as the implementer of nuclear policy, ignoring the role of the public in nuclear debates. Citizenship is overridden as governmentality calls upon secrecy and science as reasons to keep the public in the dark. This attempt to serve as a “steward” of the nuclear stockpile quashes anti-nuclear opposition and results in an all-powerful nuclear military industrial complex is self-replicating. </span></span><br />

This nuclear call to secrecy has reconfigured politics such that threats rule supreme. The national security state uses the ever present danger of destruction to advocate for a new wave of nuclearism and the silencing of civic engagement. <br />

Ultimately, the mechanisms of the military apparatus and how knowledge about it is constructed is a matter of citizenship. The combination of fear and secrecy marginalizes the groups most affected by the nuclear economy, and privileges militarized forms of citizenship that perpetuate the narrative of the nuclear security state<br />

These specific nuclear discourses spillover into other realms as political elites imbue meanings and construct threats that turn even the most neutral space violent.

We cannot continue limiting nuclear politics to the realm of international relations—an ethnographic account of the varied experiences of U.S. citizens challenges the idea of a stable national subject, unmooring the psycho social affects of nuclear nationalism, wrapped in national security and terrorist discourse- this is an act of resistance against apocalyptic violence currently normalized in American life<br />

 1. We meet: mission xa Osgood key to deterrence<br />
<br />
2. Counterinterpretation: The Nuclear Posture Review should be the litmus test for defining the phrase “role of the nuclear weapons arsenal” and includes missile defense:<br />
<br />
(a) The 1AC Osgood evidence: The Bush NPR defines the role of the nuclear weapons arsenal in terms of strategic offensive warfighting – NMD is vital to that role because it allows the US to shoot down incoming missiles in order to use mininukes without repudiation.<br />
<br />
(b) NMD is included in the New Triad.<br />
Mark Bromley, David Grahame and Christine Kucia, “Bunker Busters,” British American Security Information Council, July 2002, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Research/2002BB.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.basicint.org/pubs/Research/2002BB.pdf</a><br />
A “New Triad” stands out as a distinct change from…sea-based missile system based on AEGIS ships.4<br />
<br />
(c) NMD is inherently related to the “role” of the nuclear weapons arsenal:<br />
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 “Revised Nuclear Posture Review” (§1070 FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act)<br />
(b) ELEMENTS OF REVIEW…role and size of nuclear forces.<br />
<br />
1. We meet- substantial<br />
NO CITE<br />
Cold War. However, policymakers should remember … maintaining a robust defensive posture<br />
<br />
(b) It’s key to literature and education. The doctrine of strategic warfighting is a new feature of the NPR. Ignoring the explicit incorporation of missile defense into the role of the nuclear weapons arsenal completely misunderstands nuclear policy.<br />
<br />
(c) They’ll say we explode limits but that’s not true. Their limits explosion is an illusion; realistically, there are 10-15 advantage areas on this topic and maybe 10 affirmatives. If anything, debates will be stagnant by the end of the year. XA UCS<br />
<br />
(d) We provide the best division of ground. Our interpretation allows for affirmative innovation that is predictable and grounded in the literature and provides build in checks on the topic. The affirmatives we allow are limited to the New Triad, unified in their solvency mechanisms, and don’t allow conventional weapons affirmatives.<br />
Kenneth Payne, President of the National Institute for Public Policy, “The Nuclear Posture Review: Setting the Record Straight” The Washington Quarterly 28.3, 2005<br />
Subsequent political commentary grossly misinterpreted … deterrence credibility against post-Cold War threats.<br />
<br />
Topicality is not a voting issue – there’s no abuse in the debate. They get core generics and we have a reasonable interpretation and division of ground<br />

In the 1800s, Westerners arrived in Hawaii. In the tide of immigration that followed, settlers from Europe and the US undermined Native cultures and ultimately ousted the Hawaiian queen by military coup. Since then, the US military has used Hawaii as a base for hegemonic dominance and colonialism at the expense of indigenous autonomy.<br />
Katy Rose, “Space Invaders: Star Wars in Hawaii,” DMZ Hawaii, April 17, 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.space4peace.org/actions/gnconf_09/space%20invaders%20in%20hawaii.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.space4peace.org/actions/gnconf_09/space%20invaders%20in%20hawaii.htm</a><br />
<br />
Today, the military has a devastating stranglehold on Hawaii that causes rampant environmental destruction, militarism and violence directed against indigenous peoples. Hawaiian missile defense is the vital lynchpin of this oppressive system.<br />
Katy Rose, “Space Invaders: Star Wars in Hawaii,” DMZ Hawaii, April 17, 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.space4peace.org/actions/gnconf_09/space%20invaders%20in%20hawaii.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.space4peace.org/actions/gnconf_09/space%20invaders%20in%20hawaii.htm</a><br />
<br />
And, current US doctrine expressly integrates missile defense into the offensive strike and deterrent missions of the nuclear weapons arsenal.<br />
Carl Osgood, “Missile Defense: Cheney’s Nuclear War Doctrine,” Executive Intelligence Review, June 29, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2007/3426abm_cheney.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2007/3426abm_cheney.html</a><br />
<br />
The militarization of Hawaiian culture and civilization is both visible and invisible. This paradox of “hiding in plain sight” naturalizes a supposedly organized social order built upon the military and dismisses alternative histories and politics as disorderly.<br />
Kathy E. Ferguson and Phyllis Turnbull, Professor of Women’s Studies and Political Science @ University of Hawaii and Associate Professor of Political Science @ University of Hawaii, Oh, Say Can You See? The Semiotics of the Military in Hawaii, 1998<br />
<br />
And, allowing the militarization of the social order to remain hidden and dismissive of disorderly histories and politics cedes control over memory to the State and creates an “official” narrative that humiliates and isolates particular social groups. Only critical history and remembering can create restorative politics.<br />
Peter A. Petrakis, Associate Prof. of Political Science @ SE Louisiana University, Eric Voegelin and Paul Ricoeur on Memory and History, 2006<br />
<br />
Further, repressing feelings of hostility caused by the whitewashing of history ultimately resurface as scapegoating, victimization, genocide and nuclear war.<br />
Dominick LaCapra, Representing the Holocaust, 1994<br />
<br />
Second, Hawaii has become the locus of response to the so-called North Korean threat. Specifically, on June 19, 2009, in response to a North Korean missile launch and nuclear test, the United States deployed a missile defense system in Hawaii. The Obama administration claimed to be protecting Hawaii from inevitable North Korean attack.<br />
Wall Street Journal, June 19, 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124535285705228571.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124535285705228571.html</a><br />
<br />
And, deployment of missile defense in Hawaii is part of a problem-solution mindset that demonizes North Korea and ignores the history of US arms trade and support for oppressive regimes. Their identification of the North Korean threat is nothing but a means of sustaining the military industrial complex by aspiring for “security” from non-existent threats and manufactured crises.<br />
Kurt Nimmo, “North Korean Missile Threat,” July 3, 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.infowars.com/north-korean-missile-threat-made-in-the-usa/" rel="nofollow">http://www.infowars.com/north-korean-missile-threat-made-in-the-usa/</a><br />
<br />
Reject the epistemologically and ontologically flawed lens of security – accepting elite-defined security threats without questioning results in Otherization and self-fulfilling prophecies such as a nuclear North Korea.<br />
Prerna Lal, Post-Graduate Student in International Relations, Deconstructing the National Security State, No Date Given, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://prernalal.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/css-deconstructing-the-nat-sec-state.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://prernalal.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/css-deconstructing-the-nat-sec-state.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Further, their objective “facts” relating to North Korea aren’t true. Their evidence is tainted by a racist metanarrative that both relies on race to justify persecution of North Korea and ignores race in the larger scheme of international relations.<br />
Prerna Lal, Post-Graduate Student in International Relations, “North Korea is Not a Threat: Unveiling Hegemonic Discourses,” April 5, 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://prernalal.com/2009/04/05/north-korea-is-not-a-threat-unveiling-hegemonic-discourses/" rel="nofollow">http://prernalal.com/2009/04/05/north-korea-is-not-a-threat-unveiling-hegemonic-discourses/</a><br />
<br />
And, international relations is premised on a strategy of silence on the issue of race. This silence causes genocide, enslavement and the disappearance of the Other from view. Endorse our critical history as a means of forgetting IR.<br />
Sankaran Krishna, Prof. of Political Science @ U. of Hawaii, “Race, Amnesia, and the Education of International Relations,” Alternatives, Volume 26, 2001, 406-7<br />
<br />
Third, “rogue” regimes such as North Korea are a created and sustained through systems of surveillance such as those used in missile defense. Surveillance is the ultimate tool to divide the rational “civilized” state from the irrational “rogue.” This new spin on an old tale justifies militarism and global intervention.<br />
Bruce Cumings, Prof. of History @ U. of Chicago, Parallax Visions, 1999<br />
<br />
And, militarism causes extinction and makes war inevitable.<br />
Mike Pesa, Chief Editor, “THE STUDENT ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION COALITION (SEAC) WINTER NATIONAL CONVERGENCE,” Threshold, November 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.seac.org/threshold-backup/nov04.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.seac.org/threshold-backup/nov04.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Thus, the plan.<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should dismantle all missile defense systems in Hawaii. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Our critical history uncovers social orders of militarism in Hawaii and fosters broader examinations of American narratives of war and the state. Only the affirmative can open space for counterhegemonic stories, recounting of memories and explorations of silence.<br />
Kathy E. Ferguson and Phyllis Turnbull, Professor of Women’s Studies and Political Science @ University of Hawaii and Associate Professor of Political Science @ University of Hawaii, Oh, Say Can You See? The Semiotics of the Military in Hawaii, 1998<br />
<br />
Finally, missile defense is a vital hook for militarism in Hawaii. Removing missile defense and questioning our understandings of “security” are the first steps in demilitarization and creating an ethic of respect for indigenous peoples.<br />
