Should these solutions look promising, the US will proceed from research to development. If this should require tests, the test moratorium will be terminated. If no tests are needed, the moratorium will be kept and will be presented as a contribution to implement Art. VI.

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Such quid pro quo bargains are going nowhere fast because nuclear-weapon states and their non-nuclear counterparts are talking past each other.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Nuclear weapon states fail to understand that</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">these </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>“bargains” are not seen as fair exchanges by non–nuclear-weapon states in light of long overdue and unfulfilled promises made by nuclear-weapon states.</u></span><br />

The debate in the United States about the feasibility of nuclear disarmament has been overly focused on steps that nuclear-armed states should take, without serious attention being given to the views of non–nuclear-weapon states that have an important role to play on both the nonproliferation and disarmament agendas. This lack of understanding has limited the range of policy options under consideration. Although the foreign ministries disclosed that there are no automatic or immediate bargains to be had in the near term, they did </span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>indicate that a reorientation in U.S. policies and approaches could create the conditions for future bargains.

They state: “</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal would be, and would be perceived as, a bold initiative consistent with America’s moral heritage. The effort could have a profoundly positive impact on the security of future generations</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Without bold vision, the actions will not be perceived as fair or urgent. Without the actions, the vision will not be perceived as realistic or possible</span></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><strong>US leadership is key to convince leaders to give up nuclear weapons</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">(David, Ph.D., expert on nuclear proliferation, President of Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, US Leadership for a Nuclear Weapons Free World, 27 September 2007, &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2007/09/24_krieger_US_leadership.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2007/09/24_krieger_US_leadership.php</a>&gt;)</span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">The statement began by recognizing a present opportunity for diminishing nuclear dangers that will require US leadership to achieve. The authors stated:</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> “</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Nuclear weapons today present tremendous dangers, but also an historic opportunity. US leadership will be required to take the world to the next stage – to a solid consensus for reversing reliance on nuclear weapons globally as a vital contribution to preventing their proliferation into potentially dangerous hands, and ultimately ending them as a threat to the world</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">.” </span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">The authors expressed their belief in the importance of nuclear deterrence during the Cold War, but its decreasing relevance in a post Cold War world. They, in fact, found that Soviet-American mutually assured deterrence is “obsolete.”</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">The four prominent former US officials reviewed current nuclear dangers and called for US leadership to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons. In essence, the argument leading them to this position was based on the following premises:</span></span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence “is becoming increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective.”</u> </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Terrorist groups are outside the bounds of deterrence strategy</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">We are entering a new nuclear era that “will be more precarious, disorienting and costly than was Cold War deterrence.” </span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Attempting to replicate Cold War strategies of deterrence will dramatically increase the risk that nuclear weapons will be used.</u></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">New nuclear weapons states lack the safeguarding and control experiences learned by the US and USSR during the Cold War.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty envisions the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Non-nuclear weapons states have grown increasingly skeptical of the sincerity of the nuclear weapons states to fulfill their Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations to eliminate their nuclear arsenals.</u></span></li></ol><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">There exists an historic opportunity to eliminate nuclear weapons in the world.</span></span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">To realize this opportunity, bold vision and action are needed. </span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>The US must take the lead and must convince the leaders of the other nuclear weapons states to turn the goal of nuclear weapons abolition into a joint effort.</u></span></li></ol><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">In other words, the bipartisan group found that</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>it was in the self-interest of the US to lead the way toward a world without nuclear weapons</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. They are not a group of men likely to encourage US leadership for altruistic reasons or humanitarian concerns. They were hardened Cold Warriors, willing to risk humanity’s future during the Cold War nuclear arms race, even if it meant blowing up the world, including the United States, for what they perceived as America’s security. </span></span><br />

Since both countries demonstrated their nuclear capabilities with tests in 1998, three crises have narrowly averted escalating to the level of nuclear exchanges: the 1999 Kargil war; the 2001-2 military buildup; and the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.</span></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Anything the United States can do to minimize the risk of these countries using nuclear weapons is clearly in the interest of the United States and the international community</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">.</span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>Pakistan feels threatened by India’s overwhelming size and conventional military superiority</u></span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">. Current estimates of <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/pakistan/nuke/index.html" rel="nofollow">Pakistan’s arsenal</a> range from 65 to 110 nuclear warheads. Command and control of Pakistan’s weapons is shaky, and <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060901faessay85505/scott-d-sagan/how-to-keep-the-bomb-from-iran.html" rel="nofollow">one scholar</a> even reported that Pakistani leaders contemplated giving command of one or more nuclear weapons to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan as a hedge against India during the 1999 war. Pakistani leaders also believe the recent U.S.-India nuclear deal will allow India to produce many more nuclear warheads, thus prompting Pakistani leaders to feel they need to “catch up.”</span></span></span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">India has stated policies of “no first use” and “minimum credible deterrence,” in other words, a robust second-strike capability. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hindu.com/2006/04/08/stories/2006040806161200.htm" rel="nofollow">It is unclear</a> just what quantity of warheads is needed for such a capability: 50? 100? 300? Recent estimates put <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/Nuclearweaponswhohaswhat" rel="nofollow">India’s arsenal</a> in the range of 70 to 120 warheads, which will likely increase as India <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KB20Df02.html" rel="nofollow">continues to experiment</a> with submarine-launched nuclear weapons. India has overwhelming conventional and nuclear superiority over Pakistan; establishing and declaring a limit would not reduce that edge but would provide some measure of stability for the region.</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><u>India wants to be a great power and a leader in the region.
