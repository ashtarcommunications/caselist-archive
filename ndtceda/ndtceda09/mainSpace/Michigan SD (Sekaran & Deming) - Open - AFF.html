<br />
Yet, despite the changing security environment …<br />
<br />
…and hence it is counter-coercion or counter-deterrence<br />
<br />
A pledge of No First Use by the United States is the critical element in creating the “mutual strategic trust” necessary for relations to contain modernization, miscalculation, and accidents that could lead to war<br />

Lewis is Director of the Nuclear Strategy and Nonproliferation Initiative at the New America Foundation; Ph.D. in policy studies (international security and economic policy) from the University of Maryland; Nonproliferation Review, Vol. 16, No. 2, July 2009)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The United States and China have begun a formal dialogue…<br />
<br />
…reduce the possibility of accidents, miscalculations, or misunderstandings.<br />
U.S.-Sino relations are critical to solve several scenarios for extinction<br />
Sidney Rittenberg 2008 (former Frey Distinguished Professor of Chinese History at the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill), where an endowed chair has been announced in his name. He currently is Visiting Professor of China Studies at Pacific Lutheran University, Tacoma, Washington, Quoted in the China Daily, (Rikki N.

<br />
<br />
<br />
To frame the importance of this discussion and the topics that must be met…<br />
<br />
…axis that holds the whole thing together is the U.S. and China,&quot; Rittenberg said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Deeper strategic coordination is the ONLY way to get to strategic stability in the transition to China’s secure second-strike capabilities<br />

As China continues to modernize its nuclear and missile forces…<br />
<br />
.... to help safeguard shared interests in strategic and crisis stability.<br />

<br />
Advantage: Deterrence<br />
<br />
First use isn’t a credible threat and leads to commitment traps that are likely to cause escalation in real emergencies - Deterrence did not solve Iraq’s chemical weapons<br />
Toward True Security:Ten Steps the Next President Should Take to Transform U.S. Nuclear Weapons Policy 2008 (Federation of American Scientists; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_08021201A.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://docs.nrdc.org/nuclear/files/nuc_08021201A.pdf</a>)<br />
Advocates of an explicit U.S. nuclear threat often claim…<br />
<br />
…nuclear weapons is to deter and, if necessary, respond to nuclear attacks.<br />
<br />
The alternative to the plan is to believe in the primacy of nuclear deterrence – this hubris results in nuclear conflicts with major powers - even the best deterrence can lead to escalation in crisis<br />

<br />
Third, if Russia and China do not adequately reduce the vulnerability of their nuclear forces<br />
<br />
nuclear weapons were the preferred means of defending U.S. vital interests abroad.<br />
<br />
US policy is modeled– Obama must act to return to negative security assurances – key to preventing other countries from using weapons in crisis and restoring US credibility on non-proliferation leadership<br />

The NPR was reinforced in December 2002 by a presidentially…<br />
<br />
…dynamic that we set in motion in 2002 must now be recognized fully and countered.<br />
Proliferation causes much more likely nuclear war<br />

Combine these proliferation trends with the others noted…<br />
<br />
…proponents of nuclear abolition, nor their critics, would ever want.<br />
<br />
The plan can reverse the decline of the NPT and the alternative to the NPT is nuclear anarchy – deterrence failure and nuclear power blocs<br />

<br />
In conclusion, nuclear history has been shaped<br />
<br />
A no-first-use declaration would help address that concern.<br />
<br />
And we remove arguments that justify new programs – increasing our credibility for creating coalitions for counter-proliferation<br />
<br />
Scott D. Sagan 6/2009 (Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and Co-Director of Stanford’s Center for<br />
<br />
International Security and Cooperation; Survival, vol. 51 no. 3, June–July 2009, pp. 163–182)<br />
A US no-first-use declaration would also enhance US non-proliferation…<br />
<br />
…as would the ability of Tehran to claim it faces nuclear threats.<br />
<br />
First use will not deter terrorists– it will increase their support– international cooperation is the solution<br />
<br />
Cimbala, Stephen J. 2008 (Dr. Stephen J. Cimbala is Distinguished Professor of Political Science at the Pennsylvania State University-Brandywine; Joint Force Quarterly October 1, 2008)<br />
<br />
The threat of nuclear first use against terrorists…<br />
<br />
…and lethal nonnuclear munitions.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the risk of WMD terrorism is tiny and decreasing<br />
<br />
John Mueller 2009 (PHD; Department of Political Science, Ohio State University; International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament; 5/30; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Mueller_Terrorism.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Mueller_Terrorism.pdf</a>)<br />
The odds considered so far are for a single attempt by a single…<br />
<br />
…In addition, the science of nuclear forensics will advance.<br />
<br />
Also true of CBW’s<br />

The concept of a nuclear response to a CW or BTW…<br />
<br />
…still harder to foresee a nuclear response to such an attack.<br />
<br />
And true of Extended Deterrence – the links has no empirical basis and all available evidence points the other way<br />
