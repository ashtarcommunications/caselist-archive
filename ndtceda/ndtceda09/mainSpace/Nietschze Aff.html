Type in the content of your page here<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-family: Calibri,helvetica,sans-serif;">Modern day castles rooted in ancient Greek tragedy – dichotomy between Apollo and Dionysus</span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Saurette ’96 (Paul, “I Mistrust All Systematizers and Avoid them: Nietzche, Arendt and the Crisis of the Will to Order in International Relations Theory”)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Modern day castles still exist. Weapons secure ourselves against those who are unknowable. Fear is always present, always guiding actions. Dionysian elements of existence have been eliminated by the will to power. This has eliminated all that is ambiguous and uncertain.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Der Derian ’95 (James, “The value of Security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche and Baudrillard”)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">We build castles out of fear of the wild and other and that we cannot control and understand. Out of that fear came the sword – symbol of protection and illusion of security. Nuclear weapons are a modern day sword stemming from the same fear.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Chernus ’03 (Ira, “nuclear weapons are no cure for American epidemic of fear”)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The castle guards that which is pure and rational and eliminates the unknown. The will to truth is a desire to create the world the way it ought to be.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Turlani ’03 (Nietzche and the Later wittgenstien: an offense to the quest for another world”)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">ADVOCACY: We embrace a Dionysian relationship (depends on the team and what version of statement is read)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Desire for security has created the sword as a necessary defense for the castle. It assumes all Dionysian elements must be eliminated. The way out is smashing the sword.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">Nietzche ‘1878 (Human, All too Human, Aphorism 284)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">A Dionysian relationship to existence calls for us to desire what was undesirable and lift the apollian veil from our eyes</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">White ’90 (Adam, “Within Nietzche’s Labyrinth: Veil Frames”)</span>
