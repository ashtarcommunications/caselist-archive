The fixity of stereotype allows the marginalization and processes of otherness that oppress and subjugate. In order to resist stereotype, the ambivalence of its oscillating truth must be revealed as neither positive or negative, nor rejected in a strategy of acknowledging the normative and the unengaged. Rather, in recognizing stereotype as a function of history and politics we can reconceive of the relationship between discourse and politics to recognize the productivity of colonial power.<br />

Narratives of those who lived through the time of colonization show a continued forgetting of the Koreans involved and their stories. Conscripted Korean soldiers were forgotten and left in the absence of remembrance<br />

<br />
The focus on the nuclear gadget is a myopic gaze that distracts us from the role that nuclear weapons play, which is to secure national prosperity. Museums, memorials and tourists events act as a replacement for actual weapons accumulation that operate through the accumulation of bodies captured via the “State apparatus.”<br />

<br />
Throughout New Mexico are signs of war’s techno-boom... This counter-proliferation is rooted, seemingly paradoxically, in the recognition and proliferation of the body’s affective intensities, unassimilable moments of becoming that mark out a new politics of potential<br />
<br />
We only talk about nuclear war; it does not exist. It is the non-event without referent. Even speculations are only specularizations creating fear and assimilation of the unanticapatable other. It is this fable of war that leads us to stockpile and assimilate society and politics to the war effort.<br />

Third reason...An invention because it depends upon new technical mechanisms, to be surer but an invention also because it does not exist and especially because, at whatever point it should come into existence, it would be a grand premiere appearance.
