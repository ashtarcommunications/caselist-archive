<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">View from nowhere cards/social location arguments (Read on the Neg):</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The aff’s authors have a universal “View From Nowhere” which reiterates the cultural strategy of whiteness to perpetuate the political system of white supremacy. This means they have no means for solving for the black body because it is the radix for interpreting all racial experience, and their aff does nto account for that.<br />

The “View From Nowhere” that most philosophical discourse fosters cannot theorize for the black body or hope to solve for the harms of white supremacy</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />

<strong>Like Farrakhan said, we must let the fire burn and incinerate our current conceptions of state and legal institutions in order to produce a new world</strong><br />

<strong>Welcome to the performative evolution of Towson JM (they talk about ways in which they’ve interrupted whiteness as freshmen, sophomores, juniors) – now is the time for a disruption of privileges, norms, unspoken rules, Eurocentric validation processes, judge exceptionalist sovereignty, and violently forced assimilations through low-point wins and a ceiling for success. Now is the time to performatively disrupt whiteness pedagogically and politically seniorly; framework for this debate is who best performs a disruption of the whiteness that maintains white supremacy enroute to the liberation of the oppressed.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>[talk about the black bomb – it severs whiteness/white supremacy and ends maintenance of white supremacy through a performance of difference that doesn’t assimilate difference]</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Affirm the resolution as a performative disruption of whiteness by calling for a separate land or territory in the continental United States for the descendants of African Slaves to control and possess all nuclear weapons of the United States Federal Government.</strong><br />
<strong>Nuclear weapons are the ultimate guarantor of institutional racism – nuclear weapons function as the fire hose to put us out and silence the fire in the voices of black people. Black people’s relationship to nuclear weapons has been one of exploitation, denigration and economic degradation.</strong><br />
<strong>Oak Ridge Environmental Peace Alliance 2009</strong>, “Stop the Racism Imperialist Weapons? Building a world of peace requires making the connections” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stopthebombs.org/racism.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.stopthebombs.org/racism.php</a><br />
<br />
<strong>The black bomb is the equalizer in the fight against white supremacy – activities of Afrikan extremist elements and the enduring nuclear threat to northern African nations by U.S. decisions have rendered treaties controlling the use of nuclear weapons in Africa worthless pieces of tissue paper; demanding the call for a pan-African nuclear deterrent option, the “black bomb,” transforming the international stature of the continental formation enabling Africa to protect itself internally and externally, the black bomb projecting power and providing a nuclear umbrella to African nations as well as the 40 million blacks in the United States, the black bomb, a global nuclear security blanket to the worlds one billion Africans bridging the global nuclear divide, the black bomb, a nuclear symmetry between the north and south, the black bomb, revolutionizing the African continent and forcing open the nakedly racist asymmetry and hypocrisy of a non-proliferation order and thus contributing to a new global democracy in which all states are truly equal. This is a discursive call for the black bomb!</strong><br />
<strong>Xyborg 2006</strong>, published blog at wordpress “The Black Bomb: should Africa follow the DPRK and build the bomb? October 8; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://xyborg7.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://xyborg7.wordpress.com</a> “coming on the heels of revelations about the activities…the BLACK BOMB will be to the AFRICAN world.”<br />
<br />
<strong>The call for the “black bomb” is the call for global disarmament and the transgression of responsibility. The total elimination of all nuclear weapons on Earth is the price of forswearing a pan-African nuclear option. The black bomb may well represent the world’s final chance at letting this white supremacist, capitalist, imperialist patriarch we call America to burn and disidentify with the racial asymmetry of nuclear weapons distribution that can only be likened to a form of nuclear Jim Crow</strong><br />

<strong>Rules are created to reenforce status quo power and privilege – masking these rules in the language of fairness makes them more acceptable</strong><br />
<strong>Delgado 1992</strong> (Richard, “Shadowboxing: an essay on power” in Cornell L. Rev. May 1992)<br />
<br />
<strong>These claims of fairness, objectivity, and predictability are ways to marginalize the oppressed and silence our voices</strong><br />

<strong>Their Shively evidence is not about educational debate - here’s some that it; it says that connecting debate to the experiences and beliefs of students is vital to empowerment – their approach silences our experiences and promotes bad politics</strong><br />
