 The way we orient ourselves towards nuclear weaponry in the status quo is one of enchantment and desire. Defense analyst refer to weapons using a lexicon based on pleasant imagery as opposed to the violent nature of which the weapons are based.  This domestication of weapons has lead to desensitivity towards nuclear weapons. Consequently, our orientation towards nuclear arsenal has lead to oppression of subgroups within society. At most our enchantment humanizes the weapons and dehumanizes the weaponry, devaluing the very lives defense weapons purport to save.<br />
<br />
Cohn, 87 (Carol Cohn, Sex Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals, Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, Vol 12, No ; 687-718)<br />
<br />
“Sanitized abstraction and sexual patriarchal imagery… of weapons systems not people.” <br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government should reduce and restrict the role of its virtual power mission <br />
<br />
Throughout history nuclear weapons have been symbols of sexual desire. The connection between atomic science and sex have a long history. This enchantment of nuclear weaponry is leading to the polarization of society.<br />

“In Stanley Kubrick’s film Dr. Strangelove…repressing the autonomy of women.”<br />
<br />
The described polarization of society entails future violence and the end of humanity as we know it.<br />
<br />
Bem 1993 (Sandra- Professor of Psychology at Cornell University, The Lenses of Gender, pg. 193)<br />
<br />
“In addition to the humanist and …in massive numbers but the planet. “ <br />
<br />
And this male/cultural binary created by our orientation degrades women and is based on the ideals of male procreation and patriarchy.<br />

“The language developed by nuclear defense…men giving birth to nuclear bombs.” <br />
Nuclear fetishization is rife with metaphors of birth. This represents patriarchal domination over womyn<br />

<br />
“Along with the fetishization of nuclear technology…violent domination over female nature” (1987: 701).” <br />
<br />
<br />
This enchantment of nuclear weapons is proven in everyday speech by defense analyst. Whether referring to silos as a woman’s genitalia or an explosion as an orgasm.<br />

“Cohn was surprised at the overt nature …are a little harder than we are.’”(1987: 693).” <br />
And this oppressive lexicon of defense analyst has permeated throughout society. In today’s culture the terminology can be found in all locations.<br />

“Beyond violence against ‘female nature’… ‘nukes’and ‘mutants’ have won their place in culture.” <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuclear fetishization extends to physical acts with the bomb. It is this intense sexual desire for the bomb that leads to its use. This is based on theory, but has empirically been proven through the invention of the Pershing missile<br />

“Cohn was furthermore privy to strange… that their creations will bring.” <br />
We must change the way we orient ourselves to nuclear weapons - this educational forum provides an opportunity for important resistance - all of your policymaking good arguments are only attempts to paint individuals as powerless - all structures of power, depend upon this perception in order to perpetuate domination - the university is the most important setting to foster ideas<br />
<br />
Engler 87 (Robert Engler, professor of political science, City University of New York and Brooklyn College, N U CLEAR 'NORMALITY', THE ETHICS OF ANNIHILATION, Conference Proceedings, May 1987, p. 74.)<br />
<br />
“The weaponry and the institutions supporting …freedom is the capacity t say &quot;no&quot;.” <br />
Finally, individuals are not powerless. Our affirmative reinstates hope which is important. we must all resist nuclear weapons politically, ethically, and psychologically. We can't wait for authority or leaders to save us. Only actively participating in the anti-nuclear movement can we avert destruction<br />
<br />
Lifton and Marukesen 90 (Robert Jay Lifton, professor of psychiatry and psychology, John Jay College and City University of New York, and Eric Markusen, sociologist, Carthage College, THE GENOCIDAL MENTALITY, 1990. P. 10.)<br />
<br />
“Species awareness means awareness of human choice…We become healers, not killers, of our species.”  <br />
The affirmative is the only way to solve for the actual use of nuclear weapons. In order prevent the usage of nuclear weapons social change must be the dominant driving force. By dis-enchanting ourselves with nuclear weapons we allow for the best strategy of challenging the nuclear state<br />
<br />
John Steinbach- 2004- Nuclear Nightmare: The Bush Administration, U.S. Nuclear War-Fighting Policy &amp; the War On Iraq<br />
<br />
“The real key to preventing the use of nuclear weapons… aspects of the corporate imperial state.”
