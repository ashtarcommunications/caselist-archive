 The US's policy of holding potential detonation of its nuclear arsenal over the world is like holding a gun to someone's head- it is a way for the US to force the world to comply with its wishes. This forces countries to prepare for war or bow to the US.<br />

Senior Fellow of the </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nuclear Age Peace Foundation</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. 9/11/9. </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bloomingtonalternative.com/node/10137" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www. bloomingtonalternative.com/ node/10137</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">.<br />
In the United States … reasoning in doing so. </span><br />
<br />
The squo treats implicit threats of nuclear war as something to trade in negotiations, a bargaining chip. The US says &quot;we won't strike you if you give us what we ask for&quot;- our pledge not to make these threats delegitimizes instrumentalization of nuclear weapons. This solves violence of the squo's coercive threats.<br />
Dolar '3<br />

This leads us to the simple conclusion...it moulds our behavior in its very non-completion.<br />
<br />
Our status quo policy of threatening first strikes is like an extortionist that sells protection insurance to a local store to keep the extorionist from destroying the store. We force people into accepting security gaurentees of protection from nuclear strieks in exchange for utter submission to US security paradigms. This instrumentalizes other nations.<br />
Tilly in '85<br />
Charles Tilly, Prof of Social Science @ Columbia, &quot;Bringing the State Back In,&quot; 1985, p. 170-171<br />
In contemporary American parlance,...the government has organized a protection racket.<br />
<br />
And, even though the US would not use its nuclear weapons, the implict threat is enough. It militarizes our relations with the world and depoliticizes nuclear war as a constant spectacle from which all should flee. Thus, the US simultaneously inflates the value of nukes and asks for others to give up their freedom for their future.<br />

To make a step further...explicit form of a threat.<br />
<br />
Specifically, implicit threats are the worst, they push violent language underground and make the discursive violence the US employs invisible.<br />

The threat works at its best...an immaterial, a virtual existence.<br />
<br />
And, this process of instrumentalizing implied threats makes war depoliticized and necessary- it becomes self-fulfilling- we must manufacture threats to force others to seek our protection, but they only need our protection because we made up the danger. The aff ends this vicious cycle.<br />
