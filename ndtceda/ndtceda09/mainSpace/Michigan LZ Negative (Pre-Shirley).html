A SUBPOINT: The Mythical Atom </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The affirmative’s obsessive reverence for the destructive power of nuclear weapons is a historical construction that has arisen out of science fiction and media <u>coverage</u> of the atom as a representation of the hidden power of the universe. This mythological narrative constructs nuclear weapons as the alchemical catalyst necessary for the transmutation of the world through radioactivity and makes nuclear war desirable as a pathway to the divine salvation of the Biblical Armageddon and furnishes the ideological coordinates that allow arms racing </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The logic of nuclear destruction creates a closed loop of nuclear policy-making where decreasing, increasing and maintaining deterrence can all be shown to simultaneously increase and decrease crisis stability. This paradoxical form of paralysis is no accident but rather is the result of the political construction of nuclear weapons as a fetish, whose awesome destructive power cannot be truly wielded by mere mortals and whose value is only irrationally determined by the beliefs of others. This fetishism of the value of force constructs nuclear weapons as both natural and inevitable and literally writes value into social reality and creates a perverse relationship between quantity and value, where increasing thresholds and stockpiles devalues the credibility of actual use and thus necessitates ever-greater armaments </span></strong><br />

</span><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This artificial centering of politics around an apocalyptic fetish singularizes the multiplicity of contingent histories of atomic production into transcendental and eternal value irrationally defined by the beliefs of others and erects a prison house for consciousness that makes the masses kill in the name of their servitude and drives systems of domination as they strive to locate apocalypse </span></strong><br />

<span style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;"> </span><br />
<strong>Their attempt to keep death at bay is coopted by political power structures to re-establish their most violent mechanisms. The affirmative cedes their confrontation with death to a bureaucratic war against death as a concept, displaced from one enemy to another and normalizes endless warfare ‘over there’ as a necessary condition of local security</strong><br />
