A. the end of the world as we don't know it--the 1ac description of nuclear war is a fiction that has never occured and cannot be described as having occured. the specter of nuclear annihilation exists only textually, as created by language.<br />
Derrida 84<br />
Third reason. In our...and premiere appearance.<br />
<br />
b. we will survive--the aff's appeal to survival as a justification for the plan is a political act creating humanity in terms of nuclear weapons and preventing an escape from inevitable self-destruction<br />
Chaloupka 92<br />
Focusing on the discontinuity...haunts talk of nukes.<br />
<br />
C. implications--engagement with literal terms of apocalypse politics only plays into the hands of nuclear managers and prevents an analysis of the symbolic politics of the bomb that are used to silence anti-nuclear activism and can only feed repression and detachment<br />
Chernus 86<br />
Moreoever, even if...literalism and fantasy.<br />
<br />
2. The abstract desire to &quot;survive&quot; displaces value to life--only rejection of this blackmail can mantain a meaningful existence<br />
Baudrillard 89<br />
Everywhere survival has become...life can go on.<br />
<br />
3. Nuke managers wanted--the survival of the race as a justification for government action is the loic that allows the extermination of whole populations in the name of preserving life<br />
Coviello 2000<br />
Perhaps. But to claim...scarcely be done without.<br />
<br />
D. we feel fine--the 1ac will neither destroy the world nor prevent its destruction--the aff's trite humanism resolves quetion that our alternative re-opens. The real engagement with politics is nuclear criticism--an examination of the aff's nuclear text to see what our production of it ends up producing in us--this is the assembly of a package of interventions that our alternative rehearses for use in actual policymaking<br />
Chaloupka 92<br />
In Stanley Kubrick's film...ironic cyborg--at last.<br />

A. We live in a world which is globalized--ours is a global village. The aff is this approach which can only see earth as a game boardin the name of good. This ordering authorizes violence--their methodology destroys the local<br />
Nayar 99<br />
It has become...now plainly visible.<br />
<br />
B. Nowhere is this tendency towards ordering more prnounced than in our interactions with nuclear weapons. This emphasis distrots the way nuclear weapons effect us all at the level of our bodies and marginalizes local communities that live in the fallout zone<br />
Masco 06<br />
As this book has...within the plutonium economy.<br />
<br />
their attempts at disinterested knowledge of the Other is the enabling mechanism for the destruction of that alterity. Their attempt ot fill in the blind spots in our map of all human interaction ensures that we can only see the individuals they debate about as the targets for US bombs.<br />
Chow 2006<br />
Often under the modest...of the vanishing object.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alt--refuse the affirmative's vision of nuclear globe order in favor of the localized critique that was the 1nc.<br />
<br />
Only by centering our interrogations at the level of our live experience can we make possible modes of relating to each other which do not fall back into the pattern of violent ordering<br />
Nayar 99<br />

A. Seeking the ballot--<br />
Their methodology continues the exclusion of the ethnographic subject from the allocation of rewards--In other words, the endorsement of their presentation of ethnographic evidence takes the form of a ballot which has zero relevance for the individuals portrayed through this methodology. This replicates the traditional hierarchies that structure ethnography.<br />
Mihesuah 1998<br />
The subjects of research...desert-dwelling tribal peoples.&quot;<br />
<br />
B. A Method to their method<br />
The aff's methodology is designed to deflect critical scrutiny and maintain privilege--Their claim is that it is OK to harvest data from their research subjects because they are genuinely interested in their lives conceals the 1AC complicity with the brutal will to knowledge, turning case<br />
Whitt 1998<br />
That those engaged in...what one has destroyed.&quot;<br />
<br />
C. The AFF's insistence on the methodological purity of ethographic evidence requires a covert reliance on an essentialist understanding of subaltern consciousness. The AFF's radical textua practice hides the way that their framework re-inscribes the necessity of oppression--In other wods, the ethnographic subject has value for the AFF only so long as that subject is dominated which locks-in domination as the essential characteristic of their subjects.<br />
Spivak 1995<br />
Let us now move...conditions of its possibility.<br />
<br />
2NC Links<br />
Valorizing deprivation: the aff is a politics of self-subalternization--where judges are encouraged to found a vacuous solidarity with the other by valorizing the matieral deprication portrayed in the 1AC--However, this rhetorical strategy amounts to nothing than a sham renunciation authorized by those same structures of power<br />
Chow 1993<br />
The Orientalist has a...that enables her rhetoric.<br />

A. The aff plan operates a technology of territory: the state is the organization of disciplinary mechanisms of control that operate material and spatial practices to produce itself as a total matrix of power<br />
Radcliffe 2001<br />
States encompass a space...and its orgnanization disrupted.<br />
<br />
B. Spectacular authority: the affirmative is part of a larger continuous spectable of practice that affirms the authority of the state--the paper trail the aff constructs reproduces the state as the frame for our imagination of alternatives<br />
Hansen &amp; Stepputat 2001<br />
We have pointed out...enframer of our lives.<br />
<br />
C. The imagination colony:<br />
1. The affirmative stacks the deck of alternative by framing all the relevant questions as choices among forms of community left over from euro-american colonial modernity<br />
Chatterjee 1993<br />
I have on central...must remain forever colonized.<br />
<br />
2. Imagination is a social practice that undermines agency at all levels--itis a key component of global order<br />

De-Alert/LOW Grab Bag CP<br />
<br />
Text: The Executive Branch of the USFG should make an internal policy decision to no strictly abide by a nuclear Launch on Warning doctrine.<br />
<br />
Ambiguity is competitive – it doesn’t officially end LOW nor does it replace it with RLOAD – all the CP does is ensure the U.S. does not automatically and immediately Launch in response to a warning<br />
<br />
THE USFG should:<br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">--</span>Expand military-to-military exchanges with Russia at operational facilities to include notification of satellite launches and divulging of information concerning procedures for control, doctrine and technologies of command and control architecture<br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;"> </span>--Offer Russia early warning data to create a joint data exchange center<br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">--</span>Expand the cooperative threat production program with Russia<br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">--</span>Install Launch Warning Sensors on the U.S. arsenal and offer to provide the same for Russia<br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">--</span>Offer Russia to forgive all of their debt owed to the United States in exchange for the establishment of a fund to rebuild russia’s nuclear infrastructure<br />

JDEC solves<br />
Ford 8<br />
“In light of these various considerations” “being more dangerous than helpful”<br />
<br />
Tech sharing and transparency solve accidental launch<br />
Slocombe 8<br />
“To whatever degree this requirement of” “making nuclear over-reaction more likely”<br />
<br />
Expansion of CTR solves theft<br />
Rudney and Stanley 2k<br />
“Expansion of the CTR (or Nunn-Lugar)” “reducing risks of proliferation”<br />
<br />
More evidence proves that creating a joint data exchange center would solve accidental launch, prolif, and build mutual trust between the US and Russia<br />
Zolotarev April 2009 “The Prospect of Universal Complete Nuclear Disarmament,” Occasional Paper No. 15 online<br />
“At the same time…would be reduced.”<br />
<br />
The NB is deterrence—nuclear deterrence is credible now because of ambiguity concerning alert and launch status. The plan resolves ambiguity crushing deterrence. Our DA is much ore probable than the risk of acciental launch, whih means the risk of a NB O/W the risk of a solvency deficit<br />
Ford 2008 “Dilemmas of Nuclear Fore ‘De-Alerting’” online<br />
“In an appreciation for…Russian nuclear policy.”<br />
<br />
The counterplan maintains the option for immediate response without affecting the ability of leaders to delay action until all information has been considered<br />
Low 1999 “De-Alerting the U.S. and Russian Nuclear Arsenals: An Unlikely Method of Arms Control”<br />
“Russian and American leaders…or unauthorized fashion.”<br />
<br />
The fourth thing our counterplan does is install launch warning sensors on U.S. silos and offer to do the same for Russian silos—these sensors provide confirmation of an attack, which means that even if false alarms still occur in the world of the counterplan, redundant data streams will prevent them from getting out of control<br />
Mosher et al 2003 “Beyond the Nuclear Shadow: A Phased Approach for Improving Nuclear Safety and U.S.-Russian Relations” online<br />
“Option 2 takes…early-warning systems.”<br />
<br />
The last plank of our counterplan offers Russia a deal to forgive their debt in exchange for Russia creating a fund to maintain and rebuild their nuclear infrastructure—this revolutionizes Russian nuclear security and solves the root of their advantages<br />
Fuller 2002 “Debt for Nonproliferation: the Next Step in Threat Reduction” Arms Control Today (January/February)<br />
“Indeed, “debt swaps”…oil prices more strongly.”<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Solves Relations EXT<br />
<br />
Enhancing communication builds relations<br />
Woolf June 2009 “Nuclear Force Posture and Alert Rates: Issues and Options” online<br />
“On the other hand…monitoring missile launches.”<br />
<br />
Join EW utterly transforms the relationship with Russia<br />
Carroll 2001 “Bush Can Open a Door to Peace” Boston Globe online<br />
“Steinbruner is a realist…of mutual annihilation.”<br />
<br />
Early warning assistance drastically improves U.S.-Russian relations<br />
Mosher et al 2003 “Beyond the Nuclear Shadow: A Phased Approach for Improving Nuclear Safety and U.S.-Russian Relations” online<br />
“Effect on U.S.-Russian…an attack is possible.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A2: Russia will say no<br />
<br />
Say yes – squo has already laid the ground work bc Russia likes it so much<br />
U.S. State News 9<br />
“The U.S. consulate in Podgorica” “meets increased U.S. security standards”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A2: Perm<br />
<br />
Military exchanges alone solve mistaken launches and reduce threat of first use – the perm collapses deterrence and stability<br />
Bailey and Barish 98<br />
“If indeed a Russian C3 problem exists” “provide deterrence and stability in crisis”<br />
<br />
<br />
Ambiguity CP EXT<br />
<br />
Maintaining ambiguity about the circumstances within which the U.S. would retaliate is a requirement for effective and credible deterrence<br />
Baker Spring (“Weapons of Mass Destruction: Current Nuclear Proliferation Challenges,” Heritage Lecture,<br />
“Commission also recommends that the U.S. and other…potential for the use of nuclear weapons.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ambiguity is key – only the plan eliminates uncertainty from the mind of potential aggressors<br />
William J. Perry, “America’s strategic posture: the final report of the congressional commission the strategic posture of the United States,” May 6 2009<br />
“second, the united states should retain calculated…U.S. choosing remains credible.”<br />
