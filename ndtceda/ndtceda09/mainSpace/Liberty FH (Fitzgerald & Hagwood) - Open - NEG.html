 This representation is rooted in Orientalist ideology – it extends the interest of the political elites and legitimizes domination<br />

Orientalism is the narcissistic locating of the so-called “Orient” as the mirror in which the “Occident” sees itself as the great power—if they are not weak, we cannot be strong—the use of the mirror drives the ambition behind all oppression and all violence. Napoleon and Mussolini show us that one form cannot be disconnected from another—to dominate the “Orient” is to dominate everything.<br />
Beard, 1979 (Michael, Chester Fritz Distinguished Professor of English at the University of North Dakota, Mellon Fellow in Oriental Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, &quot;Review: Between West and World,&quot; Diacritics, Winter, Vol. 9, No. 4., pp 2-12)<br />
&quot;<span class="Underline"><span style="text-decoration: none;">The parallels between Orientals, blacks and women are striking</span></span>, … and how we might measure that difference.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, we ask you to abandon participation in political discourses and work to de-Orientalize the self by denying the four dogmas of Orientalism. Only total rejection of political identities can avoid a resurgence of the framework of oppression.<br />

More importantly, how can one intervene … but it is a necessary recognition of what constitutes Indian actors.<br />
