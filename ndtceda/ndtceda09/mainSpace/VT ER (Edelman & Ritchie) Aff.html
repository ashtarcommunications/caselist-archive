<span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">OBSERVATION ONE: FINALLY, A NUCLEAR WEAPONS TOPIC!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">This resolution hails the </span><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">debate community to test it. We are presented with the question of whether or not the federal government should make change…<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>a call to master the simulation … to prove why our visions of alternate futures are superior. We are called to roleplay as the federal government to test the efficacy of different courses of action … to be actors – to put our humanness aside… to test the merit of competing ideas.<br />
Ronell <u>2005</u> <span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">(Avital Ronell [Prof of German, comparative lit, and English @ NYU]; <em>The Test Drive.</em> 190-193) </span><br />
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 115%;">To the extent that… <u>…into itself from distance or future.</u><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">In order to prove our hypotheses about the resolution, we are called to dive into a structure of incessant research… to find the “what is” of the Resolution. The Resolution becomes a testing site for our competing claims of value and truth. We must be cautious, however, because elevating the site of testing to a position of truth-confirming can replace the value of human life with the value of testing.<br />
Ronell </span>2005 <span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">(Avital Ronell [Prof of German, comparative lit, and English @ NYU]; <em>The Test Drive.</em> 5-7)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Whether you mean to prove… … <u>will to scientific knowledge.'</u><br />
<br />
If we follow the Resolutional call to test, we position our techniques of debating in relation to our literature base in ways that infuse politics with illusory values to confirm reality through violence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Our obsession with death to prove our claims in debate is the very thing that holds the structure of testing together. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Ronell <u>2005</u><span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 9.0pt;"> (Avital Ronell [Prof of German, comparative lit, and English @ NYU]; <em>The Test Drive.</em>8-10) </span><br />
</span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 115%;">The test, which belongs… … <u>the field gets heavily technologized.</u><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;">This obsession with the immanence of destruction is at the heart of the test drive. This impulse is perhaps most evident in the laboratories of the U.S. nuclear complex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The key to post-Cold War national security is understood to be caring for an aging arsenal through constant testing to fight the effects of old age.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Here, the personification of the bomb is so complete that the body of the bomb has replaced the human body.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>This obsession with testing to preserve a fragile arsenal ensures that the value of military technology will take precedence over human life. </span><br />
<span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Masco </span>2004 <span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">(Joseph Masco [Dept of Anthropology; Univ of Chicago], “Nuclear technoaesthetics: Sensory politics from Trinity to the virtual bomb in Los Alamos,” <em>American Ethnologist, 31,</em> 349-373)</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">Therefore, we affirm the resolution as a test site whose (de)merits itself must be interrogated before we evaluate the individual claims that the resolution asks us to test. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">OBSERVATION TWO: TOPICAL TESTING<br />
Our affirmation recognizes the test site itself as the place where we are called to determine all ethical claims. Only through this recognition can we even begin to pose the question of <em>not</em> engaging the test drive. Our affirmation considers the structure of debate as a site of experimentation, and recognizes our obsession with testing is also an obsession with violence. Our affirmation seeks to read the links between violence and testing through the topology of the test site itself.<br />

</span><span style="font-family: Arial; line-height: 115%;">The normatively secured test… … <u>disruption be at all possible?</u><br />
</span><br />
<span class="apple-style-span"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">UNTIL WE QUESTION OUR INCESSANT DRIVE TO TEST (i.e., our need to prove the reality and truth of the world), we will continue TO NEGATE LIFE as it is AND TO STRENGTHEN and SPREAD the prevailing culture of</span></span><span class="apple-converted-space"><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> </span></span><span class="apple-style-span"><em><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;">RESSENTIMENT</span></em><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"> and NIHILISM. Instead we must recognize that our truths and values ARE illusions and embrace them as such. The only question we should be asking ourselves--as debaters, people, beings-in-and-of-the-world--is how can we AFFIRM LIFE in any and every instance. In this sense, AFFIRMATION is the pre-requisite to life itself.</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></span><br />
