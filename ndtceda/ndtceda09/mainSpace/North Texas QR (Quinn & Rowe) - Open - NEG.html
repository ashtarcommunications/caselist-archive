BATAILLE K<br />
ACTION TAKEN FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE FRACTURES EXISTENCE AND BINDS US INTO A LIFE VOID OF CHOICE<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />

But what does that …and is transparence.<br />

ALTERNATIVE – VOTE NEG TO SACRIFICE THE AFFIRMATIVE. GIVING UP ON THE VALUE EXPOSES THE CRUEL HEART OF ANIMALITY THAT FOUNDS LIFE RATHER THAN DISGUISING IT BEHIND THE ILLUSION OF PURPOSE.<br />

The act of sacrifice draws both the object of sacrifice and the sacrificer into immanence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>To sacrifice is to rescue the object from the world of the profane – and thus demonstrate a fidelity to existence which is not limited by its need for utility<br />

THIS IS THE ONLY IMPACT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER – THE AFFIRMATIVE’S CONCERN WITH VALUE AND THE PROMOTION OF PARTICULAR POLITICAL PROJECTS ALWAYS DEFERS MEANING ONTO YET ANOTHER VALUE; ALWAYS LOOKING TO THE FUTURE TO MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD. CROSS-X DEMONSTRATES THE CLEAR TAUTOLOGY IMPLICIT IN THIS LOGIC. THE ONLY THAT WHICH IS SACRED AND SACRIFICED FOR ITS OWN SAKE CAN GRANT MEANING.<br />

LIMITING THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS ONLY GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DETAILS OF OUR NUCLEAR ARSENAL MATTER—THIS HEIGHTENS THE RISKS OF NUCLEAR WAR WITHOUT RESOLVING THE FUNDAMENTAL ROOTS OF CONFLICT. WE SHOULD REJECT ARMS CONTROL AND CRITICIZE THE UNDERLYING MOTIVES FOR WAR<br />
