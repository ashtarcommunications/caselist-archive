Year after year and round after round we continue to reward teams finding the newest or most innovative ways to get to nuclear war, the more the counter-intuitive the internal-link chain the better! Our communities fixation with nuclear war goes back to at least to the early 80’s – Mike and I weren’t even born yet but some of Mike’s first conscious memories are debates about the end of the world – but even in the shadow of the Cold War’s cultural production of The Day After Tomorrow, Red Dawn, and War Games debate’s nuclear disaster imagery seemed detached from reality and drew criticism. Debaters from the 80’s were fully aware how a focus on contrived nuclear war scenarios was stunting debates potential for policy decision-making, topic education, and a larger place within academia.<br />
Danny Povinelli, a former NDT debater wrote in ‘85 (Danny Povinelli, 1985 University of Massachusetts, Clarifying Water Policy <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Povinelli1985Water.htm" rel="nofollow">http://groups.wfu.edu/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Povinelli1985Water.htm</a>)<br />
“Debate is catastrophe. It begins …a potentially valuable forum.<br />
<br />
Debate is catastrophe. Whether your universal health care plan tanks the economy and nuclear war ensues (Mead’s 92), or your skilled worker’s receive immigration priority aff allowed Clinton to expand NATO and nuclear war (Orlando Sentinel 95), or hege avoided nuclear war (Khalilzhad 95) or your same-sex schools plan caused the GOP to “China-bash” and nuclear war (Straits Times 2k), or you solved hege avoided nuclear war (Ikenberry), or you cause investor crowd out tank the economy and cause nuclear war (Phil fucking Kerpen!) or you solved hege avoided nuclear war (Kagan or Thayer or …) or your aff to individually stand opposed to preemption has a .00001% link to the deterrence DA and nuclear war (Chris Crowe), or your prolif advantage avoids 40 nuclear wars (Mike Horowitz, seriously?!?), or terrorism and nuclear war (Pat Speice, well at least its not Horowitz… or Pomorski). Seriously. Nuclear War. Every Time.<br />
<br />
This would be funny… if it weren’t so damn sad. We are not helping debate fulfill its potential. We continue to reward apocalyptic impact stories that are met with flight for other pursuits and then mocked in hindsight. Sure in retrospect we can look back and say that sort of extremism is unrealistic, but the rhetoric of current politicians and how they make ‘wild accusations’ and ‘easily throw around dire consequences’ reflects how “debaters have gotten into politics now and haven’t changed their tune one iota.”<br />
Nick Schweitzer, former high school debater writes in ‘06 (Nick Schweitzer, Software Consultant in the Milwaukee area. Among various geeky pursuits, he also likes to think he’s a political pundit. “Everything Causes Nuclear War” Janary 24, 2006 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nickschweitzer.net/2006/01/25/EverythingCausesNuclearWar.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nickschweitzer.net/2006/01/25/EverythingCausesNuclearWar.aspx</a>)<br />
I have another geeky confession to make. …everything leads to nuclear war damnit!<br />
<br />
It's amazing how easy it is to chain a few quotes from different people together in order to link anything to nuclear war. Debate is always already rushing to the biggest impacts, the highest body count – this morbid and detached fascination with nuclear catastrophe as game should be read as participation in, and perpetuation of, a “death culture” that celebrates human tragedies. Here rationality and objectivity are tools that conceal what would be moral outrage.<br />
<br />
We must critically examine our own discursive practices – the language we use has inevitable material and political consequences. We must turn a reflexive eye to how we unkthinkingly use language that does violence to others. Debate after all, is only a collection of shared understandings and explicit or implicit rules for interaction. Wins and losses are our currency, and we should use this place, space, and time – the alternative is forfeiting the only power we have. We may not be able to immediately enact federal policy, but we can change the community that we participate in.<br />
<br />
Rebecca Bjork, former college debater, coach, and professor in ‘93 (former college debater and former associate professor at the University of Utah, where she taught graduate and undergraduate courses in Communication and Women in Debate, Reflections on the Ongoing Struggle, Debater's Research Guide 1992-1993: Wake Forest University.Symposium, web.archive.org/web/20011012220529/members.aol.com/womynindebate/article3.htm)<br />
While reflecting on my experiences …real power that we have.<br />
<br />
It is imperative that we critically examine our own discourse practices with an eye to how our language does violence to others. The explosion in nuclear discourse is the ‘becoming sublime’ of nuclear weapons – there is a proliferation in discussions not in missiles or warheads. Producing a thrill in triumph surviving an imagined nuclear winter and enacting the destruction – repeatedly calculating, mapping, surviving.<br />
<br />
In this formation we could accidentally or intentionally destroy the entire world, and this requires the state to perform surveillance, manage, and do violence to populations. Or, if you speak Foucault: “The agencies of a nuclear state are visibly possessed, in other words, of the authority to subject to horrifying death entire populations, and to do so as if on their own behalf… Nuclear weapons—both signify and stand in for—the capacity of modern agencies of power to monitor, sustain, and fully articulate our being-in-the-world.”<br />
<br />
Coviello, 2000<br />
Peter, Professor of English at Bowdoin, Queer Frontiers, ed. Boone et al. page 46-<br />
But before we allow this …being-in-the-world.<br />
<br />
The nuclear seems to be more a matter of the proliferation of discussion, of rhetoric and exegesis, than of arms or bomb shelters. Debate may in give us the occasional ‘expert’ (or expert in training) on nuclear proliferation (Mike Horowitz though, seriously!?) but the discussions that take place in rounds are far from the accuracy and realistic assessments which direct real world policy making.<br />
<br />
Don’t buy any of the neg’s risk analysis good shwangle – debate isn’t interested in accuracy, and shouldn’t be read as forecasting, debate is interested in imagining as many possible futures as you can possibly speculate.<br />
Marieke De Goede, April 2008 (Department of European Studies, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. “Beyond Risk: Premediation and the Post-9/11 Security Imagination” Security Dialogue Vol. 39, no. 2-3)<br />
Premediation is a promising … can only speculate’ (emphasis added).<br />
<br />
Premediation . . . is not necessarily about getting the future right as much as it is about trying to imagine or map out as many possible futures as could plausibly be imagined. Debate may produce predictions that come to fruition, but most of the squad rooms have seen more fanciful but ridiculous nuclear war/apocalypse scenarios that couldn’t pass a laugh-test, but were good for a few wins.<br />
<br />
Debate’s doomsaying is dangerous – even if it is good to discuss threats, and make security predictions, the way debate searches for the worst case scenarios is really just crying wolf. This breeds complacency when action is needed. These fear-based politics promote errors in judgment and preventative wars – history is on our side from Vietnam to Iraq. And anxieties motivate weapons stockpiling rolling back previous gains in a structural long term problem.<br />
Krepon 09 Michael Krepon is Co-Founder of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Diplomat Scholar at the University of Virginia “The Mushroom Cloud That Wasn't: Why Inflating Threats Won't Reduce Them” Foreign Affairs, May 2009 - June 2009 Pg. 2 Vol. 88 No. 3<br />
Predicting nuclear disasters was …United States and foreign intelligence services.<br />
<br />
Fear-based strategies lead to … costly errors in judgment. Debate is a place that prides itself on policy-making pedagogy. But we are continuing to produce too much stale discussion that is soaked in Cold War fear and ideology.<br />
<br />
Fear based politics are best used to block change, to protect the status quo, and to foster conservativism. We must move beyond the politics of the bomb if we are ever to allow for a politics of change. “United we stand” becomes code for ‘through fear we will not move.’<br />
Ira Chernus 2k2 Professor at UColorado-Boulder “Cold War Redux” Shared Governance: Pleas and Provocations October, 2002 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/JOURNAL/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.colorado.edu/FacultyGovernance/JOURNAL/index.html</a><br />
The most important … need ever change.<br />
<br />
As long as insecurity dominates the public landscape, there will be fear of change of every kind. In order to move beyond the problems of the status quo we must be able to criticize fundamental structures and parameters of situations.<br />
<br />
Any move to methodologically bracket out our discussion cannot be viewed as value neutral, it is the worst form of conservatism favoring the established order at the expense of the oppressed.<br />
Meszaros 89 (Istvan, likes Marx not Adam Smith. The Power of Ideology, p 232-234)<br />
Nowhere is the myth of …theory or philosophy can escape.<br />
<br />
Statement:<br />
<br />
This house should substantially reduce and restrict the role of the United States federal government’s nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
We obviously do not intend for the debate to revolve around a hypothetical enactment of fanciful advice from 2 University of Kentucky undergrads have for Obama and congress. It is far better to focus our efforts in the place and space we occupy. This is why we think the ballot should be a referendum on whether there should be a reduced role of nuclear weapons in debate.<br />

 Contention One: Same As It Ever Was….<br />
<br />
The Nuclear Weapons Topic is okay but I liked it much better when it was called the Mid-East Topic….or the China topic….or the Courts topic…or the Ag topic….<br />
Okay that’s a lie, no one liked the Ag topic….but when are we are not debating about nuclear weapons -- or more specifically nuclear wars – and the chance they will bring about human or even planetary extinction? In a very real sense policy debate has become exclusively nuclear-orientated – every issue of public policy viewed through the lens of how it relates to the always already imminent (and, yet, somehow unique) nuclear apocalypse. After September 11th, an escalation in the discourse of nuclear terror went orbital – the threat of superpower war and nuclear proliferation was magnified by the fear of a terrorist acquisition of nuclear weapons – while at the same time the nuclear weapons complex wants to normalize or make the existence of this weapons a banality of life – this discursive tension is an effective strategy to maintain the relevance of nuclear weapons in current national security policies<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 329-331)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not just a scare tactic and these nuclear weapons are do not exist in a vacuum – we participate in an activity that rewards those with the biggest impacts – we obsess over body counts and collect nuclear war scenarios from policymakers so that one day we might be successful enough become part of the nuclear glitterati and get our CSIS internship…<br />
But our sub-culture is not alone - we are merely a microcosm. We live a culture that preserves nuclear weapons as an essential part of its heritage – the bomb is a organizing principal in 21stAmerican life<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 17-18)<br />
<br />
<br />
This obsessing of the bomb through radioactive nation-building has its costs – for the activity, we obfuscate the central questions of each topic – whether we should have agricultural subsides is decided not by questions of economics or food security in themselves but only expressed as a function of how many nuclear wars they access. Many of us have spent most of the summer teaching high school students not about the chronic problem of poverty and homelessness in the US but how the states counterplan and politics will peel off those issues so we can focus clearly on the impact calculus. Just as we ignore the in-depth debates about these (quote-unquote) Real World issues because of the looming threat of war, the nuclear weapons complex uses the threat of impending war to silence opposition in the public sphere to nuclear weapons production and creates them as objects of banality to make invisible the systemic damage the nuclear weapons complex does on a daily basis in the United States.<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 25-26)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it is a question of those who are allowed to speak about and “know” nuclear weapons – to produce knowledge about nuclear weapons and nuclear policy - and the marginalization of those who are most directly affected by the nuclear economy: those who experience the environmental consequences of the ongoing Manhattan Project. Closing off who is authorized to speak in the debate over nuclear weapons policy promotes and polices a norm of secrecy that forecloses any meaningful way to democratically engage nuclear weapons<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, Assistant Professor of Anthropology @ University of Chicago, Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 336-337)<br />
<br />
<br />
The screening out of marginalized nuclear experience is prime example of a disinterested knowledge of the Other that is the enabling mechanism for the destruction of that alterity. All quote unquote pragmatic nuclear solutions attempt to fill in the blind spots in our map of all human interaction ensures that we can only see these marginalized voices as the targets of the bomb<br />
