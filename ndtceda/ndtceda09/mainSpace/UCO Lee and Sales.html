 <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">OUR FIRST ARGUMENT IS THE GENERAL ECONOMY</span> –</strong><br />
<strong>What we know as reality operates around the focal point of solar energy. The Sun shits energy in all directions. Energy is an amazing phenomena that under no circumstance wishes to be restrained. Energy pushes itself in whatever direction it wishes to go. To restrict energy is to operate in contradiction to its path. This explanation of reality gives the best explanation about the notion of violence. Violence is an inevitable part of life due to our relationship with energy, the most egregious examples of violence are related to a restricted relationship to energy. Our affirmative identifies with the nonproductive useless expenditure of energy as a better understanding of relating to violence, <u>Kenneth Itzkowitz explains in 1999.</u></strong><br />

<strong>Our squandering of the notion of good as a basis for action divorces the concept of war from the political aspects of it. War does not have to be reduced to policy instrumentality but can be understood in base as beautiful. This is</strong> <strong><u>Nick Land in 1992</u></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our Second argument is the catastrophe of the atom – </span></strong><br />
<strong>The relationship with nuclear weapons is an example of restricting energy to its catastrophic extreme. There is never an ability to expend the energy built into the bomb, the irony is that their existence is intended for non-use via deterrence. Arms races and weapons increases represent a massive investment of energy into a restricted economy instead of a general economy. The status quo’s ignoring of the relationship to energy makes nuclear use inevitable. <u>This is Fred Botting and Scott Wilson in 2001.</u></strong> </span><br />

<br />
<strong>Further, the status quo’s constant fixation on preventing death is a reduction of life to mere utility that divorces the relationship of humans to solar energy. This utility creates a slave morality which colonizes life and utility while reducing all action to instrumentality. <u>This is Nick Land in 1992</u></strong><br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our Third argument is expenditure </span></strong><br />
<strong>Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal.</strong> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: left;"><strong>In order to re-articulate the relationship between nuclear weapons and energy we advocate the reduction of the nuclear weapons arsenal through the expenditure of nuclear weapons in the act of war. This defies the status quo logic about the use of nuclear weapons by depleting them and all resources around them through useless squandering. <u>This is Allen Stoekl in 2007</u></strong> </span><br />

<br />
<strong>Our affirmative is an expenditure of excess through the expression of the violent fantasy of nuclear war. This is the best possible methodology to squander the notion of good and renavigate the flows of energies that are conserved into nuclear weapons. This is also the best possible methodology for dealing with violence that inevitably crystallizes itself in the real, <u>This is Felix Guattari in 1997 three ecologies, p 57-58</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong>THIS EMBRACE OF THE VIOLENT FANTASY OF NUCLEAR WAR ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND THE VIOLENCE OF HUMANITY DEEPER THAN ANY BLANKET CONDEMNATION OF VIOLENCE AND ATROCITY. OUR AFFIRMATIVE ALLOWS US TO LIVE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF VIOLENCE AND ALTER THEIR FOUNDATIONS. WE DO NOT RUN FROM NUCLEAR WAR BUT RATHER LIVE AT THE HEIGHT OF HIROSHIMA, <u>THIS IS MICHEL SURYA IN 2001</u></strong><br />

<strong>OUR ADVOCACY OF WAR AS EROS RESITUATES THE CONCEPT OF WAR AWAY FROM THE NOTION OF SURVIVALISM AND ACCUMULATION. THIS RESTORES A CONCEPTION OF LIFE THAT EMBRACES THE PAIN AND TRAGEDY OF LIFE IN A GLORIOUS DANCE, <u>THIS IS NICK LAND IN 1992</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong>FINALLY, BE CAUTIOUS OF VOTING FOR ANY OF THEIR IMPACTS – THE IGNORING OF OUR RELATIONSHIP TO ENERGY AND EXCESS CONDEMNS LIFE TO MULTIPLE MASS DESTRUCTIONS.

 <span style="font-size: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> We’re not here to start a revolution, to rail for the rights of the oppressed or to nab your ballot through ultimatums of nuclear destruction. We would rather be as commentators that seek to expose the true result of unbridled attempts at purity. These eschatological drives for perfection have historically ended in the death of the same systems they sought to protect. We see then the true, reversible nature of systems of limitation. These drives have manifested themselves at the level of international policy as well and currently in the form of nuclear deterrence. Our government claims to possess an unparalleled arsenal of destruction to protect its people, but the form this takes is the buildup and continual innovation of tools capable of destroying all life on earth. In our community this crusade for the ideal halts debate’s becoming and refuses the activities inevitable change. This risks paralysis.<br />
<br />
The violence you mete out is always the mirror of the violence you inflict on yourself. The violence you inflict on yourself is always the mirror of the violence you mete out. This is the intelligence of evil.<br />
It seems as if our modern preoccupation with procedure has finally triumphed over substance and content. This discussion &quot;concerns ways in which current regimes of quality control undermine the traditions of practice that are essential for the healthy development of disciplined and inter disciplinary learning and enquiry. Everyone in higher education should be in favour of quality, standards, lifelong learning, but these are in danger of becoming newspeak words: the more loudly they are trum­peted the more hollow they sound.&quot; <a name="_ednref"></a>[<a class="wiki_link" href="i.html">i</a>]<br />

Our affirmative stands in alterity from those practices. A necessary antidote to the logic of the same.<br />
Traditional notions of education are flawed at the most fundamental level. A prerequisite to accomplishing the goals of their desired framework – the standards themselves held so dear under their interpretation of debate are entirely dependent on maintaining a community of scholars.... Not only is their method flawed at a basic level, but their embrace of the most insidious brand of nihilism guarantees that unending creation of ressentiment. <a class="wiki_link" href="ii.html">ii</a><br />

The incestuous obsession with finality and the ideal family is the same dive inherent within those desiring perfection within the world.

It is the secret failing of politics that it is no longer able to think evil. Politics is the site of the exercise of evil, of the management of evil, scattered into individual souls and collective manifestations in all its forms – privilege, vice and corruption.

We are pushed then to the state of our affirmation, not one subject to the conventional understanding of fiat but rather one inclusive of the alterity typically banished.<br />
<br />
This is an affirmation that “understands that it is evil that is intelligent, that it is it which thinks us – in the sense that it is implied automatically in every one of our acts.” It is “the form itself that is intelligent,… one can only bring out that form and come to an understanding with it” For with “evil it is not a question of an object to be understood; we are dealing with a form that understands us…” and it is the form itself that is insightful. <a class="wiki_link" href="viii.html">viii</a><br />

We might even say that those who deliberately practice evil certainly have no insight into it, since their act supposes the intentionality of a subject, whereas this reversibility of evil is the reversibility of a form,” a duel, immoral, and nihilistic form – “it does not aspire to any value judgment, it does not do evil, it speaks it. <a class="wiki_link" href="i.html">i</a>x<br />

 <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 10pt;">if critical theory is to be adequate to stopping nuclear annihilation, it must abandon its circular metaphysical occupation by thinking the rift between thought and action.<br />
we can negate it or think the second term positively. being is the ground of potentiality, the place rather than nonplace.<br />
Earth is divided in two roles, the productive and unproductive space. it is an end oriented mode of inquiry, the function of metaphysical thinking is ideological. this objectification domesticates the unknown.<br />
the desert is what threatens metaphyscis, it is nothing so it has no object. Nothing to focus on.<br />
This nothing is difference. american exceptionalism is based in denying this difference by trying to convert it into a something, by saying difference is a problem that can and must be solved in the name of truth. These heirarchized binaries allows the first major term to demonize the second minor term.<br />
The response to US imperial policy is to accommodate or banish the desert-the US prefers to ban it.<br />
One example is nuclear testing on desert lands-land seen as empty so it is given use and meaning through the testing of nuclear weapons.<br />
An instrumental affirmation of the topic is a flawed view, it categorizes the world according to the dictates of late capitalism.<br />
The primary targets of warfare are the sovereign nations of indigenous peoples.<br />
We expand nuclear war to include every form of nuclear violence.<br />
The real catastrophe is competitive ongoing nuclear explosions.<br />
In naming those that are thought as invisible, we expose power.<br />
Approaching the world through certain frameworks limits questions and answers.<br />
Any definitive theoretical structure is problematic.<br />
This orientation reifies others and transforms us into something ordered and conquered<br />
We Infuse ontology into the topic<br />
We seek an undialectical beyond, beyond identity and national boundary<br />
Thus, we affirm the topical exile which resides in the resolution.<br />
We affirm the topic without policy, we believe in the topical nothing.<br />
Most think the topic is something. These affirmations are similar to the way international relations naturalizes imperialism.<br />
We affirm the topic in this room, specifically the nothing. We think the nothing positively.<br />
This is a way to refuse to play by imperialism’s logic, but also take other action.<br />
In this unequal world, injustice and balance of power always rules.<br />
We refuse to consent to American imperialism, we refuse the occularcentric pattern of destruction.<br />
We refuse to understand the European concept of war between nations<br />
We are a specific tactic to subvert binaries.<br />
Use your ballot to affirm the topical exile, think the second term positively.</span><br />
<br />
Malcolm has seen the affirmative a number of times and has a really good description of the aff, but here's a bit more:<br />
<br />
following many of our spanos arguments, we affirm the topical nothing.<br />
<br />
Reading from Authors like John Beck, Masahide Kato and Valerie Kuletz we notice the metaphysical path when confronted by the trope of the desert operates under the same metaphysical dictates as many practices of insturmental, &quot;topical&quot; debate.<br />
<br />
Spanos says that in context of nuclear weapons we must begin to think this space of in-between, this rift. He frames our current sociopolitical occasion as a time of in-between as well - a no more of the gods that have fled and the not yet of the god that is coming in contrast to fukyama's representation of this time as the end of history.<br />
<br />
We also read from Robert Marzec who talks about our relationship to the land - it shows the way capital is grafted onto landscapes.<br />
<h3 id="toc8"><a name="Speaking Evil Affirmative (read at the Texas Swings):-ROUND 7 UTD-1ac description"></a><strong><a name="UCO Koslow and Spurlock Aff-IN THE DESERT-1ac description"></a>1ac description</strong></h3>
 The aff indicts Western metaphysics' desire to create the world into binaries, with one being considered full and productive and the other void of value, fit to be objectified and abused. This has been the root of American imperialism, with things like nuclear testing, mining, and waste all being done in the desert. This is because the desert is seen as absent of life and value-the unproductive end of a binary. The affirmative affirms the nothing of the resolution, acknowledging that any metaphysical statement contains within it both a supposedly filled material logic and a space of emptiness that is glossed over, and thus becomes an exceptional space that must be conquered or made productive. Affirming the desert is key because it is devoid of metaphysics. Theory has for too long abandoned the category of ontology, so we must begin there. The debate doesn't leave the room all that matters is how we are trained to act.<br />

<br />
Some other thoughts: 1AC seems to identify a main problem as being the placement of identity before difference instead of vice-versa<br />
<br />
Also lots of talk about the &quot;condition of possibility&quot;, indicating that a mimetic orientation is problematic. By affirming nothing, this chain of mimetic reproduction (or production) can be broken</span>
