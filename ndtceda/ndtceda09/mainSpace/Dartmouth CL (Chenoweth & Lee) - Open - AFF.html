4. Disarming first strikes are perceived as impossible- -thousands of missiles, spread out command centers, and unpredictable flight times maintain deterrence<br />

Q7. Is &quot;RLOAD&quot; easier to implement in terms of existing deterrence doctrine, then?<br />
I could take your question two ways. One is &quot;would the technical changes be easier?&quot; and the other &quot;would the effect on deterrence be less: which would leave......<br />
launch on warning is hardly feasible.<br />

 1. Case outweighs – War with Russia is the only scenario for extinction, and the risk increases daily as we have political tensions with Russia and 1000 cyberattacks are made a day. That’s Arbatov and Blair.<br />
<br />
2. Disarming first strikes are perceived as impossible- no threat to extended deterrence<br />

Q7. Is &quot;RLOAD...Therefore deterrence is not significantly affected.<br />

3. Would the public understand ...nuclear is not one of them.<br />
<br />
5. No Japan prolif—public opposition, no way to test, international opposition, politically weak hawks.<br />

<br />
It sounds plausible. After all, Japan is one ..........<br />
<span class="DebateUnderline"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">risk that Japan will go nuclear is not one of them</span></span>.
