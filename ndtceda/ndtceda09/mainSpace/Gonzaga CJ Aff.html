CONTENTION ONE – SACRIFICE<br />
Waste and Sacrifice describe the constant state of matter in the Milky Way. Objectivity, utility and scarcity are undermined by explosive speed of the universe and the abundance of the suns energy. Our political gaming must reflect this cosmological inevitability.<br />
Bataille, 1938<br />
Georges, Writer and Librarian at <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Nationale" rel="nofollow">Bibliothèque Nationale</a></span> Annette Michelson, October, Vol. 36, Georges Bataille: Writings on Laughter, Sacrifice, Nietzsche, Un- Knowing (Spring, 1986), pp. 75-78<br />
<br />
To represent the reality of Earth …, it becomes the slave of loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
The nuclear arsenal wastes through self denial. Loss death and negativity are inevitable. Rather than turning our backs on these aspects of life we should push through waste to experience the glory of squandered opportunities and free ourselves from the crushing yoke of morality surrounding the Bomb.<br />
Batallie, 1947<br />
Georges, Writer and Librarian at <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblioth%C3%A8que_Nationale" rel="nofollow">Bibliothèque Nationale</a></span>, Residents of Hiroshima, Trauma: Explorations in memory, pg 227-234<br />
These distinctions will perhaps seem idle. … is born of this overturning like a sudden escape of light.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sacrifice through nuclear use and manipulation refuses both sovereignty and limit; locking politics into a world of standing reserve where heads roll like cabbages. From it's conception onward, the bomb's been based on stockpiled energy which refuses an intimate relationship with the world leaving us detached and imprisoned with a false sense of self.<br />
Stoekl, 2007<br />
Allan, Bataille’s Peak: Energy, Religion and Sustainability, pg 56-58<br />
Just as there are two energetic sources of economic value… and the wholesale destruction of ecosystems (today).<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan - THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE AND RESTRICT THE ROLE AND MISSIONS OF THE UNITED STATES NUCLEAR ARSENAL THAT ARE NOT ARTISTIC.<br />
<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO – THE SACRIFICE OF SACRIFICE<br />
Relating to nuclear arms artistically is an imminent experience that gets to the thing behind the thing. By engaging with the bomb for the purpose of artistic waste, rather than it's productive missions and roles opens us to the pleasure of the self as detritus floating in the world.<br />
Foltz, MAY 5TH 2009<br />
Mary Catherine, AN ETHICS OF WASTE: TWENTIETH-CENTURY AMERICAN LITERATURE AND EXCREMENTAL CULTURE, dissertation submitted to the Faculty of the Graduate School of the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ubir.buffalo.edu/jspui/bitstream/10477/363/1/Foltz_buffalo_0656A_10287.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ubir.buffalo.edu/jspui/bitstream/10477/363/1/Foltz_buffalo_0656A_10287.pdf</a></span><br />
The true success of Sax’s sculpture is …and the potential pleasures that this might offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan is key – only a planning that takes its goal of goallessness as the true end of it's efforts allows us to identify with our sacrifice. The deliberately planned waste of our time and our effort means that we see ourselves sacrificed which enables true sovereignty.<br />
Stoekl, 1990<br />
Allan, Professor of French and Comparative Literature at Penn State University, Truman's Apotheosis: Bataille, &quot;Planisme,&quot; and Headlessness, Yale French Studies, No. 78, On Bataille (1990), pp. 181-205<br />

Their critique of america scapegoats it and replicates the logic of anti semitism<br />
