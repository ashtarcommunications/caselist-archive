 Observation I.<br />
The Ethos of Militarism<br />
<br />
<br />
As war has become the organizing principle of society and politics merely one of its guises, the state has been transformed. Neoliberalism has become weaponized and complex technologies of control have been mobilized to marginalize dissent and debate. The university has become an intense site for the transmission of militarist values, symbols, and behaviors.<br />
Giroux, Pf. Global TV Network Chair in English and Cultural Studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, ‘08 (Henry A., Theory, Culture &amp; Society, 25(5), DOI: 10.1177/0263276408095216, <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://tcs.sagepub.com/cgi/" rel="nofollow">http://tcs.sagepub.com/cgi/</a> content/abstract/25/5/56</u>)<br />
<br />
<br />
This topic is consistent with that process of militarization. Among the techniques of militarization is the promotion of a rhetorical strategy whereby modern warfare has increasingly become characterized by a transference of agency from individual people to weapons themselves, impersonal scenario planning, or chains of command function to make nuclear war thinkable by reframing mass killing as a bureaucratic task. This dehumanizes participants in war and legitimizes their use by maintaining a military chokehold over all things nuclear.<br />

<br />
<br />
Technocratic nuclear discourse is discursive discipline - determining who may and may not speak, privileging expert rationalities, and providing for false dichotomies between the “technical” and “public” spheres. Fear of nuclear war enables the creation of a hermetically sealed, self-referential, exclusive discursive community that functions to protect the state from dissent by ensuring that only those who speak in the language of the state will be heard.<br />

<br />
<br />
The primary function of nuclear weapons is rhetorical – and nuclear weapons serve to discipline the populace and maintain an elite hold on power. Unpacking this question regarding a kind of rhetorical manipulation that prevents debate about the legitimacy of state practices is *the* essential issue for debaters to discuss. As a community based around fighting for the conditions to speak, debate and be heard, this issue is paramount.<br />

<br />
<br />
Our bodies have become the battleground upon which militaristic forces deconstruct agency. This discursive boundary drawing is a form of torture. Nuclear weapons become a rhetorical device in a discursive economy designed to make political subjects speak the language of the state or be dismissed and remain silent. This game of discursive loaded dice transforms political subjects into objects that are parrots of the state. In this dynamic, our bodies become obedient instruments of national security rhetoric – literally “speaking” the power of the state through our behavior. Nuclear discourse’s use of one’s body to substantiate the power of another is torture.<br />

Observation Two: The Military Context<br />
<br />
<br />
Nearly obscured by the tangle of expert discourses, chains of command, and scenario planning is the figure of the missilier – the individual in the bunker, on the sub or in the air who actually turns the key to launch the weapons that kill millions. Gunter Lewy, writing in 1961 reminds us of the missilier’s peculiar ethical position, the genocidal stakes of the issue, and the virtue of disobedience.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: The Ethos of Freedom<br />
<br />
Just as all policy debate is necessarily a persuasive act towards a change from the status quo, The 1AC is a persuasive act toward the question of whether the missilier should break with the status quo and choose not to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons. Our arguments persuade you to affirm the figure of the disobedient missilier. Affirming the figure of the disobedient missilier who would refuse to turn the key is a resistance to militarism’s rhetorical techniques. It is a re-establishment of ethical agency through the re-situation of the “meaning” of the body through an act that is a communicative gesture. The gesture reverses the dynamic of torture by refusing to substantiate the power of nuclear security discourse. It is not without consequence. Affirming missilier’s disobedience in the face of the disciplinary forces of the nuclear complex is a recognition and transgression of its normalizing limitations that is irreducible to political success or failure. Rejection of consent to nuclear murder through an act of disobedience communicates the &quot;ethos of freedom,&quot; the epitome of caring for others through care of self.<br />
Foucault, '84<br />
(Michel, &quot;The ethic of care for the self as a practice of freedom&quot;, interview Jan. 20 1984, conducted by raul fornet-betancourt, helmut becker, alfredo gomez muller. translated by j.d. gauthier, s.j. The Final Foucault.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand the ballot is a rhetorical gesture, as is our debating, as would be a refusal to turn the key. This understanding of the relationship between embodiment, gesture, and rhetoric enables a transformation of rhetoric itself into a practice of liberty. Our argument is not that we &quot;free&quot; ourselves or the missilier from military domination. Instead, our debating itself is an act that identifies a disciplinary rhetorical strategy of the state and posits a reversal of its meaning through individual agency.<br />
