<br />
Contention One: Preemption<br />
There should be no preemptive roles or missions of the nuclear arsenal.<br />
Deterrence, the operative logic of the Cold War, has given way to the new logic of preemption. This logic is based on an epistemology of objective uncertainty – it sees a world filled with omnipresent potentially emergent threats. These “unknown unknowns” can only be collectively defined collectively as an “axis of evil” to justify what would otherwise be considered crimes against humanity undertaken to preempt potential threats.<br />
Massumi 7 (Brian, a professor in the Communication Department of the Université de Montréal, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, Iss. 2, ProQuest, GAL)<br />
“Deterrence does not work across different orders of magnitude. … The operative logic will function on an entirely different plane.”<br />
<br />
Preemption of the unspecified “terrorist threat” instates a co-productive logic driven to constantly defuse potential attacks before they unfold- fear incites you to leap into action and trigger the production of what you fear. This isn’t just about the Bush doctrine- preemption is a self-perpetuating logic which expands to encompass and respond to ever-changing threats.<br />
Massumi 7 (Brian, a professor in the Communication Department of the Université de Montréal, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, Iss. 2, ProQuest)<br />
“The situation within which the logic of preemption arises is far-from-equilibrium by nature. ….a movement of actualization may be triggered that is not only self-propelling but also effectively, indefinitely, ontologically productive, because it works from a virtual cause whose potential no single actualization exhausts.”<br />
<br />
The logic of preemption has even influenced thinking about the role of the US nuclear weapons arsenal. Contrary to traditional notions about the defensive role of nuclear weapons, Stratcom’s new global strike command includes a preemptive nuclear option.<br />
Arkin 5 (William, writes frequently about military affairs, and is the author of Code Names: Deciphering U.S. Military Plans, Programs and Operations in the 9/11 World, “Not Just A Last Resort? A Global Strike Plan, With a Nuclear Option”, Washington Post, 5/15, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/14/AR2005051400071.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/14/AR2005051400071.html</a>)<br />
“In the secret world of military planning, global strike has become the term of art to describe a specific preemptive attack. … they are also having to cater to a belief on the part of those in government's inner circle who have convinced themselves that the gravity of the threats demands that the United States not engage in any protracted debate, that it prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”<br />
<br />
The impact is a permanent state of emergency- perpetual undeclared war. A new operative logic must be found to disarm preemption- returning to prevention or deterrence, or voting a particular administration out of office is not sufficient.<br />
Massumi 7 (Brian, a professor in the Communication Department of the Université de Montréal, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, Theory &amp; Event, Vol. 10, Iss. 2, ProQuest)<br />
“Preemption stands for conflict unlimited: the potential for peace amended to become a perpetual state of undeclared war. …...National security objectives will not be crystal clear, formulated in timely fashion, or fully underwritten by national will.”<br />
<br />
The normalization of the preemptive grants the State the exceptional power to let live and make die, reducing the body to a space of absolute war.<br />
Goh ‘6 (Irving, recently has been Visiting Fellow at Harvard University, where he worked on a research project on Balibar's philosophy of citizenship. He has also been Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore. His research emphasis is in continental philosophy and its intersections with other disciplines like politics, literature, and architecture, “Disagreeing Preemptive/Prophylaxis: From Philip K. Dick to Jacques Ranciere” Fast Capitalism, 2.1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/2_1/goh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/2_1/goh.html</a>)<br />
“To allow the normalization of the fatal preemptive would be to institute the legitimization of an absolute or extreme biopolitics…. the plan has been to charge them for altering the police log book to conceal the fact that they had mistakenly identified the victim as a terror suspect.”<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Wait<br />
<br />
Global Strike is a manifestation of the drive towards preemption which tries to exorcize the trauma of 9/11 by stopping the next attack before it happens. However, instead of resolving the fear of terror, preemption continues the trauma because it always fears future retaliation. You should repeat our disagreement with the preemptive to break its momentum and stop its normalization.<br />

He has also been Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore.

“An international organization representing police chiefs has broadened its policy for the use of deadly force by telling officers to shoot suspected suicide bombers in the head… preemptive renditions are now beginning to be slowly unveiled to have some sort of consensus from some European nations like the United Kingdom and Germany, and nations that have had supported these prisons such as Poland, Romania, Morocco, and Thailand.”<br />
<br />
Only the alternative of standing wholly outside the preemptive can dispel this fixed idea- we must project a force of unconditional disagreement with the preemptive to stop its normalization.<br />

“Fifty years after the text of Minority Report, the spirit of the preemptive is no longer confined to the world of fiction (or film—as in the case of Spielberg's adaptation, which is set in 2054 and therefore in turn slightly less than fifty years from now). … &quot;disagreement&quot; to dispute the breakneck rush of the preemptive as the normative condition of global peace and security.”<br />
<br />
Our enunciation of “wait” in disagreement with the preemptive is an interruption which opens space for other possibilities to emerge.<br />

“Disagreement here will be the enunciation of wait in response to the preemptive. … that possible chance and prophylaxis for the right to be alive, by saying that there is something not totally right about the preemptive.”<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Faith<br />
<br />
Threatening depictions of the inevitable future drive faith-based politics. Not in a religious sense, but because they lead to placing blind faith in political leaders. Faith-based politics apply the logic of preemption to civil society, acting to section off and contain potential dissent, a la the “free speech cages” at the DNC.<br />
Elmer and Opel 8 (Greg- Director of the Infoscape research lab and Bell Globemedia Research Chair @ Ryerson University, and Andy, associate professor Dept. of Communication @ Florida State University, Preempting Dissent: The Politics of an Inevitable Future, p. 9-16)<br />
“IN 2003 THE PENTAGON RELEASED A PLAN to create a terrorism futures market,” a predictive program that called on individuals to place bets on, among other things, where the next terrorist attack would occur. … focusing in particular on legal, rhetorical, and tactical (via protests) strategies to articulate a politics of hope in a climate of continued fear and insecurity.”<br />

Chapter One- The world we know<br />
Policy debate has become exclusivy oriented around the bomb and nuclear war—everything always already has issue specific uniqueness to end up in the ever present threat of nuclear apocalypse. September 11th escalated this discourse and mobilized it around the terrorist threat to our super power status all while the nuclear bomb a banal everpresent condition boring ass fact of life- we have been duped inot normalizing national security.<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, <u>Nuclear Boderlands: the Manhattan project in post-cold war new mexico</u> pg 328-31<br />
“a weapon has been developed that is potentially…and ambiguities within American military technoscientific self-fashining.”<br />
<br />
Our rush to accumulate the most specific the widest array, oh, the biggest impact is debate fetishizing the bomb, don’t get it twisted I want a CSIS internship as bad as my idol Jon Warden, but our community is not alone—we are one example of the American culture that organizes the bomb as a central figure of political life.<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, <u>Nuclear Boderlands: the Manhattan project in post-cold war new mexico</u> pg 16-18<br />
“While the nuclear phantasmagoria…both imagined and material risk.”<br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons are the national fetish par excellence- the international hierarchy of nation states is mediated through possession of a weapon designed to prevent its own use, here the bomb is an impassioned object linking the government, military, and scientific communities in the projection of national culture.<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, <u>Nuclear Boderlands: the Manhattan project in post-cold war new mexico</u> pg 20-23<br />
“to describe nuclear weapons as the national fetish…political, industrial, academiuc, and scientific relationships in American society”<br />
<br />
The nuclear uncanny always retursn in repression here national building, legitmation of violence and genocide become the toxic politics ties to race and class.<br />
Masco 06 (Joseph, <u>Nuclear Boderlands: the Manhattan project in post-cold war new mexico</u> pg 34<br />
“within the us nuclear complex…post cold war anxiety”<br />
<br />
The US is the country of the bomb- radioactive nation building has left us anesthetized to the fact that the US is the most bombed country in the world, all Americans participate in the nuclear complex, our bodies carry radiation from the fall out of thousands of above ground tests. There have already been 400,000 cancer deaths from the nuclear colonial project that targets minority communities for the most dangers experiments – we must shake the nuclear fetish.<br />
Masco 06 p 24-7<br />
“The strange new intimacy of life…and with them, new psychosocial realities.”<br />
<br />
The very logic of nuclear weapons is mad- we can see the alienation and blinding our senses to violence of the nuclear ages in operation upshot knothole<br />
Maco 06 (Joseph, <u>Nuclear Boderlands: the Manhattan project in post-cold war new mexico</u> pg 8-11<br />
“nuclear weapons, however, quickly became note merely…quite meticulously, blinded.”<br />
<br />
Chapter Two- a new , old, history<br />
We cannot conitue limitg nuclear politics to the realm of international relations—an ethnographic account of the varied experiences of us citizens callenges the idea of a stable national subject, unmooring the psycho social affects of nuclear nationalism, wrapped in national secirty and terrorist discourse- this is an act of resistance against apocalyptic violence currently normalized in american life<br />

<br />
To be clear, the roll of the ballot is to write a new history of the nuclear age focusing on the tactile, individual, local experiences in the nuclear complex<br />
<span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Masco 06 (Joseph, <u>Nuclear Boderlands: the Manhattan project in post-cold war new mexico</u> pg 3-5<br />
&quot;In a post-Cold War world, then, we might usefully interrogate ... American power in the twenty-first century.&quot;</span><br />
<br />
The Manhattan Project provides a uniqe site for exploring the &quot;state of emergency&quot; which gets everyday life caught up in normalizing MAD politics and where governmentality achieves producing instruments of apocalypse in order to stop it<br />

&quot;The historical process that registers each new &quot;catastrophic technology&quot; ... in order to even begin to answer such questions?&quot;</span><br />
<br />
Whether we choose to acknowledge it or not, we are all implicated in the violence perpetuated by the nuclear weapons complex. Instead of giving into the ultimately hollow impulse to &quot;change the world,&quot; you should use the ballot as a means of initiating a change in yourself. Only by centering our interrogations at the level of our lived experience can we make possible modes of relating to each other which do not fall back into the pattern of violent ordering<br />

Nuclear fear has colonized our thinking. It is mobilized to preemptively intervene in countries like Iraq, render people, torture people, assassinate people, and bomb countries to promote democracy. This leaves domestic docile bodies easily manipulated into non-nuclear events like 9/11 mobilizing nuclear fears turning the cold War state into an anti-terror state.<br />
