UNLV Round 1<br />
vs UNLV Subs Aff<br />
(T) Nuclear Weapons = Warheads - plan removes subs, not weapons (warheads)<br />
(T) Substantial = 25% - plan only remove subs from Russian waters<br />
Chernus K<br />
2NR - Chernus K<br />
<br />
UNLV Round 4<br />
vs Texas BS Missileers Aff<br />
(T) Nuclear Weapons = Warheads - plan says missileers will not turn the key, but does not specify nuclear missileers<br />
(T) Framework = USFG - plan fiats individuals<br />
Capitalism K - Foucauldian analysis fragments struggles against capitalism by denying focal point for class based struggle<br />
CP - Dont call individuals 'missileers' - bad to reduce individuals to their occupation, denies their self-worth<br />
2NR - CP<br />
<br />

2NR - Martin<br />
<br />
Wake Round 3<br />
vs Vermont Testing Aff<br />
(T) Framework<br />
Countervision - Endorse 1AC speech act minus references to 'nuclear weapons' - NB - 'Nuclear Weapons' = Dirty Words<br />
Counterplan - Do the plan without the term 'we' and allow the individual merits of full, immediate, unilateral disarmament to be considered - NB - collective identity bad<br />
Cap (K) - Links (Analytical) - product testing and educational testing prove testing is the wrong metaphor - need a wholistic rejection of capitalism to start the rev, testing leaves open possibility that cap may sometimes be accepted.<br />
Case - Deleuze answers<br />
2NR - CP<br />
<br />
Wake Round 6<br />
vs USC TNWs Aff<br />
(T) Substantially = 25%<br />
(T) Arsenal = Mass Noun - must effect all weapons, not just specific ones<br />

Case - Weapon Shift<br />
2NR - Chernus
