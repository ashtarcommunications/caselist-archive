<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><u>Observation I. The Ethos of Militarism</u></strong><br />
<strong>As war has become the organizing principle of society and politics merely one of its guises, the state has been transformed. Neoliberalism has become weaponized and complex technologies of control have been mobilized to marginalize dissent and debate. The university has become an intense site for the transmission of militarist values, symbols, and behaviors.</strong><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>This topic is consistent with that process of militarization. Among the techniques of militarization is the promotion of a rhetorical strategy whereby modern warfare has increasingly become characterized by a transference of agency from individual people to weapons themselves, impersonal scenario planning, or chains of command. Expert discourse functions to make nuclear war thinkable by reframing mass killing as a bureaucratic task. This in itself dehumanizes the participants in war, but also functions to control the dialogue about military matters to the advantage of military experts. Even dove-ish arguments replicate this discursive move.</strong><br />

<strong>Technocratic nuclear discourse is a form of discursive discipline - determining who may and may not speak, privileging expert rationalities that colonize global commons, and providing for false dichotomies between the “technical” and “public” spheres in other policy arenas. Nuclear discourse is unique in that fear of nuclear war enables the justification for the creation of a hermetically sealed, self-referential, exclusive discursive community that functions to protect the state from dissent by ensuring that only rhetors who speak in the discursive style pre-approved by the state will be heard.</strong><br />

<strong>In fact, the primary function of nuclear weapons is rhetorical. Unpacking this gateway issue regarding a kind of rhetorical manipulation that prevents debate about the legitimacy of state practices is *the* essential issue for debaters to discuss. As a community whose very identity ought to be based around fighting for the conditions to speak, debate and be heard, this issue is paramount.</strong><br />
<strong>Nuclear weapons serve to discipline the populace and maintain elite hold on power. This is fundamentally at odds with the principle of debate and public deliberation.</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>This discursive boundary drawing enables nuclear weapons to function as a form of torture. Nuclear weapons become a a rhetorical device in a discursive economy designed to make political subjects speak the language of the state or be dismissed and remain silent. This game of discursive loaded dice transforms political subjects into objects that are parrots of the state. In this dynamic, our bodies become obedient instruments of national security rhetoric – literally “speaking” the power of the state through our behavior and gestures. Our bodies have become the battleground upon which militaristic forces deconstruct agency. Nuclear discourse’s use of one’s body to substantiate the power of another is torture.</strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial;"><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Observation Two: The Military Context</strong><br />
<strong>Nearly obscured by the tangle of expert discourses, chains of command, and scenario planning is the figure of the missilier – the individual in the bunker, on the sub or in the air who actually turns the key to launch the weapons that kill millions. Gunter Lewy, writing in 1961 reminds us of the missilier’s peculiar ethical position, the genocidal stakes of the issue, and the virtue of disobedience.</strong><br />

<strong>Observation 3: The Ethos of Freedom</strong><br />
<strong>Just as all policy debate is necessarily a persuasive act towards a change from the status quo, The 1AC is a persuasive act toward the question of whether the missilier should break with the status quo and choose not to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons. Our arguments persuade you to affirm the figure of the disobedient missilier. Affirming the figure of the disobedient missilier who would refuse to turn the key is a resistance to militarism’s rhetorical techniques. It is a re-establishment of ethical agency through the re-situation of the “meaning” of the body through an act that is a communicative gesture. The gesture reverses the dynamic of torture by refusing to substantiate the power of nuclear security discourse. It is not without consequence. Affirming missilier’s disobedience in the face of the disciplinary forces of the nuclear complex is a recognition and transgression of its normalizing limitations that is irreducible to political success or failure. Rejection of consent to nuclear murder through an act of disobedience communicates the &quot;ethos of freedom,&quot; the epitome of caring for others through care of self.</strong><br />
<strong>Foucault, '84</strong> (Michel, &quot;The ethic of care for the self as a practice of freedom&quot;, interview Jan. 20 1984, conducted by raul fornet-betancourt, helmut becker, alfredo gomez muller. translated by j.d. gauthier, s.j. The Final Foucault.)<br />
<strong>Our arguments seeking endorsement of the figure of the disobedient missilier understand that the ballot is a rhetorical gesture, as is our debating, as would be a refusal to turn the key. This understanding of the relationship between embodiment, gesture, and rhetoric enables a transformation of rhetoric itself into a practice of liberty. Our argument is not that we &quot;free&quot; ourselves or the missilier from military domination. Instead, our debating itself is an act that identifies a disciplinary rhetorical strategy of the state and posits a reversal of its meaning through individual agency.</strong><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Recuperating the figure of the missileer is a necessary imaginative act, a necessary sort of fantasy, for tearing down the rhetorical screen upon which the messages of the weapons and the contingency plans are projected. The essential fiction maintaining the weapons' power and the chain of command's power is that the individual's body is truly subjected to that power in a way that is somehow beyond rhetoric, this furthers the fiction that the individual has no choice. Our argument is that voting aff is a gesture in favor of individual agency because it results in a self-fashioned rhetorical re-situation of the self. Recuperation of the agency of the figure of the missileer through rhetoric is a step toward recuperation of our own agency as debaters through rhetoric and of rhetoric as a democratic and affirmative practice.</strong></span><br />

 Observation one is the Iron Curtain-<br />
<br />
The way we think about nuclear weapons is inextricably tied to a narrative of techno-strategic discourse that creates “terministic screens” that strategically construct our nuclear reality in ways that domesticate nuclear weapons use. This systematic disenfranchisement of the public sphere from the very language of nuclear decision-making places our collective future in the hands of puppet officials and techocrats who obfuscate their ethics for simply “getting the job done.”<br />

<br />
Observation two is the Tech-not-so-strategic situation -<br />
Our bodies are the battlegrounds upon which the war for consent to militerism is fought – and the weapons used by the state is a rhetoric which connects pain, fear and statist ideology. Technostrategic discourse presents us with the option of “conform or die” – either we speak the language of the state or experience the silence of our own voices, we cease to have subjectivity, becoming objects of the state &amp; parrots to state violence. This denial of political consent accounts for nuclear weapons moral obscenity in the realm of warmaking.<br />

Furthermore, nukespeak maintains this genocidal ideology through modes of psychological brutalization and dissociation, by displacing responsibility for our individual actions on larger structures we are numb to their reprocussions. We become the doctors of Auschwitz, performing gruesome experiments while displacing responsibility on the Nazis. The decision to use nuclear weapons is no longer seen as a choice but as an inevitability that we could have done nothing to prevent.<br />

Thus Shikhar and I endorse the following plan:<br />
<br />
United States missileers should choose not to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons.<br />
We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as all policy debate is necessarily a persuasive act towards a change from the status quo, The 1AC is a persuasive act toward the question of whether the missileer should break with the status quo and choose not to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Our answer is an unequivocal yes – In the face of the atrocity of nuclear weapons, we affirm the disobedience inherent in refusing to turn the key – the missileer decision to disobey the orders of the nuclear bureaucracy is an infusion of presence into the weapons, a re-establishment of ethical agency, and a re-personalization of war.<br />

<br />
Our ethical framework is the care of the self – the individual’s manipulation of power relations for the purpose of self-formation, a delimitation of his or her ethical agency through an identification and reversal of disciplinary strategies. The missileer’s disobedience in the face of the disciplinary forces of the nuclear complex is a recognition and transgression of its normalizing limitations that is irreducible to political success or failure.<br />
Our argument is not that we &quot;free&quot; ourselves or the missileer from military domination. &quot;Freedom&quot; of the individual is not a pre-existing, natural state that can be returned to. Freedom exists only in practices of liberty. Disobedience is an act imbued with the message that ethics is the only practice of liberty and liberty the only meaning of ethics. Rejection of consent to nuclear murder through an act of disobedience communicates the &quot;ethos of freedom,&quot; the epitome of caring for others through care of self. This is a radical reorientation of politics that demolishes the barrier between ethical and political.<br />
