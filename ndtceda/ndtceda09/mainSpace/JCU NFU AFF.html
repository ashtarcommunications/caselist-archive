 Contention 1: Inherency<br />
Despite pledges of nuclear reductions, the Obama administration refuses to adopt a policy of No First Use, perpetuating the risks of calculated ambiguity. Carnegie Council’s Laird 2009:<br />
Laird 2009 (Burgess, Carnegie Council for Ethics and International Affairs, July 21, 2009) (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cceia.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0025.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cceia.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0025.html</a>) /bgb /8/14/09 <br />

There is another initiative that………… which are very much in the interests of the United States. <br />
United States seriously considers first strike possibilities. Butfoy 2008<br />

In 2002 US President George W ………..he Bush presidency, it may well survive it. <br />
<br />
US nuclear policy can end all life. George 2009:<br />

<br />
International insecurity today stems……… <br />
not even by God………….<br />
<br />
Additionally, the refusal to reject nuclear retaliation for CBW attacks will lead to a commitment trap, causing nuclear war. Sagan 2000:<br />
Sagan 2000 (Scott, Co-Director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University) International Security Spring p. 85-115 /bgb 7/22/09<br />
The greatest danger …………..be measured against its strategic costs.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the US policy of calculated ambiguity, including its threats and claims of the essential nature of nuclear weapons, creates additional risks of nuclear war, leading to proliferation and nuclear terrorism. Daalder &amp; Lodal 2008 <br />

Now, nearly two decades after the end of the …………. with the changed threats it now confronts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The status quo results in additional distinct nuclear threats of nuclear war. Cirincione 2009 details four:<br />

<br />
It is often said that<br />
spread of nuclear weapons. <br />
<br />
The impact of nuclear terrorism against the U.S. could result in the end all life on earth. Corsi, in 2005, details the impact of a single nuclear device detonated outside the Empire State Building in <br />

More than 1.5 million people ….. apocalypse would be upon us. <br />
<br />
Terrorists use of nuclear weapons would cause a nuclear war. Fischer 2008: <br />

At the beginning of the 21st century, …. . Pakistan would, most likely, no longer be an isolated case.<br />
<br />
Additional proliferation increases the risk of war and the logic MAD no longer holds. Each proliferation massively increases the risk of nuclear war. Kissinger 2009<br />
(Henry Kissinger, 2/7/09, 56th United States Secretary of State, Newsweek, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/183673/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsweek.com/id/183673/</a>) /bgb 8/15/09<br />
The calculations …. it can never happen again?<br />
<br />
Evan a small scale, regional nuclear war would kill more than a billion people and devastate the planet’s atmosphere. Fraser et al 2009:<br />

State-of-the-…. and Pakistan, or Israel.<br />
<br />
But, there is no guarantee that a nuclear war will be limited. The result is the end of humanity. Cirkovic 2008:<br />

<br />
A nuclear war imperils all ………undoing of the human enterprise.<br />
There we have the following Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal through the adoption of a No First Use of nuclear weapons policy, to be proclaimed by the President. The military will be charged to make all necessary changes so that the nuclear force and posture adhere to the principal of No First Use. <br />
Contention III: Solvency<br />
A US NFU pledge can uniquely prevent fast proliferation. Raghavan 2009:<br />
Raghavan 2009 (V.R., Lieutenant General V. R. Raghavan (ret.) is one of India’s leading military<br />
strategic thinkers.) In Abolishing Nuclear Weapons by George Perkovich and James M. Acton, Eds., Adelphi Paper 396. International Institute for Strategic Studies. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/abolishing_nuclear_weapons_debate.pdf%20/bgb%205/18/09" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/abolishing_nuclear_weapons_debate.pdf /bgb 5/18/09</a><br />
<br />
Inability to agree by 2010 …… and opprobrium that would follow. <br />
NFU also provides a strong deterrent to nuclear terrorism. Sagan 2009:<br />
Scott D. Sagan, co-director of Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, 6/09, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://0-www.informaworld.com.library.jcu.edu/smpp/title%7Edb=all%7Econtent=t713659919%20%5C%20_top%20%5C%20Click%20to%20go%20to%20publication%20home" rel="nofollow">Survival</a>, Volume <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://0-www.informaworld.com.library.jcu.edu/smpp/title%7Edb=all%7Econtent=t713659919%7Etab=issueslist%7Ebranches=51%20%5C%20v51%20%5C%20_top%20%5C%20Click%20to%20view%20volume" rel="nofollow">51</a>, Issue <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://0-www.informaworld.com.library.jcu.edu/smpp/title%7Edb=all%7Econtent=g911475142%20%5C%20_top%20%5C%20Click%20to%20view%20issue" rel="nofollow">3 </a>pages 163-182, JBB 7/21/09<br />
It has been widely argued, ……. these weapons in the first place. <br />
<br />
Additionally, NFU provides 100% solvency for the commitment trap, eliminating the possibility of US first strike. Sagan 2000:<br />
Sagan 2000 (Scott, Co-Director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University) International Security Spring p. 85-115 /bgb 7/22/09<br />
The U.S. government should not ………. be certain, swift, and devastating.”<br />
<br />
We’ll always provide superior solvency, because even if wars break out, NFU guarantees unique escalation control. Peng &amp; Rong 2009<br />
<br />
(Peng = editor-in-chief of Strategic Sciences &amp; Rong = Ph.D. candidate at Institute of International Strategy and Development, Tsinghua Uni­versity.) China Security, Winter 2009 Nuclear No-First-Use Revisited<br />
<br />
In crisis situations, both first-use …………. exerts great restraint in its response and has not wavered in its unilateral NFU policy.<br />
NFU provides immediate solvency. Laird 2009:<br />
Laird 2009 (Burgess, Carnegie Council for Ethics and International Affairs, July 21, 2009) (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cceia.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0025.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cceia.org/resources/articles_papers_reports/0025.html</a>) /bgb /8/14/09 <br />

Advocates of no first ……….. bolster non-proliferation efforts.
