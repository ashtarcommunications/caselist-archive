AMBASSADOR JAMES GOODBY: Thank you, Daryl and thank all of you for coming out. After five decades of talk, as our president said, it’s refreshing to see so many people interested in this subject, which to me is worth five decades if we can achieve some results at the end of it. I think this is one of those good news/bad news stories that we’re telling here on the platform. We’ve heard very good news from the two previous speakers. Now, I’d like to tell you a little bad news, which in a word is that the nonproliferation regime, which we’ve tried to build up over five decades, has deteriorated in the last 10 years or so. Just think about it. Just mention a few names: North Korea, Iran, Syria, A.Q. Khan. I don’t need to elaborate. Those names speak for themselves. <u>The splits between nuclear haves and have-nots have widened, and even my use of those terms shows you what the roots of the problem really are. The basic bargain of the Nonproliferation Treaty has lost credibility</u>. <strong><u>People don’t believe that it’s still operative</u></strong>. <u>The 2005 Nonproliferation</u> <strong><u>Treaty</u></strong> <u>review conference was close to a disaster</u>. The U.N. summit meeting of that same year failed to reach agreement on measures to strengthen the nonproliferation regime, a real disgrace in the words of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. <u>The renaissance in civil nuclear power is poised to spread technology and materials around the world in the next decades. Is it going to be safeguarded? The additional protocols of the IAEA are still a long way from becoming universals</u>. <u>Tensions in the Middle East and South Asia have risen, no end in sight</u>. <u>As summed up by</u> George <u>Shultz</u>, Henry <u>Kissinger</u>, Bill <u>Perry and</u> Sam<u>Nunn</u> in their Wall Street Journal article of a couple of years ago, and I quote, “<u>The world is now on the precipice of a new and dangerous nuclear era</u>,” unquote. They believed – I think they still believe – that reliance on <strong>nuclear</strong> weapons for deterrence is “increasingly hazardous and decreasingly effective,” their words. <u>A comprehensive effort to revitalize and restore credibility for the nonproliferation regime is needed, desperately needed and</u> <strong><u>a Comprehensive Test ban Treaty must be part of it</u></strong>. Daryl Kimball mentioned General Shalikashvili’s report and I’d like to say a bit more about that. General Shalikashvili was asked in the year 2000, after the Senate had turned down the Comprehensive <strong>Test ban</strong> <strong>Treaty</strong>, to talk to senators, and Nancy Gallagher and I accompanied General Shalikashvili. I think Nancy is in the room. We talked to at least a third of the Senate, people that we thought would be influential and we wanted to hear their views. And as a result of all those discussions, General Shalikashvili prepared a report, which he presented to President Clinton in 2001 in January. The essence of that report was that General Shalikashvili saw the Comprehensive <strong>Test ban</strong><strong>Treaty</strong> as one key element in a network of barriers against proliferation – not a panacea in itself, but an element critical to the success of the whole project. As Daryl Kimball has noted, his report pointed out that <u>a Comprehensive</u> <strong><u>Test ban</u></strong> <strong><u>Treaty</u></strong> <u>would prevent the advanced nuclear weapon states from making significant improvements in their weapon stockpiles and it would prevent non-nuclear weapon states from entering into a nuclear weapon status, except perhaps through a primitive gun-type atom bomb</u>. I might parenthetically say here that Sid Drell was one of those who briefed General Shalikashvili about the effects of <strong>test</strong>ing and the effects of discontinuing <strong>test</strong>ing. And I think perhaps he might want to say something later about that particular aspect of it. Because General <u>Shalikashvili</u> <u>understood that what the</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong><u>powers do, in fact, does effect the decisions of other countries</u>. <u>And testing is perhaps the most visible of nuclear weapons activities. It amounts, in my view, to a signal to the world that the testing state has little or no intention of complying with the provisions of the Nonproliferation Treaty, and that it probably regards nuclear arsenals as a nonnegotiable element of its defense posture.</u> That’s what <strong>test</strong>ing signals. Now, <u>each state</u>, of course<u>, that is thinking about the</u> <strong><u>test ban</u></strong> <strong><u>treaty</u></strong> <u>has to make its own mind, make its own assessment of the effect of a Comprehensive</u> <strong><u>Test ban</u></strong> <strong><u>Treaty</u></strong> <u>because no agreement,</u> especially the <strong>nuclear</strong> field <u>can be considered risk free</u>. No <strong>nuclear</strong> weapons program itself is without risk for that matter. And that assessment is always in order. If the advantages outweigh the risks, one proceeds. If not, one does not. Now, General <u>Shalikashvili’s assessment</u> of the advantages for the United States was as follows. And I’m quoting directly from his report. I think from what Daryl has said, his report is at the back of the room. You can read it. He <u>said</u>, “<u>The</u> <strong><u>test ban</u></strong> <strong><u>treaty</u></strong> <u>will complicate and slow down the efforts of aspiring</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> <u>states, especially regarding more advanced types of</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> <u>weapons. It will hamper the development by Russia and China of</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> <u>weapons based on new designs and will essentially rule out certain advances</u>. <u>It will add to the legal and political constraints that nations must consider when they form their judgments about national defense policies</u>. <u>The</u> <strong><u>Test ban</u></strong> <strong><u>Treaty</u></strong><u>,”</u> he said, “<strong><u>is vital to the long-term health of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and will increase support for other elements of a comprehensive non-proliferation strategy</u></strong>. <u>The United States is well positioned to sustain its</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> <u>deterrent under the</u> <strong><u>test ban</u></strong><strong><u>treaty</u></strong>. <u>The verification regime established under the</u> <strong><u>Treaty</u></strong> <u>will enhance the United States’ own very capable</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> <strong><u>test</u></strong> <u>monitoring system and foster new techniques to improve verification.</u> <u>The</u> <strong><u>Treaty</u></strong> <u>will make it easier to mobilize domestic and international support for clarifying ambiguous situations and for responding vigorously if any nation conducts a</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> <strong><u>test</u></strong><u>.</u>” Much has changed both for good and for bad in the past 10 years. But <u>those assessments</u>, I believe, <u>remain correct</u>. Now, the past 10 years have shown us how unilateral moratoriums work and how they don’t work. We’ve learned some things about them. And one lesson is that instabilities are inherent in moratoriums. When any participant can drop out with little or no notification, an atmosphere of the temporary is inescapable. This makes it difficult to support institutions like the <strong>CTBT</strong> office that are essential, in my view, to the long-term consensus in favor of banning explosive <strong>test</strong>s. Another instability is that since there are no agreed standards regarding the scope of a moratorium, there are always bound to be doubts about whether there is a leveled playing field among the countries observing those moratoriums. And a third is that there is no agreed way to remove doubts about other nations’ actions: no on-site inspections, no transparency at test sites. The general expectation that a binding treaty is not in the cards obviously discourages any state that might be thinking about refraining from nuclear weapons program from doing so. I think, for example, that a <strong><u>CTBT</u></strong> <u>would be a higher barrier for Iran to jump over than is a moratorium, probably the same for North Korea</u> as well. I <u>think there is no real alternative to a fully ratified CTBT</u>, in short. <u>The importance of the context for a</u> <strong><u>CTBT</u></strong> <u>cannot be overstated</u>. President Obama has said that he will work to put us on the road to a world without <strong>nuclear</strong> weapons. What the end of a two tier system, if that is in sight – as I hope it is – my guess is that it will easier for CTBT holdouts to accept the <strong>test ban</strong>. I hope therefore that all possessors of <strong>nuclear</strong> weapons will rally around the vision of a world without <strong>nuclear</strong> weapons. It isn’t a simple or an easy thing to do, but it provides a goal and it provides a compass. It should help nations to think more positively about a<strong>test ban</strong>. But conversely, <u>if we can’t get a test ban and enforce the outlaw preliminary nuclear weapons is bleak.</u> And I wind up by paraphrasing a statement made by Shultz, Kissinger, Perry and Nunn, and this is it: <u>without a Comprehensive</u> <strong><u>Test ban</u></strong> <strong><u>Treaty</u></strong><u>, the vision of a world free of</u> <strong><u>nuclear</u></strong> <u>weapons will not be perceived as realistic or possible. It’s that important</u>. Thanks. </span><br />

<u>The status quo</u>, however, <u>is unsustainable with respect to nuclear weapons proliferation</u>. As former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn stated in calling for abolishing nukes, “We are in a race between cooperation and catastrophe.” <u>A US bipartisan commission on prevention of nuclear proliferation recently concluded, “Our margin of safety is shrinking, not growing.” The greatest danger is not the bogeyman of so-called ‘rogue states’ (Iran and North Korea</u>), the favored fear-mongering tool of, most notably, former US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, used to justify wasteful missile expenditures like missile defense (See Nuclear Umbrella? The Peril of Missile Defense, ICH, 10-12-06), but rather <u>the rise of failed states and its result that violent extremist non-state actors have ever-greater possibilities for getting the Bomb</u><u>.</u> Today, <u>Pakistan is the most combustible potential failed state</u>. Obama said in April that “in a strange turn of history, the threat of global nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of nuclear attack has gone up. <u>More nations have acquired these weapons. Testing has continued. Black market trade in nuclear secrets and nuclear materials abound. The technology to build the bomb has spread</u>.” Harvard political scientist Graham Allison’s Newsweek cover story (“Stopping the Ultimate Attack,” March 23, 2009) highlights the danger of nuclear terror and calls for a revitalization of the concept of deterrence. Allison, author of Nuclear Terrorism: the Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe and Nuclear Proliferation: Risk and Responsibility, surely recognizes that <u>the best deterrence is the abolition of nuclear weapons</u><u>.</u> Nuclear theorists and strategists should heed the call of former Pentagon chief Robert McNamara, who in 2003 acknowledged “it <u>was luck that prevented nuclear war” and catastrophe in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Luck may not save us next time. Nuclear threats now include: Al-Qaeda, the Taliban or other religious extremists getting nukes; India and Pakistan having the Bomb, with their bloody history and Kashmir dispute; a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, with numerous doomsday scenarios; more states pursuing civilian nuclear technology as a source of ‘clean energy</u>’ (but what do we do with the radioactive waste?) <u>leading to bomb-building; accidents like the recent collision of French and British nuclear submarines; misuse of the bloated nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union where poor safeguards, political instability and corruption have given rise to a booming black market trade in nuclear materials; nukes in the hands of one of many militant separatist groups; Iran’s firebrand leader running a reelection campaign on nuclear nationalism; and, North Korea led by a lunatic</u> who, impotent to meet the needs of his people, snubs cooperation at every opportunity, and whose only political capital is playing the international pariah. <u>The scenarios for atomic annihilation are many, and growing.</u> <u>The prospect of atomic annihilation increases daily as black market trade in nuclear weapons material and technology expands</u>. Today, <u>nuclear smuggler A.Q. Khan runs his own website from Pakistan</u>. International Atomic Energy Agency (<u>IAEA</u>) Director and 2005 Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohamed ElBaradei <u>calls Khan’s nuclear distribution network the “Wal-Mart of private-sector proliferation.” We now have a window of opportunity to act</u>, for as nuclear threats are spreading, voices of reason are rising. The past two years have seen peace activists and progressives joined by hawks like Henry Kissinger and statesmen like the prime ministers of Britain, India and Australia in calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons. And for the first time, a US president has been elected on a campaign pledge of nuclear weapons abolition. <u>Disarmament is best understood as a process, a way of progressing</u>, rather than an event, <u>the magical result of “zero” weapons</u>. The movement to abolish nuclear weapons aims to rapidly reduce the world’s nuclear arsenals so as to make nuclear weapons illegitimate. This movement is growing, <u>but time is not on its side.</u> As noted by former chief UN weapons inspector Dr. Hans Blix, “So long as any state has nuclear weapons, others will want them. So long as any such weapons remain, there is a risk that they will one day be used, by design or accident. And any such use would be catastrophic.” The fact is, <u>NPT is in shambles. The 2005 NPT review was impotent, and with its 5-year review coming next year, failure to make prompt progress may mean atomic anarchy. We must stop our nuclear hypocrisy</u><u>.</u> The <u>lesson drawn from Pakistan and India is that getting the bomb enhances state power</u>. Since these states tested their Bombs, over a decade ago, the perceived value of obtaining nuclear weapons has increased. <u>The lesson drawn from Israel is that the US approach to nuclear proliferation is</u>geopolitical and <u>hypocritical.</u> <u>All 3 of these states have flouted NPT yet received great benefits from the West. The only way to dispel these dangerous lessons and to secure our future is to take action in concert with all other nuclear weapons states to disarm</u><u>.</u> We most definitely should not be enabling Pakistan to beef-up its nuclear weapons capacity.</span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Krieger ‘9</strong> (David, Pres. Nuclear Age Peace Foundation and Councilor – World Future Council, “Still Loving the Bomb After All These Years”, 9-4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2009/09/04_krieger_newsweek_response.php?krieger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.wagingpeace.org/ articles/2009/09/04_krieger_ newsweek_response.php?krieger</a>)<br />
Jonathan <u>Tepperman’s article</u> in the September 7, 2009 issue of Newsweek, “Why Obama Should Learn to Love the Bomb,” <u>provides a novel but frivolous argument</u> that <u>nuclear weapons</u> “may not, in fact, make the world more dangerous….” Rather, in Tepperman’s world, “The bomb <u>may actually make us safer.” Tepperman shares this world with</u> Kenneth <u>Waltz, a</u> University of California professor emeritus of political science, who Tepperman describes as “<u>the leading ‘nuclear optimist</u>.’” Waltz expresses his optimism in this way: “We’ve now had 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It’s striking and against all historical precedent that for that substantial period, there has not been any war among nuclear states.” <u>Actually, there were a number of proxy wars between nuclear weapons states, such as those in Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan, and some near disasters,</u> the most notable being the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. <strong><u>Waltz’s logic is akin to observing a man falling from a high rise building, and noting that he had already fallen for 64 floors without anything bad happening to him, and concluding that so far it looked so good that others should try it. Dangerous logic</u></strong>! Tepperman builds upon Waltz’s logic, and concludes “that all states are rational,” even though their leaders may have a lot of bad qualities, including being “stupid, petty, venal, even evil….” He asks us to trust that rationality will always prevail when there is a risk of nuclear retaliation, because these weapons make “the costs of war obvious, inevitable, and unacceptable.” Actually, <u>he is asking us to do more than trust in the rationality of leaders;</u> <strong><u>he is asking us to gamble the future on this proposition</u></strong>. “The iron logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction is so compelling,” Tepperman argues, “it’s led to what’s known as the nuclear peace….” But if this is a peace worthy of the name, which it isn’t, it certainly is not one on which to risk the future of civilization. <strong><u>One irrational leader with control over a nuclear arsenal could start a nuclear conflagration, resulting in a global Hiroshima.</u></strong> Tepperman celebrates “the iron logic of deterrence,” but deterrence is a theory that is far from rooted in “iron logic.” It is a theory based upon threats that must be effectively communicated and believed. Leaders of Country A with nuclear weapons must communicate to other countries (B, C, etc.) the conditions under which A will retaliate with nuclear weapons. The leaders of the other countries must understand and believe the threat from Country A will, in fact, be carried out. <u>The longer that nuclear weapons are not used, the more other countries may come to believe that they can challenge Country A with impunity from nuclear retaliation. The more that Country A bullies other countries, the greater the incentive for these countries to develop their own nuclear arsenals.</u> <strong><u>Deterrence is unstable and therefore precarious</u></strong>. Most of the countries in the world reject the argument, made most prominently by Kenneth Waltz, that the spread of nuclear weapons makes the world safer. These countries joined together in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, but they never agreed to maintain indefinitely a system of nuclear apartheid in which some states possess nuclear weapons and others are prohibited from doing so. The principal bargain of the NPT requires the five NPT nuclear weapons states (US, Russia, UK, France and China) to engage in good faith negotiations for nuclear disarmament, and the International Court of Justice interpreted this to mean complete nuclear disarmament in all its aspects. Tepperman seems to be arguing that seeking to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is bad policy, and that nuclear weapons, because of their threat, make efforts at non-proliferation unnecessary and even unwise. If some additional states, including Iran, developed nuclear arsenals, he concludes that wouldn’t be so bad “given the way that bombs tend to mellow behavior.” Those who oppose Tepperman’s favorable disposition toward the bomb, he refers to as “nuclear pessimists.” <u>These would be the people, and I would certainly be one of them, who see nuclear weapons as presenting an urgent danger to our security, our species and our future</u>. <u>Tepperman finds</u> that when viewed from his “nuclear optimist” perspective, “nuclear weapons start to seem a lot less frightening.” “<u>Nuclear peace,”</u> he tells us, “<u>rests on a scary bargain</u>: <u>you accept a small chance that something extremely bad will happen</u> in exchange <u>for a much bigger chance that something very bad – conventional war – won’t happen</u>.” <strong><u>But the “extremely bad” thing he asks us to accept is the end of the human species</u></strong>. Yes, that would be serious. <u>He also doesn’t make the case that in a world without nuclear weapons, the prospects of conventional war would increase dramatically</u>. After all, <u>it is only an unproven supposition that nuclear weapons have prevented wars, or would do so in the future</u>. We have certainly come far too close to the precipice of catastrophic nuclear war. As an ultimate celebration of the faulty logic of deterrence, Tepperman calls for providing any nuclear weapons state with a “survivable second strike option.” Thus, he not only favors nuclear weapons, but finds the security of these weapons to trump human security. Presumably he would have President Obama providing new and secure nuclear weapons to North Korea, Pakistan and any other nuclear weapons states that come along so that they will feel secure enough not to use their weapons in a first-strike attack<u>.</u> <u>Do we really want to bet the human future that Kim Jong-Il and his successors are more rational than Mr. Tepperman</u>?</span><br />

READERS OF Mueller's judgment that policies aimed at preventing proliferation have been &quot;obsessive&quot; and &quot;counterproductive&quot; should be aware of his criteria for what constitutes an &quot;overreaction.&quot; In Overblown, he argues that America's reaction to Pearl Harbor was exaggerated. America's overreaction led it to declare war on Japan, when a policy of &quot;military containment and harassment&quot; would have been sufficient to pressure Japan to withdraw from its empire. <u>Mueller's claim that the quest to control proliferation has been &quot;substantively counterproductive&quot; misunderstands the impact successful policy has had in preventing</u> what would have been <u>catastrophic outcomes.</u> Mueller takes to task President John Kennedy's 1962 prediction that if states acquired nuclear weapons at the rate they achieved the technical ability to build bombs, there could be twenty nuclear powers by 1975. He argues the claim was exaggerated simply because it did not happen. But <u>the purpose of Kennedy's warning was to awaken the world to the unacceptable dangers of unconstrained nuclear proliferation</u>. The United States and other nations' refusal to accept those consequences motivated an international initiative <u>to create the</u> non-proliferation regime, the centerpiece of which is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty <u>(NPT). Thanks to this regime, 183 nations, including scores that have the technical capability to build nuclear arsenals, have renounced nuclear weapons.</u> Four decades later, there are only eight and a half nuclear-weapons states, not twenty or forty. (North Korea is the only self-declared but unrecognized nuclear state.) <u>The gravest challenges to the non-proliferation regime today are North Korea and Iran. If each succeeds in becoming a nuclear-weapons state, we are likely to witness the unraveling of the non-proliferation regime and a cascade of proliferation.</u> As Henry Kissinger recently said, &quot;there is no greater challenge to the global nuclear order today than the impending proliferation of nuclear weapons <u>and the increasing likelihood that terrorists may conduct a nuclear 9/11.&quot;</u></span><br />

<u>Nuclear terrorism could</u> even <u>spark full-scale war between states</u>. Such war could involve the entire spectrum of nuclear-conflict possibilities, ranging from a nuclear attack upon a non-nuclear state to systemwide nuclear war. How might such far-reaching consequences of nuclear terrorism come about? Perhaps the most likely way would involve a terrorist nuclear assault against a state by terrorists hosted in another state. For example, consider the following scenario: Early in the 1990s, Israel and its Arab-state neighbors finally stand ready to conclude a comprehensive, multilateral peace settlement. With a bilateral treaty between Israel and Egypt already many years old, only the interests of the Palestinians—as defined by the PLO—seem to have been left out. On the eve of the proposed signing of the peace agreement, half a dozen crude nuclear explosives in the one-kiloton range detonate in as many Israeli cities. Public grief in Israel over the many thousands dead ands maimed is matched only by the outcry for revenge. In response to the public mood, the government of Israel initiates selected strikes against terrorist strongholds in Lebanon, whereupon Lebanese Shiite forces and Syria retaliate against Israel. Before long, the entire region is ablaze, conflict has escalated to nuclear forms, and all countries in the area have suffered unprecedented destruction. Of course, such a scenario is fraught with the makings of even wider destruction. How would the United States react to the situation in the Middle East? What would be the Soviet response? It is certainly conceivable that a chain reaction of interstate nuclear conflict could ensue, one that would ultimately involve the superpowers or even every nuclear-weapons state on the planet. What, exactly, would this mean? Whether the terms of assessment be statistical or human, the consequences of <u>nuclear war require an entirely new paradigm of death</u>. Only such a paradigm would allow us a proper framework for absorbing the vision of near-total obliteration and the outer limits of human destructiveness. <u>Any nuclear war would have effectively permanent and irreversible consequences</u>.Whatever the actual extent of injuries and fatalities, <u>such a war would entomb the</u> spirit of the <u>entire species in a planetary casket strewn with shorn bodies and imbecile imaginations</u>.</span><br />

As these accounts suggest, <u>the risks of accidental and unauthorized use could be very high in emerging NWSs</u>, particularly during nuclear crises or periods of domestic instability. The prospects for proliferation are therefore especially disturbing because emerging NWSs will tend to be more unstable than the established NWSs have been.3° For example, all three of the emerging nuclear powers examined in this study—Iraq, Iran, and North Korea—have had significant risks of domestic instability. Although Saddam Hussein proved able to crush any opposition, he did experience a number of coup attempts (the most serious in 1992), as well as repeated riots and uprisings (in 1991, 1995, 1996, and 2000) during his time in power.&quot; And once an external invasion took place, all central authority evaporated quite rapidly.32 The risks of regime-threatening upheavals are much greater, however, in North Korea and Iran than in Ba'athist Iraq. As we have seen, neither of these countries has great prospects for political stability in the near- to mid-term.&quot; <u>In the event of severe upheavals or regime collapse, they could experience a rapid deterioration of their central controls over their nuclear weapons and related materials. Nor is it clear that simple command structures in emerging NWSs will significantly reduce the risks of accidental or unauthorized use</u>, as Seng and Karl contend. Indeed, as several analysts have argued, <u>the rudimentary command-and-control structures in India and Pakistan increase the likelihood of accidental or unauthorized use, particularly during crises. The Indian military currently has little experience in handling nuclear weapons</u><u>.</u> If India's nuclear weapons were given to the military during a crisis, they would be as inexperienced in preventing their use as they would be in using them.34 Moreover, because <u>Pakistan</u> currently <u>lacks an enunciated nuclear doctrine, reliable decision-making or communications systems, or explicit targeting information</u>, there is an increased likelihood that Pakistan's own troops might undertake strikes on their own.&quot; These are risks that any emerging NWS would likely experience as they worked to develop nuclear weapons, formulate use-doctrines, and establish command-and-control systems. But since many of the countries most likely to develop nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future would have to consider the chances of preventive strikes as quite high, they might choose to deploy (or be forced to deploy) their nuclear weapons before they have all these issues sufficiently worked out. In these instances, the simple command structures would not necessarily prevent accidental or unauthorized use, and in fact could increase these risks.</span><br />

(deepti, A Chance for Nuclear Leadership, Washington post, nov 7)<br />
Whoever wins in 2008, the most important strategic foreign policy issue facing the next President and Congress will be how to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. For almost four decades the world has been protected by a global agreement -- the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (<u>NPT</u>) -- which worked to keep the number of nuclear weapon states small. That agreement, and the world order that relies on it, <strong><u>badly needs U.S. leadership</u></strong>. There are <u>three reasons why American influence is needed</u>. First, the nuclear &quot;<u>have-not&quot; states, who signed away their right to develop nuclear weapons, don't believe that the &quot;haves&quot; are living up to their side of the deal to eventually dismantle their weapons</u><u>.</u> Second, <u>Iran's continuing refusal to comply with</u> International Atomic Energy Agency (<u>IAEA) obligations and legally binding UN Security Council resolutions undermines the effectiveness of a rule-based system for managing nuclear technology and threatens international peace and security</u>. And <u>third, as excitement over a nuclear energy renaissance grows, non-nuclear-weapon states in the developing world declare large ambitions to master the nuclear fuel cycle, a scenario the old rules didn't account for. But the regime can be saved</u>. Last month marked the eighth anniversary of the Senate's failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (<u>CTBT). The treaty bans all nuclear explosions in all places and provides an opportunity for nuclear weapons states -- China, France, Russia, the U.K. and U.S. -- to make good on their legal obligation to dismantle their nuclear weapons arsenals</u>. Forty-four states need to sign and then ratify the Treaty for it to go into effect. Pakistan, North Korea and India are the only three states not to sign. An additional seven states -- the U.S., Iran, China, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia and Israel -- have signed but not ratified. <u>U.S. leadership, in the form of Senate ratification, would pressure other &quot;hold out&quot; states to follow suit.</u> Opponents to the CTBT have three concerns: can cheaters be detected, can the U.S. maintain a credible nuclear deterrent without testing, and will the CTBT help prevent the spread of nuclear weapons? Political and technical progress over the last decade has reduced these concerns: The CTBT monitoring system detected last year's nuclear test in North Korea (twenty times smaller than the Hiroshima bomb). Government studies have confirmed that U.S. weapons will be reliable for 85 years -- twice their expected life span -- further diminishing the need to test ever again. And finally, the world's leading experts agree that <u>U.S. ratification of the Treaty would pressure other states to clarify their nuclear policies to the rest of the world -- including Iran, China, Egypt, India and Israel. Without the CTBT, it is difficult to imagine non-nuclear-weapon states agreeing to the tighter rules the U.S. seeks to reshape the nuclear fuel cycle and prevent the emergence of more nuclear weapon states</u>. <u>The CTBT would also freeze currently inferior arsenals in North East Asia, South Asia and the Middle East by cementing the technical superiority of the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal, while forbidding other nuclear weapons states from conducting tests needed to improve their own. Those who fear China as a &quot;peer competitor&quot; should jump at this opportunity. China</u>, already a signatory to the CTBT, <u>with no domestic political opposition, could ratify within months</u>. China could conceivably be persuaded to do so within the current negotiations with North Korea. If the <u>Six Party Talks' plan to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program</u> bears fruit and removes fissile material from the Korean peninsula, there should be few obstacles to securing North Korea's agreement to not test again. It <u>would be easier to achieve</u> this outcome <u>if</u> two of the six parties -- <u>the U.S. and China -- ratified the treaty.</u> <u>In South Asia, the CTBT could help to prevent the arms race that Pakistan warns could result from the Bush administration's pursuit of an unprecedented exception to both U.S. and global rules on nuclear trade for India. Securing Indian support of the CTBT could diminish concerns about India's ability to increase its arsenal. Pakistan, eager to keep up with reciprocal measures and gain the same treatment as India, could likely also be persuaded to do the same</u>. In the Middle East, Iran could ratify the CTBT as further evidence that its nuclear program is truly for peaceful purposes. <u>Whether Iran ratifies it or not, there is no doubt that crossing the redline of exploding a nuclear device, as the North Koreans did after withdrawing from the NPT, would only shore up international opinion against Iran and finally unify the UN Security Council to take serious action</u>. <u>The CTBT also represents another obstacle to thwart the nuclear weapons ambitions of Iran's neighbors</u>. Nine of the fifteen states that have announced interest in developing nuclear energy programs since 2005 are in the Middle East and include Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. They could follow the South African example of constructing crude gun-type weapons that do not require testing. <u>The CTBT would, however, inhibit efforts to develop more sophisticated arsenals because without nuclear testing these nations could have no confidence that their covertly and illegally developed weapons would even work</u><u>.</u> Moving forward requires recognizing that earlier concerns are outdated and that a world with a CTBT better promotes American interests than a world without one. It seems foolish to forego the benefits of the test ban. This is a strategic flaw that Congress should begin to address now in preparation for the next Congress and President.</span><br />

(Thomas and Max, Nuclear Weapons: A n Existential Threat to Humanity, CTBTO Spectrum 1, September 2008,)<br />
Sixty-three years ago last month, the beautiful city of Hiroshima was devastated by the explosion of an atomic bomb. The bomb released the explosive equivalent of 12,500 tons of TNT and killed – outright, or over time by radiation poisoning – nearly 75 percent of the population of that city. Three days later similar devastation was brought to the city of N agasaki, and a few days after that, the Second World War, the bloodiest and most destructive in the history of humanity, came to an end. <u>Capability to destroy the Earth several times over</u> <u>Many thought</u> then, and in subsequent years, that the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the harbingers of the future and that <u>nuclear weapons were destined to spread around the world and be part of future wars, threatening the survival of humanity. These views were reinforced by</u> the commencement in a few years of a vast nuclear arms race with both <u>the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>and the Soviet Union rapidly developing the capability to destroy the Earth many times over. Over 40 States have capacity to build nuclear weapons</u> President John F. Kennedy was one of those who feared that nuclear weapons would inherit the Earth. There were predictions during his administration that, by the end of the 1970s, there could be as many as 15 to 20 nuclear weapon States in the world, with nuclear weapons fully integrated into national arsenals. If this had happened, there would likely be twice or more that many today. I n 2004, for example, <u>the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed E lBaradei, asserted that there were more than 40 States in the world that currently could build nuclear weapons, if they so chose. Such a development would have placed the world community in a situation where every conflict would run the risk of going nuclear and there would be no way to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorist organizations.</u> Such an international security situation would have made today’s time of troubles seem like paradise by comparison. <u>Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty prevents catastrophe Fortunately, such nuclear weapon proliferation did not happen.</u> President Kennedy’s darkest fears of catastrophe were not realized. <u>The chief reason that this did not happen was the entry into force of the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty</u> (NPT) in 1970, along with the extended deterrence policies of the United States and the Soviet Union. T he NPT converted what had been an act of national pride into an act of international outlawry. In 1960, after the first French nuclear test in the Sahara, the French newspapers were overflowing with nationalistic sentiment: “Vive La France” and “Vive De G aulle.” Switzerland held two national referenda and the Swiss public twice voted to build nuclear weapons. Sweden had an active nuclear weapons research program. A fter the NPT was in force, however, when India conducted its first nuclear weapon test in 1974, they were condemned by the entire world and they had to hasten to declare that their nuclear explosion was “peaceful.” 184 non-nuclear weapon States agree not to acquire nuclear weapons The NPT essentially drew the line where the world was in 1970; it recognized five existing nuclear. <u>Non-proliferation in exchange for nuclear disarmament</u> But <u>the NPT did not come as a free gift from the rest of the world to the five nuclear weapon States; rather it is a strategic arrangement founded on a central bargain. That bargain was, and is, non-proliferation in exchange for the sharing of peaceful technology and nuclear disarmament</u>. Nuclear disarmament was perceived by the non-nuclear weapon States as the five nuclear weapon States agreeing <u>over the long term to negotiate away their nuclear arsenals so that ultimately all States would receive equal treatment under the NPT. A comprehensive nuclear test ban Since it was recognized that this would take significant time, the non-nuclear weapon States pressed the nuclear weapon States to agree to interim measures to include a comprehensive nuclear weapon test ban</u>, a prohibition on the further production of nuclear explosive material, a significant world-wide reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, and binding obligations not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear NPT parties. None of these measures 40 years later has been realized. O ne of these measures, which was seen in 1970 as a sort of litmus test which would indicate whether or not the five nuclear weapon States would, over time, live up to their side of the central bargain was a comprehensive nuclear test ban, which was included in the preamble to the NPT . Review conferences failed several times over the years because of disagreement over this issue. W hen the NPT was made a permanent treaty in 1995, there was a recommitment to conclude a test ban in one year - that is, by 1996. T he non-nuclear weapons States’ view was, and is, that, if they are going to give up nuclear weapons, the five nuclear weapon States could at least agree to stop testing their weapons. CTBT rejection contrary to wishes of most Americans A Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban T reaty (CTBT) was in fact agreed to and signed in 1996, but it was defeated in the U.S. Senate in 1999 and has not yet come into force - some 12 years later and some 40 years after entry into force of the NPT itself. T he U.S. Senate’s rejection of the CTBT in 1999 was, incidentally, contrary to the wishes of the American public. A poll taken immediately thereafter disclosed that two thirds of the American public disapproved of the Senate’s action. T his remains a problem. The next U.S. administration and the CTBT There are two periods in the four-year cycle of the A merican presidency when the United States is most likely to review policies and respond to the political exigencies of the moment: during a presidential campaign year when issues are raised, and during the first six months after a presidential election, when a newly-elected or re-elected president is generally empowered to carry out commitments made or judgments held. In that connection, Senator Obama has stated that he will support CTBT ratification and Senator McCain has said he will consider it. <u>Goal of eliminating nuclear weapons can be realized Since the publication of</u> two Wall Street Journal articles<u>authored by George Shultz, William Perry, Henry Kissinger, and Sam Nunn in January 2007 and 2008 based on</u> President Ronald <u>Reagan’s dream to eliminate nuclear weapons worldwide, the world community has taken new hope that some day this objective could actually be accomplished, and the NPT central bargain of non-proliferation in exchange for peaceful cooperation and disarmament finally redeemed.</u> T he articles have contributed to <u>paving the way for</u> the realization of <u>the goal of zero nuclear weapons that has been sought since the beginning of the nuclear age</u>. It is recognized that this goal may take a long time to achieve, but <u>for the first time it is actually conceivable - indeed imperative - given the current existential dangers that threaten civilization.</u>UN can help ensure that the disaster of Hiroshima never happens again But <u>if there is to be any hope of actually realizing the goal of zero nuclear weapons worldwide, crucial for world security in the long run, it is also essential that the NPT regime not only survive but flourish and act as a real ban against the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. Further, proliferation would substantially derogate from the goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons. The near-term ratification by the United States and entry into force of the CTBT would significantly contribute to the strengthening of the NPT.</u> Thus it must be pursued with urgency. In addition, we must look for other more direct ways to outlaw the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. Important to the future of the nonproliferation regime, is the utilization of the United Nations, which represents the people of the world. T he United Nations should call for the elimination of nuclear weapons as an integral part of human survival. If we want to be absolutely certain that the disaster of Hiroshima will never happen again, then our dedicated objective must be for the United Nations to propose a negotiating schedule to reach a world-wide, verifiable and enforceable agreement on zero nuclear weapons and declare that the development and possession of nuclear weapons is an international crime punishable by total political, economic, cultural, and if necessary, military world isolation and pressure. T he continuing role of the United Nations, after this, would then be to prevent and punish violations. T his is something that we can achieve and that we must achieve. Let us all work together to help make it happen. It is appropriate and timely for the United Nations to live up to its potential.</span><br />

<u>The most important effect of the CTBT may be psychological. An agreement</u> to end all nuclear testing <u>amounts to acceptance that further nuclear-weapon development will not enhance security</u>. Ever since the invention of nuclear weapons, some security experts have viewed them as the “ultimate weapon”, which can be used for a wide range of military and political purposes, while others have viewed them as too destructive for any rational purpose besides deterrence, if even that. Historically, the strongest opposition to nuclear-test restrictions has come from people who think about nuclear weapons in traditional war-fighting terms and assume that continued improvements could enhance security more than closer international cooperation would. <u>A global ban on nuclear testing would symbolize widespread acceptance of the opposite point of view: that post-Cold War deterrence requirements can be easily met by a fraction of existing nuclear weapons and emerging threats</u> to global security <u>are better addressed through international collaboration.

<u>Without the CTBT’s</u> entry into force, <u>the damage caused by previous testing risks being overshadowed by the effects of a new wave of testing</u><u>.</u> Political, doctrinal and operational <u>decisions could be taken at any time to reverse the taboo and moratorium on testing, further weakening the CTBT and endangering the goal of nuclear disarmament</u>. The situation remains uncertain, and <u>the signs are that it could all too easily deteriorate</u>. Below, <u>we outline a number of scenarios that could occur if current, negative trends are not arrested.</u> The preamble to the CTBT makes its purpose clear: “…the cessation of all nuclear weapon test explosions and all other nuclear explosions, by constraining the development and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, constitutes an effective measure of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in all its aspects”. The CTBT was meant to “contribute effectively to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace and security”. After signing the treaty, then United States President Clinton said before the United Nations General Assembly: “This Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will help prevent the nuclear Powers from developing more advanced and more dangerous weapons. It will limit the ability of other States to acquire such devices themselves. It points us towards a century in which the roles and risks of nuclear weapons can be further reduced and ultimately eliminated.”5 Ten years later only three countries that possess nuclear weapons are committed to the CTBT, and only one of those (France) has actually dismantled its nuclear-test site. Ten countries whose ratification is necessary for the entry into force of the treaty have not yet ratified and/or signed it (China, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and the United States).6 The original vision of the CTBT, that it “will help prevent the nuclear Powers from developing more advanced and more dangerous weapons … [and] limit the possibilities for other States to acquire such devices” has not been realized.7 In fact, <u>today’s world is undergoing a nuclear-weapon renaissance. In the United States</u>, the drive to resume testing of new nuclear-weapon designs continues despite the denials of the Bush Administration. <u>Budgets for nuclear-weapon work have soared to</u> roughly US$ <u>6,000 million</u> in the current fiscal year from their low of about US$ 3,200 million in fiscal year 1995. The reality is that a nuclear-weapon industry resurgence is occurring in the United States. Millions are being spent at the Nevada nuclear-test site to ensure it is ready to resume nuclear testing within 18 months of any political decision being taken. In order to maintain expertise, non-nuclear or subcritical tests are being conducted, which simulate all parts of a nuclear weapon except the explosion itself. The Bush Administration denies any intention to test; the weapons laboratories deny any intention to resume nuclear testing. Given the evidence, this rings about as true as a car owner spending a lot of time and effort refurbishing an old car, learning to drive in a computer simulator, ordering a new engine to be designed for it, and then denying any intention ever to drive. <u>The</u> United Kingdom (<u>UK</u>) has just <u>announced its intent to spend just over £1,000 million</u> over the next three years on refurbishing key facilities at its nuclear-weapon complex. This includes new facilities <u>for assembling and disassembling nuclear weapons</u> and the handling of high explosives and weapon-grade uranium, as well as a new high-energy laser facility. It also plans to recruit over 1,000 new staff over the next three years. The UK government is expected to make a decision on a replacement for its Trident submarine-launched nuclear-weapon system some time during 2006 and has just extended its nuclear-weapon cooperation agreement with the United States for another ten years. <u>In France,</u> laboratory-based <u>expansions of its nuclear-weapon design, development and production capacities have been under way</u> for a number of years. For example, over US$ 3,000 million are being spent on a new high-energy laser facility. <u>This year, France is expected to start testing a new missile for its submarine-launched nuclear warheads,</u> which will have an increased range, and it is also working on improving the capabilities of its air-launched nuclear delivery vehicle along with a more “robust” warhead, the tête nucléaire aéroportée. In January 2006 French President Jacques Chirac made a landmark speech, warning that “[t]he credible threat of their [nuclear weapons’] utilization permanently hangs over those leaders who harbour hostile intentions against us. …[W]e always reserve the right to resort to a final warning to mark our determination to safeguard our vital interests.”8 He also warned that “the leaders of States who contemplate terrorist attacks against us, as well as those who might consider using weapons of mass destruction in one way or another, must understand that they would lay themselves open to a firm and appropriate response on our part. And this response could be a conventional one. It could also be of another kind.”9 Nuclear testing is very much a political statement—it is the most public way possible of proving possession of the bomb. There are few who believe that North Korea has the material and the capabilities to possess nuclear weapons, and other than holding an international press conference to show off its nuclear bombs, <u>how else could North Korea prove it has a nuclear capability?</u> Even if it did hold an international media event, how would you know that what you were being shown was actually a nuclear bomb? How would anyone know that it worked? If a nuclear test is a political signal, it is not hard to foresee that if one state considers it necessary to demonstrate its nuclear prowess through testing, others will follow. India’s first test in 1974 was a very blunt message to Pakistan and China and it sparked a regional arms race that continues today. Nine years earlier, President Bhutto of Pakistan had made it clear that “[i]f India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own. We have no other choice”. And so Pakistan began its nuclear bomb programme. The logic that prevails is certainly not rational or linear, but <u>history has provided us with various examples that demonstrate the symbolic significance of testing, and the contagious effect it can have, escalating nuclear arms races.</u> This is <u>the worst</u> 2010 (when the next Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, review process ends) we can imagine—none of these developments are inevitable, nor are they desirable, but they <u>could happen if current trends continue and if key states continue to hold international law and treaties in contempt.</u> • The <u>Prep</u>aratory <u>Com</u>mission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization has effectively established its ring of sensors and monitoring stations around the world but the treaty has still not entered into force, so the organization has been reduced to little more than an international earthquake and tsunami monitoring body. Its political structure <u>has failed to meet for the last two years and the organization has no political clout</u><u>,</u> purpose or direction. • The Conference on Disarmament and the United Nations Disarmament Commission have been suspended until further notice because of continued failure to agree a programme of work. • The United States’ Global <u>Nuclear Energy</u> Partnership is up and running. This nuclear cartel of the Group of Eight controls the supply of over 80% of the world’s capacity for nuclear reprocessing, enrichment and supply services. Centralized facilities for providing these services either exist or are almost completed and supply agreements are in place with almost all of the nations that have nuclear power programmes. <u>Plans to expand into</u> the <u>Africa</u>n continent <u>are now under way</u>, with aid agreements and soft loans under negotiation with the oil-rich African nations. • Iran has invoked Article X of the NPT10 and withdrawn because of the “nuclear racism” of the US-led Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, which has established a few centres for the provision of nuclear fuel and enrichment and reprocessing services to states that they deem to be trustworthy political allies. <u>Iran has one nuclear power plant online, with four more under construction.</u> The uranium enrichment plant at Natanz has 3,000 centrifuges operating successfully and the uranium conversion plant at Esfahan is providing sufficient feed material for Natanz to be creating enough enriched uranium for an estimated five nuclear warheads a year. Iran is obtaining technical assistance from China and Russia despite its withdrawal from the NPT. • The global community has been unable to rein in the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea. The United States remains bogged down in Iraq and in trying to contain new conflicts that have arisen over oil resources on the African continent. • The <u>nuclear deals between the United States and India and between France and India have now been in operation</u> for 18 months, allowing India to successfully concentrate its uranium reserves and its technical abilities on miniaturizing and building up its nuclear arsenal. China has thus stepped in and signed its own nuclear cooperation agreement with Pakistan in order to bring some form of nuclear balance to the region. As a result <u>India and Pakistan have entered into a new nuclear arms race</u>, each side desperately trying to beat the other to be the first to put nuclear payloads on the advanced missiles they have successfully developed. • Israel and the United States have entered into a nuclear cooperation agreement similar to that with India to save Israel’s ageing nuclear research programme and build new reactors that will provide Israel with “true energy security”. • The <u>Eighth Review Conference of the NPT has just ended in failure</u> with no agreement on a way forward. This is a result of all of the above plus the clear agreement of all the nuclear-weapon states11 to proceed with the development and deployment of new nuclear-weapon systems and the adoption of new nuclear doctrines that allow for the use of nuclear weapons as a political and military tool even before the appearance of a clear threat. • The United Kingdom has announced its intention, in cooperation with the United States, to replace its Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile system with a new system of submarines armed with sub-strategic warheads, to be fitted onto both cruise and ballistic missiles. France is about to deploy its new missile system for its Triomphante ballistic missile submarines and has embarked on the development of a new warhead with full United States cooperation. China has successfully deployed its first ballistic missile submarine and is building a further three, and Russia now has 12 ballistic missile submarines operationally armed with the Tupolov missile system, equipped with what is rumoured to be a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle. SCENARIO ONE: UNITED STATES IGNITES THE NUCLEAR TESTING STAMPEDE <u>It is 2010, and still the United States refuses to sign up to the CTBT.</u>For years, US nuclear-weapon laboratories have been feverishly working on new nuclear warheads that will meet the administration’s wish to have small, robust, reliable warheads that can be easily used. However, the <u>scientists still cannot say that the warhead will work as desired</u><u>,</u> despite the billions invested in computer simulators and other fancy ways of creating the conditions of a nuclear explosion in the laboratory. The Nevada nuclear-test site is ready and waiting and <u>the administration takes the decision to conduct just one, or</u> maybe <u>two, nuclear tests</u> to check that the new weapon will operate the way it should. Under much secrecy, the test site is prepared with the public announcement that this will be another subcritical test—that is, a nuclear test in all but name—and that a subcritical assembly will be placed down the shaft, not a nuclear weapon. Once ready, the United States government announces publicly that it has changed its mind, it intends to resume nuclear testing for “safety and reliability” reasons: this will be a limited series of tests and as soon as it is completed, the moratorium will once again apply. The French and the British, supposedly advocates and defenders of the CTBT, participate in the tests. <u>Result: China,</u> experiencing difficulties and uncertainties about its nuclear warhead modernization programme, <u>decides to</u> seize the political opportunity and <u>follow the United States</u>. It announces its intent to resume a short series of nuclear tests<u>.</u> <u>Russia follows</u> the lead of the other four nuclear-weapon states because, despite all the economic and technical difficulties this will entail, it really does not want to be left behind. With their stranglehold on the UN Security Council, <u>the supply of nuclear technology and the rest of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, the five nuclear-weapon states engage in a new nuclear arms race, each rushing to finish developing and deploying new nuclear-weapon systems</u>. The international community and global society look on helplessly. SCENARIO TWO: NORTH-EAST ASIA LEADS THE CHAIN REACTION This scenario could occur on its own or closely after the scenario outlined above. It is 2010 and North Korea has had enough of being shunned by the international community and denied the rights others seem to have. The <u>Six-Party Talks have ground to a halt</u><u>,</u> with mutual recriminations between the United States and North Korea, and between Japan and North Korea, that focus on unresolved historical angers and issues rather than nuclear weapons. The United States has stationed a carrier battle group permanently off the Korean coast, strengthening United States–South Korea military exercises, which have already heightened tension. North Korea is suffering extreme famine as so much of the nation’s wealth is ploughed into the military sector, power outages are the norm, and challenges to the leadership are brewing. To blast away any doubts about its programme or how tired it is of treatment as a second-class international citizen, and to reassert internal control, <u>Kim Jong Il decides to blast</u> away <u>one of the few warheads.</u> Result: Now under threat of nuclear attack and reluctant to rely solely on the United States’ nuclear umbrella, <u>Japan, South Korea and Taiwan quickly cooperate in a crash programme to arm themselves</u> with nuclear weapons. The United States feels obliged politically to assist in this programme, including providing access to testing facilities and technology in the United States. The United States also announces its intent to redeploy nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula and on its surface ships and other aircraft in the region. <u>China, outraged by US intervention in the region</u><u>,</u> especially cooperation with Taiwan, <u>comes to the aid of North Korea, providing it with a nuclear umbrella</u> while assisting it in building up its nuclear arsenal and means of delivery. The United States quickly again redeploys nuclear weapons onto South Korean soil and its naval vessels in the region. <u>Within two years</u> the situation has escalated to a point similar to that along the Kashmiri Line of Control: two <u>nuclear-armed states are in constant conflict across the Demilitarized Zone</u> of the Korean peninsula, aided and abetted by two powerful nuclear-weapon states. A new cold war breaks out between China and the United States–ASEAN nuclear pact, inevitably <u>accompanied by trade embargoes and a breakdown in political relations</u>. SCENARIO THREE: MIDDLE EAST MELTDOWN This scenario could occur on its own or closely after scenario one above. <u>Iran</u> has now designed and built a viable nuclear warhead, which it thinks can be carried by its advanced Shahab missile system. <u>Facing the same doubts</u> and dilemmas as other nuclear-weapon scientists, they <u>decide to see if it will work</u> and also to send a clear message to the world, and to Israel in particular, that Iran is now a nuclear power and a serious force to be reckoned with. The “Islamic bomb” is now a reality. <u>Israel in turn makes public its possession of a nuclear arsenal by carrying out a test at US facilities.</u> Result: <u>Saudi Arabia embarks on a crash programme of purchasing missiles</u> and warheads from its nuclear ally, Pakistan, and within a year announces itself as also possessing nuclear weapons. It offers fellow members of the Gulf Cooperation Council protection under its nuclear umbrella. <u>Israel has no choice and</u><u>,</u> with the United States, <u>launches a massive military strike on Iran to destroy its nuclear facilities. Simultaneously, Israel launches a massive military invasion of Lebanon and Palestinian-controlled territories</u> and refuses to give up control of the Occupied Territories. <u>Massive civil war breaks out</u> in the region as a result. The strike fails to take out all of Iran’s nuclear capabilities or its regime and leaves the region with three military nuclear alliances continuously threatening to wipe each other off the face of the Earth. The Pelindaba Treaty12 collapses before it enters into force, and <u>there is mass withdrawal from the NPT</u>. SCENARIO FOUR: DELIVERING ON THE THREAT The 2010 nuclear arsenals of India and Pakistan are believed to be fairly crude in design and unable to be efficiently carried by their relatively advanced missile technology. Delivering nuclear-weapon technology is about reaching the target within minutes, accurately and with little or no chance of being detected and destroyed before delivery. But thanks to India’s deal with the United States, and Pakistan’s with China, in 2010 one or both countries manage to develop a warhead small and light enough to fit the missiles, but are left with the same dilemma: will it work? <u>India or Pakistan,</u> or both, <u>decide to test their new warheads. Result: A tit for tat nuclear warhead and nuclear-capable missile-testing programme breaks out. Both sides start to build missile launch facilities close to the Kashmiri Line of Control</u> and India deploys its Russian-supplied nuclear-capable aircraft carrier and support vessels on a month-long exercise just outside of Pakistan’s territorial waters before sailing off on a tour of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean with planned visits to France, the United Kingdom and the United States. The United States decides to redeploy some of its nuclear arsenal to Diego Garcia and China decides to move some of its nuclear arsenal closer to India. <u>This doesn’t have to happen</u> Whether it is through resumption of nuclear testing by established nuclear-weapon states or by “new” nuclear powers, <u>a testing stampede will result if the taboo and moratorium against nuclear-weapon tests are broken.</u> Completion of global nuclear-test-ban treaty negotiations was a central nuclear arms control objective for more than 40 years. This long-awaited goal was finally won when the CTBT was opened for signature on 24 September 1996. Vital to the prevention of the dangerous and destabilizing modernization and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons, <u>the CTBT is one of the major elements necessary to achieving an end to these weapons of mass terror and destruction,</u> and to ensuring that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the last cities ever to suffer the effects of a nuclear-weapon attack. <u>Recent nuclear-weapon developments present a clear and present danger to the CTBT regime</u>, and to the existing moratorium. If they continue unchecked, <u>the worst scenarios that nuclear campaigners can dream up may become reality</u>. But just as any nuclear-weapon test would have major political consequences, <u>all efforts to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force are steps toward real peace and security:</u> and this is where we should all be directing our energy.</span><br />

As Obama himself recognizes, the road to a world free of nuclear weapons must include the entry into force of the nuclear test ban treaty. <u>A global ban on nuclear weapons tests is an essential step to halting the entry of new states into the nuclear club: without the ability to demonstrate</u> its mastery <u>of nuclear weapons by detonating one, no proliferator can lay claim to a credible</u> nuclear <u>arsenal</u>. Likewise, <u>a test ban promises to halt destabilizing nuclear arms races between existing weapons states</u> by <strong><u>ceasing the development and deployment of new types of nuclear weapons</u></strong>. <u>Without</u> the option of <u>tests to verify their effectiveness and reliability, a nuclear power will be hard pressed to introduce new advanced weapons</u> into their deterrent. Instead, <u>an effective nuclear test ban will</u> more or less <u>freeze existing nuclear arsenals at their current levels</u> <u>and prevent future improvements to their</u> explosive <u>power or miniaturization of warheads for missile deployment.</u> For that reason alone, the United States, which possesses the most advanced nuclear arsenal in the world, should be a strong supporter of a treaty that promises to lock in the nuclear weapons status quo. Furthermore, the CTBT entry into force would prevent China from further advances in fielding multiple warhead ballistic missiles.10 </span><br />

The <strong>DOE Stockpile Stewardship Option (</strong>_<strong>)</strong> rates poor (one star) for supporting arms control and nonproliferation. <u>DOE’s</u> broad experimental program in nuclear weapons technology, which includes secret underground explosions; its determined efforts to advance its understanding of nuclear weapons technology; and its <u>plans to improve and modernize every U.S. weapons system, encourages, rather than deters, the development and maintenance of nuclear weapons around the world. DOE’s program to refurbish and modernize the stockpile is inconsistent with U.S. commitments under the NPT to cease the nuclear arms race.</u> It is also counter to the purpose of the CTBT. <u>The conduct of subcritical tests</u> underground at the Nevada Test Site makes it difficult for other nations to verify that the United States is not conducting explosive nuclear tests. These deep underground tests <u>foster suspicion and mistrust of U.S. actions, which hinders progress on arms control and encourages secret nuclear weapons development in other nations</u>. Furthermore, the extent of DOE’s multifaceted Stockpile Stewardship effort (including new testing facilities such as NIF and DARHT and the ASCI program) also fosters other nation’s fears that the United States is putting in place the ability to make qualitative improvements to nuclear weapons. The U.S. Senate’s instructions to DOE in the 2001 Defense Authorization Bill to begin design studies for a new low yield earth penetrating nuclear weapon can only exacerbate this problem.</span><br />

Last year, the U.S. Congress passed legislation partially overturning a 1994 law barring the labs from developing precision, low-yield nuclear weapons. <u>The new law mandated a study</u> (which was due July 1, 2001, but is late) <u>on a new generation of weaponry, including low-yield “mini-nukes” for use against hardened and deeply buried targets such as missile silos</u>, stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons or Saddam Hussein’s command bunker. A “mini-nuke” is defined as a weapon with a yield of five kilotons or less. By comparison, some modern nuclear weapons have yields of more than 1,000 kilotons. <u>This is an extremely dangerous development, because the military is likely to regard these lowyield nuclear weapons as more useable than existing weapon types.</u> <u>7</u> Under other, already-existing programs, the U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories are researching ways to use small nuclear warheads to destroy or disable hardened targets such as tunnels and underground bunkers, and to attack chemical or biological weapons facilities. <u>This threatens to blur the distinction between conventional and nuclear warfare by lowering the political obstacles to the use of nuclear weapons, and makes it more likely that the U.S. will use nuclear weapons against states which do not have them</u>.8</span><br />

<strong>Ghitis, 2009</strong> independent commentator on world affairs and a World Politics Review contributing editor<br />
(Frida, World Citizen: Obama Must Parlay Soft Power Gains into Real Results, april 9)<br />
When viewed through a wide lens, the tour looks like a success. <u>America's ambassador-in-chief received a hero's welcome everywhere he went,</u> even if his most celebrated attribute remains simply not being George W. Bush. Becoming the object of adoring throngs and fawning heads of state may seem meaningless fluff to some, but in today's world, it falls squarely in the category of &quot;soft power.&quot; And soft power is, after all, real power. <u>Obama has become America's soft power H-bomb</u>. <u>The new president</u> -- who came to office, in many respects, <u>as the Un-Bush -- is hard at work reshaping the country's standing</u>, battered during the tenure of his predecessor<u>. Soft power is effective if a country can use it to magnify its powers of persuasion, then leverage that influence into concrete results. The U.S. under Obama has not reached that point yet.</u> <u>This is still the first stage: consolidating that soft power.</u> We still don't know if <u>the ultimate goal -- using the country's renewed standing to achieve strategic goals</u> -- will ultimately be achieved. <u>Clearly</u>, though, <u>we are not there yet.</u> <u>A closer look at Obama's interaction with world leaders proves the point</u>. The U.S. president achieved almost none of Washington's strategic or even tactical goals during this trip. The first stop on the president's tour was in London, where leaders of the world's largest economies, the G-20, met to discuss the top item on every country's agenda today: the economy. While presidents and prime ministers strained to stand near America's new rock-star president, <u>the popularity did little to advance U.S. interests at the negotiating table</u>. Going into the meeting, the U.S. was at odds with Europe, and particularly Germany, on the need for Europe to risk more of its budget to stimulate economic growth. Germany remained unmoved by American arguments, and in the end Europeans will risk much less of their own money to revive global economic growth. America's trillion-dollar budget deficit, meanwhile, will stimulate consumption and help everyone -- including European exporters -- sell more of their products. The U.S. also failed to persuade Europe to spend its own money rescuing troubled banks in EU member states in Eastern Europe. Again, the U.S. wanted the EU to risk its own capital. Instead, Obama agreed to a trillion-dollar jump in funding for the International Monetary Fund. That means American money will make up part of the pool that will rescue troubled banks in the EU. <u>During</u> his <u>dealings with leaders of NATO member countries, Obama fared equally poorly. Washington has been pressuring NATO to contribute more troops to the struggling war effort in Afghanistan</u> since long before Obama came to office. <u>While Obama is much more popular than his predecessor, he was no more successful than the Bush administration on this front.</u> At the NATO summit in Strasburg, European alliance members agreed to a much-touted boost of 5,000 troops. Despite the publicity, the outcome was a deep disappointment. After giving in on the economy, Obama might have pushed for a trade-off on Afghanistan. But for the most part, European leaders offered only to send more forces temporarily, to help with security during the upcoming Afghan elections. The other stops in the six-country tour brought even fewer substantial results. Visits to the Czech Republic, Turkey and Iraq focused on rebuilding America's image, developing new personal relationships between the young U.S. administration and other world leaders, and showing support for the shrinking U.S. mission in Iraq. An agreement to work with Moscow to restart talks on nuclear disarmament was a crowd-pleaser. But savvy observers noted that this is an unreciprocated concession to Russia -- whose nuclear arsenal, unlike America's, is falling into disrepair. <u>The highly symbolic move on nuclear weapons looked all the more empty, coming as North Korea launched a long-range rocket in defiance of the international community</u>, and the United Nations seemed incapable of mustering even a resolution of condemnation. As expected, the president's criticism of Bush's policies and &quot;American arrogance&quot; won plaudits abroad and spawned controversy at home. <u>Audiences</u> during the trip <u>cheered the reaffirmation of his early opposition to the Iraq war, as well as references to previously announced plans to close</u> down the controversial prison at <u>Guantanamo Bay</u>, Cuba, and to end the Iraq war responsibly. Much praise greeted Obama's vow to &quot;never be at war with Islam,&quot; his renewed commitment to peace in the Middle East and a diplomatic solution to the conflict over Iran's nuclear weapons. By all accounts, the push for better relations with Muslims was also a big success. <strong><u>It all amounts to a nice start, but no more</u></strong><u>. As the Obama administration moves forward with its policies, it will need international support for concrete measures, not just high personal approval ratings for the president.</u> All the popularity in the world will prove of little use if, for example, talks with Iran fail and Europeans and Russians fail to support tighter sanctions on Iran. For this first big trip, <u>coming home with a suitcase full of love</u> and adulation for the president and the first lady <u>can be counted as a success. As time passes</u>, however, <u>Obama will have to score more solid results.</u> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>CTBT ratification is the NUMBER ONE sign that we respect the international community, are committed to multilateralism, and revamps soft power.</strong><br />

(Jofi, Renew the Drive for CTBT Ratification, The Washington Quarterly, Volume 32, Issue 2 April 2009 , pages 79 - 90<br />
First, a pledge to work toward <u>CTBT ratification would help demonstrate the administration’s commitment to multilateral cooperation</u><u>.</u> The election of <u>Obama</u> as the United States’ forty-fourth president ignited celebrations around the world in part because it <u>was expected to end the era of U.S. unilateralism and ‘‘cowboy diplomacy</u>.’’ To his credit, Bush pursued a largely diplomatic course during his second term, especially toward the nonproliferation challenges posed by Iran and North Korea, but it was too late to repair the image of U.S. unilateralism<u>.</u> <u>Obama offers the United States a fresh start on redefining its international image</u><u>.</u> Even though the international community is extending a friendly hand toward Obama and his team, <u>the new administration may well find that budgetary constraints or differing conceptions of shared interests will limit other avenues of multilateral cooperation on issues like global warming or a renewed focus on Afghanistan. It is for that reason that a concrete pledge to work with the Senate on CTBT ratification carries so much promise.</u>Senate <u>ratification of the CTBT matters because it would be hailed as a renewed U.S. commitment to the essential pact at the heart of the NPT. Much of the international community</u>, especially leading nonnuclear weapons states like Brazil, Japan, South Africa, and Sweden, <u>believe that the United States has backtracked on the NPT’s basic bargain</u> contained in Article VI: <u>in exchange for the pledge by nonnuclear weapons states to not acquire nuclear weapons,</u> <u>the United States</u> and the four other recognized nuclear weapons powers China, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom <u>would pursue measures</u> ‘‘in good faith’’ to cease the nuclear arms race and <u>achieve eventual nuclear disarmament.</u> Under the Clinton administration, the United States explicitly reaffirmed its commitment to eventual nuclear disarmament at the 1995 NPT Review Conference in exchange for the agreement of other States Parties to indefinitely extend the NPT. Without this compromise, the NPT could have been allowed to expire or, more likely, extended only for a fixed period. The 2000 NPT Review Conference followed up with the adoption by all States Parties of a thirteen-step plan to pave the path for eventual general nuclear disarmament, with the first step calling for the CTBT’s early entry into force. 4 In the years following the 2000 conference, however, the United States was viewed as diverging from, and in some cases repudiating, many of those agreed upon measures. <u>Bush exercised the right of the United States to withdraw from the 1972 ABM Treaty</u>, viewed by many nations as a pillar of strategic stability. The administration’s 2002 Nuclear Posture Review explicitly discussed the circumstances under which a first use of nuclear weapons could be contemplated, and referred to possible target nations. 5 Administration officials discussed renewed efforts on research and development of new nuclear weapons, including so-called bunker buster bombs and miniaturized nuclear warheads that could lend themselves to more accessible use in a conflict. Finally, <u>the</u><u>administration withheld some key funding</u> <u>from the</u> Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (<u>CTBTO</u>), the international secretariat responsible for all relevant preparations for the CTBT’s entry into force, and sought congressional approval to shorten the timeline for required preparations before a nuclear weapons test<u>.</u> <u>In light of this recent discouraging history</u>, an unmistakable commitment from Obama that he will seek Senate <u>ratification of the CTBT</u> during his first term in office <u>may</u> <strong><u>do more than any other single measure</u></strong> <u>to indicate to the world that the United States is not only listening to, but also respects, the views of the international community.</u> While it will do little to directly convince rogue states like Iran or North Korea to halt their nuclear weapons programs, <u>it will strengthen the hand of the United States as it seeks to build international coalitions to squeeze</u> those <u>hostile</u> <u>states</u>. Indeed, a recent <u>survey of sixteen key nonnuclear weapons states reached the conclusion that ratification of the CTBT ‘‘would</u> <strong><u>send a very strong signal’’</u></strong> <u>to demonstrate the U.S. commitment to disarmament.</u> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Nuclear issues are the best way to change the perception of US leadership – it shores up our soft power – that’s key to solving a litany of issues</strong><br />
<strong>Stanley, 2007</strong> PhD in the Walsh School of Foreign Service and Department of Government at Georgetown University<br />
(Elizabeth A, , “International Perceptions of US Nuclear Policy,” independent research project for the Advanced Concepts Group at Sandia National Laboratories, Feb,)<br />
Seen in light of this wider debate about cooperation and power in international relations, <u>US nuclear policy can be framed in terms of its effects on US soft power</u> rather than just traditional hard power framing. Obviously, <u>US nuclear policy</u> aims to strengthen US hard power, but it <u>also has effects on soft power</u><u>.</u> This analysis suggests that <u>US nuclear policy undermines US soft power abroad. Given its</u> status as a nuclear weapons state in the NPT, and its <u>commitment</u> in that treaty <u>to eventual disarmament,</u> the <u>United States is faulted by other countries</u> when <u>its nuclear policies are perceived to be at odds with this disarmament goal</u></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. For example, </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><u>many states view the United States’ decisions not to ratify the</u> Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (<u>CTBT</u>) and to withdraw from the 1972 ABM Treaty to develop a national missile defense program – <u>while simultaneously trying to block other states from developing nuclear programs – as very hypocritical</u>. The US hypocrisy is perceived to extend to other policy areas as well, including (for example): agriculture, pharmaceuticals, relations with authoritarian leaders, and treatment of detainees. Perceptions about all of these US actions have corroded US soft power. <u>These perceptions have made other states – including allies – less inclined to cooperate with the United States. These actions also appear to provide a basis for adversaries and others to call the American commitment to freedom and peace into doubt</u><u>.</u> In other words, these actions as they are perceived abroad appear to demonstrate that the United States believes it is powerful enough – and thus exceptional enough – to behave independently of international norms. As a Pakistani security scholar, Ghazala Yasmin, argued in an article about the US NPR, “The US seems to be sending a message across the world – do as we say, not as we do.”13 How important is soft power, anyway? Given its vast conventional military power, does the United States even need soft power? Some analysts argue that US military predominance is both possible and desirable over the long term, and thus soft power is not important. But a growing consensus disagrees. These analysts argue that soft power is critical for four reasons. First, <u>soft power is invaluable for keeping potential adversaries from gaining international support, for “winning the peace” in Afghanistan and Iraq, and for convincing moderates to refrain from supporting extremist terrorist groups</u></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Second,</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> <u>soft power helps influence neutral and developing states to support US global leadership.</u> Third, <u>soft power is also important for convincing allies and partners to share the international security burden</u>.14 Finally, and perhaps most importantly, given the increasing interdependence and globalization of the world system, <u>soft power is critical for addressing most security threats</u> the United States faces today. <u>Most global security threats are impossible to be countered by a single state alone. Terrorism</u>, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) <u>proliferation, failed</u> and failing<u>states</u>, conflicts <u>over access to resources, are not confined to any one state</u><u>.</u> In addition, <u>disease, demographic shifts, environmental degradation and global warming will have negative security implications as well.</u> <u>All of these</u> potential threats share four traits: (1) they are <u>best addressed proactively, rather than after they develop into full-blown crises; (2) they require multi-lateral approaches, often under the umbrella of an international institution; (3) they are not candidates for a quick fix, but rather require multi-year, or multi-decade solutions;</u> and, (4) they are “wicked” problems. Given these four traits, <u>soft power is critical for helping to secure the international, multi-lateral cooperation that will be necessary to address such threats effectively</u>. If soft power is important in today’s security landscape, how important for regaining the “moral high ground” and repairing its soft power is a perceived US commitment to the non-proliferation regime? <u>How do international actors perceive US nuclear policy and changes to that policy? Because of the nature of the weapons themselves</u><u>,</u> United States’ nuclear policy cannot be directed at just one actor or group of actors. <u>Any changes in US nuclear policy will send signals to multiple actors in the international system.</u> <u>The actors most often considered are potential adversaries</u>, including emerging peers, rogue states and non-state violent extremists. However, <u>the US posture also sends strong signals to allies, neutrals and other states in the system that may be considering acquiring nuclear weapons</u>. Depending upon its congruence with the NPT (especially Article VI), <u>US nuclear policy also sends signals about US credibility in upholding other international agreements and acting as a global leader in international institutions</u>. Each of these reactions occurs simultaneously and interacts with each other, in turn affecting how the US responds to those reactions. The strategic interaction is complex and incredibly difficult to model. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Soft power &amp; perception is key to effective leadership – builds alliances, checks counter-balancing, maintains domestic support – multilateral co-op is the best internal link to solving terrorism</strong><br />
<strong>Jervis, 2009</strong> professor of international politics at Columbia University.<br />
(Robert, Unipolarity: A Structural Perspective, World Politics Volume 61, Number 1, January 2009<br />
To say that the system is unipolar is not to argue that the unipole can get everything it wants or that it has no need for others. <u>American power</u> is very great, but it <u>is</u> still <u>subject to</u> two familiar <u>limitations:</u> it is harder to build than to destroy, and <u>success usually depends on others’ decisions</u>. This is particularly true of the current system because of what the U.S. wants. If Hitler had won World War II, he might have been able to maintain his system for some period of time with little cooperation from others because “all” he wanted was to establish the supremacy of the Aryan race. <u>The U.S. wants not only to prevent the rise of a peer competitor but also to stamp out terrorism, an open international economic system, spread democracy throughout the world, and establish a high degree of cooperation among countries that remain juridically equal.</u> <u>Even in the military arena, the U.S. cannot act completely alone.</u> <u>Bases and overflight rights are always needed, and support from allies</u>, especially Great Britain, <u>is important to validate military action in the eyes of the American public.</u> When one matches American forces, not against those of an adversary but against the tasks at hand, they often fall short.54 <u>Against terrorism, force is ineffective without excellent intelligence. Given the international nature of the threat and the difficulties of gaining information about it, international cooperation is the only route to success.</u> <u>The maintenance of international prosperity also requires joint efforts, even leaving aside the danger that other countries could trigger a run on the dollar by cashing in their holdings</u>.Despite its lack of political unity, Europe is in many respects an economic unit, and one with a greater gdp than that of the U.S. Especially because of the growing Chinese economy, e<u>conomic power is spread around the world much more equally than is military power, and the open economic system</u> [End Page 210] <u>could easily disintegrate despite continued unipolarity</u>. In parallel, on <u>a whole host of problems such as aids, poverty</u>, and <u>international crime</u> (<u>even</u> leaving aside <u>climate change),</u> <u>the unipole can lead and exert pressure but cannot dictate.</u> <u>Joint actions may be necessary to apply sanctions to various unpleasant and recalcitrant regimes; proliferation can be stopped only if all the major states</u> (and many minor ones) <u>work to this end</u>; unipolarity did not automatically enable the U.S. to maintain the coalition against Iraq after the first Gulf War; <u>close ties within the West are needed to reduce the ability of China, Russia, and other states to play one Western country off against the others</u>. But in comparison with the cold war era, there are fewer incentives today for allies to cooperate with the U.S. During the earlier period unity and close coordination not only permitted military efficiencies but, more importantly, gave credibility to the American nuclear umbrella that protected the allies. Serious splits were dangerous because they entailed the risk that the Soviet Union would be emboldened. This reason for avoiding squabbles disappeared along with the USSR, and the point is likely to generalize to other unipolar systems if they involve a decrease of threats that call for maintaining good relations with the superpower. This does not mean that even in this particular unipolar system the superpower is like Gulliver tied down by the Lilliputians. In some areas opposition can be self-defeating. Thus for any country to undermine American leadership of the international economy would be to put its own economy at risk, even if the U.S. did not retaliate, and for a country to sell a large proportion of its dollar holding would be to depress the value of the dollar, thereby diminishing the worth of the country’s remaining stock of this currency. Furthermore, cooperation often follows strong and essentially unilateral action. Without the war in Iraq it is not likely that we would have seen the degree of cooperation that the U.S. obtained from Europe in combating the Iranian nuclear program and from Japan and the PRC in containing North Korea. Nevertheless, many of the <u>American goals depend on persuading others, not coercing them</u>. <u>Although incentives and even force are not irrelevant to spreading democracy and the free market, at bottom this requires people to embrace a set of institutions and values. Building the world that the U.S. seeks is a political, social, and even psychological task for which unilateral measures are likely to be unsuited and for which American military and economic strength can at best play a supporting role. Success requires that others share the American vision and believe that its leadership is benign.</u> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Commitment to multilateralism is vital to prevent counter-balancing and overstretch – which destroy US leadership</strong><br />

<span style="display: block; font-family: Garamond; text-align: justify;">But <u>the fact that the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>has achieved overwhelming power does not mean that it doesn’t need, and should not seek, alliances. Solitude is dangerous for empires, and alliances continue to be crucial</u> for the United States for two reasons. First, <u>by having allies, the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>can</u> <strong><u>economize its own forces</u></strong><u>. Allies can fulfill crucial tasks from peacekeeping to protecting sea lanes and checking the rise of potential regional competitors</u><u>.</u> By doing so, <u>they will reduce utilization of American forces</u><u>.</u> For example, <u>the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>will need allies such as Japan and Taiwan, as well as India and</u> some of the <u>Central Asian states, to contain the rising power of China. China will have to devote</u> some of <u>its forces to paying attention to U.S. allies such as India</u>, thus<u>limiting its ability to threaten U.S. interests</u> in the Pacific. <u>By relying on these allies to curb China's ambitions, the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>can limit its own expenditure of power in the region and avoid the danger of having most of its forces absorbed in the Pacific</u>, to the detriment of its global interests.6 <u>The U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>will also continue to benefit from</u> European and other <u>allies’ supplying much-needed manpower to garrison trouble spots</u> from Afghanistan to the Balkans, thereby <strong><u>reducing the risk of American military overstretch</u></strong><u>.</u> There are currently about 8,000 non-U.S. troops under nato command in Afghanistan (more than two hundred are from non-nato members, such as Macedonia and Sweden, while the United States has about 20,000 troops there), and 7,000 soldiers under eufor (the eu-led force) in Bosnia. While <u>these</u> and other <u>military deployments</u> of allies <u>cannot substitute for U.S. involvement, they do free American resources from carrying out some tasks so that they can direct their efforts elsewhere</u> (e.g., to a more aggressive search for Taliban and Al Qaeda elements in Afghanistan). <u>The</u> second, and perhaps <u>most important, reason the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>needs alliances is that</u> <strong><u>allies are less likely to challenge its supremacy</u></strong><u>. If the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>chooses to be a solitary power, it will invite the rest of the world to coalesce against it. Challengers will arise faster and more numerously if the empire leaves states outside of its protective and beneficial mantel.</u> Alternatively, the United States can actively seek alliances with other states, which as allies will have fewer incentives to upset the status quo (i.e., American supremacy). <u>If a state is not given the choice of allying with the empire, it will be more likely to seek the support of others to balance against it, if only because there is no benefit to be gained from the empire's existence.</u> Obviously, building alliances with states that for a variety of reasons have as their main strategic goal weakening the United States will not eliminate their desire to do so. This is why multilateral or international organizations that include all sorts of states do not fully protect U.S. national security interests. Because there is no political settlement short of a U.S. defeat that would satisfy the purported objectives of these states (just think of Iran or China), bringing them into some sort of alliance or institution with the United States will not reduce their drive to achieve that goal.7 <u>The possibility of an alliance with Washington will</u>, however, <u>have an impact on those states that are more concerned with their own security and economic welfare than with dethroning the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates. For such states, <u>a U.S. alliance offers protection</u> (e.g., the Baltic states or South Korea), <u>hopes of economic and political benefits</u> (e.g., Poland and Italy), <u>and</u> often <u>domestic stability</u> (e.g., Macedonia or Albania). Developing <u>such alliances</u> unabashedly serves the United States’ interests. It <u>limits the rise of new enemies that</u>, however small, <u>can be a dangerous distraction and divert U.S. resources</u>. In fact, for these states, <u>the alternative to allying with the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>is seeking the support of other powers.</u> For example, without American support, Poland may pursue an increasingly Francophile, or Ukraine an increasingly Russophile, course, strengthening the anti-U.S. bloc in Europe. <u>In Asia, the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates’ <u>withdrawal from its commitments to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would lead some states to a more accommodating policy toward China, increasing that nation's sphere of influence to the detriment of American interests.</u> </span><br />

<strong>Brzezinski, 2005</strong> National Security Advisor in the Carter Administration, Professor of Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University<br />
[Zbigniew “The Choice: Global Domination or Global Leadership” (p. 2-4)]</span><br />
<span style="display: block; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><u>History</u> is a record of change, a reminder that nothing endures indefinitely. It <u>can</u> also <u>remind us</u>, however, <u>that some things endure for a long time, and when they disappear, the status quo ante does not reappear. So it will be with the current American global preponderance</u><u>.</u> It too, will fade at some point, probably later than some wish and earlier than m any Americans take for granted. The key question is: What will replace it? <u>An abrupt termination of American hegemony would without doubt precipitate global chaos, in which international anarchy would be punctuated by eruptions of truly massive destructiveness. An unguided progressive decline would have a similar effect, spread out over a longer time.</u> But a gradual and controlled devolution of power could lead to an increasingly formalized global community of shared interest, with supranational arrangements increasingly assuming some of the special security roles of traditional nation-states. In any case, <u>the eventual end of American hegemony will not involve a restoration of multipolarity among the familiar major powers</u> that dominated world affairs for the last two centuries. <u>Nor will it yield to another dominant hegemon that would displace the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>by assuming a similar political, military, economic, technological, and sociocultural worldwide preeminence. The familiar powers of the last century are too fatigued or too weak to assume the role the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>now plays.</u> It is noteworthy that since 1880, in a comparative ranking of world powers (cumulative1y based on their economic strength, mi1itarybudgets and assets, populations, etc.), the top five slots at sequential twenty-year intervals have been shared by just seven states: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, Japan, and China. Only the United States, however, unambiguously earned inclusion among the top five in every one of the twenty¬ year intervals, and the gap in the year 2000 between the top-ranked United States and the rest was vastly wider than ever before. <u>The former major European powers</u> – Great Britain, Germany, and France – <u>are too weak to step into the breach.</u> In the next two decades, <u>it is quite unlikely that the E</u>uropean <u>U</u>nion <u>will become sufficiently united politically to muster the popular will to compete with the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>in the politico-military arena. Russia is no longer an imperial power, and its central challenge is to recover socioeconomically lest it lose its far eastern territories to China. Japan's population is aging and its economy has slowed</u>; the conventional wisdom of the 1980s that Japan is destined to be the next &quot;superstate&quot; now has the ring of historical irony. <u>China, even if it succeeds in maintaining high rates of economic growth and retains its internal political stability (both are far from certain), will at best be a regional power still constrained by an impoverished population, antiquated infrastructure, and limited appeal worldwide. The same is true of India, which additionally faces uncertainties regarding its long-term national unity. Even a coalition among the above</u> – a most unlikely prospect, given their historical conflicts and clashing territorial claims – <u>would lack the cohesion, muscle, and energy needed to</u> both push America off its pedestal and <u>sustain global stability.</u> Some leading states, in any case, would side with America if push came to shove. Indeed, any evident American decline might precipitate efforts to reinforce America's leadership. Most important, <u>the shared resentment of American hegemony would not dampen the clashes of interest among states. The more intense collisions</u> – <u>in the event of America's decline</u> – <u>could spark a wildfire of regional violence, rendered all the more dangerous by the dissemination of w</u>eapons of <u>m</u>ass<u>d</u>estruction. The bottom line is twofold: For the next two decades, <u>the steadying effect of American power will be indispensable to global stability, while the principal challenge to American power can come only from within</u> – either <u>from the repudiation of power by the American democracy itself, or from America's global misuse of its own power.</u> American society, even though rather parochial in its intellectual and cultural interests, steadily sustained a protracted worldwide engagement against the threat of totalitarian communism and it is currently mobilized against international terrorism. As long as that commitment endures, America's role as the global stabilizer will also endure. Should that commitment fade – either because terrorism has faded, or because Americans tire or lose their sense of common purpose – <u>America's global role could rapidly terminate. That role could also be undermined and delegitimated by the misuse of U.S. power. Conduct that is perceived worldwide as arbitrary could prompt America’s progressive isolation, undercutting</u> not America's power to defend itself as such, but rather <u>its ability to use</u> that <u>power to enlist others in a common effort to shape a more secure international environment.</u></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Leadership stops multiple nuclear conflicts – solves all the worlds problems</strong><br />
<strong>Kagan, 2007</strong> Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace<br />
Robert “End of Dreams, Return of History” <em>Policy Review</em> (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/8552512.html#n10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.hoover.org/ publications/policyreview/ 8552512.html#n10</a>)]<br />
This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions. It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance in the international system those errors are magnified and take on greater significance than the errors of less powerful nations. <u>Compared to the ideal Kantian international order, in which all the world's powers would be peace-loving equals, conducting themselves wisely, prudently, and in strict obeisance to international law, the unipolar system is both dangerous and unjust. Compared to any plausible alternative in the real world, however, it is relatively stable and less likely to produce a</u> <strong><u>major war between great powers.</u></strong> It is also comparatively benevolent, from a liberal perspective, for it is more conducive to the principles of economic and political liberalism that Americans and many others value. <u>American predominance</u> does not stand in the way of progress toward a better world, therefore. It <u>stands in the way of regression toward a more dangerous world. The choice is not between an American-dominated order and a world that looks like the European Union. The future international order will be shaped by those who have the power to shape it.</u> The leaders of a post-American world will not meet in Brussels but in Beijing, Moscow, and Washington. The return of great powers and great games If the world is marked by the persistence of unipolarity, it is nevertheless also being shaped by the reemergence of competitive national ambitions of the kind that have shaped human affairs from time immemorial. During the Cold War, this historical tendency of great powers to jostle with one another for status and influence as well as for wealth and power was largely suppressed by the two superpowers and their rigid bipolar order. Since the end of the Cold War, the United States has not been powerful enough, and probably could never be powerful enough, to suppress by itself the normal ambitions of nations. This does not mean the world has returned to multipolarity, since none of the large powers is in range of competing with the superpower for global influence. Nevertheless, several large powers are now competing for regional predominance, both with the United States and with each other. National ambition drives China's foreign policy today, and although it is tempered by prudence and the desire to appear as unthreatening as possible to the rest of the world, <u>the Chinese are</u> <strong><u>powerfully motivated</u></strong> <u>to return their nation to what they regard as its traditional position as the preeminent power in East Asia</u>. They do not share a European, postmodern view that power is passé; hence their now two-decades-long military buildup and modernization. Like the Americans, they believe power, including military power, is a good thing to have and that it is better to have more of it than less. Perhaps more significant is the Chinese perception, also shared by Americans, that status and honor, and not just wealth and security, are important for a nation. <u>Japan, meanwhile, which in the past could have been counted as an aspiring postmodern power -- with its pacifist constitution and low defense spending -- now appears embarked on a more traditional national course. Partly this is in reaction to the rising power of China and concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons</u>. But it is also driven by Japan's own national ambition to be a leader in East Asia or at least not to play second fiddle or &quot;little brother&quot; to China. China and Japan are now in a competitive quest with each trying to augment its own status and power and to prevent the other 's rise to predominance, and this competition has a military and strategic as well as an economic and political component. Their competition is such that a nation like South Korea, with a long unhappy history as a pawn between the two powers, is once again worrying both about a &quot;greater China&quot; and about the return of Japanese nationalism. As Aaron Friedberg commented, the East Asian future looks more like Europe's past than its present. But it also looks like Asia's past. <u>Russian foreign policy,</u> too, looks more like something from the nineteenth century. It <u>is being driven by a typical, and typically Russian, blend of national resentment and ambition</u>. A postmodern Russia simply seeking integration into the new European order, the Russia of Andrei Kozyrev, would not be troubled by the eastward enlargement of the EU and NATO, would not insist on predominant influence over its &quot;near abroad,&quot; and would not use its natural resources as means of gaining geopolitical leverage and enhancing Russia 's international status in an attempt to regain the lost glories of the Soviet empire and Peter the Great. But Russia, like China and Japan, is moved by more traditional great-power considerations, including the pursuit of those valuable if intangible national interests: honor and respect. Although Russian leaders complain about threats to their security from NATO and the United States, the Russian sense of insecurity has more to do with resentment and national identity than with plausible external military threats. 16 Russia's complaint today is not with this or that weapons system. It is the entire post-Cold War settlement of the 1990s that Russia resents and wants to revise. But that does not make insecurity less a factor in Russia 's relations with the world; indeed, it makes finding compromise with the Russians all the more difficult. One could add others to this list of great powers with traditional rather than postmodern aspirations. <u>India's regional ambitions are more muted, or are focused most intently on Pakistan, but it is clearly engaged in competition with China for dominance in the Indian Ocean</u> and sees itself, correctly, as an emerging great power on the world scene. In the Middle East there is Iran, which mingles religious fervor with a historical sense of superiority and leadership in its region. 17 Its nuclear program is as much about the desire for regional hegemony as about defending Iranian territory from attack by the United States. Even the European Union, in its way, expresses a pan-European national ambition to play a significant role in the world, and it has become the vehicle for channeling German, French, and British ambitions in what Europeans regard as a safe supranational direction. Europeans seek honor and respect, too, but of a postmodern variety. The honor they seek is to occupy the moral high ground in the world, to exercise moral authority, to wield political and economic influence as an antidote to militarism, to be the keeper of the global conscience, and to be recognized and admired by others for playing this role. Islam is not a nation, but many Muslims express a kind of religious nationalism, and the leaders of radical Islam, including al Qaeda, do seek to establish a theocratic nation or confederation of nations that would encompass a wide swath of the Middle East and beyond. Like national movements elsewhere, Islamists have a yearning for respect, including self-respect, and a desire for honor. Their national identity has been molded in defiance against stronger and often oppressive outside powers, and also by memories of ancient superiority over those same powers. China had its &quot;century of humiliation.&quot; Islamists have more than a century of humiliation to look back on, a humiliation of which Israel has become the living symbol, which is partly why even Muslims who are neither radical nor fundamentalist proffer their sympathy and even their support to violent extremists who can turn the tables on the dominant liberal West, and particularly on a dominant America which implanted and still feeds the Israeli cancer in their midst. Finally, there is the United States itself. As a matter of national policy stretching back across numerous administrations, Democratic and Republican, liberal and conservative, Americans have insisted on preserving regional predominance in East Asia; the Middle East; the Western Hemisphere; until recently, Europe; and now, increasingly, Central Asia. This was its goal after the Second World War, and since the end of the Cold War, beginning with the first Bush administration and continuing through the Clinton years, the United States did not retract but expanded its influence eastward across Europe and into the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. <u>Even as it maintains its position as the predominant global power, it is</u> <u>also engaged in hegemonic competitions in these regions with China in East and Central Asia, with Iran in the Middle East and Central Asia, and with Russia in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.</u> The United States, too, is more of a traditional than a postmodern power, and though Americans are loath to acknowledge it, they generally prefer their global place as &quot;No. 1&quot; and are equally loath to relinquish it. Once having entered a region, whether for practical or idealistic reasons, they are remarkably slow to withdraw from it until they believe they have substantially transformed it in their own image. They profess indifference to the world and claim they just want to be left alone even as they seek daily to shape the behavior of billions of people around the globe. The jostling for status and influence among these ambitious nations and would-be nations is a second defining feature of the new post-Cold War international system. <u>Nationalism in all its forms is back,</u> if it ever went away, <u>and so is international competition for power, influence, honor, and status. American predominance prevents these rivalries from intensifying -- its regional as well as its global predominance. Were the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>to diminish its influence in the regions where it is currently the strongest power, the other nations would settle disputes as great and lesser powers have done in the past:</u> sometimes through diplomacy and accommodation but <u>often through confrontation and wars</u> of varying scope, intensity, and destructiveness. <u>One novel aspect of such a multipolar world is that most of these powers would possess nuclear weapons. That could make wars between them</u> less likely, or it could simply make them more <strong><u>catastrophic</u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong> It is easy but also dangerous to underestimate the role the United States plays in providing a measure of stability in the world even as it also disrupts stability. For instance, the United States is the dominant naval power everywhere, such that other nations cannot compete with it even in their home waters. They either happily or grudgingly allow the United States Navy to be the guarantor of international waterways and trade routes, of international access to markets and raw materials such as oil. Even when the United States engages in a war, it is able to play its role as guardian of the waterways. In a more genuinely multipolar world, however, it would not. Nations would compete for naval dominance at least in their own regions and possibly beyond. <u>Conflict between nations would involve struggles on the oceans as well as on land. Armed embargos, of the kind used in World War I and other major conflicts, would disrupt trade flows in a way that is now impossible</u>. Such order as exists in the world rests not merely on the goodwill of peoples but on a foundation provided by American power. Even the European Union, that great geopolitical miracle, owes its founding to American power, for without it the European nations after World War ii would never have felt secure enough to reintegrate Germany. Most Europeans recoil at the thought, but even today <u>Europe's stability depends on the guarantee,</u> however distant and one hopes unnecessary, <u>that the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>could step in to check any dangerous development on the continent. In a genuinely multipolar world, that would not be possible without renewing the danger of</u> <strong><u>world war</u>.</strong> People who believe greater equality among nations would be preferable to the present American predominance often succumb to a basic logical fallacy. They believe the order the world enjoys today exists independently of American power. They imagine that in a world where American power was diminished, the aspects of international order that they like would remain in place. But that 's not the way it works. International order does not rest on ideas and institutions. It is shaped by configurations of power. The international order we know today reflects the distribution of power in the world since World War ii, and especially since the end of the Cold War. A different configuration of power, a multipolar world in which the poles were Russia, China, the United States, India, and Europe, would produce its own kind of order, with different rules and norms reflecting the interests of the powerful states that would have a hand in shaping it. Would that international order be an improvement? Perhaps for Beijing and Moscow it would. But it is doubtful that it would suit the tastes of enlightenment liberals in the United States and Europe. The current order, of course, is not only far from perfect but also offers no guarantee against major conflict among the world's great powers. <u>Even under the umbrella of unipolarity, regional conflicts involving the large powers may erupt. War could erupt between China and Taiwan</u> and draw in both the United States and Japan. War could erupt <u>between Russia and Georgia,</u> forcing the United States and its European allies to decide whether to intervene or suffer the consequences of a Russian victory. Conflict <u>between India and Pakistan</u> remains possible, as does conflict <u>between Iran and Israel or other Middle Eastern states</u>. These, too, could draw in other great powers, including the United States. Such conflicts may be unavoidable no matter what policies the United States pursues. <u>But they are more likely to erupt if the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>weakens or withdraws from its positions of regional dominance</u>. This is especially true <u>in East Asia, where most nations agree that a reliable American power has a stabilizing and pacific effect on the region</u>. That is certainly the view of most of China 's neighbors. But even China, which seeks gradually to supplant the United States as the dominant power in the region, faces the dilemma that an American withdrawal could unleash an ambitious, independent, nationalist Japan. <u>In Europe</u>, too, <u>the departure of the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates from the scene -- even if it remained the world's most powerful nation -- <u>could be destabilizing. It could tempt Russia to an even more overbearing and potentially forceful approach to unruly nations on its peripher</u>y. Although some realist theorists seem to imagine that the disappearance of the Soviet Union put an end to the possibility of confrontation between Russia and the West, and therefore to the need for a permanent American role in Europe, history suggests that conflicts in Europe involving Russia are possible even without Soviet communism. <u>If the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates withdrew from Europe -- if it <u>adopted</u> what some call <u>a strategy of &quot;offshore balancing&quot; -- this could</u> in time <u>increase the likelihood of conflict involving Russia and its near neighbors, which could in turn</u> <strong><u>draw the U</u></strong>nited <strong><u>S</u></strong>tates <strong><u>back in</u></strong> under unfavorable circumstances. <u>It is also optimistic to imagine that a retrenchment of the American position in the Middle East and the assumption of a more passive, &quot;offshore&quot; role would lead to greater stability there</u>. The vital interest the United States has in access to oil and the role it plays in keeping access open to other nations in Europe and Asia make it unlikely that American leaders could or would stand back and hope for the best while the powers in the region battle it out. Nor would a more &quot;even-handed&quot; policy toward Israel, which some see as the magic key to unlocking peace, stability, and comity in the Middle East, obviate the need to come to Israel 's aid if its security became threatened. That commitment, paired with the American commitment to protect strategic oil supplies for most of the world, practically ensures a heavy American military presence in the region, both on the seas and on the ground. The subtraction of American power from any region would not end conflict but would simply change the equation. <u>In the Middle East, competition for influence among powers both inside and outside the region has raged for at least two centuries. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism doesn't change this. It only adds a new and more threatening dimension to the competition</u>, which neither a sudden end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians nor an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq would change. <u>The alternative to American predominance</u> in the region <u>is</u> <strong><u>not balance and peace. It is further competition.</u></strong> The region and the states within it remain relatively weak. <u>A diminution of American influence would not be followed by a diminution of other external influences. One could expect deeper involvement by both China and Russia</u>, if only to secure their interests. 18 And one could also expect the more powerful states of the region, particularly Iran, to expand and fill the vacuum. It is doubtful that any American administration would voluntarily take actions that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East further toward Russia, China, or Iran. The world hasn 't changed that much. An American withdrawal from Iraq will not return things to &quot;normal&quot; or to a new kind of stability in the region. It will produce a new instability, one likely to draw the United States back in again. The alternative to American regional predominance in the Middle East and elsewhere is not a new regional stability. In an era of burgeoning nationalism, the future is likely to be one of intensified competition among nations and nationalist movements. Difficult as it may be to extend American predominance into the future, no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.</span><br />
