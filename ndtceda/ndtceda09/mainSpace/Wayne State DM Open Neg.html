We've run some version of health care or cap and trade good politics pretty much every neg round and we usually run some case specific CPs and DAs.<br />

<strong>The affirmative’s discussion of</strong> <strong>China</strong> <strong>is based on a positivist mode of “knowing”</strong> <strong>China</strong><strong>. This constructs a mode of thought that can only relate to</strong> <strong>China</strong> <strong>as a threat.</strong><br />

<strong>Chinese threat construction makes nuclear war inevitable – it influences policymakers’ suspicions of</strong> <strong>China</strong> <strong>and causes massive arms buildups. We must reject the way they frame US-China relations.</strong><br />

 <strong>The era of post politics radically depoliticizes the economy – this can never obtain the dimensions of universality because it precludes acts of authentic politics – we must establish a radical strategy that re-politicizes the economy in order to break free from the chains of global capitalism</strong><br />

<strong>It is not possible to solve any situation without solving them all – only a criticism which attacks the universal of capitalism can solve their impacts and the inevitable destruction of the earth and its people. This proves only the alt can solve the plan.</strong><br />

<strong>Their effort to stop proliferation of WMDs is a symptom of America’s superpower syndrome – the US tries to know and secure the entire world, so that it can avoid confrontation with its own vulnerability. US dominance aims to secure its own identity – they only legitimize US violence.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Lifton, ’03</u></strong> (Robert, professor of psychiatry at Harvard known for his studies of the psychological causes and effects of war and political violence, <u>Superpower Syndrome</u>, p. 173-182)<br />
<br />
The invasion of Iraq was a continuation ... superpower syndrome at its core.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Omnipotence would be great if it was possible, but it’s not. In fact, their attempt to counter proliferation leads has the opposite effect and makes violence inevitable.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Lifton, ’03</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Robert, professor of psychiatry at Harvard known for his studies of the psychological causes and effects of war and political violence, <u>Superpower Syndrome</u>, p. 183-4) </span><br />

<u>Nuclear weapons represent a psychological ground zero ...</u> <u>a key lever for the militarization of society.</u><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The alternative is to refuse their drive for absolute security. Apocalyptic representations are the root of their impacts and culminate in extinction – only by admitting that we can’t perfect the world can we break down the superpower syndrome.</strong><br />

In both cases, victimization by others becomes ... know everything cannot kill everyone.
