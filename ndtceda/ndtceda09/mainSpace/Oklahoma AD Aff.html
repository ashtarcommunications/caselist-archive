The argument that we have to absolutely reject “accidents” in all instances fractures coalitions – hurts politics. <br />

 US maintains Launch-on-Warning which ensures accidental launch - de-alert measures prove their disads untrue and de-targeting measures fail.<br />

In an October 2008 article entitled… fate of all humans and most other living things.<br />
<br />
Risk Calculus<br />
Inadvertent nuclear war is the most probable scenario for escalating nuclear conflict – mathematically, the accumulation of small probabilities makes the concept of Launch-on-Warning more dangerous than a try at Russian roulette. Phillips ’09 [Dr. Alan, Physicist who did research for the British army during World War II, “20 Mishaps that might have started accidental nuclear war,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/20-mishaps-maybe-caused-nuclear-war.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/accidents/20-mishaps-maybe-caused-nuclear-war.htm</a>]<br />
Ever since the two adversaries… been less than 50:50.<br />
<br />
And, each year the risk of miscalculation increases by 1-2% – there’s a 50% chance right now that a security event could be misperceived and cause extinction. Phillips &amp; Starr ’07 [Dr. Alan (Physicist who did research for the British army during World War II) &amp; Steven (Nuclear engineering expert and senior scientist for social responsibility, international network of engineers and scientists against proliferation, Jan 8, “Change Launch on Warning Policy,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldfederalistscanada.org/rload/Replace_LoW_Policy_8Jan.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldfederalistscanada.org/rload/Replace_LoW_Policy_8Jan.pdf</a>]<br />
It is very dangerous to allow… civilization, by a mere accident.<br />
<br />
Accidental launch is more probable than intentional nuclear war.<br />

How likely is an accidental nuclear war… miracle that it hasn't happened already.<br />

Intentional attacks won’t happen – neither side has interest in annihilating each other.<br />
