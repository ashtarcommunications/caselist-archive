The affirmative’s call for political action based on the narrative encapsulation of pain contained in their advantage is a futile and dangerous path for political resistance. Tying stories of trauma based on subjugated identities to legal recourse validates the power of the state to engage in subordination and prevents effective resistance by pitting groups against each other-<br />
Berlant, Professor of English at Chicago, 2000 (Cultural Studies &amp; Political Theory) sentimental culture takes its strength… construct the narrative to come.<br />
<br />
The affirmatives counter-hegemonic deployment of pain as a means to spur alleviation of trauma shields oppressive practices and makes violence bearable<br />
Berlant, Professor of English at Chicago, 2000 (Cultural Studies &amp; Political Theory) indeed, it would not be… for sustaining the hegemonic field<br />

Priveleging representations and a dogmatic anti orientalist agenda is not emanciaptory, its depolitizing propaganda- reaccesses the kritik<br />
Vhow, 2004 (“Towards an ethics of postvisuality: some thoughts on the recent work of zhang yimou” Poetics Today, 25(4) winter 2004 pg 678-9) in their semiotic-marxist, feminist…. In the form of an “ought”?<br />
<br />
The negative produces bad scholarship- essentializing middle eastern studies fractures coalition building and prevents political action<br />
Teitelbaum and Litvak, 2006 (Joshua and Meir, “Students, Teachers, and Eward Said: Taking Stock of Orientalism,” Middle East Review of International Affairs, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2493" rel="nofollow">http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/2493</a>) since the publication of orientalism… eastern society and politics<br />

Links more to the neg- the 1ac is a more nuanced account of modern politics- by glossing over the particulars the neg sacrifices the population to academic ideals<br />
Kramer, 2001 (“Ivory Towers on Sand” www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/islamobscured.htm) as an assessment of what had gone before… out of sympathy for Lebanese and Palestinians<br />

<br />
( __ ) The call to engage in an international non-proliferation regime is fundamentally about an attempt to rationally order the world along western values. America sees itself as the author of the world’s moral truisms and reinforces them through imperial international agreements- the drive to thus order the world conceals the violence of the technocratic world ordering process itself, undermining any chance for a lasting global peace<br />
