<strong>HIROSHIMA, 1945</strong>: THE FIRST ACT OF NUCLEAR AGGRESSION IS JUSTIFIED BY AN UNCONSCIOUS SYSTEM OF DOMINANCE AND RULES WHICH GOVERN THE AMERICAN BODY POLITIC. AN EXAMINATION OF THE CONTEMPORARY PSYCHE UNCOVERS A DISTURBING TRUTH: THE SAME NARCISSISTIC GRANDEUR THAT JUSTIFIED THE BOMB CONTINUES TODAY IN THE MAINTENANCE AND SURVIVAL OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. THE DEAD OF HIROSHIMA REMAIN IN DANGER AS LONG AS THE BOMB EXISTS AS AN OPTION, NO MATTER HOW ETHICALLY BANKRUPT.<br />

 <br />
<strong>ALAMAGORDO, 1944</strong>: ENRICO FERMI BRUSHES OFF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE USE OF THE BOMB MIGHT “INCINERATE THE ATMOSPHERE.” THEN AS NOW, NUCLEAR TECHNICIANS AND POLITICAL OPERATIVES GOVERN THE EVALUATION OF RISK AND THE MYSTICAL POSSIBILITIES OF CATASTROPHE. THIS CALCULATIVE THOUGHT FORMS THE BASIS FOR OUR ABILITY TO CREATE THE “ULTIMATE CATASTROPHE” – THE VICTIMS OF WHICH EXIST AS MERELY SPECTERS IN OUR SUBLIME IMAGINATION.<br />

<br />
<strong>AND</strong>: THE LESSION OF THE HIBAKUSHA DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE BOMB IS TO DESTROY ABSOLUTELY. OUR MAINTENANCE OF THE BOMB MEANS THAT EVERY BEING IS A HOLLOW SHELL, READY AT ANY MOMENT TO BECOME A NUCLEAR SURVIVOR. WE ARE ALL THE HIBAKUSHA, WHICH MEANS WE ARE ALREADY DEAD.<br />

<br />
<strong>FINALLY</strong>: THE BOMB COMPLETES THE BODY POLITIC’S PSYCHOLOGICAL DESIRE TO DESTROY THE SUBLIME, THAT WHICH IS WITHOUT REFERENT. A STATE OF CATASTROPHIC ANXIETY OVERCOMES US ALL: WE ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY RESPONSIBLE FOR AND VICTIMS OF OUR CATASTROPHIC BIOPOWER. TO HAVE THE BOMB IS TO USE THE BOMB, OBLITERATING BOTH METAPHOR AND REALITY.<br />

 <br />
THE BOMB CANNOT BE INTERNALIZED. THE ONLY ESCAPE FROM THE CYCLE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SUBJECT IS TO REFUSE TO PLAY THE GAME. WE MUST REJECT THE LIBERATING IDEOLOGY OF PROTECTION AND OPEN OURSELVES TO THE CATHARTIC CRISIS – THE ACT OF SELF-OVERCOMING IS TO CHOOSE TO DENY OURSELVES THE POWER OF THE BOMB AND RECLAIM OUR SUBJECTIVITY. THE PLAN IS OUR “HERMENUTIC OF ENGAGEMENT” WHICH SHATTERS THE KNOWN AND RUPTURES OUR LINK TO THE BOMB.<br />

 <br />
<strong>NOBODY HERE IS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS</strong>: THE GAME IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT FORMS AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPPOSE THE STATE IN A MICRO-LEVEL CONTESTATION. <strong>WE CALLED THE GOVERNMENT BUT NOBODY ANSWERED</strong> – WE CAN’T ACT AS IF THE REALM OF THE POLITICAL DOESN’T SURROUND US. OUR CALL IS TO ACT OUTSIDE OF THE FORMAL APPARATUS OF GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE INTIMACY OF DAILY INTERACTIONS.<br />
<br />
<strong>SPEAKING IS DOING</strong>: DEBATE ROUNDS ARE A TERRAIN OF DISSENT WHERE LANGUAGE ITSELF IS A FORM OF ACTION. WE DON’T REQUIRE YOU BELIVE IN THE FICTION OF FIAT IN ORDER TO CREATE CHANGE: THIS IS A PLACE WHERE THE POSSIBILITIES OF SOCIAL CHANGE EMERGE AND WE CAN ENGAGE IN EVERYDAY FORMS OF RESISTANCE.<br />
<br />
<strong>THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE AND TIME</strong>: NO FORUM IS TOO FAR REMOVED FROM THE CENTER OF POWER TO MAKE RESISTANCE UNNECESSARY. WE RESIST FROM WITHIN THE CENTER OF THE POLICYMAKING ELITE, CREATING SPACE FOR AUTONOMOUS THOUGHT AND CHALLENGING THE HEGEMONIC DISCOURSE OF THE STATUS QUO.<br />

 <br />
YOUR FRAMEWORK OF RATIONALITY PROTECTS THE FRAGILE PSYCHE OF THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, THE SAME PSYCHE WHICH ENGAGES IN DESTRUCTION. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK, WE MUST NOT SEEK TO DENY ITS LEGITIMACY. WE EXAMINED YOUR FRAMEWORK ON AN ONTOLOGICAL LEVEL AND FOUND IT WANTING.<br />

THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS TRADITIONAL POLICYMAKING BECAUSE AGENCY ISN’T LIMITED TO THE DELIBERATION OF STATESMEN. OUR DISSENT IS LOCATED WITHIN THE REALM OF THE EVERYDAY, THE NEW SITE FOR TRANSVERSAL STRUGGLES.<br />

ONE MUST EXAMINE THE THEORETICAL BASIS FOR POLICYMAKING. DEBATES ABOUT EFFECT CAN’T COME BEFORE INTERROGATIONS OF THE MODELS WHICH UNDERLIE OUR GRAND STRATEGY.<br />
