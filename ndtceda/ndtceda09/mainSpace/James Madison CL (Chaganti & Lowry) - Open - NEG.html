Sean read a narrative about how his personal experience has affected his advocacy of nuclear testing.<br />
<br />
Postcolonial feminism represents a necessary intersectional approach to understand and confront nuclear testing. Postcolonial feminism attends to multiple intesections of difference while recognizing that colonialist violence continues. Vote negative to challenge multiple sites of domination, affirm the unique place indigenous women occupy in the struggle against nuclear weapons testing<br />
Mack-Canty 2006 (Colleen, Assistant Professor of Political Science and Director of the Master of Public Administration Program at the University of Idaho, “ENVIRONMENTALISM AND POSTCOLONIAL FEMINISM: Examples of Third World Women's Resistance,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globaljusticecenter.org/papers2006/mackcantyENG.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globaljusticecenter.org/papers2006/mackcantyENG.htm</a>, date accessed Oct. 4, 2009) PM<br />
<br />
Western feminism generally... substance for humans.<br />
<br />
U.S. nuclear testing has and continues to devistate different indigenous populations throughout the U.S. Ratifying the CTBT is a key first step to confronting this undeclared nuclear warfare.<br />
Fleege 2005 (Laura, “A Journey of a Thousand Miles,” Talking Back Volume 4, Issue 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/talkingback/v4.1/fleege.htm" rel="nofollow">http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/talkingback/v4.1/fleege.htm</a>, date accessed Oct. 4, 2009) PM<br />
The only way...“our biggest enemy” (Swords).<br />
<br />
The history of U.S. nuclear tests on indigenous populations in the Pacific show: nuclear testing disproportionately affects women and children, as they are forced to bear the worst of the health impacts.<br />

The failure to engage in debate over political alternatives forces antagonistic agents into other destructive avenues and enables fill-in from the right, corporate and elite.<br />

<br />
New Labour represents ...tra ditional democratic spectrum.<br />
<br />
Exclusion is inevitable, every decision forecloses other possibilities. We must acknowledge the inevitable exclusions that form our agonistic and democratic politics to avoid naturalizing and essentializing exclusion.<br />

It is for that...their power structure.<br />

<br />
A well-functioning...basis of civility.<br />
<br />
Weak Ontology:<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative employs strong ontological claims as a basis for their affirmation. Assertions about agents, subjects, others, self and the world itself are premised in an orientation which presume certainity and resolution. The difference between weak and strong ontology is how you carry yourself and your most basic commitments. Strong ontology manifests in resolution and confidence while weak ontology acknowledges doubt and skepticism. Post 9/11 speeches by Bush and Graham demonstrate the subtle but important difference.<br />
<u>White 2005</u> (Stephen K., James Hart Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia, “Weak Ontology: Genealogy and Critical Issues,” <em>Hedgehog Review</em>, Summer, p.14-15) PM<br />
From the point of view of a strict secularist… hold upon the distinction between good and evil, us and the enemy.<span class="apple-style-span"><br />
</span><br />
Weak ontology insists that our conceptions of self, other and the world are characterized by contingency and indeterminacy. This makes possible ethico-political practices of care. Strong ontological claims, on the other hand, assume with certainty to know they way the world is. Strong ontological orientations violently eliminate that which their claims cannot capture.<br />
