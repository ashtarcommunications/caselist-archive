 Wake rd 4 v. George Washington ST<br />
<br />
Pepperdine FY Negative position:<br />
<br />
OFF CASE:<br />
<br />
2 minute video at beginning of speech to illustrate argument, cultural connection between bombs and sex. <br />
<br />
The Affirmative’s focus of nuclear weapons is only on matters of hardware and statistics at the expense of questions regarding the cultural assumptions that are used to justify the bombs existence.<br />
Spretnak 83 [Charlene, MA in English and American Literature from the University o0f California Berkeley, Naming the Cultural Forces That Push Us to War, found in the book “Exposing Nuclear Phallacies,” pgs 53-61] <br />
Women and men can … weapons and microwave devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />
<br />
The affirmative notices and willfully ignores the feminist standpoint on nuclear weapons.<br />
The omission of knowledge about women and the disempowered maintains gender hierarchies of control and violence.<br />
Tickner 2001 (Ann. Professor of Political Scienceat the College of the Holy Cross.Gendering World Politics. Columbia University Press.2001. p. 133)<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, as I have… the meaning of gender.<br />
<br />
These ideas legitimate and promote patriarchy which is rooted in the glamorization of atomic symbols.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>In a symbolic system in which nuclear weapons are conceptualized as extensions of the penis, the nuclear blast is the ultimate orgasm, eroticizing domination and legitimizing violence against women and the Earth.<br />
Caputi,1993 [Jane. Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Gossips, Gorgons, and Crones: The Fates of the Earth. p.53-54]<br />
<br />
I have extensively discussed the… bitches, bombshells, and scapegoats.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to redefine the rhetoric of nuclear weapons through a gendered analysis of culture to challenge the bomb’s position as a tool of domination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />
<br />
The Bomb is the central position to challenge and break down patriarchy. While it has radically altered our existence, it also illuminates the utter failure of masculinist domination. Rendering the nuclearist narrative obsolete can reconceptualize the reigning narratives. <br />
Caputi,1993. (Jane. Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Gossips, Gorgons, and Crones: The Fates of the Earth. p.29-30)<br />
<br />
In a series of books and articles… reconceptualizing the reigning narratives.<br />
<br />
We establish that this debate will function as a comparison of methodologies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The framework of this round is to evaluate the debate on who can better interrogate the rhetoric of nuclear weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Our methodology of cultural engagement is more appropriate for the context of academic debate and for this resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The following are reasons as to why this is true and why it warrants a ballot for the negative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />
<br />
Our framework mechanism of cultural engagement is a pedagogical practice used to highlight public memory and the history of the disempowered. While the affirmative’s pedagogical foundation chooses to willfully ignore feminist scholarship, we utilize our agency to rupture the silences of public memory, allowing for long-term transformation.<br />
Giroux 04<br />
<br />
Fifth, cultural studies… nonhierarchical social order<br />
<br />
ON CASE:<br />
Patriarchal domination is the primary form of oppression which shapes our lives in the home and in intimate relationships. Feminist struggle to end domination must be the central component of any movement to challenge institutionalized power and racism.<br />
hooks, 2005 (Feminism: A Transformational Politic (bell hooks))<br />
<br />
<br />
This knowledge seems especially… the power to dominate.<br />

New Alternative<br />
Alternative- To render technostrategic discourse obsolete, we must expose and delegitimate by destabilizing and interrupting patriarchal discourse only then can we begin to establish a new paradigm that is based on different values and interests.<br />
Susan McKay 01 March 1995 “Women's Voices in Peace Psychology: A Feminist Agenda” Women's Studies Program University of Wyoming Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology<br />
Johnson and Newcomb (1992) observed ….systems based on different values and interests.<br />
On Case:<br />
The affirmative constructs weapons as bodies and bodies as weapons, systematically gendering the war system. The only way to solve for the harms is to analyze and investigate the bond between men and weapons and how it is linked with violent notions of masculinity need to be analyzed before any sustainable policy exists.<br />
MYRTTINEN 2003 (Henri. “Disarming Masculinities.” Women, Men, Peace, and Security. Accessed via Google Scholar)<br />
<br />
The connection between men and weapons…—above all—power by directly and violently subjugating others.<br />
The affirmative represents war as an isolated event, a specific occurrence that can be avoided. It locates the state as the central agent in these events.<br />
Cuomo, Chris J 1996. [War is not just an event: Reflections on the significance of everyday violence. Hypatia, 11(4),30-45. Retrieved, from GenderWatch (GW) database. (Document 10: 10579489).]<br />
Philosophical attention to war … matter of good or bad intentions and identifiable decisions.<br />
<br />
This view wrong; the absence of war is not peace. War is an ongoing phenomenon enabled by a gendered, militaristic, and classed society. The focus on war and avoiding it is only a way to seal in privilege and force other political priorities to drop out of the picture.<br />
Cuomo, Chris J 1996. [War is not just an event: Reflections on the significance of everyday violence. Hypatia, 11(4),30-45. Retrieved, from GenderWatch (GW) database. (Document 10: 10579489).]<br />
<br />
Theory that does not investigate … perpetrated by military institutions and other militaristic agents of the state.<br />
<br />
Sexualization of the war system spills over into systematic sexual violence.<br />
MYRTTINEN 2003 (Henri. “Disarming Masculinities.” Women, Men, Peace, and Security. Accessed via Google Scholar)<br />
<br />
Most conflicts today are ‘low-…Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sierra Leone.26<br />
Western mass culture’s celebration of hyper-masculine war system has shaded how we think of peace. The culture of gendered militarism makes violence inevitable.<br />
MYRTTINEN 2003 (Henri. “Disarming Masculinities.” Women, Men, Peace, and Security. Accessed via Google Scholar)<br />
<br />
Notions of ‘warrior’ masculinity … as western intervention forces in Afghanistan, Iraq or Sierra Leone.32<br />
<br />
Turns Case- The affirmative is ignoring the hierarchal constructions of gender which perpetuates political relationships of domination and subordination<br />
<br />
Tickner, Ann 1992[Gender in International Relations pg 7/8]<br />
Framed in its own set …, I shall give a brief historical overview of the field as it has traditionally been constructed.<br />
<br />
Representations of military violence is an isolated event ignore the violence we<br />
all face in our every day lives.<br />
Cuomo, Chris J 1996. [War is not just an event: Reflections on the significance of everyday violence. Hypatia, 11(4),30-45. Retrieved, from GenderWatch (GW) database. (Document 10: 10579489).]<br />
Peach rightly identifies the …, persistent events, are practically and theoretically insufficient.<br />

 <br />
The 1AC is riddled with nuclear terminology and obscure acronyms, slangs, body counts, and technical calculations making weaponry seem playful and sexy.<br />
Cohn, Carol, 1987 [“Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals” Signs, Vol. 12, No. 4, Within and Without: Women, Gender, and Theory. (Summer, 1987), pp. 687-718]<br />
Although I was startled by the combination of dry abstraction and counter-inuitive imagery that characterizes ...forgetting about how one might just interfere with the next, not to mention with the lives beneath them.<br />
Knowledge construction is central to how we conceive of gender. The omission of knowledge about women and the disempowered maintains gender hierarchies of control and violence.<br />
Tickner 2001 (Ann. Professor of Political Scienceat the College of the Holy Cross.Gendering World Politics. Columbia University Press.2001. p. 133)<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, as I have also pointed out… serious miscommunication with conventionallR scholars. So, too, have different understandings of the meaning of gender.<br />
<br />
This abstract discourse used to describe nuclear weapons protects aggressors from the horrors of nuclear warfare and legitimizes nuclear weapons.<br />
Cohn and Ruddick 2003 [Carol, Sara. A Feminist Ethical Perspective on Weapons of Mass Destruction. Boston Consortium on Gender, Security, and Human Rights. Working Paper #104. p.11-12]<br />
<br />
Anti-war feminist attention to WMD …The victims, if they can speak at all, speak quite differently.<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s language constructs gender dichotomies which exclude the feminine and highly value the masculine. These views about gender shape our view of the world and have political effects.<br />
Cohn 2005 [“The Relevance of Gender for Eliminating Weapons of Mass Destruction” (with Felicity Hill and Sara Ruddick), also published in Disarmament Diplomacy, issue no. 80, Autumn 2005. Pg 2-3]<br />
A next crucial step in thinking about gender is to …shape how we see the world. And they have political effects.<br />
<br />
The system of nuclear icons is embedded in a system of power. These icons produce truth, objectify of the Other, and reinforce dominant narratives in order to justify state action and violence.<br />
Harriman 2007 (No Caption Needed. P 1-4)<br />
<br />
These images and a few others like them are the icons ofv.s. public culture… of visual eloquence-that reproduces an idealism essential for democratic continuity.<br />
<br />
These ideas legitimate and promote patriarchy which is rooted in the glamorization of atomic symbols. In a symbolic system the nuclear weapon is conceptualized as extensions of the penis and the nuclear blast is the ultimate orgasm. This leads to violence against female nature, and violence in society.<br />
Caputi,1993 [Jane. Professor of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Gossips, Gorgons, and Crones: The Fates of the Earth. p.53-54]<br />
<br />
I have extensively discussed the connections between sexual and nuclear violences in earlier writings, …self-serving fantasies that perceive women as objects, evil seducers, bitches, bombshells, and scapegoats.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to problematize the current use of technostrategic discourse and rebuild a new narrative relying on diverse voices which include emotions, bodily experience, and passion.<br />
Cohn, Carol, 1987 [“Sex and Death in the Rational World of Defense Intellectuals” Signs, Vol. 12, No. 4, Within and Without: Women, Gender, and Theory. (Summer, 1987), pp. 687-718]<br />
I do not wish to discuss or judge the holding of “objectivity…diverse voices who conversations with each other will invent those futures.
