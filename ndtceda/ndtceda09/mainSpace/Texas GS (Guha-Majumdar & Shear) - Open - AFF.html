 Contention 1: Disciplinary Strategies<br />
<br />
First, nuclear weapons function as a form of torture on a massive scale, a rhetorical device to make the subject speak the language of the state and experience the silence of his or her own voice, turning political subjects into objects that are parrots of the state. Our bodies have become the battleground upon which militaristic forces deconstruct agency. This attempt at the utter denial of consent or dissent accounts for nuclear weapon’s particular obscenity in the realm of war-making.<br />
<br />
Grimes ’05 [Charles, Asst. Pf. of Theater and English @ St. Leo University, Harold Pinter's Politics-A Silence Beyond Echo, p. ]<br />
<br />
<br />
If silence is… Pinter's political plays.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, Modern technocratic nuclear discourse is a form of discursive discipline - determining who and who may not speak, privileging expert rationalities that colonize global commons, and providing for false dichotomies between the “technical” and “public” spheres in other policy arenas.<br />
Kinsella ’05 [William, Associate Professor at North Carolina State University, Interdisciplinary Program Director—Science, Technology and Society, “One Hundred Years of Nuclear Discourse: Four Master Themes and Their Implications for Environmental Communication”, in The Environmental Communication Yearbook by Susan Senecah, pg.52-54]<br />
<br />
Additionally, Ruthven pointed… this value preference<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth regime established by nuclear ‘experts’ is dominated by a sanitized hyper-technical discourse which normalizes both speakers and recipients through ‘terministic screens’ that portray war as a logistical endeavor, one that is benign and not repulsive, moving nuclear war from the realm of the possible to the realm of the probable.<br />
Edward Sciappa. Assistant Professor of Speech at Kansas State University. “The Rhetoric of Nukespeak.” Communication Monographs. 56: September 1989. pp. 253-272<br />
<br />
Nukespeak actively structures… war will be”<br />
<br />
<br />
Third, The bureaucratic structure of the nuclear weapons system numbs the individual to its genocidal process, allowing the displacement of agency onto these structures – individuals are “just following orders”.<br />
<br />
LIFTON AND MARKUSEN, 1990 Robert Jay, Eric, The Genocidal Mentality Pt 3: In defense of Idealistic Moralismvs 'Pragmatism', <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.awitness.org/journal/idealistic_moralism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awitness.org/journal/idealistic_moralism.html</a><br />
In the end… of its purpose<br />
<br />
Contention 2: The Magic Missileer<br />
<br />
Missileers are the forgotten figures of nuclear politics - the men and women who turn the key to launch nuclear weapons, literally holding the fate of millions in their hands.<br />
<br />
DAILY MAIL (London) 2000 [Christopher Matthew, May 26, “Still all set for Armageddon”, lexis]<br />
<br />
WHEN U.S. Air… on Frontier Day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Missileers have become simple extensions of nuclear weapons and authoritarian directives, a symbol of the disappearance of individual agency in the nuclear weapons complex<br />
<br />
The Scotsman 2k [Hannah Mcgill, May 26, “AH GOOD, THE WORLD'S IN SAFE HANDS”, lexis, AG]<br />
<br />
Sometimes the yawning… to vaporise me.<br />
<br />
<br />
PLAN: United States federal government missileers should choose not to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention 3: The Care of the Self<br />
<br />
Just as all policy debate is necessarily a persuasive act towards a change from the status quo, The 1AC is a persuasive act toward the question of whether the missileer should break with the status quo and choose not to turn the key to launch nuclear weapons. An affirmative ballot is an endorsement of the missileer’s disobedience, which is a simultaneous affirmation of disobedience against the techno-strategic discourse of the nuclear complex. Our choice is either to speak out and disobey or continue to submit to nuclear ‘experts.’<br />
<br />
We choose to disobey – In the face of the atrocity of nuclear weapons, we affirm the disobedience inherent in refusing to turn the key. The affirmative places the debate space within the ethical dilemma of nuclear destruction. The missileer decision to disobey the orders of the nuclear bureaucracy is an infusion of presence into the weapons, a re-establishment of ethical agency, and a re-personalization of war.<br />
<br />
Lewy, Pf. of Political Science at Smith College, ’61 (Guenter, “Superior Orders, Nuclear Warfare, and the Dictates of Conscience: The Dilemma of Military Obedience in the Atomic Age”, American Political Science Review, Vol. 55, No 1, March, 1961, pp 3-24)<br />
<br />
When Francis Gary… non-violent resistance.&quot;'<br />
<br />
Our ethical framework is the care of the self – the individual’s manipulation of power relations for the purpose of self-formation, a delimitation of his or her ethical agency through an identification and reversal of disciplinary strategies. The missileer’s disobedience in the face of the disciplinary forces of the nuclear complex is a recognition and transgression of its normalizing limitations that is irreducible to political success or failure.<br />
<br />
Bernauer and Mahon ‘05[James W, Professor of Philosophy and Boston College, and Michael, associate professor of humanities at Boston University’s College of General Studies, “Foucault’s Ethical Imagination” in The Cambridge Companion to Foucault Second Edition, edited by Gary Gutting]<br />
<br />
The explicit ethical… a political force.<br />
<br />
<br />
Endorsement of the figure of the disobedient missileer uses the ballot as a rhetorical gesture and transforms rhetoric itself into a practice of liberty. Our argument is not that we &quot;free&quot; ourselves or the missileer from military domination. &quot;Freedom&quot; of the individual is not a pre-existing, natural state that can be returned to. Freedom exists only in practices of liberty. Disobedience is an act imbued with the message that ethics is the only practice of liberty and liberty the only meaning of ethics. Rejection of consent to nuclear murder through an act of disobedience communicates the &quot;ethos of freedom,&quot; the epitome of caring for others through care of self. This is a radical reorientation of politics that demolishes the barrier between ethical and political.<br />
<br />
Foucault, '84 (Michel, &quot;The ethic of care for the self as a practice of freedom&quot;, interview Jan. 20 1984, conducted by raul fornet-betancourt, helmut becker, alfredo gomez muller. translated by j.d. gauthier, s.j. The Final Foucault.)<br />
<br />
Q: A work of… care for self.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, our ethics requires looking beyond the politics of life and death – the engagement with and transgression of the nuclear complex represents an impatience for liberty that will not submit to a hypothetical, messianic future<br />
<br />
Bernauer and Mahon ‘94 [James W, Professor of Philosophy and Boston College, and Michael, associate professor of humanities at Boston University’s College of General Studies, “The Ethics of Michel Foucault” in The Cambridge Companion to Foucault, edited by Gary Gutting]<br />
<br />
What is the… the human essence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A true ethical evaluation necessitates forgoing strict morality and utilitarian rationalism – both are only outgrowths of law’s conceptual domination that limit ethical possibilities. We affirm a loose moral framework that allows for an ‘ethics of existence’, the ability for individuals to negotiate their position relative to this framework.<br />
<br />
Bevir ’99 [Mark Bevir, Professor of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley “Foucault and Critique: Deploying Agency Against Autonomy” (1999). Political Theory. 27, pp. 65-84]<br />
<br />
I hope my… personal, ethical conduct.<br />
<br />
<br />
Claims of nuclear expertise and war planning are nothing more than shamanism. They are based in tenuous assumptions and not real research. Expertise is manufactured in order to silence competing voices. Engaging in social struggles is necessary to challenge expert domination.<br />
