 Focus on subjective violence and easily identifiable flashpoints of conflict misses the boat- only focusing on the background or objective violence can solve the root cause- cannot be viewed from the same standpoint- the call to act will be strong but responding creates a stop-gap which prevents engaging in criticisms of capital<br />
Zizek 2008 (Slavoj, Violence, 1-4)<br />
If there is a unifying thesis... respect towards its victims.<br />
<br />
Capital is the root cause of all their impacts- denounce their simple relationship with violence because the system of capital produces the material reality which makes violence inevitable<br />
Zizek 2008 (Slavoj, Violence, 11-12)<br />
There is an old joke... the situation of capital.<br />
<br />
The demand for urgency is a product of hypocritical outrage meant to extend privilege- our alternative is to do nothing in the face of the affirmative.<br />
