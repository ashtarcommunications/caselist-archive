US should adopt a declaratory policy of first strike on any country the United States can prove either intentionally or accidentally leaked nuclear materials to a terrorist organization that uses that material to attack the United States or its allies. <br />
The United should initiate a multilateral effort to require that all states submit detailed isotopic data on the nuclear materials they produce and to submit to the data's verification to the International Atomic Energy Agency. <br />
The United States should not retaliate against Russia for an attack carried out by terrorists using materials received from Russia.<br />
The United States should offer Pakistan assistance in securing its nuclear arsenal against thefts and leaks as well as any country that requests such assistance.<br />
The United States should guarantee assistance to all countries to secure their nuclear arsenal against thefts and leaks without conditions – this should include providing technology oversight, funding, and multilateral assistance while clearly stating the intentions to not push for disarmament or requiring access to a countries nuclear arsenal.<br />
The United States federal government should implement pilot programs throughout the globe to promote the development of clean water access projects focusing on the regions most at need while increasing public-private partnerships to mobilize resources and technologies to improve global access to water.<br />

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">FIRST - Declares without ambiguity that any country that leaks nuclear materials to a terrorist that uses them will be attacked by the U.S. – this solves the ambiguity of the status-quo and solves – it undermines terrorist motivations because they fear the country will be blamed. The only disad to this – commitment traps &amp; secret leaks are solved by the other planks. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">SECOND The multilateral effort to gather isotopic data solves in two ways –  </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">A. it answers all their commitment trap crap – the US would be able to test the DNA of the explosion and figure out exactly where it came from – which eliminates any risk of another IRAQ. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">THIRD – the counterplan offers assistance to every country in the world that we will personally help them secure their nuclear systems.

<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";">FOURTH – the advocate explicitly states that the US will not start a nuke war with Russia – means there is no way to win an internal link to that impact – any solvency deficit is limited to a nuke war between the United States and NOT RUSSIA.  </span><br />

Role refers to the typical function performed by something<br />
<br />
Oxford English Dictionary, 89 (online, at Emory)<br />

Restricting the role requires restricting the range of weapons that nuclear weapons can be used to deter<br />

CP - US-Russia Military Exchange CP<br />
<br />
Text: The United States and Russia should expand military-to-military exchanges at operational facilities to include notification of satellite launches and divulging information concerning procedures for control, doctrine and technologies of command and control architecture. The United States and Russia should extend requirements of information exchange concerning movement of weapons systems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That solves mistaken launches, reduces threat of a first strike and preserves deterrence.<br />

Case Arguments<br />
<br />
1. No accidental launch.<br />
<br />
Quinlan ‘9 (Michael, Former Permanent Under-Sec. State – UK Ministry of Defense, “Thinking about Nuclear Weapons: Principles, Problems, Prospects”, p. 63-69)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. No U.S. or Russian launch on warning<br />
<br />
Ford, 08 - Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Technology and Global Security at the Hudson Institute, and formerly U.S. Special Representative for Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State.

<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Multiple factors in relations make launch a zero probability<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />
<br />
1. Verification fails and is unenforceable – it’s more likely to trigger verfication conflicts than build trust<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
2. De-Alert increases crisis instability --- causes re-alert races during crisis that are substantially more destabilizing that current alert levels.<br />

<br />
restrict<br />
verb [T]<br />
to limit (an intended action) esp. by setting the conditions under which it is allowed to happen<br />
The state legislature voted to restrict development in the area.<br />
Efforts are under way to further restrict cigarette advertising.<br />
<br />
This excludes the power to prohibit<br />
Words and Phrases, 04 (vol 37A, p. 406)<br />
<br />
Miss. 1927. To “restrict” is to restrain within bounds; to limit; to confine, and does not mean to destroy or prohibit.—Dart v. City of Gulfport, 113 So. 441, 147 Miss. 534.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Violation – the affirmative bans a role or mission – they don’t restrict it.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Voting issue -<br />
<br />
1. limits – there are a finite number of affs that have advocates for restrictions instead of prohibitions – like de-alert or CTBT. Allowing straight prohibitions makes EVERY elimination of a mission or role topical.<br />
<br />
2. neg ground – they destroy our core generic counterplan ground – the affi should have to advocate a condition on the missions and roles - this means the negative should get disarm<br />
