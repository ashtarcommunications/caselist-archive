<strong><u>Nuclear Colonialism K</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Internal colonialism means that the federal government has complete control over who, what, and how it exploits indigenous people. America’s globally dominant economic and military power is at the expense of American Indian systematic disempowerment and death.</strong><br />
<strong>Churchill 1997</strong> (Ward, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and the Denial in the Americas 1492 to Present, City Lights Books, San Francisco, 1997, Prof. American Indian Studies at the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder pg. 292-93)<br />
“Under the neatly crafter system…the internal colonies of the native North”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Assertions of legitimacy in the interest of the world are exactly the same as the USFG’s tyranny over Native Americans and assured their subsequent genocide</strong><br />

“According to the final (1979) report…consent to massive resource expropriation.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Nuclear colonialism cannot be maintained—putting all human existence in peril.</strong><br />
<strong>Churchill 2002</strong> (Ward, “Struggle for the land: Native American Reisistence to genocide, ecocide, and colonization.” pg 278)<br />
“Neither genocide nor ecocide can be…once their victims have died.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Decolonization of indigenous land is key to resolving the entire nuclear dilemma. This must be our first priority.</strong><br />
<strong>Churchill 1997</strong> (Ward, A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and the Denial in the Americas 1492 to Present, City Lights Books, San Francisco, 1997, Prof. American Indian Studies at the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado, Boulder pg. 347-49)<br />
“Plainly, the nuclear establishment has…rapidly opening beneath our feet.”<br />

<strong>First the Affirmative is a nice, neatly packed description of the world--too nice in fact. Simplistic narratives that attempt to outline a global harm an a simplistic, state based solution, are not value neutral inevitabilities but are part of a larger discursive method. Which means chaos and violence are always situated out there, never in here. Unfortunately, this global speak is cyclical; harms are never systemic and can always be &quot;solved for&quot; with more beautiful narratives of clean orders like the affirmative.<br />
Nayar 1999</strong> (Jayan, Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems, Fall 1999, pp. Lexis Nexis)<br />
&quot;It has become a convienience...times is the order of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Unifying around the state as a solution to status quo problems invests dominant regimes with the power to destroy difference and homogenize culture to be easily managed beings.</strong><br />
<strong>Nayar 1999</strong> (Jayan, Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems, Fall 1999, pp. Lexis Nexis)<br />
&quot;Following around the state as...of mythic solidarities and common destinies.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>The regime of global order is wrapped up in consumption as a part of the larger desire to fit within the world order designated by powerful structure like capitalism. Their case is turned because they maintained a new violent system of colonialism masked by &quot;new&quot; discourses. The very idea of a &quot;new world order&quot; reproduces violent systems of assimilation and erasure because everything that exists outside of it is to be destroyed.</strong><br />
<strong>Nayar 1999</strong> (Jayan, Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems, Fall 1999, pp. Lexis Nexis)<br />
&quot;Despite the vision of world-order...as the basis for human relations.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Only questioning world orders in our own communities challenges its symbolic power--Invoking the &quot;I&quot; question is a necessary prerequisite toward change.</strong><br />
<strong>Nayar 1999</strong> (Jayan, Transnational Law and Contemporary Problems, Fall 1999, pp. Lexis Nexis)<br />
&quot;The description of the continuities...to consider the &quot;technologies&quot; of ordering.&quot;
