Four days after the nuclear attack on Nagasaki, General John Hull of the War Department Operations Division spoke to Colonel L.E. Seaman about the critical juncture the United States faced having detonated its entire stockpile of nuclear weapons, yet the surrender of Japan remained 2 days in their future:<br />
[Declassified transcript of Aug 13, 1945 telephone conversation -- <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf</a></span>]<br />
<br />
This was the true beginning of the story of nuclear weapons policy in the United States – the first moment in which policy makers questioned what to do with the growing capacity to build nuclear weapons faster and faster. Our view of nuclear weapons is viewed through the smoothing lens of history that focuses on “deterrence” and “cold war mentality” and strategies of “mutually assured destrcution” as inevitabilities of nuclear weapons, but this obscures events such as this phone conversation that reveal that decision makers were unsure of what to do with the nuclear weapons being constructed.<br />
<br />
After the surrender of Japan, growing tensions with the Soviet Union forced the next crucial turning point in the development of nuclear weapons policy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The conventional narrative of history invokes the “cold war mentality” but far from an inevitable mentality, a secret battle raged among military officials over the shape of U.S. policy, with several key leaders striving to limit nuclear the stockpile to the bare minimum they believed necessary to ensure that the Soviet Union would never risk launching a nuclear war.<br />

However at this juncture these voices were drowned out by the Air Force and its ally the RAND Corporation – a joint venture of the Air Force and major defense contractor Douglas Aircraft – who saw an opportunity in the candidacy of Jack Kennedy to shift the course of nuclear policy toward more and more weapons<br />

The use of the term “overkill” was not an exaggeration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Admiral Roy Johnson, the Deputy Director of the Joint Strategic Planning Staff during this era would later say of the Air Force’s drive: [quote available at <span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none; text-underline: none;"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb236/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb236/index.htm</a></span>]<br />
<br />
This policy of “overkill” to assure completely destroying the military prowess of the Soviet Union coincidentally required far more nuclear weaponry and, despite its name, entailed far more devastation to Russian and Chinese civilians than prior nuclear policies<br />

As decision makers in the United States stumbled through these uncertainties and dragged the rest of the world behind them, over 70,000 nuclear warheads were contracted and built due to the Cold War arms race. Reviewing the decisions made at each of these junctures, there is no inevitable conclusion, no “cold war mentality” but a network of synergistic factors – nodes of power not seeking to destroy the world, but to expand their industry and budgets – the motivations that are blindly accepted as the “admirable” traits of capitalism<br />

<br />
In the context of nuclear weapons, the banal motivations of capitalism, the drive to expand industry and budgets that dominated the development of nuclear weapons policy and these impulses, usually lauded for increasing efficiency while leaving the harms they exact obscured, are illuminated for their capacity to directly risk mass murder and extinction in the pursuit of self-interest. We stand resolved that the United States Federal Government should abolish its nuclear weapons arsenal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>The purpose of the affirmative’s genealogical interrogation of the events that gave rise to U.S. nuclear policy is to problematize that history and provide a starting point for reorienting our ethical relationship toward nuclear weapons from one that recognizes weapons as purely “security” concerns toward one that recognizes these weapons as the grotesque reflection of the horrors of capitalism.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>In this way, our demand reflects a point from which we can challenge the uncritical acceptance of capitalism as harmless.<br />
<br />
The genealogical examination of the Affirmative problematizes history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>This is central to destabilize our own subjectivities and recreate ourselves as ethical beings<br />
Rabinow 97 (Paul, Professor of Anthropology at U.C. Berkley, “Introduction,” Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth, p. xxxv-xxxvi)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span><br />
The contradictions revealed by genealogical interrogation, and making ethical demands upon the government, even on the aspirational level, exposes cracks within capitalism and opens space for change<br />

War is the safety valve of the capital system – so long as we continue a nuclear policy under the guise that expansionism is inevitable capitalism will threaten human survival<a name="_Toc201133343"></a><br />

<br />
The system of capital makes social exclusion on a global scale inevitable – the utmost ethico-political responsibility is to reject this system of economic evaluation<br />
