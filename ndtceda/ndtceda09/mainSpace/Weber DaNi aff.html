First, Nuclear Weapons represent a false sense of security, perpetuating a denial of vulnerability and flawed policies of realism, isolationism and expansionism that attempt to protect the United States from all threats around the globe. Nuclear weapons today prove that we live in a state of shared global vulnerability to violence. The current US stance ignores the call of other nations for us to embrace a community created by our shared exposure to violence and loss.<br />

The theme of this present conference... save our common world.<br />
<br />
And, The warmth of current US politics deny acts of vulnerability by exploiting fear and detachment. The time has come for all of us to remove these blankets and expose our weaknesses. The &quot;loss&quot; of security is necessary to rearticulate and reorient our social and political spaces.<br />

<br />
Furthermore: We believe that the United States nuclear arsenal denies vulnerability and is used to maintain a regime of constant violence in the name of peace. We embrace insecurity ourselves and stand in opposition to the deadly order imposed on the world by the United States arsenal.<br />
<br />
And, voting aff is an embrace of the mutual vulnerability that makes community possible<br />

And, Vulnerability constitutes a community freed from security by marking the spot where being hurt and being loved form the inseparable and inescapable unity at the heart of the humanRolfsen 2008 (Cdr.

In line with this... preventing its misuse.<br />
<br />
And, We all posses vulnerability in our bodies. But it is the mindfulness of that vulnerability that leads to productive non-military solutions. We must disrupt the fantasy of mastery that is implicit in our politics surrounding nuclear weapons to stop systemic violence.Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .28-29)<br />
Mourning, fear, anxiety, rage. ... exposure to this condition?<br />
<br />
And, Each of us is constituted politically by the social vulnerability of our bodies, we are united by our risk to violence. The dispossessing effect of loss, from illness to global conflict, can found an unrealized communityButler, 2004 (Judith Butler, is an American post-structuralist philosopher, who has contributed to the fields of feminism, queer theory, political philosophy, and ethics.

<br />
And, A re-oreintation towards feminist politics offers the greatest possibility to collectively deal with our fundemental politics of security. Vulnerability avoids dominant masculine political discourse by not drawing a line between assimilation or erasure. We can no longer be &quot;us or them&quot; because we can be &quot;we&quot;<br />
Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg. 42)<br />
Feminism surely could... between the two.<br />
<br />
And, Vulnerability is an ethical form of engagement that once recognized has the power to reconstitute itself. We are actively performing this recognition through our advocacy in our discourse.Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .40-41)<br />
By insisting on a... an expanded operation.<br />
<br />
And, creating a social transformation to accept the vulnerability of our bodies occurs through individual re-articulation of social practices. An aff ballot despite any and all negative offense can rupture the prevailing episteme of our culture and distraught community by enabling a new relationship to the violence done to our bodies by both our activity and our government<br />

Furthermore, dissent and disruption are necessary strategies to oppose the static values of politics. We must maintain a critical view of politics even in a world blanketed in the stigma of security.Butler 2004 (Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, Verso, New York, 2004, pg .XVIII-XIXI)The Levinasian face... instrument of censorship.
