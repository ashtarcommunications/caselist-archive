Wall Street Journal, 2-19,  <br />
“LONDON-U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, acknowledging he is the underdog” …. “what is seen as the most dramatic U.K. ballot since his party swept to power in 1997.”<br />
Further reductions in the US arsenal will prompt Britainn to cut its nuclear arsenal <br />
Reuters, 9, July 16 <br />
“Britain could look at further reductions in the number” …. “for the UK to reconsider the size of its own stockpile.”<br />
This ensures a Brown victory in 2010 <br />

“There has been speculation that Britain could be considering scaling” …. “scrap nuclear weapons completely rather than replace Trident.”<br />

International Tobin tax would create an inevitable economic calamity <br />
Business Insider, 9, 11-9 <br />
“The idea of a financial transaction tax has never made much” …. “the Fed would simply have to fund the deflationary effects of the tax by printing money and buying securities.” <br />

 A rusian nuclear first-strike is imminent – LoW is key to deterring them<br />
Skousen 2006. Jel, political scientist and specialist in security, “A nuclear Knife Aimed at America’s Heart” Online. Nov 15.<br />
“The impetus to change U.S. strategic nuclear doctrine… targeting data from satellites) strike targets that are still viable.”<br />
<br />
2NC -<br />
1.Russia has an overwhelming number of forces – they think that they can totally annihilate our ability to 2nd strike in a world in which we don’t launch on warning. Our forces can only effectively survive if launched<br />
the arg is that Russia won’t believe that we have enough surviving forces to fight effectively<br />
Without LoW, Russia believes it can totally annihilate the US 2nd strike capability – this means it wouldn’t be destructive at all for them. The entire thesis of ouf DA is that MAD won’t apply because we won’t be able to effectively destroy them.<br />
Russia is preparing for a first strike – the only reason for this is so they can first-strike. There is no other reason to build bunkers and enhance first-strike technology unless first strike is being planned.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Forces won’t be perceived as surviving – communication links will be cut off.<br />
Skousen 2006 – Joel (Online)<br />
“Clinton national security aide Robert bell…and satellites are downed in a first strike.”<br />
3. Russia thinks we won’t retaliate since we’ll have lost too many forces<br />
Koehle 9. (Stuart, “The Weekly Standard Online)<br />
“survivability is perhaps the critical element of strategic deterrence…the question of false alarms or even an accidental launch.”<br />
4. Subs don’t deter effectively – Russia knows it can destroy them<br />
Lowther 2009. (Adam, April, Online)<br />
“our country’s adversaries would be well aware…as the Nuclear Posture Review gets under way.”<br />
5. Launch on Warning is key to ability to retaliate<br />
Blair 2006. Bruce G. “The Fallacy of Nuclear Primacy”<br />
“both the professors and their critics also muddy…and preferred option in their strategic war plans.”<br />
6. If our land nuclear forces are destroyed, Russia only has to destroy a couple more targets<br />
Huessy 2009 (Peter) Geostrategic Analysis (march/April “Unclear Nucleate Logic?”<br />

At the crux of the review is the question of targets and strategy…it strongly affect the size and composition of U.S. nuclear forces.<br />
