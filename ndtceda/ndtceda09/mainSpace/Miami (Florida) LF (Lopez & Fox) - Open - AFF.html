<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation One: TRANSPARENCY<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obama will pursue deep cuts in operationally deployed warheads, pressure allies and enemies alike to do the same, ban testing and production of fissile material, and revise u.s. nuclear posture – even if some of these efforts ultimately fail, unilateral reductions are inevitable<br />
<br />

<br />
Obama’s plan has three steps. First, the United States will recognize that nuclear weapons have only a deterrent function … Russian President Medvedev has signaled that he is ready to engage in negotiations with Mr. Obama to accelerate the reduction of nuclear arsenals. US Assistant Secretary of State Gottemoeller held talks in Moscow on a replacement for the START, which will expire in December 2009.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Current warhead counting rules mean that pledged reductions exist in name only – thousands of warheads awaiting dismantlement are maintained to provide significant “upload” potential<br />
<br />
Jeffrey Lewis and Meri Lugo, 4-13-2009, Director of the Nuclear Strategy and Nonproliferation Initiative at the New America Foundation; research intern at the New America Foundation, “Where nuclear weapons go to die,” Foreign Policy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://experts.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/13/where_nuclear_weapons_go_to_die" rel="nofollow">http://experts.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/13/where_nuclear_weapons_go_to_die</a><br />
<br />
Speaking in Prague on April 5, U.S. President Barack Obama called the thousands of nuclear weapons sitting in world arsenals &quot;the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War.&quot; He proposed deep cuts in U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles. But when policymakers talk about nuclear reductions, what do they mean in practice? ... So, even if we agree to get rid of them, nuclear weapons will be with us for quite a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this means any future reductions only increase the dismantlement backlog – and the infrastructure necessary to store them safely doesn’t exist<br />
<br />
Charles Digges, 5-13-2009, Editor of Bellona Web, Bellona Foundation, “Problems of where to store extra plutonium from deeper Cold war weapons cuts dog Obama,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2009/obama_weapons_cuts_storage" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellona.org/articles/articles_2009/obama_weapons_cuts_storage</a><br />
<br />
US President Barack Obama plans for deep new cuts in America’s nuclear arsenal comes at a time when the government is facing a 15-year backlog of warheads already awaiting dismantlement, and billions of dollars are needed for new facilities to store and dispose of plutonium. … Among those areas where a US backlog in weapons dismantlement are likely to become apparent quickly are a Texas storage site for plutonium pits, which will start hitting space shortages in 2014, an inspector general audit released earlier this years said.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
implementing further reductions without verifiably disabling warheads awaiting dismantlement makes all progress in arms control easily reversible, failing to generate confidence that the reductions are meaningful<br />
<br />
Steven E. Miller, Sep 2000, “A Comprehensive Approach to Nuclear Arms Control,” in Arms Control and Disarmament: A New Conceptual Approach, United Nations Publications, Department for Disarmament Affairs, DDA Occasional Papers, No.4, p.22-24, googlebooks<br />
<br />
3 A comprehensive approach to nuclear arms control would seek to control warheads in reserve as well as deployed warheads. Washington and Moscow generally have retained inventories of nuclear weapons that were not actually deployed with either strategic or tactical forces. … Such rules would be a desirable component of a comprehensive approach to nuclear arms control, since this would prevent rapid redeployment of weapons slated for destruction.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this reversibility dramatically increases the risk of breakout, ensuring multiple scenarios for a failure of deterrence and subsequent nuclear war:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
first, fears of greater upload potential risk miscalculation and force regeneration, which uncontrollably escalates<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
second, inexperience with force regeneration also risks accidental launch<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
third, centralizing warhead storage jeopardizes survivability and creates perverse incentives for first-strikes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and, the visibility and time required to upload means there’s no upside<br />
<br />
Dr. Kathleen C. Bailey, 3-31-1998, Senior Fellow at National Institute for Public Policy, former Assistant Director for Nuclear and Weapons Control, Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Statement Before the US Senate Armed Services Committee, Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980331kb.htm" rel="nofollow">http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980331kb.htm</a><br />
<br />
Proposed de-alerting measures have a number of significant detrimental effects, one of the most important being their impact on deterrence. … If warheads were dispersed in many storage facilities to make them less inviting targets, the task of protecting them would be extraordinarily demanding compared to the security required for either warheads on missiles, or warheads in few storage areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
pit-stuffing is the only process which can irreversibly and verifiably disarm nuclear warheads within minutes without compromising sensitive information<br />
<br />
Matthew Bunn, 1998, Assistant Director of the Science, Technology and Public Policy Program in the Belfar Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, “‘Pit-Stuffing’: How To Disable Thousands of Warheads and Easily Verify Their Dismantlement,” FAS Public Interest Report, 51(2), Mar/Apr, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/faspir/pir0498.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/faspir/pir0498.htm</a><br />
<br />
Technology exists which makes it possible to disable thousands of nuclear warheads, rapidly, permanently, and verifiably -- and to verify their dismantlement with a minimum of cost and intrusion. … This technology can offer policy-makers new options - and deprive them of excuses for not pursuing deep, transparent, and irreversible reductions in nuclear arms.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this resolves dismantlement bottlenecks and eliminates problems with storage<br />

<br />
Post Cold-War U.S.-Russian relations provide a unique window of opportunity for disarmament. How frustrating then to find that political leaders on both sides are failing to seize these opportunities, and to discover that bottlenecks in dismantling warheads, or storing them securely, can turn potentially rapid progress in disabling nuclear weapons into eyeball glazing decade-long disarmament processes. … In sum, pit-stuffing makes large-scale &quot;instant&quot; disarmament a real and a live option. And this could change a lot in the calculations of decision-makers on whether to attempt fuller exploitation of the present window of opportunity for disarmament.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
implementing pit-stuffing now is key – verification after deep cuts is too late to solve confidence<br />

<br />
Verifying the warhead and fissile material declarations of the United States and Russia will be an enormous endeavor. Because it will take many years for states to gain confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the declaration, verification should begin as far in advance of deep reductions as possible. … Such operations could be readily verified by existing materials measurement and accounting procedures.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
observation two: RUSSIA<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
consultations with russia over reductions are ongoing, and although a treaty is inevitable, disagreements over warhead counting rules and european missile defense have resulted in lowered expectations and drawn-out negotiations, bolstering the position of hard-liners in the russian defense establishment and preventing meaningful progress<br />

CHARLES D. FERGUSON: Well, Bernie, because the START agreement is going to expire in early December, that's one of the main motivations to have this summit here in -- you know, coming in early July -- as you point out, it's still early in the -- President Obama's term -- but because there are relatively few months left to have a follow-on START agreement. … There was some work done on that in the late 1990s and I think the presidents may talk about trying to get interest going again in that particular area.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
upload capability is the primary concern of the russian defense establishment – absent transparency measures, mistrust will collapse the entire nonproliferation agenda<br />

Blank, Mar 2009, the Strategic Studies Institute’s expert on the Soviet bloc and the post-Soviet world since 1989, former Associate Professor of Soviet Studies at the Center for Aerospace Doctrine, Research, and Education, Maxwell Air Force Base, and taught at the University of Texas, San Antonio, and at the University of California, Riverside, Ph.D., M.A. History, University of Chicago, B.A. History, University of Pennsylvania, “Russia and Arms Control: Are There Opportunities for the Obama Administration?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub908.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Whereas Russia is destroying or cannot replace nuclear weapons equal to the enhancement of U.S. conventional and nuclear capabilities, America, by walking out of the ABM treaty and refusing any kind of verification or constraint upon its ability to upload or replenish weapons, has a huge strategic nuclear reserve that can be quickly mobilized for military purposes. … Absent such reassurance and such an anchor, we will all be sailing on very stormy seas without a rudder and with a corpse in the cargo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
scenario a: stockpile security<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
russia has demanded the u.s. make nuclear reductions irreversible by destroying warheads awaiting dismantlement – u.s. agreement is critical to boost the position of russian moderates and secure access to russian stockpiles<br />

<br />
Long term concerns about the security of Russia’s fissile materials have now been compounded by the fear that some terrorist groups would use nuclear weapons if they could acquire them. … Resolving remaining technical and legal issues may still require considerable effort, but the two presidents could signal their political decision to move ahead by coupling their agreement on reductions of deployed nuclear warheads with a joint statement on warhead elimination. This would make the May summit both a guaranteed success and an encouraging first step toward securing and reducing the most dangerous legacy of the Cold War.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
specifically, absent transparent warhead elimination, russia won’t bugde on inspections, warhead and fissile material security, or tactial nuclear weapons<br />

Kristensen, Dec 2001, Director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, co-author of the Nuclear Notebook column in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (widely regarded as the most accurate source of information on nuclear weapons and weapons facilities available to the public) and the World Nuclear Forces overview in the SIPRI Yearbook, “The Unruly Hedge: Cold War Thinking at the Crawford Summit,” Arms Control Today, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrol.org/print/961" rel="nofollow">http://www.armscontrol.org/print/961</a><br />
<br />
This article presents new information about the hedge that has recently been declassified and released under the Freedom of Information Act. Newly available documents demonstrate that the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), which is responsible for U.S. nuclear forces, repeatedly warned during the 1990s that increased transparency of the nuclear arms reduction process was more important after START II than new cuts, suggesting that Bush’s inclusion of only operationally deployed strategic warheads in the new round of cuts is unwise because it will contribute to the hedge and therefore the opacity of U.S. forces. … If Bush wants to transform our strategic relations with Russia, he must make the entire stockpile accountable.<br />

<br />
ASSISTANCE FOR TRANSPARENT DISMANTLEMENT OF THOUSANDS OF WARHEADS. Increased transparency in the management of nuclear warhead and fissile material stockpiles (while maintaining protection for legitimate nuclear secrets) will be fundamental to achieving deep reductions in nuclear arms, as well as cooperation to secure nuclear stockpiles—and hence to reducing the nuclear threat to the United States. … Preliminary U.S.-Russian lab-to-lab work in designing such measures is already under way. The total cost of such an effort, including the financial assistance for warhead dismantlement, might be in the range of half a billion dollars over several years.<br />

Bush administration officials say that because the United States and Russia are no longer enemies, the size of the Russian nuclear arsenal no longer matters. But that sentiment ignores the main risk from Russia: not from a deliberate nuclear attack but the possible leakage of nuclear weapons or material to would-be nuclear states or terrorist groups. … The improving nature of the U.S.-Russian relationship should expand to include effective, transparent, and reciprocal steps to ensure the safety and security of nuclear weapons as they wind their way toward eventual and permanent elimination.<br />

<br />
The combination of horror and outrage that will surge upon the nation will demand that the president retaliate for the incomprehensible damage done by the attack. … That we might believe we can solve the problem diplomatically is exactly the conclusion the mullahs are praying we will come to.<br />

Scenario b: European theater missile defense<br />

<br />
<br />
obama is planning to trade away the proposed european missile defense system in the hope of accelerating arms reduction talks<br />
<br />
The Washington Times, 8-28-2009, “Obama jilts Poland and the Czech Republic; America reneges on missile defense for New Europe,” l/n<br />
<br />
The United States is poised to dump a critical missile-defense agreement with two of its most dependable NATO allies. … We are afraid to contemplate how long it will be before the Obama administration's national-security blunders have serious and irreversible consequences.<br />

russian concerns over the missile shield are intrinsically tied to perceptions of u.s. upload capability – a concession on one of the two issues is inevitable<br />

Ambassador M K Bhadrakumar, 7-4-2009, a career diplomat in the Indian Foreign Service, assignments included the Soviet Union, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Germany, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kuwait and Turkey, “A moment of truth for Obama in Moscow,” Asia Times Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/KG04Ag01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/KG04Ag01.html</a><br />
<br />
Washington has a pressing need to engage Russia specifically and selectively on certain issues. … Possibly, even a framework for a new accord may be announced, as it is customary for US-Russia summits to produce some results. But a final deal could still be hampered.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
alternative u.s. concessions are key to russian aquiescence to the missile shield<br />

<br />
Missile defense also drew significant attention during the talks. Russia has strenuously opposed the deployment of a U.S. missile defense system in Eastern Europe for some time and has tried to force Washington to abandon it as part of the arms control talks. … Better still, if they get this right, coming to an agreement on nuclear reductions and missile defense will be much easier.<br />

European missile defense uniquely prevents allies in the middle east from initiating nuclear weapons programs<br />

Eckart von Klaeden, 5-10-2007, German MP and foreign-affairs spokesman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, “Missile Defense Means Common Security for Russia Too,” Atlantic Community, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atlantic-community.org/index/articles/view/Missile_Defense_Means_Common_Security_for_Russia_Too" rel="nofollow">http://www.atlantic-community.org/index/articles/view/Missile_Defense_Means_Common_Security_for_Russia_Too</a><br />
<br />
Moscow should not cling to the old zero-sum game from the Cold War era. … The US missile-defense program will serve the same purpose. It does not foment a nuclear arms race, but rather seeks to prevent it.<br />
<br />

these rapid crash programs will overwhelm any stabilizing effects<br />

Peter Madson, Mar 2006, master’s thesis for the naval postgraduate school, “the sky is not falling: regional reaction to a nuclear-armed iran,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A445779&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=Getrdoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A445779&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=Getrdoc.pdf</a><br />
<br />
If the Gulf States were to embark on independent nuclear programs three dangerous side effects could emerge. … As Nuclear Optimists have stressed, stability from nuclear proliferation comes from the slow addition of nuclear states, not haphazard races for production.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this scenario for proliferation is uniquely destabilizing and risks multiple scenarios for nuclear war<br />

Richard L. Russell, 11-1-2006, Research associate in Georgetown University’s institute for the study of diplomacy and professor in Georgetown’s security studies program, Military Review, “Military Planning for a Middle East Stockpiled with Nuclear Weapons,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-155824168.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-155824168.html</a><br />
<br />
How would the Middle East be affected by numerous states armed with nuclear weapons? The good news is that some international security experts argue that the spread of such weapons would actually stabilize the region. … In short, in the Middle East of the future, numerous nuclear weapons stores will sit atop potentially explosive political powder kegs like the one that exists in Pakistan today.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this ensures escalation to global nuclear war<br />

John Steinbach, March 2002, DC Iraq Coalition, Centre for Research on Globalisation, “Israeli Weapons of Mass Destruction: a Threat to Peace,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/03/00_steinbach_israeli-wmd.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/03/00_steinbach_israeli-wmd.htm</a><br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal of mass destruction in such an unstable region in turn has serious implications for future arms control and disarmament negotiations, and even the threat of nuclear war. … In the words of Mark Gaffney, &quot;... if the familar pattern(Israel refining its weapons of mass destruction with U.S. complicity) is not reversed soon - for whatever reason - the deepening Middle East conflict could trigger a world conflagration.&quot;
