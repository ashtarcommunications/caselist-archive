The cornerstone of Western ethics is reducible to the aesthetic experience of the Kantian sublime – an experience of a natural or technological phenomenon occurring with such spectacular enormity so as to overwhelm human sensibility and provoke a ‘feeling’ of ‘transcendental totality.’ Nuclear weapons form the perfect sublime object from which we derive pleasure, devaluing the real world in their false-confirmation of a ‘God’ of some  ‘Sovereign Good.’<br />
<br />
Professor Scott Stroud of the Philosophy Department at Temple University, and Assistant Professor in Communications Studies at UT Austin, explains in 2003,<br />
[Stroud, Scott “Living Large: Kant and the Sublimity of Technology.” Teaching Ethics, Fall 2003. Pg. 53-59.]<br />
<br />
<br />
If the Bomb is a material replacement for God, our possession of it gives us a God complex. This complex stems from a desire to baptize Earth by fire—or an attempt to re-fashion the world into one without death or suffering.<br />
<br />
[Chernus, Ira. Dr. Strangegod. South Carolina: University of South Carolina Press, 1986. Pg. 133-5, 143-5.]<br />
<br />
<br />
This complex is symptomatic of a nihilistic death drive. The repression of Death paradoxically aligns us with it, making life here—in the real—undesirable.<br />
<br />
Professor Tim Themi, senior researcher of Philosophy at Deakin University explains in 2008,<br />
[Themi, Tim. “How Lacan's Ethics might improve our understanding of Nietzsche's critique of Platonism.” Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy, Vol. 4.1, Spring 2008: pp. 328-346.]<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, Mycal and I advocate that:<br />
The United States Federal Government should eliminate its nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
We cannot begin to confront the psychological-symbolic level of nuclear weapons as long as they exist. Our plan is the first step in an ethic of “imagining the real.” Imagining the real means accepting the world, suffering and all. The ultimate failure of successive conceptions of God cannot be resolved by identifying with a new conception of God. Our focus must be on the dislocation of these symbolizations itself.<br />
