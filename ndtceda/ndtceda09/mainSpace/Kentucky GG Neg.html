Grab Bag CP<br />
The USFG should abandon nuclear launch-on-warning <br />
-intstall launch warning sensors and command-destruct sequences on the US nuclear arsenal and offer to provide the same for Russia<br />
-expand military to military exchanges with Russia at operational facilities to include notification of satellite launches and divulging of information concerning procedures for contro, doctrine and technologies of command and control architecture<br />
<br />
Solves accidental launch<br />
Slocombe 9 (Walter “De-Alerting: Diagnoses, Prescriptions, and Side Effects”)<br />

A2: Perm do CP—policy makers must choose between unilateral or bilateral nuclear reductions<br />
Woolf 1 (Amy “Arms Control and Strategic Nuclear Weapons: Unilateral vs. Bilateral Reductions”)<br />
<br />
Leveraging the plan is key—only way Russia will agree<br />
Barlow 82 (Jeffery “The Hard Fact the Nuclear Freeze Ignores”)<br />
An analysis of past Soviet… agreements with the Soviets. <br />
<br />
A2: Lie Perm- leaks would occur—collapses leverage<br />
Newsom 92 (David “The Allies and Arms Control”)<br />
Because of the public nature… presented with a fait accompli. <br />
<br />
Leaks are guaranteed<br />
Wilson 8 (James, American Government: Brief Version, Ninth Edition, p. 116-7)<br />
American government is the leakiest in… print government secrets <br />
<br />
Russia will say yes<br />
