A. The affirmative falls short of the true problem by focusing on the weapons as the problem, rather than the agent of political violence<br />
J. Marshall Beier 6, Assistant Professor of Political Science, McMaster University, McMaster University, Disarming Politics: Arms, Agency, and the (Post)Politics of Disarmament Advocacy, Canadian Political Science Association, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2007/Beier.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2007/Beier.pdf</a><br />
<br />
No matter their undeniably…with many of the same implications.<br />
<br />
B. The affirmative categorizes the weapon as the agent of violence and holder of ethical responsibility – this confuses the reality of the human and political agent behind the launching of the nuclear weapons. <br />
J. Marshall Beier 6, Assistant Professor of Political Science, McMaster University, McMaster University, Disarming Politics: Arms, Agency, and the (Post)Politics of Disarmament Advocacy, Canadian Political Science Association, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2007/Beier.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2007/Beier.pdf</a><br />

Novel though it may be, … attach to the victims.15 <br />
C. The Alternative: Vote neg to withdraw your consent from the perpetuation of the nuclear state---even if this doesn’t translate into concrete policy reform, withdrawing your consent can help reclaim our ethical and political agency in the face of the nuclear regime's colonization of our lifeworld<br />
Dennis Rivers 2, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, 3/30/02 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.coopcomm.org/nonukes/declaration.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.coopcomm.org/nonukes/declaration.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
So, what is an ordinary citizen to do? …our world might be saved. <br />
<br />
<br />
D. Focusing on weapons misses the deeper meaning in the capitalist system – politicians get away with ‘more sound than action’ <br />
Brian Martin, 1986 (“Nuclear Disarmament is not Enough,” Peace Studies, pp. 36-39, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/86ps.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/pubs/86ps.html</a>) <br />
<br />
Quite a number of historical … corporations is greater than ever today.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Fear of Nuclear Weapons is good:  becoming blasé about nuclear war risks extinction<br />
Futterman 94 (J. A. H., Physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, “Meditations on the Bomb,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dogchurch.org/scriptorium/nuke.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogchurch.org/scriptorium/nuke.html</a>, AD: 7/11/09) <br />
But the inhibitory … movement with a needed sense of urgency that it might otherwise lack.<br />
2)Turn: Accidents--<br />
 a) Fear decreases risk of accidents<br />
Waltz 03 (Kenneth, Professor of Political Science, Columbia, The Spread Of Nuclear Weapons, , p. 144)<br />
Fear of accidents … is too dangerous to bear. <br />
b) Human error makes accidents the most likely scenario for conflict – 5 reasons <br />
Slocombe 2k9  [Walter B.  a senior advisor for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad “De-Alerting: Diagnoses, Prescriptions, and Side-Effects*.” EastWest Institute. June 2009. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewi.info/system/files/Slocombe.pdf</a>&gt;.] <br />
Technical failure: Pure accident – something going terribly wrong at technical/operational level that results in… reaction in a crisis.<br />
<br />
3)Turn: Peace Activism – fear of nuclear weapons is key to stopping their use and allowing peace activism to create a more peaceful society <br />
JAH Futterman 1995, Lawrence Livermore lab researcher, MEDITIATION OF THE BOMB, 1995, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.dogchurch.org/scriptorium/nuke.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogchurch.org/scriptorium/nuke.html</a><br />
I could say that if I …. that it might otherwise lack.<br />
 4) We need the fear of nuclear weapons to break down Nuclearism and de-nuclearize <br />
Jay Lifton, Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry, Jon Jay College, WORLD POLICY JOURNAL Spring 2001, p. 25<br />
We need to replace psychic numbing with awareness, and to expose and counter the new versions of nuclearism as well as the older ones. We need to probe ever more deeply the trickle-down effects of existing weapons, including especially their psychological effects. And we need to take steps, as citizen activists and concerned intellectuals, to denuclearize the world. We need to start here at home and renounce our weapons-centered status, thereby freeing ourselves to pursue saner, life-enhancing projects.<br />
5) Imagery of nuclear weaponry has created a fear of nuclear weapons that has prevented their use <br />
R. Rajaraman, Professor of Theoretical Physics, THE HINDU, April 20, 2002, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hinduonnet.com/2002/04/22/stories/2002042200431000.htm</a><br />
There were a variety of …face of serious military crises.<br />
6)FEAR OF DEATH IS KEY TO VALUE IN LIFE<br />
Bertrand Russel, A FREE MAN’S WORSHIP, 1903, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/fmw.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.drew.edu/~jlenz/fmw.html</a><br />
In the spectacle of Death…is to conquer them.<br />
7) fear of nuclear weapons motivates people to use constructive means to prevent catastrophes  <br />
Jay Lifton, Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry, Jon Jay College, WORLD POLICY JOURNAL Spring 2001, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/sum01-1.html#3" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/sum01-1.html#3</a><br />
The trouble is … they don’t exist.
