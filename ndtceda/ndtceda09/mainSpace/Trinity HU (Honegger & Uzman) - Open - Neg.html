 <br />
<strong>T - Delivery Vehicles</strong><br />
a. The nuclear arsenal refers exclusively to the weapons<br />
Babylon, Timeless (Translation/Dictionary service)<br />
Definition of Nuclear arsenal<br />
collection of nuclear weapons, amassment of nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
b. Violation – delivery systems are only nuclear weapons if they are equipped with a warhead, missiles that simply could have nuclear warheads aren’t weapons<br />
Singh and Chinkin, 2004 (Rabinder, former joint secretary of the Research and Analysis Wing, suspected of being a CIA mole, and Christine, Professor of International Law at the London School of Economics, “Mutual Defence agreement and the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty,” July 20, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd78/78news02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd78/78news02.htm</a>)<br />
The drafters 'intended to exclude nuclear delivery ... Main Committee 1 (Bundle, Tab 1, p. 25) is consistent with that view.<br />
<br />
c. Standards –<br />
1. Limits – including delivery systems doubles the topic to two completely distinct areas, we have to research every aff in the context of the warheads and every aff in the context of the missiles. They can also claim advantages based on the potential to arm missiles with various warheads<br />
<br />
2. Ground – neg ground is premised on the combination of the warheads and the missiles, they no link out of any disad premised on the plan decreasing the capability of the US to deliver warheads.<br />
<br />
d. Topicality is a voter because it tells the negative what they should and should not be prepared to debate.<br />
<br />
<strong>T - DeAlert</strong><br />
A. Interpretation – reduce and restrict means to both diminish and confine<br />
1. Reduce means to diminish<br />
Merriam-Webster, 2009<br />
reduce. (2009). In Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary. www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reduce<br />
Reduce - (1) : to diminish in size, amount, extent, or number &lt;reduce taxes&gt; &lt;reduce the likelihood of war&gt;<br />
<br />
2. Restrict means to confine<br />
Random House 2009<br />

Restrict<br />
–verb (used with object)<br />
to confine or keep within limits, as of space, action, choice, intensity, or quantity.<br />
<br />
3. And means both<br />

And<br />
1. (used to connect grammatically coordinate words, phrases, or clauses) along or together with; as well as; in addition to; besides; also; moreover: pens and pencils.<br />
<br />
B. Violation – de-alert explicitly allows for re-alert, means it doesn’t reduce or restrict because the weapons are still considered vital to a nuclear war plan<br />
Karas, 2001(Advanced Concepts Group, Sandia National Laboratories, Thomas, “De-alerting and De-activating Strategic Nuclear Weapons”, Sandia Reports, April, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2001/010835.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2001/010835.pdf</a>)<br />
Deactivation (and, for that matter, elimination) ... to be deactivated are deemed dispensable and scheduled for elimination.<br />
<br />
C. Standards –<br />
1. Limits – they allow reduction of anything that complements the role of nuclear weapons. Explodes the topic to any part of the nuclear infrastructure and even the conventional military because they both help the arsenal fulfill its role<br />
<br />
2. Ground – de-alert is meaningless and can be reversed, means we get no ground<br />
Nuclear Darkness, No Date (“De-Alerting Nuclear Weapons,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nucleardarkness.org/highalert/dealertingnuclearweapons/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nucleardarkness.org/highalert/dealertingnuclearweapons/</a>)<br />

N.D.Ill. 2002. Under ADA, “substantially” in phrase substantially limits, means considerable, or to a large degree.<br />
<br />
B. Violation – Declaratory policies aren’t binding<br />
Tertrais 9<br />
[Bruno Tertrais. “The Trouble with No First Use” Survival. October-November 2009. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zero-nukes.org/Disarmament_Scenarios_Abolition_NoFirstUse_Sagan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zero-nukes.org/Disarmament_Scenarios_Abolition_NoFirstUse_Sagan.html</a>]<br />
Bruno Tertrais from ... nuclear weapons in a crisis.<br />
<br />
Such declarations are meaningless – US empirically flip flops<br />
Bunn and Du Preez 7 – George Bunn, first general counsel for the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, helped negotiate the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and later became U.S. ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament, Jean du Preez, director of the International Organizations and Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in the Monterey Institute of International Studies, July-August 2007, “More Than Words: The Value of U.S. Non-Nuclear-Use Promises,” Arms Control Today, online:<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007_07-08/NonUse" rel="nofollow">http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007_07-08/NonUse</a><br />
Although not as unqualified as some Latin Americans had desired, ... that did not have them.<br />
<br />
Here is more evidence that draws a distinction between adopting an NFU and declaring one.<br />
Miller 2<br />

The idea of no-first-use ... incompatible with NFU.<br />
<br />
C. Standards –<br />
<br />
1. Ground – Can’t Garner any stable links – they can always spike out of our disads by saying the US isn’t really adopting a no-first use policy.<br />
<br />
2. Limits – Explodes the topic – means the negative has to be prepared to debate declaratory affs that don’t actually change the posture of the nuclear arsenal.<br />
<br />
D. T is a voting issue for reasons of fairness and education, evaluated under competing interpretations.<br />

<strong>Japan</strong><br />
A. Current US nuclear umbrella assuages Japanese security concerns – weakening of the umbrella would trigger Japanese rearmament.<br />

[Elizabeth Bakanic. While a master's student at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Bakanic worked on a policy report that recommended ways in which to prevent proliferation chain reactions in Japan, South Korea, and Egypt.

<strong>SCI FI KRITIK</strong><br />
The 1AC was nice, but we wish to present a different image, one consistent with Harlan Ellison’s I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. Instead of picturing some vague nuclear war, picture all of details – humanity has created a great computer system, named AM, to control our weapons, but this system gains control and kills all but five survivors. And instead of imagining your way out of an eternity of sadistic torture, you should adopt a pessimistic view – the truly compassionate thing to do is kill the other four survivors. This pessimistic view of nuclear weapons is the logical extrapolation of our current culture which is centered around the superweapon<br />
Franklin, 2008 (H. Bruce, John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University, War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination, P. 211-212<br />
The most terrifying image of the war-making computer is offered in ... This image embodies what we may become if we do not regain human control of our own creative powers.<br />

A fundamental difference between our fiction and that of the aff is pessimism. The aff tells an optimistic story of how we can all come together and solve a potential impact, our story ends in a much more realistic manner – we are all going to die and there is nothing we can do about it. This story serves to make listeners self reflexive and self critical. Only by imagining our most evil, not most heroic, potential can we accept responsibility for bringing the world to the precipice of extinction<br />

So, while the pessimistic conception ... will necessarily mark out a unique path of suffering. Perhaps, instead of &quot;sweet violence,&quot; we should speak of a terror that liberates<br />

The affirmative’s ultimate failure is one of understanding culture. Nuclear weapons did not produce culture, rather they were the product of a particular culture which created the musket, the submarine and the machine gun. There is nothing special about nuclear weapons, they are just our most recent fixation. Only pessimistic fiction can rupture that culture and prevent extinction.<br />
Franklin, 2008 (H. Bruce, John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University, War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination, P. 167-169)<br />
Instead, the superweapon now attained the potential for ... enough people to prevent nuclear war—so far.<br />

<strong>Security</strong><br />
US de-nuclearization policy is used to justify coercive and aggressive actions designed to preserve US dominance. The affirmative empowers that dominance and is the only means of justifying nuclear war<br />

Rejecting specific policies which embody the security paradigm is key. The act of voting not-aff is necessary to find a world post-security<br />
