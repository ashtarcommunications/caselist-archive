<strong><u>Contention One:</u> God Mode</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>The</strong> <strong>United States</strong> <strong>has come to see its nuclear arsenal as a new God, able to protect us as long as we believe in It. This belief has produced a dichotomy that constructs the</strong> <strong>US</strong> <strong>as absolute good and our “enemies” as absolute evil. This mindset allows us to strive for omnipotence at any cost, which necessarily dehumanizes our Enemy and allows us to use any means necessary to destroy it.</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Chernus, ’86</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Ira, Professor of Religious Studies at the </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">University</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> of </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Colorado</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> at </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Boulder</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, <u>Dr. Strangegod: On the Symbolic Meaning of Nuclear Weapons</u>, p. 32-35)</span> <br />
<br />
By starting with the observation … we ever be truly free?<br />
<br />
<strong>Omnipotence would be great if it was possible, but it’s not. In fact, our attempt to maintain nuclear superiority leads to increased militarization which makes proliferation and war inevitable.</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Lifton, ’03</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">(Robert, professor of psychiatry at Harvard known for his studies of the psychological causes and effects of war and political violence, <u>Superpower Syndrome</u>, p. 183-4) </span><br />
<br />
Nuclear weapons represent a psychological ground zero … the militarization of society. <br />
<br />
<strong>The terminal impact is extinction – the militarization of society destroys the planet</strong> <br />

<br />
<strong><u>Contention Two: Discardable Populations</u></strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>The deification of the Bomb has turned us into automatons - humans are mere cogs in the machine. The way in which we orient ourselves toward the Bomb influences how we treat others, meaning any population can be sacrificed.</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Chernus, ’86</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Ira, Professor of Religious Studies at the </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">University</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> of </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Colorado</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> at </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Boulder</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, <u>Dr. Strangegod: On the Symbolic Meaning of Nuclear Weapons</u>, p. 137-139)</span> <br />
<br />
The way in which we prepare … to do whatever it wants. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Furthermore, this machine mentality is the bedrock of the capitalist value-system</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Chernus, ’86</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Ira, Professor of Religious Studies at the </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">University</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> of </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Colorado</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> at </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Boulder</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, <u>Dr. Strangegod: On the Symbolic Meaning of Nuclear Weapons</u>, p. 137-139)</span> <br />
<br />
In fact, the ultimate goal … to live as a machine. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>This mindset leads to extinction – the logic that allows us to sacrifice certain parts of the population on the altar of the market justifies the destruction of ALL parts of the population.</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Santos, ’03</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Boaventura de Sousa, Professor of Sociology at the School of Economics, University of Coimbra, Bad Subjects, Issue #63, April, bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">According to Franz Hinkelammert, … poorest countries for four years.</span> <br />
<br />
<br />
Plan:  <br />
The United States Federal Government should completely eliminate and ban the use of its nuclear weapons arsenal. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Contention Three: A Way Out</u></strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>The plan is key to ending the chilling effects of nuclear weapons on the population</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Chernus, ’86</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Ira, Professor of Religious Studies at the </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">University</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> of </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Colorado</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> at </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Boulder</span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">, <u>Dr. Strangegod: On the Symbolic Meaning of Nuclear Weapons</u>, p. 149-151)</span> <br />
<br />
It is hard to be optimistic ... we so long avoided. <br />
<br />
<strong>Incrementalism is not an option – Cold War activism proves piecemeal reform is just used to placate the antinuclear movement.</strong> <br />
<strong><u>Chernus, ’91</u></strong> (Ira, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, <u>Nuclear Madness: Religion and the Psychology of the Nuclear Age</u>, p. 173-175)<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 9pt;">The enthusiastic response to the CPD campaign … </span><u>relevance to the present situation.</u> <br />
<br />
<strong>Only the plan solves – the mere existence of nuclear weapons sustains the genocidal mentality.</strong>  <br />
<strong><u>Lifton and Markusen, ’90</u></strong> <span style="font-size: 9pt;">(Robert Jay Lifton, Professor of Psychiatry and Eric Markusen, Professor of Sociology, PHD, University of Minnesota, <u>The Genocidal Mentality,</u> 1990, pg 35-36) </span><br />
<br />
<u>A manifestation of the genocidal mentality …</u><span style="font-size: 9pt;"> threats undoubtedly also made secretly.</span>
