Observation 1: The window of opportunity <br />
<br />
In the forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review, the Obama administration has a chance to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy by repudiating Cold War thinking and adopting a no-first use doctrine.<br />
<br />
Sagan 9 [Scott D., Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and Co-Director of Stanford’s Center forInternational Security and Cooperation. Survival  vol. 51 no. 3  June–July pp. 163–182] <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hence the plan: The United States Federal Government should adopt a declaratory posture committing to no first use of nuclear weapons. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage One: US nuclear escalation<br />
<br />
Scenario One- Commitment trap <br />
<br />
Multiple scenarios cause deterrence failure for chemical or biological weapons<br />
<br />
Sagan 2K [Scott D., Director of CISAC and Professor of Political Science at Stanford University; &quot;The Commitment Trap: Why the United States Should Not Use Nuclear Threats to Deter Biological and Chemical Weapons Attacks.&quot; International Security, September, Vol. 24, No. 4 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2539316" rel="nofollow">http://www.jstor.org/stable/2539316</a>] <br />
The status quo policy of “calculated ambiguity” toward CBWs creates a commitment trap, causing the US to escalate to nuclear first use in the event of deterrence failure in order maintain the credibility of its threat.<br />
<br />

<br />
International Security and Cooperation. Survival  vol. 51 no. 3  June–July pp. 163–182) <br />
<br />
Scenario 2: Mission Creep <br />
Using nuclear weapons as a deterrent to non-nuclear “WMDs” causes mission creep which justifies nuclear first use in an increasing number of contingencies.<br />
<br />
Butfoy 8(Andy, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, 01 October, Survival,  vol. 50 no. 5) <br />
<br />
Scenario 3: Mini-Nukes <br />
Retaining first use options against CBWs causes reliance on low-yield nuclear weapons which make nuclear weapons appear more usable.<br />
<br />
Tannenwald 5 [Nina, Director of the International Relations Program and Joukowsky Family Research Assistant Professor at the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, “Stigmatizing the Bomb Origins of the Nuclear Taboo”, International Security, Vol. 29, No. 4, Spring, pp. 5–49, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ts.isil.westga.edu/login?url=http" rel="nofollow">http://ts.isil.westga.edu/login?url=http</a>://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=17434672&amp;site=ehost-live] <br />
<br />
<br />
A credible firebreak between nuclear and conventional weapons is the only barrier to global nuclear annihilation.<br />
<br />
Schwartz &amp; Derber 91 (Schwartz, William A., and Charles Derber, et al The Nuclear Seduction: Why the Arms Race Doesn't Matter--And What Does. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1990. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft1n39n7wg/" rel="nofollow">http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft1n39n7wg/</a>) <br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, actual first use by the US would be catastrophic- it would shatter the NPT, destroy the taboo against nuclear use for terrorists and states alike, and encourage further nuclear use by Russia, China, India, and Pakistan.<br />
<br />
Feiveson and Hogendoorn 3 (Harold A., senior research scientist and co-director of the Program on Science and Global Security at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, and Ernst Jan, Ph.D. student at the Woodrow Wilson School, “No First Use of Nuclear Weapons”, The Nonproliferation Review, Summer) <br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Proliferation- we’ll isolate ___ internal links <br />
<br />
First, Hypocrisy: <br />
US use of nuclear weapons for diplomatic objectives undermines the credibility of our NPT disarmament commitments<br />
<br />
Butfoy 8(Andy, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, 01 October, Survival,  vol. 50 no. 5)<br />
<br />
Second, Prestige: <br />
First use policies inflate the value of nuclear weapons by affirming that they are a military necessity- adopting an NFU posture is key to reinforcing international norms against nuclear acquisition and use.<br />
<br />

<br />
Third, Negative Security Assurances: <br />
<br />
First use options undermine negative security assurances which are key to the viability of the entire nonproliferation regime. <br />

<br />
<br />
Fourth, Iran <br />
US no-first-use declaration will increase international diplomatic support for tougher measures against new proliferators like Iran.  Further, US nuclear threats empower forces which favor nuclear weapons development in Iran.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Advantage 3: India <br />
India directly models US first use “hedges” in their own nuclear doctrine.  This increases the likelihood of nuclear escalation in future conflicts with Pakistan, and causes regional proliferation.<br />

India-Pakistan war means extinction <br />
Ghulam Nabi Fai,  Executive Director, Kashmiri American Council, <br />
WASHINGTON TIMES, September 8, 2001, p. 1 <br />
<br />
Proliferation causes extinction – nuclear arms races and miscalculated nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Utgoff 2  (Deputy Director of the Strategy Forces, and Resources Division of the Institute for Defense Analyses, Victor, “Proliferation, Missile Defence, and American Ambitions,” Survival, Volume 44, Number 2, Summer) <br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 4: China <br />
A.  US first use plans undermine the foundation of non-proliferation, causing destructive arms races with Russia and China, and pushing other countries to adopt similar postures.  This risks Chinese revocation of their No First Use pledge.<br />
<br />
Krieger and Ong ‘2 (David and Carah, president and Director of Publications and Research at the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, “No First Use”, April, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/04/00_krieger_no-first-use.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/04/00_krieger_no-first-use.htm</a>) <br />
<br />
<br />
Rollback of China’s No-First-Use policy will result in increased tension, a nuclear arms race, and increases risks of both intentional and accidental or unauthorized global nuclear exchange.<br />
<br />
Zhenqiang 5  (Pan, Professor of International Relations at the Institute for Strategic Studies, retired Major General of the People’s Liberation Army, Autumn, “China Insistence on No-First-Use of Nuclear Weapons,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://se1.isn.ch/serviceengine/FileContent?serviceID=ISN&amp;fileid=A755A706-0DEF-9BDE-0865-85AAED920C65&amp;lng=en" rel="nofollow">http://se1.isn.ch/serviceengine/FileContent?serviceID=ISN&amp;fileid=A755A706-0DEF-9BDE-0865-85AAED920C65&amp;lng=en</a>, Acc. Jul 28, 2009) <br />
<br />
<br />
Even if China doesn’t explicitly roll back their no-first-use policy – United States first use postures increase risk of US-China nuclear conflict.<br />
<br />
Zhang 8 (Hui, March, Research Associate at Harvard University, “Chinese Perspectives On Space Weapons,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsichina.org/attach/CS2_3.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsichina.org/attach/CS2_3.pdf</a>, AD: 7-29-09) <br />
<br />
The impact is extinction<br />
<br />
Straits Times 2k [“Regional Fallout: No one gains in war over Taiwan,” lexis] <br />
<br />
<br />
A US declaration of no first use would ease tensions, and prevent a US-Sino arms race.<br />
<br />
Berry 9 [Ken, ICNND Research Coordinator “DRAFT TREATY ON NON-FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS” International Commission on Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament, June 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Berry_No_First_Use_Treaty.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Berry_No_First_Use_Treaty.pdf</a>, AD: 7-31-09) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2: <br />
Declaratory policy matters- Even if the plan is only symbolic, adopting a NFU policy has “trickle down” effects on war planners, signaling that nuclear use is not appropriate in any contingency.  Plan also changes the context for debates among both policymakers and the public regarding the usability of nuclear weapons, and reinforces international norms against the spread and use of nuclear weapons.<br />

Your arguments about extended deterrence are rhetorical tactics to keep weapons that have no basis in the real world<br />
<br />
Butfoy 8 (Andy, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, 01 October, Survival,  vol. 50 no. 5) <br />
<br />
Adopting an NFU policy reinforces the credibility of our extended deterrent by emphasizing conventional responses to conventional acts, eliminating fears that the US will renege on its commitments.<br />
<br />
Sagan 9 (Scott D., Professor of Political Science at Stanford University and Co-Director of Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. Survival  vol. 51 no. 3  June–July pp. 163–182) <br />
<br />
Now is the key time- a NFU declaration ends US inconsistency regarding negative security assurances, which is key to a successful 2010 NPT Review Conference.<br />
<br />

<br />
International Security and Cooperation. Survival  vol. 51 no. 3  June–July pp. 163–182) <br />
<br />
<br />
Negative arguments based on defenses of “ambiguity” or uncertainty, CBW deterrence, and lack of verification collapse under scrutiny.  The benefits of NFU far outweigh any of their case turns.<br />
