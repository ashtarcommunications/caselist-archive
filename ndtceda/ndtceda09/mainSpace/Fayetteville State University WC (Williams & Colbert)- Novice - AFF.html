<strong><em>1ac cites:<br />
<br />
Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
The United States senate will not ratify the CTBT. Specifically, senators who have long opposed CTBT will stop its passage.<br />
UCS 09. (Union of COncerned Scientists 4/7/9 &quot;New U.S. approach toward reducing the threat of nuclear weapons.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/nuclear_weapons/policy_issues/new-nuclear-approach.html?print=t" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/nuclear_weapons_and_global_security/nuclear_weapons/policy_issues/new-nuclear-approach.html?print=t</a>)<br />
<br />
&quot;International agreements require approval...most notably Senate ratification of the CTBT.&quot;<br />
<br />
Advantage 1: Horizontal Proliferation<br />
<br />
The NPT is collapsing-the CTBT is key to revitalizing the NPT.<br />
Goodby 09. (Ambassador James Goodby-Hoover Institution, in the Carnegie International Nonproliferation Conference report. &quot;The Future of the CTBT.&quot; April 7, 9. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/npc_ctbt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/npc_ctbt.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
&quot;The nonproliferation regime has deteriorated in the last 10 years...and a comprehensive Test Ban Treaty must be part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
NPT collapse will double the number of nuclear states.<br />
Hartung 02. (William D. Hartung-senior research fellow and director of the Arms Trade Resource Center at the World Policy Institute- World Policy Journal Article: Volume XIX, No. 4, Winder 02/03. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/articles/wpj02-4/hartung.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/articles/wpj02-4/hartung.html</a>)<br />
<br />
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970...nuclear weapons states in the world could quickly double.<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Vertical Proliferation<br />
<br />
Without US ratification, the moratorium on nuclear testing will collapse-China and other nuclear powers will resume testing.<br />
Joseph 09. (Jofi Joseph-senior foreign policy staffer in the United States Senate-The Washington Quarterly, April 09. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/09april/docs/09apr_Joseph.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.twq.com/09april/docs/09apr_Joseph.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
The international community will not wait indefinitely....The time to move is now.<br />
<br />
Nuclear testing and weapons buildup by India and Pakistan increases the risk of nuclear war.<br />
Nelson 09. (Robert Nelson-senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists-Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists-March/April 2009. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/n47850402k684613/fulltext.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://thebulletin.metapress.com/content/n47850402k684613/fulltext.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
China is thought to possess...develop multiple warhead missiles.<br />
<br />
Vertical proliferation magnifies the risk of an escalatory nuclear war.<br />
McGrath 09. (Keegan, July 8, Research Associate Monterey Institute for International Studies, James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, &quot;Battle Lines Being Drawn in the CTBT Debate: an Analysis of the Strategic Posture Commission's Arguments against U.S. ratification.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_us_ratification.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_us_ratification.html</a>.<br />
<br />
The authors' assertion that there is no...risk that this breakdown could occur.<br />
<br />
Proliferation makes extinction inevitable-terrorism, miscalculation, and retaliation.<br />
Utgoff, 02. (Deputy Director of Strategy, Forces, and Resources Division of Institute for Defense Analysis. Victor A., &quot;Proliferation, Missile Defense and American Ambitions.&quot; Survival, Summer, p. 87-90).<br />
<br />
Escalation of violence is also basic...even in the face of nuclear threats.<br />
<br />
Plan Text (above-listed)<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
U.S. ratification is key to bolstering support for the success of the 2010 NPT review conference.<br />
Blechman 09. (Barry Blechman-co-founder of the Henry L. Stimson Center and a Stimson Distinguished Fellow currently working on developing solutions for the nuclear threat-March 2, 2009. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=759" rel="nofollow">http://www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=759</a>).<br />
<br />
Entry into force of the Test ban is an important step...pressures on the other hold outs will grow exponentially.<br />
<br />
China will ratify after the U.S. does<br />
Blechman 09 (Barry Blechman-co-founder of the Henry L. Stimson Center and a Stimson Distinguished Fellow currently working on developing solutions for the nuclear threat-March 2, 2009. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=759" rel="nofollow">http://www.stimson.org/pub.cfm?id=759</a>).<br />
<br />
The Test Ban is important to the United States....would have a great deal to gain from new tests.<br />
<br />
Ratification would create norms and fear that would prevent testing.<br />
O'Hanlon 08. (Michael. Brookings Senior Fellow-Resurrecting the Test Ban Treaty, Surviva, Feb/Mar 08. pp. 119-132.)<br />
<br />
Second, a comprehensive test-ban treaty would not...not to repeat the mistake.<br />
<br />
CTBT ratification is key to bolstering US credibility to gain stronger IAEA enforcement to prevent proliferation.<br />
Joseph 09. (Jofi Joseph-senior foreign policy staffer in the United States Senate- The Washington Quarterly, April 2009. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.twq.com/09april/docs/09apr_Joseph.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.twq.com/09april/docs/09apr_Joseph.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
An unmistakeable commitment from Obama...that violate their IAEA obligations.<br />
<br />
All of your disads are non-unique-the U.S. hasn't tested since 1992 and has no plans to test. Ratifying the treaty would actually improve the strength of the U.S. arsenal.<br />
McGrath 09. (Keegan, July 8, Research Associate, Monterey Institute for International Studies, James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, &quot;Battle Lines Being Drawn in the CTBT debate: an Analysis of the Strategic Posture Commission's Arguments against U.S&gt; Ratification.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_us_ratification.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nti.org/e_research/e3_us_ratification.html</a>)<br />
<br />
The United States would follow the letter...nuclear testing in the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether people continue to test weapons, we are SAFER in a world with the CTBT that in STATUS QUO<br />
