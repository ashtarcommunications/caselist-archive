 Consult NRC<br />
Counterplan text: The United States federal government should enter into a binding consultation with the Russian Federation through the NATO-Russia Council over the issue of the United States federal government substantially reducing the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reducing and restricting the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal.. The United States federal government will continuously advocate (insert plan text) throughout the consultation process. The policy decision will be fully conditioned upon the outcome of the binding consultation.<br />
