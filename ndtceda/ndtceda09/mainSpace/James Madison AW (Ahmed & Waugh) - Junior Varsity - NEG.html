<strong>Weak Ontology CP v. KCKCC- Octos at ADA</strong><br />
1NC:<br />
The affirmative employs strong ontological claims as a basis for their affirmation. Assertions about agents, subjects, others, self and the world itself are premised in an orientation which presume certainty and resolution. The difference between weak and strong ontology is how you carry yourself and your most basic commitments. Strong ontology manifests in resolution and confidence while weak ontology acknowledges doubt and skepticism. Post 9/11 speeches by Bush and Graham demonstrate the subtle but important difference.<br />
White 2005<br />
(Stephen K., James Hart Professor of politics at the University of Virginia, “Weak Ontology: Genealogy and Critical Issues,” Hedgehog Review, Summer, p.14-15)<br />
From the point of view of a strict secularist…between good and evil, us and the enemy.<br />
<br />
Weak ontology insists that our conceptions of self, other, and the world are characterized by contingency and indeterminacy. This makes possible ethico-political practices of care. Strong ontological claims, on the other hand, assume with the certainty to know the way the world is. Strong ontological orientations violently eliminate that which their claims cannot capture.<br />
Howe 2006<br />
(Louis E., associate professor in the Department of Political Science and Planning at the University of West Georgia, “Enchantment, Weak Ontologies, and Administrative Ethics,” Administration and Society, September, p. 427-439)<br />
<br />
The alternative is to vote negative for a weak ontological orientation. _ <u>and I are not resolved but contingently affirm with hesitation</u><u>-</u><br />
Mustapha 2009<br />
(Jennifer, department of political science at McMaster University, “An Analytical Survey of Critical Security Studies: Making the Case for a (Modified) Post-Structuralist Approach, Paper presented at the 2009 CPSA, Ottawa,<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2009/Mustapha.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2009/Mustapha.pdf</a>., p. 2-3)<br />
At the outset, it is important to define… cultivated and affirmed in its wake” (White 2000, 8).<br />
<br />
<br />
2NC:<br />
Voting affirmative constitutes the affirmative claims within the Resolved of the resolution. Resolved has been defined as coming to a definite decision, to settle conclusively without uncertainty.<br />
Random House Dictionary<br />
<u>(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resolved" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/resolved</a>)</u><br />
<br />
The affirmative, even if critiquing, repudiating and refusing the resolution, is interpellated as affirming the resolution, being resolved. They are listed on the schedule and pairing as affirmative. They speak first and last. They constitute themselves as affirmative and are interpellated as others as being affirmative with the strong ontological orientation of resolution.<br />
Jenkins 2003<br />
(Joseph, JS from UC Berkeley and a PhD Candidate/Mellon –Sawyer at UCLA Department of Comparative Literature, “Symposium: Nietzsche and Legal Theory (Part II): Heritance Law as Constellation in Lieu of Redress: A Detour Through Exceptional Terrain,” Cardozo Law Review, 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 1043, March, lexis)<br />
Thus a certain form, of vague and imperfect outline… of delineating (exemplifying) an originary movement.<br />
<br />
Vote negative with hesitation and doubt for the affirmative but from a weak ontological comportment toward the world. Our weak ontological orientation offers the possibility for an ethic of generosity, modesty and care necessary for navigating an uncertain world. Vote negative for our not-resolution: Not resolved:<br />
