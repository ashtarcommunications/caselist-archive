And, their acceptance of a politics of amnesia instead of active engagement with history and consquences of the bomb guarantees a deadly pathology that culminates in a new era of nuclear acquisition and nuclear war.<br />

Our alternative is to imagine the real. Only visualizing the impact of nuclear destruction through images and political acts of resistance solves. We must respond to Lifton’s call to “imagine the real” by refusing the spectacle of the 1AC, confronting the forgetting of the impending dangers of nuclear omnicide, and condemn the horrors of nuclear catastrophe.<br />
