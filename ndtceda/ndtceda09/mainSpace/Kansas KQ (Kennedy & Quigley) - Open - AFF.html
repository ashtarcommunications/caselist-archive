 ROUND 3, Aff v Emory GM<br />
C1 – Inherency<br />
<br />
The U.S. maintains a policy of launch on warning that drastically compresses decisionmaking times for nuclear response and attempts to force the presidents hand in an overwhelming response.<br />
Bruce Blair, 10-13-07, Online<br />
Contrary to the U.S. statement by Christina Rocca in which it is asserted that…. Authorized to execute nuclear weapons).”<br />
<br />
U.S. maintains LoW as the default policy<br />
Steven Starr, August 08, Online<br />
Ironically, the US and Russia are also unwilling to publicly state that they will… ‘No First Use’ pledge for their nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
PDD-60 did not eliminate launch on warning<br />
Mark Gaffney, 07, Online<br />
Just five months later, in November 1997, Clinton issued a presidential directive, PDD-60… would be used to study nuclear fusion—another clue.<br />
<br />
Simply having LoW as an option is meant to massively compress decisionmaking times – Ford is wrong about everything<br />
John Hallam, June 09, Online<br />
Ford argues, (and argued at the IPI debate)[ref] and seemingly bases his argument on a December 1999 doctoral thesis by James R. Low… silo doors and removing nuclear warheads fro missiles).<br />
<br />
C2 – Speed<br />
LoW is premised around a fundamental compression of time, a drive for speedy vengeance against those who would harm us. It creates a pressure-packed timeline that works its way down to all levels of nuclear command<br />
Bruce Blair, 2003, Online<br />
The most dangerous legacy of the Cold War is the continuing practice of Russia and the… social stresses and inadequate training.<br />
<br />
LoW eliminates the possibility for making a decision in the moment, making nuclear launch a series of checklists<br />
Bruce Blair and Chen Yali, 06, Online<br />
This shift created enormous pressure on the decision process. Allowing only minutes to detect and assess… would cause an accidental nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Bruce blair and others call these accidents. They are right about the danger they pose but are wrong about the label. These are not accidents, they are choices. Accidents create a false dichotomy between ordinary deterrence and mistaken breakdown, ignoring that breakdowns can only come out of the dangerous situation produced by our deterrent system built on a system of technical speed. This creates the very conditions for violence while ignoring our own roles in producing situations of danger.<br />
Chaloupka, 92, Knowing Nukes, 12-16<br />
Even our best signs of stability are easily inverted into signs of chaos and entropy… uncanny power to become the bases for fateful decisions.”<br />
<br />
This leads to a form of nuclear absolutism that mandates total destruction.<br />
Timothy Donovan, A. Samuel Kimball, and Jillian Smith, 05, “Fog of War: What Yet Remains”, Postmodern Culture, Project Muse<br />
Any ethical principle remains threatened by the velocity and efficacy of competition… the confusion of needless sacrifice in war.<br />
<br />
The compression of time in launch on warning depoliticizes nuclear decisions<br />
Tim Luke and Gearoid Tuathail, 00, Thinking Space, 368-69<br />
More provocative is a second consequence. Virillio extrapolates from global nuclear deterrence as… of modern war are reconstituted’ (1989: 86).<br />
<br />
This mandates war and makes resolving conflicts impossible<br />
Anthony Burke, 07, “Ontologies of War”, Theory and Event, Project Muse<br />
This closed circle of existential and strategic reason generates a number of dangers… are arguably examples of such ontologies in action.<br />
<br />
Our response to launch on warning is an affirmation of pause, of trembling before the technics of nucle3ar war<br />
Charlie Gere, 04, “Breaking the Time Barrier”, culture and organization, 10:1<br />
The increasing speed of technology, both in its operations and in its evolution… trembles on the edge of this event itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Calculated Ambiguity/Secrecy Aff</strong><br />
<strong>Doubles Coast 1<br />
vs Michigan LZ</strong><br />
<br />
Secrecy of current nuclear war plans places genocidal missions out of all public accountability<br />
Stephen Schwartz, 1998. Atomic Audit, p. 464-5.<br />
“Completely removed from both public and congressional … details of operational planning should be closely guarded.”<br />
<br />
Planning secrecy has destroyed the nuclear public sphere – need public planning process with congressional oversight to solve<br />
Matthew G. McKinzie et al, June 2001. “The U.S. Nuclear War Plan: A Time For Change,” Natural Resources Defense Council.<br />
“Abandon much of the secrecy that surrounds the SIOP … involvement and oversight, should plan the use of nuclear weapons.”<br />
<br />
This current policy of calculated ambiguity is premised around secrecy and deception<br />
Stephen Schwartz, February 1998. Miscalculated Ambiguity: US Policy on the Use and Threat of Use of Nuclear Weapons, Issue No 23, www.acronym.org.uk/dd/dd23/23uspol.htm<br />
“Publicly, most officials adhered to longstanding policy … any more than US officials believed them.<br />
<br />
Creates groupthink that destroys policy planning and threatens extinction<br />
Daniel Ellsberg, 8/6/2009. The Nation, Hiroshima Day: America Has Been Asleep at the Wheel for 64 Years, www.thenation.com/doc/20090817/ellsberg<br />
“We have long needed and lacked the equivalent of the Pentagon … a new understanding of the real history of the nuclear age.”<br />
<br />
This culture of secrecy allows unchecked rule by nuclear elites.<br />
Bryan Hubbard, May 1997. Nuclear Criticism After The Cold War, Thesis, UMI, pg 12-13.<br />
“An awareness is growing among public policy advocates … in the post-Cold War era.”<br />
<br />
And secrecy independently shuts down the nuclear public sphere by allowing governmental control of the terms of debate.<br />
Joseph Masco, June 20-23 2007. The Nuclear Public Sphere, Ethnografeast III: Ethnography and the Public Sphere, Lisbon, Portugal, anthropology.uchicago.edu/faculty/faculty_masco.shtml.<br />
“The modern state form while promoting the idea of a public sphere … of the state in the ability to destroy or be destroyed.”<br />
<br />
Nuclear technocracy ensures extinction – only public involvement can ensure responsible use of science and solve arms races<br />
Marko Beljac, 2008. Mission Statement, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scisec.net/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">http://scisec.net/?page_id=5</a>.<br />
“But it cannot be stated that the mere existence of a faculty of scientific … public subsidy that undergirds the Pentagon system.”<br />
<br />
This secrecy matrix guarantees war and failure at all levels of policy planning<br />
Joseph Masco, June 20-23 2007. The Nuclear Public Sphere, Ethnografeast III: Ethnography and the Public Sphere, Lisbon, Portugal, anthropology.uchicago.edu/faculty/faculty_masco.shtml.<br />
“The deployment of “secret” knowledge as political propaganda … only ideology remains as the basis for action.”<br />
<br />
The secret nuclear planning process guarantees extinction<br />
Andrew Lichterman, 2004. A Juggernaut Without Brakes: American Militarism Drives On, www.al.marginalnotes.org/docs/juggernaut.html<br />
“Hannah Arendt noted that with imperialism there emerged … will not stop until there is nothing left to violate.”<br />
<br />
Must challenge nuclear secrecy – it is the organizing principle of all federal government secrecy<br />
Joseph Masco, June 20-23 2007. The Nuclear Public Sphere, Ethnografeast III: Ethnography and the Public Sphere, Lisbon, Portugal, anthropology.uchicago.edu/faculty/faculty_masco.shtml.<br />
“The classified universe is five to ten times … management in the form of the secrecy/threat matrix.”<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should eliminate the United States federal government’s nuclear calculated ambiguity declaratory policy and restrict all nuclear missions to only those that are approved by non-secret hearings of the United States Congress.<br />
<br />
Forcing broad, non-secret debate on nuclear weapons policies in Congress solves resource allocation issues to insure strong oversight<br />
Stephen Schwartz, October 2008. Center for Nonproliferation Studies – Monterey Institute for International Studies, www.nti.org/e_research/e3_congress_and_nuclear_weapons.html<br />
“In addition, as we have seen many members feel they lack the knowledge … not on the policies use to justify the spending programs in those budgets.”<br />
<br />
War planning is key – plan forces an open consideration of the effects of nuclear war and galvanizes the nuclear public sphere<br />
Matthew G. McKinzie et al, June 2001. “The U.S. Nuclear War Plan: A Time For Change,” Natural Resources Defense Council.<br />
“Our databases and tools have provided us with a greater appreciation … nation, democratic, at peace with itself and its neighbors.”<br />
<br />
Top down change in the war plan debate is key to mobilize all institutional change<br />
Norris and Benedict, 11/7/2005. “The Taboos, Secrets, and Hidden History of Nuclear Weapons,” The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Federal News Service.<br />
“Could you comment on the fact that in a way … and day out doing what they are told to do.”<br />
<br />
Oversight key to solve unchecked tech development<br />
Stephen Schwartz, 1998. Atomic Audit, p. 517.<br />
“In conclusion, congressional oversight of the nuclear weapons … nuclear weapons budget is taken up in chapter II.”<br />
<br />
Calculated ambiguity makes deterrence failures inevitable<br />
Hans Kristensen, July 2007. “U.S. Strategic War Planning After 9/11,” Nonproliferation Review, Vol 14, No 2.<br />
“The New Triad has been sold on the presumption that it is a positive … to prevent undermining the credibility of U.S. nuclear deterrence in the future.”<br />
<br />
Calculated ambiguity causes deterrence break downs<br />
CSIS, 2009. PONI Blog, “The Commitment Trap,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://csis.org/blog/commitment-trap" rel="nofollow">http://csis.org/blog/commitment-trap</a><br />
“While there could be a bit of a “nuclear warfare allergy” … make a very big deal. Choose your words carefully.”<br />
<br />
Evolutionary psych proves deterrence inevitably fails.<br />
Bradley Thayer, 2007. “Thinking About Nuclear Deterrence Theory: Why Evolutionary Psychology Undermines Its Rational Actor Assumptions,” Comparative Strategy 26:311-323.<br />
“Most often, the difficulty in removing academic stovepipes is not an urgent matter … of a nuclear deterrent threat is irredeemably flawed.”<br />

The subject of the resolution is an ethical call— It demands that the USFG “SHOULD” do something—it is a call for laws, social norms, for methodology. It is call for collective behaivor towards the right decision. It demands A premier science of morality to justify our actions. it wants the science of good and evil.<br />

Ethics is about … make such judgments [11].<br />
<br />
This is a science that is enacted in the government’s launch on warning posture. Despite the appearance of low alert, the U.S. maintains a policy of Launch on Warning that strictly prescribes a narrow window to launch a retaliatory strike before weapons detonate within the U.S. There is no decision to make because the decision of “should” has already been made. The president must launch as per predetermined war plans.<br />

We have not learned the lesson of the “guns of august” 1914. We cannot systematize decisions without invoking disaster. This strategy is the most absurd faith in rationality—we have removed the moment-to-moment vitality of decision because of a fear of not having the chance to strike back. the ethics of decision do not fit the timeframe of seconds. the possibility of mistakes in our machines or calculations is not considered. the morality has been predetermined<br />

<br />
BRUce blair and others call these accidents. they are right about the danger they pose but are wrong about the label. These are not accidents, they are choices. they choices do not choose in the moment, they leave responsibilty of ethics to systems of rational calculation and technical system of assessment.<br />
<br />
Accidents act as a vehicle for metaphysics. they create a false dichotomy between ordinary deterrence and mistaken breakdown, ignoring that breakdowns can only come out of the dangerous situation produced by our deterrent system built of rational ethics. this creatES the very conditions for violence while ignoring our own roles in producing situations of danger<br />

<br />
these confusions of agency leads to decisions that seem pre-made in the absence of thoughts about devastating consequences.

This shift created enormous …an accidental nuclear war.<br />
<br />
The desire for a science of ethics, for a formula of premade decisions that can take the most weighty decision of the moment off our hands is understandable. But it is the moral ethics of systems which engenders the worst cruelty and violence, for it can only operate is two ways. First, ethics tells us what is morally permissable and, in any given situation, what “we should do” or what “we should not do.” WE are held culpable for assaulting that which iS iNLCUDED our ethics. But what is excluded? in consequentialist ethics, what does not Outweigh becomes of no consequence. We say “We have no choice” but to sacrifice some for the many. Not only is violence acceptable, necessarily, but it is a choice about which we give no second thought. It is justified. in phenomological ethics, we find rules, guidelines, that are “apparent” or should be followed—but what those are not covered by the rules are left behind, unthought. Ambiguity crushes these rules—what about certain situations unthought of prior—must ethics imagine every situation? That is impossible.<br />
<br />
Second, ethics is conduct. what should be done can only be enforced by punishment. We learn by pain. otherwise, what of ethics? why should We pay attention to the ethiCS we cannot enforce? ethics becomes the force of law…the law itself, wITH all of the juridical power of the law behind IT. After all, the worst cruelties are those which are meant to enforce ethical behavior.<br />
<br />
AND, We wish for moral ethics to guide our decisions about who should live and who should die. WE WANT IT to remove that great burden—but we should be careful what we wish for. to wish ethics is to assign our creation of ourselves to outside forces, to unplanned choices, and sacrifice our own deliberation. Our very ability to take responsibility—the very existence of a sovereign-self that can make a choice at all is at risk.<br />

<br />
PLAN: The united states federal government will abandon its policy of launch on warning.<br />
<br />
Our conclusion against the launch on warnning is not a moral rule. We do not ban retaliatory nuclear strikes. our pathotic responsibility means you must choose for yourself what is life-affirming, what helps you understand your own life. Life involves suffering and we cannot avoid inflicting it or having it inflicted on us. We must confront that in all life. But Low is precisely the opposite—it prevent us from confronting killing, stop us from taking responsibility for our decisions for our safety, prevent us from affirming EVERYTHING In life, agreeable or disagreeable. You cannot be responsible for bureacratized violence. If you must inflict it, do it yourself and not at the behest of pre-made formulas.<br />

This pre-made morality of decision, these briefing of retalitory options which been so deeply calculated in vetted, are the root of war and do nothing to stop this violence. Ethics demands war—it makes is a process of obeying what we have already determined to be morally justifiable. for one moment, in LOW, we retake the power of decision of away from a system and return it to human.<br />

<em>AFF - Harvard Round 3 - v Michigan LZ<br />
<br />
The SSP replaced the original testing mission of the nuclear arsenal with a never-ending nuclear science fair. The SSP has created machines that abstract the destructive power of the bomb in science projects that study the first microseconds of explosions. These tests are fun, exciting; they offer weapons scientists a chance to ignore the already existing weapons and instead search for the mythic first-principles of the bomb’s power. The SSP is an attempt to run from the bodily terror produced by the bomb and convert it into a purely useful form. Through endless simulation, the materials science of the bomb becomes an end in itself, dedicated only to giving bored scientists something to do. The ends of the bomb are lost as the stockpile is converted from a political institution into an object of aesthetic fascination<br />
Joseph Masco, “Nuclear Borderlands”, 53-55, 2006<br />
By separating the nuclear future from an arms race that the United States… articulate an expanding view of the nuclear future.<br />
<br />
Purely aesthetic rendering of nuclear science depoliticizes it – renders the reproduction of nuclear technology inevitable. It is not the beauty of the bomb that is bad, rather it is the scientists<br />
Masco, 96-98, 2006<br />
The question SBSS ultimately exposes, I would argue, is not how to maintain nuclear weapons… technoaesthetic spectacle par excellence.<br />
<br />
The SSP makes technological progress appear an inevitable part of the world rather than a series of everyday decisions.<br />
Masco, p. 14-15, 2006<br />
But if, as Stein argues, the bomb is banal, how did it come to be… always preparing for the “unthinkable.”<br />
<br />
Even if the materials science itself doesn’t depoliticize technology, any remaining vestige of the stewardship mandate will be redeployed by DOE to close off nuclear policy from deliberation and ensure technocratic control.<br />

Audiences attempting to follow the story of nuclear weapons in the post-Cold War era… SSP and its rhetorical situation.<br />

Taylor and Henry, 2008<br />
Through these arguments, we come to understand how the potential… levers of U.S. nuclear weapons policy.”<br />
<br />
There is also structural spillover – certification process ensures that this knowledge determines broader nuclear policy<br />
Andrew Lichterman and Jacqueline Cabasso, 2000, Online<br />
The SS&amp;M program will increase the political power of the nuclear weapons labs and their control over weapons-reltaed information, and may thus help… essentially a judgement call by the laboratories.<br />
<br />
This depoliticized knowledge creates regimes oftruth within nuclear science which makes more effective science impossible – policy action can reverse it<br />
Laura McNamara, “Nuclear Legacies, Communication, Controversy, and the US Nuclear Weapons Complex”, p. 193, 2006<br />
So, even without a return to testing, the weapons laboratories seem… remarkably resilient regime of nuclear truth.<br />
<br />
AND This depoliticization mandates escalatory war and makes peaceful resolution of conflicts impossible<br />
Anthony Burke, “Ontologies of War”, Theory and Event, 10:2, 2007<br />
This closed circle of existential and strategic reason generates… arguably examples of such ontologies in action.<br />
Depoliticized weapons science leads to extinction – must have democratic forms of knowledge to contest complex expansion<br />
Marko Beljac, “Mission Statement”, 2008, Online<br />
But it cannot be stated that the mere existence of a faculty of scientific cognition foreordains an extinction event… remove the public subsidy that undergirds the pentagon system.<br />

Joseph Masco, “Bad Weather: On Planetary Crisis”, 2008, 11-14<br />
Returning to the synthetic forest of 1953 (see figure 1) we can see in the fury of the nuclear blast… post-national vision of American power.<br />

Fuyuki Kurasawa, “The Ties to bind: Techno-science, ethics, and democracy”, Philosophy and social criticism”, 30:2, 2004<br />
This erosion of ethics and publicness creates a disturbing situation, according to which the sources… and according to what and whose values?<br />
<br />
The aff is a pre-req to yoru impact turns – only social change and public deliberation can ensure positive use of science and technology<br />
Christian Fuchs, “On the Topicality of Selected Aspects and Herbert Marcuse’s Work”, 2002, Online<br />
When Marcuse says, that domination is a technology… machines as well as the role they play in life.<br />
<br />
The nuclear complex has been obscured from our vision of everyday life – our aff is critical to establish linkages between the imagined use of nuclear weapons, the false apocalypse of the nuclear scientists and the everyday activities that determine how we understand these weapons.<br />
Masco, “Nuclear Borderlands”, 4-5 and 23-25<br />
The “unthinkability” of the nuclear age has right from the beginning, then, produced its rhetorical… American power in the twenty-first century… Nuclear weapons, as “impassioned objects,” are not only the material… to a large extent, through the bomb.<br />

The Stockpile Stewardship Program replaced the original testing mission of the nuclear arsenal with a never-ending nuclear science fair. According to the DOE the SSP’s mission is to[[#_ftn1|[1]]]<br />
Support a focused, multifaceted program to increase the understanding of the enduring stockpile;<br />
Predict, detect, and evaluate potential problems of the aging of the stockpile;<br />
Refurbish and re-manufacture weapons and components, as required; and<br />
Maintain the science and engineering institutions needed to support the nation’s nuclear deterrent, now and in the future.<br />
Yet it is more. The SSP was created in the days of uncertainty following Clinton’s defacto test ban, supposedly simply to maintain the existing arsenal. It has created machines that abstract the destructive power of the bomb in science projects that study the first microseconds of explosions. These tests are fun, exciting; they offer weapons scientists a chance to ignore the already existing weapons and instead search for the mythic first-principles of the bomb’s power.<br />
<br />
The Stockpile Stewardship program is an attempt to run from the bodily terror produced by the bomb and convert it into a purely useful form. Through endless simulation, the materials science of the bomb becomes an end in itself, dedicated only to giving bored scientists something to do. The ends of the bomb are lost as the stockpile is converted from a political institution to an object of aesthetic fascination.<br />

 Contention 1 – Aesthetics<br />
The Stockpile Stewardship Program replaced the original testing mission of the nuclear arsenal with a never-ending nuclear science fair. According to the DOE the SSP’s mission is to1<br />
Support a focused, multifaceted program to increase the understanding of the enduring stockpile;<br />
Predict, detect, and evaluate potential problems of the aging of the stockpile;<br />
Refurbish and re-manufacture weapons and components, as required; and<br />
Maintain the science and engineering institutions needed to support the nation’s nuclear deterrent, now and in the future.<br />
Yet it is more. The SSP was created in the days of uncertainty following Clinton’s defacto test ban, supposedly simply to maintain the existing arsenal. It has created machines that abstract the destructive power of the bomb in science projects that study the first microseconds of explosions. To observe a nuclear explosion now means to take a trip to the Assessment Theater to view the Power Wall.2 Or go over to the National Ignition Facility to light up a pellet of frozen hydrogen to create a miniature nuclear explosion for a fraction of a second.3These tests are fun, exciting; they offer weapons scientists a chance to ignore the already existing weapons and instead search for the mythic first-principles of the bomb’s power.<br />
The Stockpile Stewardship program is an attempt to run from the bodily terror produced by the bomb and convert it into a purely useful form. Through endless simulation, the materials science of the bomb becomes an end in itself, dedicated only to giving bored scientists something to do.

<br />
By separating the nuclear future … view of the nuclear future.<br />
To push the effects of the bomb into the aesthetic realm places them as objects outside of public deliberation making war inevitable and denies the everyday pleasure of the body as individuals are forced to identify with the power that holds them hostage<br />

Contention 2 – Depoliticization<br />
The SBSS depoliticizes the development of nuclear technology – making technological progress appear an inevitable part of the world rather than a series of everyday decisions<br />

(Joseph, The Nuclear Borderlands: The Manhattan Project in Post-Cold War New Mexico, pg. 14-5)<br />
<br />
But if, as Stein argues, … preparing for the “unthinkable.”<br />
In this view of technology we constantly hold out hope that the next, biggest bomb will be the last yet to compensate for the ever increasing pace of technology we are forced us to destroy our senses and consequently all that makes life worth living<br />

Contention 3 – Everyday Life<br />
Discussions about nuclear weapons are thus stuck gravitating between two extreme poles- on the one hand there are the materials scientists, absentmindedly disconnected from the nuclear complex of which they are a part, participating in the production of new technologies whose social function and impact they will never attempt to understand- on the other there is the citizenry, constantly fed images of nuclear apocalypse, instilling fear within them in order to create financial and political support for a burgeoning nuclear industry. And yet, despite the fact that political and social life have been oriented obsessively towards the construction of the nuclear complex, the complex itself has disappeared from everyday life, its effects mysteriously rendered invisible in the realm of nuclear policymaking. Our plan is critical to establish the linkages between these two extremes, creating a vision of everyday life that can politicize the bomb rather than allow it to become a banal feature of our everyday existence<br />
