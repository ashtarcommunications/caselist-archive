War permeates all discourse; debate itself is a battle, we create discursive weapons to attack with and positions to defend in our little theater of war, <br />
Mann in 1996<br />

<br />
And, It is through ordering lines of flight, communication and knowledge that the state attempts to control and enframe all life. The perpetual control of space and politics is central the power of the enemy, through this ordering power the state is able to control resistance itself, making all resistance intelligible and visible, ensuring the continued domination state power.<br />

<br />
And, this control of the discursive economy of ordering is what makes all status quo criticism and resistance to the state inevitably fail<br />

The statist form of ordering uses its power to protect itself from criticism, subverting anti-majoritarian practices like secrecy for the power of the state. Through its ordering power the state is able to control and restrict all communiation and information regarding nuclear weapons. In fact all data relating to nuclear weapons is “born secret”, even relating a dream about nuclear weapons endangers national security and is against the law, it places the individual outside the statist grid of ordering<br />
Morland in 2005<br />
(Howard, journalist and activist, “Born Secret”, CARDOZO LAW REVIEW, VOL 26, NO 4, MARCH 2005, PP. 1401-8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/cardozo.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/cardozo.pdf</a> -rkc)<br />
<br />
The control of information about nuclear weapons and the ability to organize and striate society freezes the social and maintains a society of perfect control, justified by the fear of nuclear weapons and the state security apparatus.<br />

<br />
This control of lines of flight, nuclear weapons and the knowledge about them, is part of a state offensive of security that creates a totalizing, unending violence of incorporation, discipline and annihilation against life itself.<br />

<br />
Thus, the plan:<br />
<span style="background: black; mso-highlight: black;">Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal, and/or substantially reduce and restrict the role and/or missions of its nuclear weapons arsenal.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Secrecy is becoming. It is not the content of the secret, but its form that gives it power. Our affirmation of secrecy is an affirmation of a life of resistance and guerilla warfare against the statist forms of ordering that are constantly disciplining us</span><br />

We need to throw out all traditional and normative forms of resistance, these normative forms and practices of politics ultimately reify and support the statist economy of ordering. We must abandon the economies of positioning and strategy for more tactical and effective forms of resistance<br />
Mann in 1996<br />
(Paul, Professor of English @ Pomona College, “The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare”, PMC 6.2, <span style="font-size: 8.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt;">pMUSE-rkc</span>)<br />
Our tactics are key to guarantee victory because Intellectual warfare demands tactical deception and secrecy, since we are in a war with the state and its normative forms of ordering and control, we must subvert the entire system, abandoning the normative discursive economy for new grounds of deception and tactical resistance<br />
Mann in 1996<br />

The 1ac is a wrench in the system, we need to play a new game entirely. Instead of playing chess, a game of the state with fixed positions and strategies, we should play go, and affirm more tactical and unlimited forms of resistance<br />

Our affirmation is a war machine, a life opposed to all statist forms of ordering and thinking,<br />
