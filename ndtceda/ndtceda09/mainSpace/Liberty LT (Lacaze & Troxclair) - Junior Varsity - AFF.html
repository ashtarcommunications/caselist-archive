Advantage 1: Russia<br />
<br />
Eliminating TNW is key to Russian TNW cuts- US must act first<br />
1) Russian officials have pointed to U.S. weapons in Europe as a justification for rejecting limits on their own TNWs.<br />
Kristensen, Federation of American Scientists Nuclear Information Project Director, June 08<br />
(Hans M., Hans, Federation of American Scientists, former Natural Resources Defense Council Nuclear Program consultant, former Nautilus Institute Nuclear Strategy Project director, former  Danish Ministry of defense  special adviser, former Greenpeace International Nuclear Information Unit senior researcher, Federation of American Scientists, “U.S. Nuclear Weapons Withdrawn From the United Kingdom”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2008/06/us-nuclear-weapons-withdrawn-from-the-united-kingdom.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2008/06/us-nuclear-weapons-withdrawn-from-the-united-kingdom.php</a>) kel<br />
<br />
<br />
Why NATO and the…is: who will make the first move?<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Russia only keeps their TNWs as security against U.S. TNWs<br />
ITAR-TASS news agency, 09/03/07<br />
(Moscow, Russia, “Any Russia-US talks on nuclear disarmament should include UK, France – general”, LexisNexis) kel <br />
<br />
Moscow, 3 September:…weapons would have a direct influence on its security,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
3) TNWs are both the most likely weapon Russia will use in a nuclear confrontation and the most accident-prone – Russia will extend the role of its TNWs to equalize the conventional weakness – this heightens the probability for unauthorized use, Russia-NATO military standoff, and terrorist acquisition.<br />
Saradzhyan, research fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center, 08/10/09<br />
(Simon, “Tactical Nukes: A Strategic Asset or Future Liability?”, International Relations and Security Network Security Watch, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/layout/set/print/content/view/full/73?id=103631&amp;lng=en" rel="nofollow">http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/layout/set/print/content/view/full/73?id=103631&amp;lng=en</a>) kel<br />

The issues, with which Russia…nuclear powers and acquisition of such arms by either nation states or non-state actors.<br />
<br />
4) We control uniqueness – Distrust keeps building with every inch of NATO encroachment<br />
Friedman, Chief Executive of Stratfor,  8/31/09 <br />
(George, , “The Western View of Russia,” Stratfor Global Intelligence Report, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://hosted" rel="nofollow">http://hosted</a>.<br />

<br />
While the nuclear balance remains,…War policies they nurtured.<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: Accidental Launch<br />
<br />
1) The status quo locks in a growing imbalance between Russian strategic and tactical nukes – As both sides reduce their strategic arsenals, Russia’s strategic nuclear deterrent becomes threatened and the likelihood of using TNWs increases<br />
Wood, ‘09 <br />
(David, Columnist for Politics Daily, “Tactical Nuclear Weapons, the Menace No One Is Talking About,” 7/8, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/07/08/tactical-nuclear-weapons-the-menace-no-one-is-" rel="nofollow">http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/07/08/tactical-nuclear-weapons-the-menace-no-one-is-</a> talking-about/ )<br />
<br />
Almost nothing is known…we agree to go down to very low levels of strategic weapons, that begins to matter to strategists.'' <br />
<br />
<br />
2) This accelerates Russia’s fear that the US could escalate a successfulfirst strike – causes Russia to transition to an unstable posture<br />
MOSHER Senior Policy Analyst @ RAND 2003 <br />
(David E., , Beyond the Nuclear Shadow: A Phased Approach for Improving Nuclear Safety and U.S-Russian Relations, Pg. 31-32)<br />
<br />
Wlhen the perceived vulnerability…times, this system could break down.<br />
<br />
<br />
3)  Russian Tactical Nuclear weapons are extremely subject to accidental, illicit, or terrorist use<br />
Alexander and Millar, Director of the Center on Global Counterterrorism Cooperation, 2003<br />
(Brian and Alistair, “Uncovered Nukes: An Introduction to Tactical Nuclear Weapons”, Tactical Nuclear Weapons: Emergent Threats in an Evolving Security Environment, edited by Brian Alexander and Alistair Millar, pg. 11-13) kel<br />
<br />
Tactical Nuclear Weapons and…to prevent the export of fissile materials and dangerous dual-use technologies/'26<br />
<br />
4) Tactical deployments promotes a hair-trigger posture, making accidental nuclear war more likely by encouraging lower command and control, predelegation, and preemptive strikes<br />
Sokov, Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, 1997 <br />
(Nikolai, The Nonproliferation Review, Winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol04/42/sokov42.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/npr/vol04/42/sokov42.pdf</a>)<br />
“Effective deterrence hinges on an ability”) kel<br />
<br />
The “sacred” foundations of nuclear….the same logic to the other side.<br />

5) Accidental launch causes extinction<br />
PR Newswire, April 29, 1998<br />
(Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, “NEJM Study Warns of Increasing Risk of Accidental Nuclear Attack”)<br />
<br />
An 'accidental' nuclear …nuclear war with billions of casualties worldwide.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: U.S./Russia Relations<br />
<br />
TNWs and the resulting aggressive nuclear posture damage U.S./ Russia relations<br />
Kristensen, FAS Nuclear Information Project director, 02/05  <br />
[Hans, Federation of American Scientists, former Natural Resources Defense Council Nuclear Program consultant, former Nautilus Institute Nuclear Strategy Project director, former Danish Ministry of defense special adviser, former Greenpeace International Nuclear Information Unit senior researcher, “U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe A Review of Post-Cold War Policy,<br />
Force Levels, and War Planning”, Natural Resources Defense Council, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf</a>) kel<br />
<br />
The Bush administration declared…these weapons allegedly contributeto NATO’s security interests.<br />
<br />
2) Relations solves Russian aggression-act as a constraining influence. <br />
Pifer, senior adviser  CSIS Russia and Eurasia Program, 2009 <br />
(Steven, “Reversing the Decline: An Agenda for U.S.-Russian Relations in 2009”,Brooking Institute, January 2009, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/01_us_russia_relations_pifer.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/01_us_russia_relations_pifer.aspx</a>, ldg)<br />
<br />
Further, the more there is to the…truculent Russia that seeks to undermine U.S.-preferred institutions and initiatives or create alternatives. <br />
<br />
3) Tactical nuclear presence in Eastern Europe combined with NATO eastern expansion, NMD, and the Russian war in Georgia has set a perfect storm of political ramifications that threaten an arms race and return to war.<br />
Solovyvov in 8<br />
Dimitry; writer for Reuters; Oct 1; Russia fears U.S. nuclear arms on its borders; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE4907RV20081001" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE4907RV20081001</a><br />
<br />
&quot;Accession of Russia's neighbors Ukraine and Georgia to NATO could lead to…- Abkhazia and South Ossetia -- as independent states.&quot;<br />
<br />
4) Even a “limited” conflict would kill billions<br />

<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.teachpeace.com/encirclingusall.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.teachpeace.com/encirclingusall.htm</a><br />
A renewed cold war between nuclear powers also raises the danger of<br />
&quot;accidental”…”nationalism are driving militarization and confrontations that put<br />
all we know at risk. ”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5) U.S. Russia war leads to extinction<br />
Bostrom, Director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, 2002 (Nick, Existential Risks<br />
Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.transhumanist.com/volume9/risks.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.transhumanist.com/volume9/risks.html</a>) <br />
<br />
The US and Russia still have huge….may or may not be more resilient to extinction than other animal species.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Nuclear Terrorism<br />
<br />
1) Withdrawing TNW’s Prevents Nuclear Terrorism<br />
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, 10/05<br />
(Davida Higgin, CND and Lakenheath Action Group “U.S. Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Europe”, Briefing Paper, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf</a>) kel<br />

“Nuclear terrorism is one…conflict of unimaginable proportions.<br />
<br />
2) TNW is key to prevent nuclear terrorism – Air Force investigation proves<br />
Kristensen, Federation of American Scientists Nuclear Information Project Director, 06/19/08<br />
(Hans, Federation of American Scientists, former Natural Resources Defense Council Nuclear Program consultant, former Nautilus Institute Nuclear Strategy Project director, former Danish Ministry of defense special adviser, former Greenpeace International Nuclear Information Unit senior researcher , “Are U.S. Weapons in Europe Secure?”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474977377479" rel="nofollow">http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474977377479</a>) kel<br />
<br />
The main implication of the BRR report is….come to finally complete the withdrawal if tactical nuclear weapons from Europe.<br />
<br />
3)  TNWs risk nuclear terrorism because of poorly guarded Russian borders, failing economy, and waning safeguards<br />
Millar, Director of the Center on Global Counterterrorism Cooperation, and Alexander, March 2002<br />
(Alistair and Brian, Fourth Freedom Forum, Washington D.C., “Uncovered Nukes: Tactical Nuclear Weapons”,  <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/npt/ngorep/TactNukes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/legal/npt/ngorep/TactNukes.pdf</a>) kel<br />
<br />
The rise of international terrorism….This need for international efforts to control and reduce this class of weapon through a successful initiative on TNWs is paramount.<br />
<br />
4) Nuclear terrorism with TNW would be just as bad as a strategic weapon- AND- TNW are a unique risk- they are not regulated by international arms control<br />
 Turner, former Director of CIA and Commander and Chief of NATO’s Southern Flank, 03<br />
(Stansfield, “Tactical Nuclear Weapons: Emergent Threats in an Evolving Security Environment”, edited by Brian Alexander and Alistair Millar, pg. vii-viii)<br />
The first is related to this fact: The single…..effort to the tactical arena.<br />
<br />
5) Nuclear terrorism causes a full-scale nuclear war<br />
Spiece, Associate @ Gibson, Dunn and Cruthcr Washington DC 2006 (William and Mary Law Review, February 2006, lexis) <br />
<br />
The potential consequences of the unchecked….escalate to the use of nuclear weapons<br />
<br />
6) The impact is world war and extinction, even if it doesn’t work<br />
Mohamed Sid-Ahmed, Al-Ahram Weekly political analyst, ‘04<br />
[Al-Ahram Weekly, &quot;Extinction!&quot; 8/26, no. 705, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/705/op5.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
What would be the consequences of ….we will all be losers.<br />
<br />
Solvency:<br />
<br />
1) Withdrawing TNW’s from Europe would solve U.S./ Russia arms control and reduction<br />
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, 10/05<br />
(Davida Higgin, CND and Lakenheath Action Group “U.S. Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Europe”, Briefing Paper, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnduk.org/pages/binfo/nato2005.pdf</a>) kel<br />
<br />
First of all, by withdrawing TNW from…US bombs are deployed.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) The U.S. should remove its TNW from Europe because they create the posture for a nuclear-standoff with Russia<br />
Pikayev, Head of the Department for Disarmament and Conflict Resolution at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations at the Academy of Sciences, Accessed 08/17/09<br />
(Alexander, Member of International Institute of Strategic Studies, commissioned by the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, “Tactical Nuclear Weapons”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Pikayev_Tactical_Nuclear_Weapons.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.icnnd.org/latest/research/Pikayev_Tactical_Nuclear_Weapons.pdf</a>) kel<br />
