Accidental War 1AC<br />
<br />
Contention One - War<br />
<br />
U.S. forces are on high alert – it only takes a couple of minutes to launch<br />
<br />
Blair 8 (Bruce, president of the World Security Institute, “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament, Oslo Feb. 26 – 27, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
Both the Kremlin and the White House routinely re-issue presidential nuclear guidance that requires their respective nuclear forces to be constantly prepared to fight a largescale nuclear war with each other at a moment’s notice. These forces are assigned long lists of targets, running into the thousands on each side, to strike in the event of war, and they are expected to inflict serious damage with high probability on all target categories – opposing nuclear forces, conventional forces, war-supporting industry, and leadership. The forces cannot achieve this wartime objective of high ‘damage expectancy’ if the opposing forces destroy them first, and so both strategic arsenals kept on launch-ready alert. Their command and early warning networks maintain a constant vigil and readiness to launch the forces on warning of incoming warheads fired by the opposing side.<br />
<br />
This fuse is no longer today than it was during the Cold War. Both nuclear superpowers manage their strategic arsenals in almost exactly the same manner as they did during the Cold War.<br />
<br />
How short is this fuse? Many hundreds of missiles on land and sea are fully armed, fueled, and targeted. The land-based missiles in silos will fly as soon as they receive a few short computer signals whose transmission is as simple as stroking a few keys on a keyboard, hitting ‘enter,’ repeating the sequence once more, and then turning twoaaa keys in unison. The sea-based missiles on submarines will pop out of their tubes as soon as their gyroscopes are spun up, the onboard computer uploads their wartime targets and arms their warheads, and additional computer signals open the hatches and ignite the steam generators that propel the missiles to the surface.<br />
<br />
If the Kremlin and the White House ordered the launch of their alert strategic missiles right now, this minute, without any prior notice and advance preparation, the amount of firepower unleashed and the speed of its release would be astonishingly large and rapid. U.S. land-based launch crews would receive the order almost instantaneously, remove launch keys and codes from their safes, compare the authorization codes in the launch order with those in their safes, insert their launch keys, punch in the number of the selected war plan that automatically instructs their missiles which specific target file to pull from their computer files and what trajectory to fly, key in the ‘enabling code’ contained in the launch order that arms the warheads on the missiles, and turn the launch keys that transmit the ‘fire’ command to the dispersed unmanned missiles in underground silos.<br />
<br />
The time needed to execute all of these steps in the Minuteman fields of central plains America: one to two minutes. (They are called Minuteman for a reason.) At sea, analogous steps taken by submarine crews include retrieving a special firing key from a safe inside a safe, the access code to which is provided by the launch order from higher authority. From that point in time until missiles leave their tubes in quick succession only about 12 minutes would elapse.<br />
<br />
Very similar procedures and timelines apply in Russia. Extremely high launch readiness for large numbers of alert missiles prevails on both sides. About one-third of their total strategic forces are poised for immediate launch under normal conditions. The combined firepower that could be unleashed within these short time frames measured in minutes is approximately 2,654 high-yield nuclear warheads (1,382 U.S. and 1,272 Russian) – the equivalent of approximately 100,000 Hiroshima bombs (assuming the Hiroshima bomb yielded 15 kilotons of explosive power).<br />
<br />
A high degree of vigilance suffuses the entire U.S. and Russian chains of nuclear command and warning, from the bottom all the way to the top. In the warning centers, such as the hub of the U.S. early warning network in Colorado, crews labor under the pressure of tight deadlines to assess and report whether a satellite or land radar sensor indicating a possible threat to North America is real or false. Events happen almost daily, sometimes more than once daily, which trigger this assessment drill that is supposed to yield a preliminary assessment within three minutes after the arrival of the initial sensor data.2 Analogous drills take place under comparable deadlines in Russia. A rush of adrenalin and rote processing of checklists, often accompanied by confusion, characterize the process.3<br />
<br />
If their early warning assessment determines that a nuclear missile attack is possibly underway, the entire chain of nuclear command in the United States or Russia would immediately kick into high gear with thousands of duty crews and nuclear support personnel involved. The same rush of adrenalin and rote decision-making by checklist drive a process whose intensity and deadlines practically rule out any chance for careful deliberation. An emergency conference involving the presidents and their top nuclear advisors would be convened, whereupon on the U.S. side the commanding duty officer at Strategic Command headquarters in Omaha would brief the U.S. president on the nature of the apparent attack, the wide array of response options, and their anticipated consequences for Russian physical and human resources. The time allocated for this briefing is as little as 30 seconds depending on the nature of the attack. The U.S. president then would come under intense pressure to absorb this complex set of data, weigh the consequences of the various options, and choose a course of action. His decision window is typically twelve minutes, although under certain extreme conditions it can be much shorter.<br />
<br />
The extraordinarily brief time for such a momentous decision is driven by four factors: the 30 minute flight time for an intercontinental missile, and about one-half that for an submarine-launched missile; the time required to validate and characterize the attack, using two separate sources of warning data to ensure high confidence; the time required to convene a phone conference of the principals involved in the decision process, and the time required following presidential decision to encode and transmit that decision worldwide to the strategic nuclear forces. Any delay in transmitting the response order runs the risk of losing retaliatory forces to the other side’s attack, thus undermining the calculus of expected damage for the response option chosen by the national leadership. This risk is compounded in the event of a so-called “decapitation strike,” that is, an opening attack on the leadership. Under this circumstance, the integrity of a retaliatory response is greatly compromised, thus calling into question the very calculus upon which nuclear deterrence is based.<br />
<br />
Given these acute conditions, it is no wonder that as much of the response process as possible is designed to be quasi-automatic. It can reasonably be described as going to war by checklist, enacting a prepared script, with little margin for human error or technical malfunction. The nuclear war machinery on both sides has a hair-trigger quality. And that quality has been a constant in the nuclear equation for decades despite the Cold War’s end. Both of the traditional nuclear rivals still stand ready to inflict apocalyptic devastation on one another in a first or second strike whose essential course would be run in less than one hour.<br />

Accidental War 1AC<br />
<br />
Accidental conflict is inevitable—<br />
<br />
First, deteriorating early warning systems<br />

<br />
As historical experience demonstrates, the highest potential danger of an accidental nuclear conflict lies in the reconnaissance data gathering systems, command and control systems and early warning systems (EWS). Let us look at the problem based on EWS operation example. As we all know, the early warning systems of both Russia and the United States are based on complex radio-technical and infrared equipment systems, both ground-based and space-based, are highly automated and saturated with fast-acting computers. This is precisely the system which outputs the initial signal which serves as the basis for making the launch-on-warning decision. The non-absolute reliability of the early warning systems could lead to a nuclear conflict despite the will of the top political command of the nation, due to the fact that erroneous information and the high degree of combat readiness of nuclear weapons could be at the core of the decision-making process. History knows many incidents of early warning systems giving false alarms of an incoming nuclear missile attack by the adversary.  Here are just a few examples. In 1961, U.S. early-warning radar registered a sudden emergence of a multitude of unknown objects flying at a great speed towards the United States. After this data has been processed in the system, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) immediately put its forces on combat alert. Everything was ready for a strike, and only some time later it was discovered that all the panic had been caused by the flying fragments of the detonated tank of the U.S. Transit satellite.  In June of 1980, the warning system located at the SAC command post near Omaha, Nebraska, gave a signal of an incoming submarine-launched ballistic missile attack. All the B-52 bomber crews on duty received the command to take their places and turn on the engines. The airborne command post was readied for takeoff as well. Only three minutes later did it become clear that it was a false alarm, and an all-clear signal sounded. Subsequent investigation of the incident revealed that the false alarm had been caused by the malfunctioning of a 50-cent computer microchip of the early warning system. A steel spill at a metallurgical plant, when observed from space, can be mistaken for a missile launch. According to experts, during the 1980's, false initial signals were registered 6 times daily on average by the early warning systems.    Similar incidents occurred in the operation of the Soviet (Russian) EWS as well. In January of 1982, Soviet radar covering the southward direction registered an incoming ballistic missile. In response to this signal, the command post was put on heightened combat alert. Only several minutes later did it become clear that the cause for the alarm had been the test launch by Israel of the Jericho-2 missile, which had a flight range of 1,450 km and therefore did not pose any threat to the U.S.S.R. In June of 1985, the radar covering eastward direction registered a ballistic missile flying within the surveillance area. The signal was so strong that the target was immediately followed. Further analysis of the moving target at the command post revealed that the signal had been generated by a satellite possessing high reflectivity to solar light. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Russian early warning system was put to a hard test. Out of the nine EWS radars, only three remained within Russia, while the rest of the radars ended up on the territory of other Commonwealth countries: two in Ukraine, and one each in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Belorussia and Latvia. At the urge of the Latvian government, the radar located on its territory was dismantled, thus baring the north-western direction of potential missile attack. According to the agreement with the countries of the Commonwealth, the remaining radars stay in operation for the common good of all involved. The north-western direction will be covered by the radar which is now being built near Baranovichi, Belorussia. The issue of the status of the Gabalinsk radar in Azerbaijan, the crew of which has to operate under complex conditions, remains unsettled. In addition to the above, Ukraine and Azerbaijan are part of GUUAM3, whose members often diverge from Russia in their opinion on security issues. Therefore, one cannot rule out the impossibility of Russia's using radars located in Ukraine and Azerbaijan. We should acknowledge that the operational reliability of a branched-out early warning system is inferior to that of the single early missile warning system of the former U.S.S.R. An indirect proof can be found in the incident involving an accidental destruction of the Russian passenger airliner with an S-200 antiaircraft missile fired during a drill in October of 2001 by the Ukrainian Air Defense Forces. This demonstrated the deterioration and lack of reliability of a number of EWS-related components of the Ukrainian armed forces. The situation is further aggravated by the fact that the Russian EWS space complex has been seriously weakened in the recent years due to economic hardships suffered by the nation, and is currently operating in its abbreviated configuration. All of the above lowers the degree of assuredness of the failure-free operation of the Russian EWS, thus dictating the necessity to abandon the concept of launching nuclear missiles &quot;on warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
It almost happened in 1995 – and now Russia’s warning radar has deteriorated further increasing the chance of a mistake<br />

<br />
<br />
This is not just a hypothetical problem. In 1995, Russia’s early-warning system indicated  a possible U.S. missile attack. Russia’s radars  apparently could not rule out the possibility that a nearby rocket launch was a U.S. nuclear-armed missile fired from a submarine in the Norwegian Sea. This triggered Russia’s emergency nuclear deci- sion process, and the alarm traveled all the way up the chain of command to President Boris Yeltsin, activating his nuclear suitcase, which would be used to authorize nuclear retaliation. About eight minutes into the rocket launch, the operators of Russia’s warning radars reported that the rocket did not threaten Russia, and the alarm was canceled. In fact, the launch was a scientific research rocket fired from Norway. The safe outcome of this false alarm is scant consolation. The mere fact that a peaceful scientific rocket could trigger an emergency launch procedure in Russia points to a real danger. And Russia’s com- mand and early-warning systems have deteriorated since then: it now has only three early-warning  satellites rather than nine. The next time Russia interprets a benign event as a potential nuclear attack, it is not clear that it will have enough infor- mation to decide that it can afford to wait. A false alarm involving a single rocket or a small number  of incoming warheads presumably would not pre- cipitate a Russian decision to launch. However, a false alarm (resulting from, for example, a computer  malfunction) could also create the impression of a massive U.S. attack, in which case Russia may be less willing to wait before launching a counterattack.<br />

<br />
Do you know about this? On Nov. 22, Thanksgiving Day, 2007, two U.S. jets were scrambled from the 90th Fighter Squadron at Elmendorf Air Force Baset in Alaska to intercept two Russian long-range &quot;strategic&quot; bombers (strategic being a euphemism for nuclear-capable) in the skies over the Aleutian Islands as the bombers approached Alaskan air space. The U.S. F-22 jets monitored the Russian Bear H bombers at close range for a few minutes before the bombers turned back. This encounter was one of the consequences of Vladimir Putin's decision, announced last August, to resume regular &quot;strategic flights&quot; of its nuclear bombers. Most reports said that the bombers were not carrying nukes, that the flights were ostensibly for &quot;training&quot; and &quot;readiness&quot; purposes, although nuclear armed missions were not explicitly ruled out. And probing the state of U.S. and NATO warning and defense systems and reminding the world of Russia's superpower status may have been on the agenda as well.  The Thanksgiving Day encounter was not an isolated incident. While the resumption of &quot;strategic flights&quot; was fairly widely reported, the number and frequency of such subsequent intercept &quot;incidents&quot; have not been. A Canadian air force major who spoke to me from North American Aerospace Defense Command headquarters in the hollowed-out core of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, the central node in the U.S. nuclear-attack warning system, confirmed the details of the Aleutian incident and said there have been at least 17 such incidents in NORAD's U.S. and Canadian sphere of operations since August.   In each case, the U.S. jets were scrambled to intercept, he said, because the Russian bombers refused to file a flight plan and just showed up out of the blue approaching NORAD-patrolled airspace.  The Aleutian encounter first came to my attention in a relatively obscure U.K. military trade magazine called Air Forces Monthly, which also reported similar incidents involving NATO jets and Russian strategic bombers over the Atlantic and Arctic seas and cited a Russian major general saying, &quot;NATO jets approached at what he considered could be potentially dangerous distances—within 16-25 feet ... wingtip-to-wingtip&quot; and concluding that &quot;the fact no emergency situation had arisen ... was a testament to the flying skills of both sides.&quot;  And one of the few mainstream press stories on this subject, in the Denver Post, contained this disquieting quote: While odds are low that these increasing Russian forays will cause a catastrophe, &quot;there's more of a risk of something accidental of happening,&quot; Joint Chiefs Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said. Something accidental happening? The odds of &quot;catastrophe&quot; may be low, but how low? And can they be lowered? I've touched on the largely unexamined risks of accidental nuclear war before, but now that we know U.S. and NATO jets are buzzing Russian strategic bombers, raising concerns about &quot;dangerous situations&quot; and &quot;catastrophe,&quot; I think it's important to press the question now when both political parties are writing their platforms. Let's challenge both presidential nominees to place the problem of reducing the risk of accidental nuclear war on their agendas. Because while &quot;the odds are low,&quot; the costs of a catastrophe would be unimaginably high. In my last column on this subject, I suggested it was time for both the United States and Russia to publicly define and defend their warning and launch procedures. I've now come upon a persuasive set of concrete, achievable steps both countries can take to lower the risk of an accidental launch. These steps would extend the all-too-brief window we now have to evaluate attack warnings, the better to distinguish &quot;false positives&quot; from the real thing. And thus extend the time the presidents of both nuclear superpowers have to decide how to respond. Our current warning decision procedures—both U.S. and Russian—make our nuclear arsenals all too vulnerable to accidental or unauthorized launch. To inadvertence, as the nuclear euphemism has it.  It's time to avert &quot;inadvertence.&quot;  Not long after I read about the U.S. fighter jet intercept of Russian bombers, I took myself down to Washington to talk to Bruce G. Blair, president of the World Security Institute, a D.C. think tank, and perhaps the world's leading expert on both the U.S. and the former Soviet Union's nuclear warning and launch postures, their &quot;command and control&quot; systems. It turns out he'd recently delivered a paper on &quot;de-alerting&quot;—steps that could be taken to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war—at an Oslo conference, and they merit close attention by whomever will be in charge of these matters in the next administration. For the most part, his proposals are neither hawkish nor dovey. They're just smart. And urgent.  Bruce Blair is the former minuteman missile crewman and Brookings nuclear systems savant who published a study called &quot;Strategic Command and Control&quot; in the mid-'80s. Its analysis of the flaws in our systems attracted the attention of both the Russians, who would later consult with him in the post-Soviet era, and the U.S. Congress, which got him highly classified access to U.S. warning and launch systems to delve further into the flaws. His Congressional Record testimony is the closest unclassified look at the workings of the nuclear attack launch and warning systems we have. It reveals how poorly and patchily thought-out these systems were. According to Blair, the systems in place now have not been much improved. Blair has long been arguing that the two nuclear superpowers' post-Cold War detargeting is merely &quot;cosmetic.&quot; He contends that the original target coordinates are still in the missile memory system and could easily be retargeted in moments via computer.  In addition, Blair has long warned that some of the current warning-and-launch protocols leave almost no time for the president and the nuclear chain of command to adequately evaluate whether a warning signal is a false positive or a serious threat. His Oslo proposals have two key objectives: true de-targeting, and extending the time we have to evaluate warnings.  Of course we all think the days when we have to be concerned about such things are gone. The United States and the former Soviet Union, though still geopolitical rivals, are no longer locked in the ideological death struggle that entailed a nuclear &quot;balance of terror,&quot; the threat of &quot;mutually assured destruction,&quot; to keep both from inflicting nuclear war on the planet. But the chance of accident remains (there were two extremely close calls and many lesser ones during the Cold War), and the danger of accident or misinterpretation of innocent artifacts on the radar or satellite screens grows greater when the tensions between the superpowers begin to ratchet up again. As they have, alas, recently but unmistakably.<br />
<br />
Accidental War 1AC<br />
<br />
Third, cyber terror<br />
<br />
Blair 8 (Bruce, president of the World Security Institute and former senior fellow in foreign policy for the Brookings Institute, “Increasing Warning and Decision Time,” Presented at Achieving the Vision of a World Free of Nuclear Weapons, an International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament held in Oslo, February 26-27)<br />
<br />
There are a host of reasons why removing the hair-trigger on their missiles is an urgent priority.  Beyond the familiar arguments about the inherent danger of accidental and unauthorized nuclear attack lurk shadowy new threats such as cybernetic threats to the nuclear command and warning systems.  The nuclear command systems today operate in an intense information battleground on which more than 20 nations including Russia, China, and North Korea have developed dedicated computer attack programs.4  These programs deploy viruses to disable, confuse, and delay nuclear command and warning processes in other nations.  At the brink of conflict, nuclear command and warning networks around the world may be besieged by electronic intruders whose onslaught degrades the coherence and rationality of nuclear decision-making.  The potential for perverse consequences with computer-launched weapons on hair-trigger is clear. Other information warfare programs are designed to infiltrate and collect information on, for example, the schedule of the movement of nuclear warheads during peacetime.   Hacking operations of these sorts are increasing exponentially as the militaries of the world increasingly depend on computer and communications networks.  The number of attempts by outside hostile actors to break into Defense Department networks has surged by 10-fold in the past couple of years.  Hostile intrusion attempts against Pentagon computer systems now run in the neighborhood of 1,000 per day.  (China is especially active.) Among the possible terrorist threats posed by cyber-attack: terrorists could spoof early warning sensors and generate false alarms that precipitate nuclear overreactions; or terrorists may get inside the command and communications networks controlling nuclear forces.  They might gain information useful to interdicting and capturing weapons, or unauthorized actors might even discover ways to inject messages into the circuits.5    Clearly, keeping nuclear forces ready to fly instantaneously upon receipt of a short stream of computer signals carries real risk. The simple fact that maintaining war-ready nuclear postures requires many hundreds of nuclear bombs to be moving around on alert or going back and for the between the field and bomb refurbishment facilities means that they are exposed to capture or theft during the most vulnerable phase of their operating cycle: transportation, the Achilles Heel of security.  As long as traditional deterrent practices continue, it will be impossible to truly ‘lock down’ the arsenals to protect them from theft.<br />
<br />
(footnote 5)<br />
<br />
5 An especially noteworthy example is the discovery by the commission of an unprotected electronic backdoor into the naval broadcast communications network used to transmit launch orders by radio to the U.S. Trident deterrent submarine fleet. Unauthorized persons including terrorists may have been able to seize electronic control of shore-based radio transmitters such as the very low frequency facility at Cutler Maine, and actually inject a launch order into the network. The deficiency was taken so seriously that new launch order validation protocols had to be devised and Trident crews had to undergo special training to learn them.<br />
<br />
Fourth, command and control failures<br />

<br />
The development of the military command system software is especially difficult, particularly from the point of view of the corresponding degree of reliability. The abundance and complexity of functional relations, the multitude and unpredictability of potential combat situations, as well as active counteraction on the part of the adversary highly complicate the structure and the volume of software programs. As the world experience demonstrates, even the most qualified of programmers are not fully warranted against bad mistakes. According to Holstead's theory, for large software programs the number of errors grows in proportion to their length logarithm (i.e. the number of lines of the programming code), thus making the idea of developing an error-free complex combat system command and control software program quite dubious. What all of the above means is that relying on such computerized systems can lead to tragic consequences due to their intrinsic lack of reliability To prove the above statement, a single example would suffice. During the conflict between Great Britain and Argentina over Falkland Islands (Islas Malvin), one of the best ships of the British fleet went down, the Sheffield destroyer, equipped with a state-of-the-art computerized air defense system. The investigation into the reasons of its demise revealed that during the development of the software program for the control of the ship's air defense system, the British programmers overlooked the recent addition to the Argentinian fleet of the French Exocet anti-ship missile. This particular missile is included in the arsenal of the NATO countries, and as such was registered as a &quot;friendly type&quot; missile in the air defense system control software of the British destroyer. As a result of this error, when the missile approached the ship, the devices for radio countering and destruction of airborne targets were not activated. The missile went through the air defense zone with no obstruction and with a direct hit sent the destroyer to the bottom of the ocean. Over the decades of the Cold War, the military command of Russia had developed a strictly centralized (even more so than its U.S. counterpart, as some of the U.S. military experts admit) nuclear forces command and control system, with multiple redundancies. The high degree of reliability of this system has never been doubted. However, in recent years, the situation has become somewhat more complex in this area. First and foremost this has to do with the reduced amount of financing available for maintaining the technical reliability of the data gathering and surveillance systems and combat command and control systems - a development which gives experts grounds for serious concern. Former Minister of Defense of Russia Igor Rodionov admitted to that effect by saying, &quot;if lack of financial resources persists,... Russia could soon approach a threshold beyond which missiles and nuclear systems become unmanageable.&quot; This state of affairs is a cause of great concern for the new Russian leadership. In particular, this was reflected in the program for the construction and development of the Russian Federation Armed Forces up to the year 2005, which, among other things, is focused on the task of maintaining and improving combat command, control and communications system. Extending launch preparation time appears to be the best solution to the problem of potential errors or false interpretation of EWS data.<br />

<br />
Even if accidental war doesn’t kill us, an unauthorized launch will – lack of morale in Russia guarantees it<br />

<br />
<br />
In addition to these many technical difficulties, Russia's nuclear weapons establishment suffers from a host of human and organizational problems. Crews receive less training than they did formerly and are consequently less proficient in the safe handling of nuclear weapons. And despite President Yeltsin's promises to improve conditions, endemic housing and food shortages have led to demoralization and disaffection within the elite Strategic Rocket Forces, the strategic submarine fleet and the custodians of Russia's stock-piles of nuclear warheads. As a result, the likelihood increases that desperate low-level commanders might disregard safety rules or, worse still, that they might take unauthorized control of nuclear weapons--something a deteriorating central command might be unable to prevent or counter. Although most Russian launch crews would need to receive special codes held by the General Staff before they could fire their missiles, one recent CIA report warned that some submarine crews may be able to launch the ballistic missiles on board their vessels without having to obtain such information first.  Even at the top, control over nuclear weapons could splinter along various political fault lines. Relations between politicians and military leaders in Russia are strained, and physical control of the launch codes remains in the hands of the military. Thus, the authority to fire ballistic missiles could be usurped by military commanders during an internal crisis. In fact, during the August 1991 coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, top-level allegiances suddenly shifted, and the normal chain of command for Russia's nuclear weapons was broken. For three days, the power to launch nuclear weapons rested in the hands of Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov and the chief of the General Staff, Mikhail Moiseyev. Given the dire conditions in Russia, something similar could happen again. <br />

Nuclear deterrence is already failing – de-alerting avoids the apocalypse<br />

News Blaze 9 (<strong>Qualifications for Organizations Below</strong> “Organizations Worldwide Urge Obama, Medvedev: Take Weapons Off Alert,” July 6, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://newsblaze.com/story/20090706130809zzzz.nb/topstory.html" rel="nofollow">http://newsblaze.com/story/20090706130809zzzz.nb/topstory.html</a>) <br />
<br />
In a letter faxed last week to Presidents Obama and Medvedev, nuclear disarmament organisations worldwide have urged Russia and the US to negotiate to lower the state of operational readiness of their nuclear weapons systems. Presidents Obama and Medvedev are due to meet on Monday 6 to 8th July.  The letter was coordinated by PND Nuclear Flashpoints John Hallam, who together with the Association of World Citizens Doug Mattern, and nuclear weapons expert Steven Starr, coordinated an appeal by 44 nobel prizewinners that resulted in resolutions in the UN General Assembly in 2007 and 2008 calling for nuclear weapons to be taken off quick - launch status. (Mr Steven Starr, now scientific adviser to Physicians for Social Responsibility will be speaking on Hiroshima Day (6Aug) in Sydney)  According to Mr Hallam: &quot;When Presidents Obama and Medvedev meet on Monday, President Obama will have an opportunity to make good on his election promise to negotiate with Russia to take US and Russian nuclear weapons off high - alert, a step that will quite literally 'take the apocalypse off the agenda'. There are still roughly 2000 nuclear weapons in the 23,000 nuclear weapons still held by the US and Russia, that are able to be launched in less than two minutes. The launch of these weapons would, still, terminate civilisation and possibly end the human race. High-level bodies from the 1996 Canberra Commission to the 2006 Blix Commission, and more recently the editorials by Henry Kissinger and others have recommended that nuclear weapons be removed from a status in which they can be quickly launched. Obama has promised to do so. Now is a good time to make good on that promise.&quot;  The letter has been signed by major disarmament organisations and parliamentarians worldwide, starting with the Mayor of Hiroshima on behalf of Mayors for Peace representing over 3000 cities and towns worldwide, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (1985 nobel peace prize recipient), International Peace Bureau, the Association of World Citizens, the World Federation of United Nations Associations, the International Association of Peace Messenger Cities, and the vice-resident of the European Parliament, MEP Luisa Morgantini.  LETTER BY ORGANISATIONS WORLDWIDE TO OBAMA, MEDVEDEV, PUTIN, BIDEN, LAVROV AND CLINTON ON OPERATING STATUS OF NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEMS  PRESIDENT BARACK HUSEIN OBAMA VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR, PRESIDENT MEDVEDEV PRIME MINISTER VLADIMIR PUTIN FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEI LAVROV SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON US SENATE COMMITTEES ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND ARMED SERVICES, RUSSIAN DUMA COMMITTEES ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE,  RE: OPERATIONAL READINESS OF NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEMS  Dear Presidents Obama and Medvedev, Vice-President Joseph Biden, Prime Minister Putin, Secretary of State Clinton, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and Congressional and Duma Committees on Foreign Affairs and Defense/Armed Services:  The authors of this letter write also as the joint coordinators of an appeal to lower nuclear weapons operating status/operational readiness that was signed by 44 Nobel Prize - winners and which helped lead to resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly in October 2007 and 2008. (see appendix for UN Resolutions)  This letter is signed by NGOs and distinguished individuals from around the world who believe that nuclear disarmament is a matter of urgency, and that taking nuclear weapons off quick-launch capability is a vital first step toward nuclear disarmament.  We suggest that the current negotiations between the US and Russia over a successor to START be also used as forum in which the US and Russia negotiate an agreement to cease maintaining their large nuclear forces in quick-launch status.  We are very much encouraged by the repeated committments made by President Obama to negotiate with Russia to lower the operational status of nuclear weapons systems, as well as by the statements to that effect to which Dr. Henry Kissinger has lent his name, as well as by his involvement in a successor to START.  The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, in a September, 2008 article entitled 'Avoiding Human Extinction', placed the lowering of the operational status of nuclear weapon systems, reductions in warhead numbers, and the complete abolition of nuclear weapons at the top of a list of measures needed to protect humankind, ahead even of climate change mitigation measures and monitoring of large incoming asteroids.  U.S. scientists now predict, with a high level of certainty, that: (1) the detonation in urban areas of as little as a half of one percent of the explosive power contained in U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals could cause major disruptions in global climate leading to the starvation of hundreds of millions of the already hungry, and; (2) A war fought with even a few thousand strategic nuclear weapons, such as the U.S.-Russian weapons now maintained at high-alert status, would cause such cataclysmic changes in global climate and environment that growing seasons would be completely eliminated for years, thus dooming most of humanity to perish from famine. It is unrealistic to assume that nuclear deterrence will work perfectly forever. With the passage of time, the use of nuclear weaponry, due to madness, malice, miscalculation, or malfunction becomes an inevitability. Thus it is imperative that as a first step towards reducing and eliminating the immense danger these weapons pose to all nations and peoples, that the U.S. and Russia agree to remove their nuclear weapons from high-alert status.<br />
<br />
We urge the US and Russian governments, Presidents Obama and Medvedev, Secretary of State Clinton and Foreign Minister Ivanov, to use the opportunity of the renegotiation/replacement of START to negotiate to immediately lower the operational readiness of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapon systems. This single act will do more than any other immediately available measure to make humanity and civilisation secure in accordance with our shared objective of progress towards the abolition of nuclear weapons.<br />

<br />
In 1983, discussion of human extinction re-emerged when Carl Sagan and others calculated that a global thermonuclear war could generate enough atmospheric debris to kill much of the planet's plant life and, with it, humanity. While the &quot;nuclear winter&quot; theory fell out of favor in the 1990s, recent climate models suggest that the original calculations actually underestimated the catastrophic effects of thermonuclear war. Moreover, the original model of Sagan and his collaborators supported research showing that supervolcanic eruptions and asteroid or comet impacts could pose comparable extinction risks.  Despite these notable instances, in the 61 years since the Doomsday Clock's creation, the risk of human extinction has received relatively scant scientific attention, with a bibliography filling perhaps one page. Maybe this is because human extinction seems to most of us impossible, inevitable, or, in either case, beyond our control. Still, it's surprising that a topic of primary significance to humanity has provoked so little serious research.  One of the missions of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University is to expand scholarly analysis of extinction risks by studying extinction-level hazards, their relative probabilities, and strategies for mitigation. In July 2008, the institute organized a meeting on these subjects, drawing experts from physics, biology, philosophy, economics, law, and public policy.  The facts are sobering. More than 99.9 percent of species that have ever existed on Earth have gone extinct. Over the long run, it seems likely that humanity will meet the same fate. In less than a billion years, the increased intensity of the Sun will initiate a wet greenhouse effect, even without any human interference, making Earth inhospitable to life. A couple of billion years later Earth will be destroyed, when it's engulfed by our Sun as it expands into a red-giant star. If we colonize space, we could survive longer than our planet, but as mammalian species survive, on average, only two million years, we should consider ourselves very lucky if we make it to one billion.  Humanity could be extinguished as early as this century by succumbing to natural hazards, such as an extinction-level asteroid or comet impact, supervolcanic eruption, global methane-hydrate release, or nearby supernova or gamma-ray burst. (Perhaps the most probable of these hazards, supervolcanism, was discovered only in the last 25 years, suggesting that other natural hazards may remain unrecognized.) Fortunately the probability of any one of these events killing off our species is very low--less than one in 100 million per year, given what we know about their past frequency. But as improbable as these events are, measures to reduce their probability can still be worthwhile. For instance, investments in asteroid detection and deflection technologies cost less, per life saved, than most investments in medicine. While an extinction-level asteroid impact is very unlikely, its improbability is outweighed by its potential death toll.  The risks from anthropogenic hazards appear at present larger than those from natural ones. Although great progress has been made in reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world, humanity is still threatened by the possibility of a global thermonuclear war and a resulting nuclear winter. We may face even greater risks from emerging technologies. Advances in synthetic biology might make it possible to engineer pathogens capable of extinction-level pandemics. The knowledge, equipment, and materials needed to engineer pathogens are more accessible than those needed to build nuclear weapons. And unlike other weapons, pathogens are self-replicating, allowing a small arsenal to become exponentially destructive. Pathogens have been implicated in the extinctions of many wild species. Although most pandemics &quot;fade out&quot; by reducing the density of susceptible populations, pathogens with wide host ranges in multiple species can reach even isolated individuals. The intentional or unintentional release of engineered pathogens with high transmissibility, latency, and lethality might be capable of causing human extinction. While such an event seems unlikely today, the likelihood may increase as biotechnologies continue to improve at a rate rivaling Moore's Law.  Farther out in time are technologies that remain theoretical but might be developed this century. Molecular nanotechnology could allow the creation of self-replicating machines capable of destroying the ecosystem. And advances in neuroscience and computation might enable improvements in cognition that accelerate the invention of new weapons. A survey at the Oxford conference found that concerns about human extinction were dominated by fears that new technologies would be misused. These emerging threats are especially challenging as they could become dangerous more quickly than past technologies, outpacing society's ability to control them. As H.G. Wells noted, &quot;Human history becomes more and more a race between education and catastrophe.&quot;  Such remote risks may seem academic in a world plagued by immediate problems, such as global poverty, HIV, and climate change. But as intimidating as these problems are, they do not threaten human existence. In discussing the risk of nuclear winter, Carl Sagan emphasized the astronomical toll of human extinction:  A nuclear war imperils all of our descendants, for as long as there will be humans. Even if the population remains static, with an average lifetime of the order of 100 years, over a typical time period for the biological evolution of a successful species (roughly ten million years), we are talking about some 500 trillion people yet to come. By this criterion, the stakes are one million times greater for extinction than for the more modest nuclear wars that kill &quot;only&quot; hundreds of millions of people. There are many other possible measures of the potential loss--including culture and science, the evolutionary history of the planet, and the significance of the lives of all of our ancestors who contributed to the future of their descendants. Extinction is the undoing of the human enterprise.  There is a discontinuity between risks that threaten 10 percent or even 99 percent of humanity and those that threaten 100 percent. For disasters killing less than all humanity, there is a good chance that the species could recover. If we value future human generations, then reducing extinction risks should dominate our considerations. Fortunately, most measures to reduce these risks also improve global security against a range of lesser catastrophes, and thus deserve support regardless of how much one worries about extinction. These measures include: Removing nuclear weapons from hair-trigger alert and further reducing their numbers. * Placing safeguards on gene synthesis equipment to prevent synthesis of select pathogens; * Improving our ability to respond to infectious diseases, including rapid disease surveillance, diagnosis, and control, as well as accelerated drug development; * Funding research on asteroid detection and deflection, &quot;hot spot&quot; eruptions, methane hydrate deposits, and other catastrophic natural hazards; * Monitoring developments in key disruptive technologies, such as nanotechnology and computational neuroscience, and developing international policies to reduce the risk of catastrophic accidents. <br />

Accidental War 1AC<br />

<br />
And, even if they mitigate the impact of the initial strike, Russia has a doomsday machine – any accidental strike guarantees nuclear retaliation and the end of life<br />
<br />
Rosenbaum 7 – Staff Writer for Slate (Ron, 8/31, “The Return of the Doomsday Machine?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2191104/pagenum/all/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2191104/pagenum/all/</a>) <br />
<br />
In Strangelove, the doomsday machine was a Soviet system that automatically detonated some 50 cobalt-jacketed hydrogen bombs pre-positioned around the planet if the doomsday system's sensors detected a nuclear attack on Russian soil. Thus, even an accidental or (as in Strangelove) an unauthorized U.S. nuclear bomb could set off the doomsday machine bombs, releasing enough deadly cobalt fallout to make the Earth uninhabitable for the human species for 93 years. No human hand could stop the fully automated apocalypse An extreme fantasy, yes. But according to a new book called Doomsday Men and several papers on the subject by U.S. analysts, it may not have been merely a fantasy. According to these accounts, the Soviets built and activated a variation of a doomsday machine in the mid-'80s. And there is no evidence Putin's Russia has deactivated the system. Instead, something was reactivated in Russia last week. I'm referring to the ominous announcement—given insufficient attention by most U.S. media (the Economist made it the opening of a lead editorial on Putin's Russia)—by Vladimir Putin that Russia has resumed regular &quot;strategic flights&quot; of nuclear bombers. (They may or may not be carrying nuclear bombs, but you can practically hear Putin's smirking tone as he says, &quot;Our [nuclear bomber] pilots have been grounded for too long. They are happy to start a new life.&quot;) These twin developments raise a troubling question: What are the United States' and Russia's current nuclear policies with regard to how and when they will respond to a perceived nuclear attack? In most accounts, once the president or Russian premier receives radar warning of an attack, they have less than 15 minutes to decide whether the warning is valid. The pressure is on to &quot;use it or lose it&quot;—launch our missiles before they can be destroyed in their silos. Pressure that makes the wrong decision more likely. Pressure that makes accidental nuclear war a real possibility. Once you start to poke into this matter, you discover a disturbing level of uncertainty, which leads me to believe we should be demanding that the United States and Russia define and defend their nuclear postures. Bush and Putin should be compelled to tell us just what &quot;failsafe&quot; provisions are installed on their respective nuclear bombers, missiles, and submarines—what the current provisions against warning malfunctions are and what kinds of controls there are over the ability of lone madman nuclear bombers to bring on the unhappy end of history. As for the former Soviet Union, the possible existence of a version of a doomsday machine is both relevant and disturbing.  In the Strangelove film, the Soviet ambassador tells the president and generals in the U.S. war room that the device was designed to deter a surprise attack, the kind of attack that might otherwise prevent retaliation by &quot;decapitating&quot; the Soviet command structure. The automated system would insure massive world-destroying retaliation even if the entire Soviet leadership were wiped out—or had second thoughts. As a result, some referred to it as the &quot;dead hand&quot; doomsday device.  It is Dr. Strangelove himself, the madman U.S. nuclear strategist played by Peter Sellers, who detects the flaw in this plan. After being apprised of the system's existence by the Soviet ambassador, and the likelihood of its being triggered by a U.S. bomber on an unauthorized mission to nuke its Soviet target, Dr. Strangelove exclaims:  Yes, but the ... whole point of the doomsday machine ... is lost ... if you keep it a secret! Why didn't you tell the world, eh? In other words, a doomsday machine kept secret is no good for deterrence, only for retaliation by extinction.  Did the Soviets actually design a variation on a doomsday device and not tell us about it? And could an accidental or terrorist nuclear attack on Putin's Russia (by Chechens, for instance) trigger an antiquated automated dead-hand system and launch missiles capable of killing tens, maybe hundreds, of millions at unknown targets that might include the United States?  But on that day I came upon a startling essay in the London Times Literary Supplement. It was a review (titled &quot;Deadly Devices&quot;) of a book recently published in the United Kingdom: Doomsday Men: The Real Dr. Strangelove and the Dream of the Superweapon by nuclear-age historian P.D. Smith of University College London. (It will be out in the United States in December.) The TLS reviewer, Christopher Coker (who is on the faculty of the London School of Economics), asserted that the book demonstrates that &quot;only after the Berlin Wall had been breached and ... the Cold War began to thaw did military analysts realize the Russians had actually built a version of the [doomsday] device. The details of this top-secret Soviet system were first revealed in 1993 by Bruce G. Blair, a former American ICBM launch control officer, now one of the country's foremost experts on Russian arms. Fearing that a sneak attack by American submarine-launched missiles might take Moscow out in 13 minutes, the Soviet leadership had authorized the construction of an automated communication network, reinforced to withstand a nuclear strike. At its heart was a computer system similar to the one in Dr. Strangelove. Its code name was Perimetr. It went fully operational in January 1985. It is still in place<br />

Additionally, de-alerting would immediately reduce the risk of a nuclear terrorist attack – current initiatives are insufficient and increase the vulnerabilities inherent in both the US and Russia<br />

To its credit, the Bush administration has finally launched an ambitious initiative to better secure nuclear and radiological materials, particularly in violence-racked Russia. But unless the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, which was introduced in May, becomes part of a far more comprehensive approach to the challenges of nuclear theft and terrorism, it is destined to fall well short of its goal of safeguarding the American people from the threat of nuclear weapons.  The initiative builds on the bilateral nonproliferation efforts of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, a U.S. government-funded, post-Cold War effort that focused on securing Russia's nuclear arsenal. The new, expanded cooperative effort seeks to collect weapons-grade plutonium and enriched uranium that could be used in nuclear bombs from dozens of additional countries, and to lock them down in secure facilities.  But with U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear forces still on hair-trigger alert, we need to recognize that present policies for reducing the risk of nuclear strikes against the United States by terrorists or rogue countries are inconsistent and self-defeating. On the one hand, in the name of deterrence, U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear forces both comply with their presidents' instructions to be constantly prepared to fight a large-scale nuclear war with each other at a moment's notice. On the other hand, in the name of nonproliferation, the United States and Russia cooperate closely in securing Russia's nuclear weapons against theft.  By keeping thousands of nuclear weapons poised for immediate launch, even under normal peacetime circumstances, the United States projects a powerful deterrent threat at Russia. But at the same time, it causes Russia to retain thousands of weapons in its operational inventory, scattered across that country's vast territory, and to keep them ready for rapid use in large-scale nuclear war with America. And to maintain the reliability of these far-flung weapons, Russia must constantly transport large numbers back and forth between a remanufacturing facility and the dispersed military bases. This perpetual motion creates a serious vulnerability, because transportation is the Achilles' heel of nuclear weapons security.  On any given day, many hundreds of Russian nuclear weapons are moving around the countryside. Nearly 1,000 of them are in some stage of transit or temporary storage awaiting relocation at any time. This constant movement between the far-flung nuclear bases and the remanufacturing facility at Ozersk in the southern Urals stems from the esoteric technical fact that Russian nuclear bombs are highly perishable. In contrast to American bombs, which have a shelf life of more than 30 years, Russian bombs last only eight to 12 years before corrosion and internal decay render them unreliable -- prone to fizzling instead of exploding. At that point, they must be shipped back to the factory for remanufacturing. Every year many hundreds of bombs, perhaps as many as a thousand, roll out of Russia's Mayak factory. The United States turns out fewer than 10 per year. In Russia, the rail and other transportation lines linking the factory to the far-flung nuclear bases across 10 time zones are buzzing with nuclear activity and provide fertile ground for terrorist interception. Keeping a small strategic arsenal consolidated at a limited number of locations close to the Mayak factory would be the ideal security environment for preventing Russian nuclear bombs from falling into terrorist hands. But the ongoing nuclear dynamic between the former Cold War foes creates the opposite environment, which undercuts security. Russian nuclear commanders, confronted with U.S. submarines lurking off their coasts with 10-minute missile-flight times to Moscow and thousands of launch-ready U.S. warheads on land- and sea-based missiles aimed at thousands of targets in Russia, are compelled to match the American posture in numbers, alert status and geographic dispersal. U.S. leaders must decide which goal takes precedence: sustaining the Cold War legacy of massive arsenals to deter a massive surprise nuclear attack, or shoring up the security of Russian nuclear weapons to prevent terrorists from grabbing them (or corrupt guards from stealing and selling them).  And terrorists grabbing such a weapon as it shuttles between deployment fields and factories is not the worst-case scenario stemming from this nuclear gamesmanship. The theft of a nuclear bomb could spell eventual disaster for an American city, but the seizure of a ready-to-fire strategic long-range nuclear missile or group of missiles capable of delivering bombs to targets thousands of miles away could be apocalyptic for entire nations.  If scores of armed Chechen rebels were able to slip into the heart of Moscow and hold a packed theater hostage for days, as they did in 2002, might it not be possible for terrorists to infiltrate missile fields in rural Russia and seize control of a nuclear-armed mobile rocket roaming the countryside? It's an open question that warrants candid bilateral discussion of the prospects of terrorists capturing rockets and circumventing the safeguards designed to foil their illicit firing, especially since the 9/11 commission report revealed that al Queda plotters considered this very idea.  Another specter concerns terrorists &quot;spoofing&quot; radar or satellite sensors or cyber-terrorists hacking into early warning networks. By either firing short-range missiles that fool warning sensors into reporting an attack by longer-range missiles, or feeding false data into warning computer networks, could sophisticated terrorists generate false indications of an enemy attack that results in a mistaken launch of nuclear rockets in &quot;retaliation?&quot; False alarms have been frequent enough on both sides under the best of conditions. False warning poses an acute danger as long as Russian and U.S. nuclear commanders are given, as they still are today, only several pressure-packed minutes to determine whether an enemy attack is underway and to decide whether to retaliate. Russia's deteriorating early-warning network, coupled with terrorist plotting against it, only heightens the dangers.  Russia is not the only crucible of risk.  The early-warning and control problems plaguing Pakistan, India and other nuclear proliferators are even more acute. As these nations move toward hair-trigger stances for their nuclear missiles, the terrorist threat to them will grow in parallel.  Even the U.S. nuclear control apparatus is far from fool-proof. For example, a Pentagon investigation of nuclear safeguards conducted several years ago made a startling discovery -- terrorist hackers might be able to gain back-door electronic access to the U.S. naval communications network, seize control electronically of radio towers such as the one in Cutler, Maine, and illicitly transmit a launch order to U.S. Trident ballistic missile submarines armed with 200 nuclear warheads apiece. This exposure was deemed so serious that Trident launch crews had to be given new instructions for confirming the validity of any launch order they receive. They would now reject certain types of firing orders that previously would have been carried out immediately.  Both countries are running terrorist risks of this sort for the sake of an obsolete deterrent strategy. The notion that either the United States or Russia would deliberately attack the other with nuclear weapons is ludicrous, while the danger that terrorists are plotting to get their hands on these arsenals is real. We need to kick our old habits and stand down our hair-trigger forces. Taking U.S. and Russian missiles off of alert would automatically reduce, if not remove, the biggest terrorist threats that stem from keeping thousands of U.S. and Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles fueled, targeted and waiting for a couple of computer signals to fire. They would fly the instant they received these signals, which can be sent with a few keystrokes on a launch console.<br />

Nuclear terrorism could even spark full-scale war between states. Such war could involve the entire spectrum of nuclear-conflict possibilities, ranging from a nuclear attack upon a non-nuclear state to systemwide nuclear war. How might such far-reaching consequences of nuclear terrorism come about? Perhaps the most likely way would involve a terrorist nuclear assault against a state by terrorists hosted in another state. For example, consider the following scenario: Early in the 1990s, Israel and its Arab-state neighbors finally stand ready to conclude a comprehensive, multilateral peace settlement. With a bilateral treaty between Israel and Egypt already many years old, only the interests of the Palestinians—as defined by the PLO—seem to have been left out. On the eve of the proposed signing of the peace agreement, half a dozen crude nuclear explosives in the one-kiloton range detonate in as many Israeli cities. Public grief in Israel over the many thousands dead ands maimed is matched only by the outcry for revenge. In response to the public mood, the government of Israel initiates selected strikes against terrorist strongholds in Lebanon, whereupon Lebanese Shiite forces and Syria retaliate against Israel. Before long, the entire region is ablaze, conflict has escalated to nuclear forms, and all countries in the area have suffered unprecedented destruction. Of course, such a scenario is fraught with the makings of even wider destruction. How would the United States react to the situation in the Middle East? What would be the Soviet response? It is certainly conceivable that a chain reaction of interstate nuclear conflict could ensure, one that would ultimately involve the superpowers or even every nuclear-weapons state on the planet. What, exactly, would this mean? Whether the terms of assessment be statistical or human, the consequences of nuclear war require an entirely new paradigm of death. Only such a paradigm would allow us a proper framework for absorbing the vision of near-total obliteration and the outer limits of human destructiveness. Any nuclear war would have effectively permanent and irreversible consequences. Whatever the actual extent of injuries and fatalities, such a war would entomb the spirit of the entire species in a planetary casket strewn with shorn bodies and imbecile imaginations.<br />

Accidental War 1AC<br />
<br />
Finally, the likelihood of war is quickly decreasing –  all types of conflict can be stopped by conventional forces<br />

<br />
War has greatly diminished over the course of the 1990s and particularly so during the last few years, a remarkable development that has attracted scarcely any notice. Within a very few years there may be no war at all anywhere in the world, quite possibly for the first time in the history of the human race. War is most commonly defined in the social science literature as an armed conflict between governments (in the case of international wars), or between a government and an at least somewhat organized domestic armed group (for civil wars), in which at least 1000 people are killed, or killed yearly, as a direct or fairly direct consequence of the fighting. Using that definition, there are probably only two wars left in the world--the one garnering all the headlines in Iraq and a civil war in Sudan. There are a number of intermittent armed conflicts that could potentially rise above the violence threshold--in Nepal, Israel, Chechnya, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Kashmir, or Nigeria, for example--though most of these seem to be declining in violence. And, of course, new wars could emerge in other countries. In addition, one could apply other, more modest, definitions of war that would push the number above two. But, however defined, war has become a remarkably rare phenomenon. To begin with, certain standard, indeed classic, varieties of war--particularly major war, or wars among developed countries--have become so rare and unlikely that they could well be considered to be obsolescent, if not obsolete. Also, in notable decline, it appears, are international war more generally, conventional civil war, colonial war, and ideological civil war. In understanding this remarkable phenomenon I suggest that sometime in the middle of the last millennium disciplined military and police forces triumphed over essentially criminal ones in Europe and, in the process, gradually brought civil order and the state system to that continent. In result war, previously an almost continuous fact of life there, came under more coherent political control. Then, when people and politicians in the developed world became disillusioned with war--something that happened at the time of the First World War--they increasingly used their control over war to keep it from happening at all, at least in their relations with each other. In this view, the Second World War in Europe becomes a spectacular anachronism, fabricated almost single handedly by history's supreme atavism, Adolf Hitler. Then, over the course of the last half-century, the developed world's war-aversion seems to have become increasingly adopted elsewhere with the result that several other kinds of warfare are becoming increasingly rare as well. Thus, the decline of war, it seems to me, chiefly stems from the way attitudes toward the value and efficacy of war have changed, particularly over the last century, and the key lies in the machinations of idea entrepreneurs, not in wider-ranging social, economic, or technological developments or in the fabrication of institutions, trade, or patterns of interdependence--which often seem to be more nearly a consequence of peace and of rising war aversion than their cause. War, in this view, is merely an idea, an institution, like dueling or slavery that has been grafted onto human existence. It is not a trick of fate, a thunderbolt from hell, a natural calamity, or a desperate plot contrivance dreamed up by some sadistic puppeteer on high. And it seems to me that the institution is in pronounced decline as attitudes toward it have changed, roughly following the pattern by which the ancient and formidable institution of slavery became discredited and then obsolete. With only a few exceptions, there have been two kinds of war since the end of the Cold War. By far the most common have been civil wars, most of them taking place in the poorest countries of the world. Many of these have been labeled &quot;new war,&quot; &quot;ethnic conflict,&quot; or, most grandly, &quot;clashes of civilizations.&quot; But, in fact, most, though not all, are more nearly opportunistic predation waged by packs- -often remarkably small ones--of criminals, bandits, and thugs. They engage in armed conflict either as mercenaries under hire to desperate governments or as independent or semi-independent warlord or brigand bands. To a substantial and perhaps increasing degree, then, warfare has been reduced to its remnants--or dregs--and thugs are the residual combatants. Over the last years, many of these wars--or competitive criminal enterprises--have exhausted themselves, and new ones have failed to arise to take their place. This is not because ethnic, nationalist, civilizational, or religious tensions have diminished--these remain quite pronounced in many areas. Rather the key seems to have been in the rise of competent governments which have increasingly been able to police domestic conflicts rather than exacerbating them as frequently happened in the past. That is, governmental effectiveness, not ethnic tension or other more cosmic concerns, is the key to the existence of much contemporary civil warfare. It follows that the fabrication of capable government is ultimately the most promising method for the long term control, and even potentially for the eradication, of most of the remnants of war. There is some suggestive, but by no means conclusive, evidence that governments are becoming generally more effective even in the poorest areas of the world, and thus that criminal warfare (and criminal regimes) may, like international warfare, be in terminal decline. The other remaining type of war in the post-Cold War era, far less common, includes what might be called &quot;policing wars.&quot; These comprise militarized efforts by developed countries to bring order to the civil conflicts or to topple the thuggish regimes that are, after the apparent demise of international war, the chief remaining sources of deadly human destruction in the world. Experience during the post-Cold War period suggests that this is not usually a terribly formidable task: since thugs tend to be opportunistic and cowardly, they can generally be defeated by an organized, disciplined, and sizeable army. However, developed countries, despite their general consensus on how the post-Cold War world should be ordered, are unlikely systematically to carry out such actions for several reasons. These include a severe aversion to casualties, a fundamental lack of interest, an aversion to long-term policing, the lack of political gain from success, a deeply-held bias against war and aggression, and the misguided, but convenient, assumption that civil conflicts stem from immutable and inexplicable ethnic hatreds that cannot be remedied by well-intentioned outsiders. The record of these ventures has been mixed, but the messy results of the most notable and recent of these--America's war (or debacle) in Iraq--suggest that they are unlikely to become common. The demise of war hardly means, of course, that everything is perfect. Crime and criminal predation will still exist, and so will terrorism which, like crime, can be carried out by individuals or very small groups. And there will certainly be plenty of other problems to worry about--famine, disease, malnutrition, pollution, corruption, poverty, politics, and economic travail. However, a continuing decline in what remains of war, while far from certain, does seem to be an entirely reasonable prospect. If the process continues, war will recede from the human experience.<br />

Barash and Webel 8 (David, Professor of Psychology at the University of Washington, and notable for several books on human aggression, peace studies, and sexual behavior of animals and people; Charles, multidisciplinary Ph.D. in Psychology, Sociology, Political Science, and Philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley, lecturer in the School of Social Welfare at Berkeley, “Has Technology Made War Obsolete,” Peace and Conflict Studies, Vol. 2, pg. 22-3) <br />
<br />
Since the dawn of the nuclear age in 1945, some observers of the global military scene have once again suggested that since war has become unacceptably destructive—to a would-be aggressor and even to a supposed “victor”—the likelihood of war has actually decreased.  Although this line of reasoning may appear somewhat comforting, it is also secretly flawed.  Let us grant that nuclear war, because of its potential for global annihilation, is in a sense its own deterrent.  States possessing nuclear weapons (especially the major superpowers) may well be very cautious in any conflict with other nuclear weapons states.  But at the same time, theories of mutual nuclear deterrence seem to have produced the expectation that because of the seriousness of nuclear war, each side can count on the other to refrain from anything resembling a nuclear provocation, which in turn makes the world yet more “safe for conventional war.” In addition, there is the great danger that in a nuclear confrontation, each side will presume that the other will be deterred by the prospect of annihilation and, therefore, expect the other to back down, while remaining determined to stand firm itself.  Moreover, nuclear weapons carry with them an inherent ambiguity: Since the consequences of using them are so extreme, the threat to do so lacks credibility.  As a result, although technological “progress” in war making has undeniably made war—especially nuclear war-horrifically destructive, it remains uncertain whether such developments have actually made war any less likely.  In fact, it may well be true that a nuclear conflict, detonation, or accident is more, not less, likely in this century than in the previous one.  This is because of the increased likelihood of “accidental” local (or theater) nuclear wars, as well as the likely proliferation of small nuclear devices (possibly deliverable in suitcases) and of “rogue states” and “terrorists” seeking to acquire them.  Perhaps most disturbing of all, the fact remains that human beings, including decision makers, are influenced by many things beyond a cool, rational calculation of their perceived best interests.  Wars have been initiated for many reasons, often including mistaken judgment or faulty information.  And when war takes place, the combatants make use of whatever weapons they have.<br />

High alert status is destroying US-Russian relations – it’s the most important issue, despite outward signs of progress<br />

<br />
At the conclusion of their April 2008 summit, Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin agreed the Cold War was over Regardless of public expressions of friendship, the United States and Russia continue to operate under policies that assume each could authorize a nuclear attack against the other. The failure to end their Cold War nuclear confrontation causes both nations together to maintain a total of at least 2,600 strategic nuclear warheads on high-alert, launch-ready status, whose primary missions remain the destruction of the opposing side’s nuclear forces, industrial infrastructure and civilian/military leaders.<br />
<br />
Most Americans don’t know these weapons exist. They have no idea a single strategic nuclear warhead, when detonated over a city or industrial area, could ignite an enormous firestorm over a total area of 40 to 65 square miles. The vast nuclear arsenals have effectively been hidden from public view and removed from public knowledge, thus making it easy for smiling U.S. and Russian presidents to proclaim &quot;peace in our time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another Cuban missile crisis might be &quot;unthinkable,&quot; but the continued U.S.-Russian nuclear confrontation means it certainly isn’t impossible. Presidential assurances to the contrary, the relations between Washington and Moscow are worse than at any time since the fall of the Soviet Union. And nuclear weapons remain at the heart of U.S.-Russian political disagreements.<br />
<br />
Eleven months before the April 2008 summit, Putin revealed Russian tests of a new ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads were a response to the planned deployment of a new U.S. missile defense system in Eastern Europe. Bush said the U.S. system is designed to intercept Iranian missiles aimed at America. Russia argues Iran has no long-range missiles and is not soon likely to have them - and even if it did have them, the sites for the proposed U.S. radar and interceptors are hundreds of miles north of where they should ideally be located.<br />
<br />
The U.S. system, however, would be in an ideal spot to track European-based Russian nuclear-armed ballistic missiles. X-band radar in the Czech Republic and missile interceptors in Poland are to be located between 800 and 1,000 miles from Moscow. If the situation were reversed, it would be the geographical equivalent of putting Russian missiles on the northern edge of Lake Superior. Russia views the proposed U.S. system as a direct threat to its strategic nuclear weapons and warns it will target its missiles at the Czech and Polish sites where the system is to be based.<br />
<br />
Russian arguments are supported by two respected U.S. physicists, George Lewis and Theodore Postol. They say the U.S. missile defense system would be able to track and engage almost every Russian missile launched toward the United States from Russian sites west of the Urals. The physicists said the only obvious reason for choosing Eastern Europe for a missile defense site is to place U.S. interceptor missiles close to Russia, making it possible for the European-based radar and interceptors to be added as a layer against Russia to the already developing U.S. continental missile defense.<br />
<br />
Russia is also deeply threatened by constant efforts to expand NATO and encircle Russia with U.S. military bases. Despite vehement Russian objections, Bush continues to insist the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia be allowed to join NATO. Should this happen, NATO military forces will be positioned on the borders of Russia. If Ukraine joins NATO and accepts the deployment of U.S. anti-missile defenses on its territory, Russia has threatened to target it with nuclear warheads.<br />
<br />
NATO, which began as an anti-Soviet alliance, is locked in a Cold War mentality that regards Russia as the enemy and keeps nuclear weapons as a primary military option. Four hundred eighty U.S. nuclear bombs (a force larger than the entire deployed nuclear arsenals of France, the United Kingdom, China or Israel) are stored at eight European NATO bases. These forward-based U.S. weapons are intended for use, in accordance with NATO nuclear strike plans, against targets in the Middle East or Russia.<br />
<br />
The Cold War will not really end until the United States and Russia stand down their high-alert, launch-ready nuclear arsenals and finally cease their nuclear confrontation. This surely will not happen as long as the United States continues to push for NATO expansion while ignoring Russian concerns about its proposed European missile defense system.<br />

<br />
Even when dramatic changes occur in the political relations between nuclear states that make them stop seeing each other as adversaries, as with Russia and the United States following the Cold War, these states armed forces, and foremost their nuclear forces, retain the powerful momentum of confrontation and competition. These forces cannot adjust to new cooperative political relations on their own without political and technical efforts that are consistent, well designed, and bilateral. Furthermore, newly emerging adversaries, contingencies, and challenges brought about by nuclear proliferation and various conflicts of national interests may destabilize strategic relations between the former enemies. The result can be increased tensions in their strategic policies, with highly detrimental political, military, and legal arms control consequences.<br />
<br />
For example, the 2002 U.S. decision to test and deploy a strategic ballistic missile defense (BMD) system, allegedly designed to defend the United States from the new countries (that is, .rogue states.) possessing ballistic missiles, and Washington.s withdrawal from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, made Russia place increased reliance on its offensive strategic nuclear force. Thus, Moscow extended the service lives of those of its heavy intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) equipped with multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVs) and even purchased a few dozen MIRV missiles from Ukraine.s stockpile. Also, as reported by President Vladimir Putin, Russia has accelerated development of a new strategic offensive weapon system fitted with a gliding and maneuvering reentry vehicle designed to penetrate .any BMD system.. In keeping with post.Cold War sensitivities no specific opponent has been mentioned, but this new system can only be assumed to be intended to target the United States.<br />
<br />
Russia reacted in a similar way to a new U.S. program of nuclear earth-penetrating warheads allegedly designed to destroy underground bunkers in terrorist-held areas and rogue states. Many Russians believe that this program is directed at Russia.s own hardened sites. As Russia.s defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, said, .Moscow is attentively tracking the developments in the U.S. strategic nuclear force. In particular, we are not indifferent to the U.S. programs of developing mini.nuclear weapons, for each new type of weapon adds up new elements to the general picture of global stability. We are to take it into account in our military planning..1<br />
<br />
Since the end of the Cold War, nuclear deterrence between Russia and the United States has been receding into the background in terms of day-to-day foreign policy and official public relations. Although both countries retain thousands of nuclear warheads, they have ceased to be global rivals and the chances of a deliberate war between them have fallen close to zero.<br />
<br />
Despite serious differences on some issues, such as Yugoslavia (1999), Iraq (2003), Russian domestic politics and their effect on elections in Ukraine (2004), the eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO, 1999 and 2003), and a growing U.S. presence in several of the former Soviet republics, Moscow and Washington are no longer the leaders of two coalitions of states and political-ideological movements that had made bipolarity the global norm in international relations for almost five decades. Their relations, despite continuous ups and downs, friction, disagreements, and mutual recrimination. include numerous and important areas of cooperation. This cooperation has embraced various economic and political spheres, peacekeeping operations, resolution of regional conflicts, nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the struggle against terrorism, joint ground and naval exercises, programs to secure and eliminate stockpiles of nuclear and chemical weapons, safe disposal of nuclear materials and decommissioned nuclear submarines, salvage operations at sea, and joint human space systems.<br />
<br />
Since the early 1990s, the United States and Russia have halved their deployed strategic nuclear forces in terms of nuclear reentry vehicles (warheads) under the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START I), and are expected to reduce them by another 60 percent by 2012 under the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty (SORT). Combined with cuts in both sides. tactical nuclear arms, the reductions will apparently amount to at least 80 percent over the twenty-year period since the early 1990s. But there is also the other side of the coin. Unlike before, the United States, Russia, and some of the other great powers have openly or tacitly rejected the idea of nuclear disarmament as an indispensable, if abstract, condition of general security. Worse yet, as their official doctrines, arms programs, and military budgets indicate, they are dismantling the complex of central nuclear disarmament agreements to keep maximum freedom of action in technical development and plans for combat use of nuclear weapons. For instance, the George W. Bush administration does not consider it worthwhile even to discuss strategic nuclear reduction measures subsequent to SORT, and has rejected both the ABM treaty and the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty of 1996. The administration has apparently also lost interest in the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, as well as universal measures to enhance the effectiveness of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Moreover, Washington is now emphasizing the right to launch preemptive selective nuclear strikes, thereby promoting a doctrine of actual nuclear warfare rather than of traditional nuclear deterrence. A serious program, although not without disputes and setbacks, is now underway in the United States to develop advanced nuclear weapons allegedly designed to destroy hardened bunkers and other installations of rogue countries and terrorists with less fallout and collateral damage.<br />
<br />
This example is being followed by Russia, although with some reservations and a variety of controversial official declarations. After a rather weak resistance, Moscow has resigned itself to the United States. current lack of interest in arms control treaties, and has demonstrated that it cannot oppose Washington effectively at the political, diplomatic, or military-technical levels. Instead, despite scarce funding, Russia unwisely attempts to carry out a .balanced modernization. of all three legs of its nuclear triad (that is, air-, land-, and sea-based systems), shrinks from discussing tactical nuclear weapons, and seeks to make up for its setbacks through the export of nuclear technologies and materials, as well as massive arms sales abroad.<br />
<br />
As early as 1993, democratic Russia officially repudiated the no-first-use commitment made by the totalitarian Soviet Union in 1982. During 2000 and 2001 Moscow reconfirmed that position, and it now says that nuclear weapons play a leading role in ensuring Russian national security. Moscow even acknowledges the possibility of .a selective and limited combat use. of strategic nuclear weapons in order to .de-escalate the aggression. .2 This implies accomplishing specific tasks involved in conducting and terminating nuclear warfare, rather than merely deterring aggression through the capacity to inflict devastating retaliation, as previously claimed by Soviet official military doctrine.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, Great Britain, France, and China are not going to undertake any limitations of their nuclear forces through arms control treaties, alleging that they lag far behind the two major nuclear powers. Indeed, all three are implementing planned long-term modernizations and, in some weapon systems, a build-up of nuclear arsenals.<br />
<br />
Now, as never before, nuclear deterrence looks like the factor most likely to remain a permanent part of international relations, at least until a more devastating or efficient weapon is invented. Moreover, this posture is taken not because of the colossal technical or political difficulties of achieving general and complete nuclear disarmament, but because of the presumably considerable .inherent advantages of nuclear weapons as a means of sustaining national security and civilizing international relations by making nations more responsible. Obviously, the Big Five (United States, Russia, Great Britain, France, and China) openly or tacitly treat nuclear deterrence as an indispensable and legitimate instrument of their security and military policies, even as they claim that other countries have no right to acquire nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Using the traditional Chinese mode of presenting intellectual subject matter (and paying respect to the newly acquired popularity of China.s doctrines and policies among some Western and Russian experts), in this study the research is built around a concept that may be called 3X3X3 (or a cubed triple) package of paradoxes, assertions, and proposals:<br />
<br />
·There are three major paradoxes of post.Cold War nuclear deterrence in the world.<br />
<br />
·There are three principal reasons why nuclear deterrence will not serve great powers. national security, and international<br />
<br />
security, in the long run.<br />
<br />
·There are three main avenues of action to transform mutual nuclear deterrence into a more constructive and reliable model of strategic relations while staying short of .general and complete nuclear disarmament..<br />
<br />
General and complete nuclear disarmament, as noble a goal as it is, seems at present very distant and unrealistic, because it would require immense changes in the way international politics has been conducted and conflicts have been resolved throughout known history. Such changes are clearly far outside the purview of this book.<br />
<br />
As for the cubed triple, we believe that the decade and a half that has elapsed since the end of the Cold War has demonstrated at least three great paradoxes in regard to nuclear weapons. The first is that mutual nuclear deterrence between the United States and the Soviet Union (and now Russia) has quietly outlived the two states global rivalry and confrontation, with which it was closely associated from 1945 to 1991, and<br />
<br />
Continues…<br />
<br />
Relations 1AC<br />
<br />
Continues…<br />
<br />
which continued in its self-perpetuating momentum even after the collapse of one of the main subjects of deterrence.the Soviet superpower. These inexorable dynamics of mutual nuclear deterrence have acquired a growing and negative feedback effect on political relations between former opponents, sustaining a muted though multifarious fear: of the supposed evil intentions of the strategic partner; of inadvertent or accidental nuclear attack; of possible loss of control over nuclear weapons leading to their acquisition by rebel groups or terrorists; of the one’s plans to gain control over the other’s nuclear weapons or to deliver a disarming strike against nuclear sites, all this in the absence of any real political basis for suspecting such horrific scenarios or actions.<br />
<br />
The second paradox is that with the removal of the fear of escalation of any nuclear weapon use to a global catastrophe, the United States, Russia, and some other nuclear weapon states have become much more casual about contemplating initiation of the actual combat use of nuclear weapons in service to specific military missions. Thus, the end of the Cold War has actually lowered, not raised, the nuclear threshold, to say nothing of bringing an end to nuclear warfare planning altogether.<br />
<br />
The third paradox is that with the end of the Cold War, the focus has been on doing away with nuclear arms limitations and reductions, transparency, and confidence building, rather than doing away with nuclear deterrence and eventually the nuclear weapons themselves. The victims of this process (primarily at the initiative of current U.S. policy makers) already include the ABM treaty, START II, and the START III Framework Treaty (an agreement on delineation between strategic and tactical BMD systems), as well as near-term entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, constructive negotiations on the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, and potentially even the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.at least that is how it looks from the results of a disastrous review conference on that treaty in May 2005. The whole structure of nuclear arms control is collapsing, with most dire predictable consequences from the growth of new threats and risks.<br />
<br />
Of the three main reasons why nuclear deterrence should be superseded by some type of constructive strategic relationship between the United States and Russia, and eventually among all nuclear weapon states, the first is nuclear deterrence’s irrelevance to the real threats and challenges of the post-Cold War era. Deterrence remains effective against the least probable or nonexistent threats: nuclear or massive conventional attacks by great powers (and their alliances) against each other. But it does not work against new ‘real and present dangers’ such as nuclear proliferation, international terrorism, ethnic and religious conflicts, drug and arms trafficking, transborder crime, and illegal migration. Whether nuclear disarmament might prevent nuclear proliferation is a highly debatable point. It is certain, however, that nuclear deterrence cannot stop proliferation, and it is quite probable that deterrence encourages further expansion of the ‘nuclear club’.<br />
<br />
The second reason for replacing deterrence with a new strategic relationship is that the relations involved in mutual nuclear deterrence place tangible limitations on the ability of great powers to cooperate genuinely in dealing with new threats and challenges. The degree of cooperation of the Cold War times, when most arms control treaties, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, were concluded, is not enough for the new era. Such endeavors as cooperation between the two states, secret services and special forces, joint counterproliferation policies (for example, Russian participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative, and envisioned actual U.S.-Russian combat operations against terrorists and rogue and failed states), officially initiated joint early warning and BMD systems, much stricter nuclear and missile export control regimes, greater emphasis on securing and accounting for nuclear warheads and nuclear materials (which implies broad transparency and access to each other.s secret sites), verifiable cessation of production of weapons- grade nuclear materials throughout the world, and ambitious Global Partnership projects all require a greater magnitude of trust and cooperation among partner states. But all of these are impossible to imagine while the United States and Russia still aim thousands of nuclear warheads at each other, keep missiles on hair-trigger alert, and modernize nuclear forces to preserve robust retaliatory capabilities against each other. Besides, as mentioned above, the momentum of nuclear deterrence in combination with new threats and missions may destabilize strategic relations among the great powers, further undercutting their ability to think and act together.<br />
<br />
The current crisis over the Iranian nuclear program, despite the apparent similarity of the U.S. and Russian positions, provides a good illustration of this point. Neither the United States nor Russia wants Iran to have uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing capabilities, to say nothing of the potential effect of Teheran.s acquisition of nuclear weapons. However, action in the form of United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran, or a UN resolution calling for the use of military force, is where U.S.-Russian unanimity stops. For the United States, the prospect of eventually being targeted by Iranian nuclear missiles is totally unbearable and warrants all means of prevention. For all conservative Russians, the dire political, economic, and security implications of supporting (even if passively) UN sanctions or U.S. military action against Iran, Russia’s long-standing partner, may be seen as too high a price to pay. After all, as hard-liners would point out, Russia is already targeted by thousands of U.S. nuclear weapons, as well as by the nuclear weapons of American allies and partners (Britain, France, Israel, and Pakistan). A nuclear-armed Iran would not add much to this picture, and probably would target its missiles elsewhere anyway.<br />
<br />
The prospect of Iranian nuclear materials or weapons being leaked to Islamic terrorist organizations is much more frightening. However, Russian hawks would claim that this is a hypothetical scenario, while actual transactions of that kind might have been already discussed or attempted through A. Q. Khan’s black market connections with the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and Iran— without ensuing aggressive U.S. attempts to investigate and prosecute the case. Apparently, this benign position was motivated by Washington’s desire not to destabilize its partner regime in Pakistan. As for Russia, its political-strategic elite would be deeply split if it had to make a choice between cooperation with its partner regime in Iran and cooperation with the United States, particularly in view of the state of U.S.-Russian strategic relations.<br />
<br />
The third reason for a new strategic relationship is the problem of resource allocation. Sustaining nuclear deterrence at current levels, or even at reduced levels (such as the 1,700 to 2,200 deployed warheads called for under SORT), is an expensive luxury, given that the two biggest powers assign the bulk of these forces the mission of destroying each other, as well as serving “as a hedge against future uncertainty.” This aimless “hedge” may be relatively inexpensive for the United States, which has the largest overall defense budget in the world (about as big as the sum of all military spending by the other major powers), and which fully modernized its strategic nuclear force during the 1980s and 1990s, investing in “strategic capital” that will last for decades into the future. Still, even for the United States it would be easy to find a much better allocation of these resources, whether within its defense budget or outside it.<br />
<br />
The burden of maintaining robust nuclear deterrence is heavier for Russia, which is now implementing a “balanced modernization” of all elements of its strategic triad and planning to keep up with the SORT ceilings of 1,700 to 2,200 warheads. Faced with having to fund an enormously expensive process of military reform, as well as extensive modernization and restructuring of its conventional forces, Russia nonetheless suffers the expenditure of huge sums on nuclear weapons. The budget share for nuclear deterrence is relatively even bigger for France, Britain, and China.<br />
<br />
By maintaining mutual nuclear deterrence, the great powers are wasting resources that otherwise could be applied to more appropriate military and security tasks and missions. Moreover, significant scientific and technical intellectual resources are tied up by nuclear deterrence. Powerful state, business, research, and political organizations are locked into sustaining nuclear confrontation in economic, technical, and mental respects, instead of addressing the more realistic and urgent needs of national and international security.<br />
<br />
Another, more general objection to nuclear deterrence is not directly linked to nuclear weapons, so it is not included in our 3x3x3 package. Still it is worth mentioning. Russia.s domestic economic and political evolution is inseparable from its foreign policy. It is impossible to imagine Russia evolving as an advanced market economy and democracy without good relations with the United States and gradual economic, political, and security integration with the European Union.<br />
<br />
For the West, consistent cooperation with and integration of Russia is potentially an immense asset in providing for security in Eurasia. The benefits include gaining from Russia’s science, technology, and cultural resources; coping with the unpredictable future of the supply of energy and raw materials; containing Islamic radicalism; addressing the proliferation of WMD; dealing with international terrorism; and managing relations with a growing China.<br />
<br />
Mutual nuclear deterrence between Russia, on the one hand, and the United States, Britain, and France, on the other, is a latent but real barrier to such cooperation and integration. Although it would be presumptuous to claim that Russian democratic development and economic reform directly depend on doing away with nuclear deterrence, transforming deterrence as part of a process of forging closer security relations with the West would certainly advance Russia.s progress toward democracy and economic integration with the West.<br />

US-Russian relations are critical to resolving global conflicts<br />
<br />

<br />
As the Report of the Commission on American National Interests (2000) concluded, Russia ranks among the few countries whose actions powerfully affect American vital interests. Why? First, Russia is a very large country linking several strategically important regions. By virtue of its size and location, Russia is a key player in Europe as well as the Middle East and Central, South and East Asia. Accordingly, Moscow can substantially contribute to, or detract from, U.S. efforts to deal with such urgent challenges as North Korea and Iran, as well as important longer term problems like Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition, Russia shares the world's longest land border with China, an emerging great power that can have a major impact on both U.S. and Russian interests. The bottom line is that notwithstanding its significant loss of power after the end of the Cold War, Moscow's geopolitical weight still exceeds that of London or Paris.  Second, as a result of its Soviet legacy, Russia has relationships with and information about countries that remain comparatively inaccessible to the American government, in the Middle East, Central Asia and elsewhere. Russian intelligence and/or leverage in these areas could significantly aid the United States in its efforts to deal with current, emerging and still unforeseen strategic challenges, including in the war on terrorism.<br />

<br />
Assuming Russia does not move into absolute isolation (or break up), it is also not inconceivable that Moscow and Washington could fight a war on the same side-if both regard a particular emerging power as challenging their mutual interests, and if joint action suits the interests of the ruling party or elite on both sides, so as to prove their alliance commitment. But if conflict does break out-whether between Russia and its neighbors, or among other significant states-it will be necessary to make certain these conflicts do not spread. As in the interwar period, divisive allied foreign policies and the failure to establish and sustain a larger concert of states may well mean-and in the not-so-distant future-having to choose  between &quot;supporting,&quot; &quot;appeasing,&quot; “containing,&quot; and &quot;rolling back&quot; radically divergent, revisionist or revanchist powers. The right choice will prevent World War III. <br />
Relations 1AC<br />

The U.S. arsenal is perceived as a first strike force – this independently increases the likelihood of nuclear arms racing, crises and full-scale nuclear conflict<br />
<br />
Lieber and Press 6 - * Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame.AND </strong> Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Pennsylvania (Keir and Daryl, International Security, “The End of MAD?<br />
<br />
The Nuclear Dimension of U.S. Primacy”, Spring, projectmuse) <br />
<br />
Other analysts have noted that the current U.S. nuclear force looks surprisingly like an arsenal designed for a nuclear first strike against Russia or China. &quot;The U.S. arsenal today looks much as it would if a disarming strike against Russia were still its dominant mission,&quot; a scholar at the Federation of American Scientists writes.60 A group of RAND analysts agrees: &quot;What the planned force appears best suited to provide beyond the needs of traditional deterrence [End Page 30] is a preemptive counterforce capability against Russia and China. Otherwise, the numbers and the operating procedures simply do not add up.&quot;61 These analysts appear to believe that the steadily growing U.S. counterforce capability reflects something akin to bureaucratic momentum, not a desire to achieve first-strike capability. Although the tendency of weapons designers and military organizations to constantly seek to improve their forces is well documented,62 the steady improvement in the U.S. nuclear arsenal is entirely consistent with America's across-the-board effort to maintain and expand its military primacy.63<br />
<br />
The United States is openly seeking primacy in every other dimension of modern military technology. The desire to modernize U.S. conventional forces is broadly and correctly interpreted as an effort to build the tools necessary to retain U.S. military supremacy. The simultaneous modernization of U.S. nuclear weapon systems should be seen in the same light.<br />
<br />
Implications and Counterarguments<br />
<br />
The shift in the nuclear balance could significantly damage relations among the great powers and increase the probability of nuclear war. First, the United States' growing offensive nuclear capabilities will pressure Russia and China to reduce the peacetime vulnerability of their forces. The steps that they may take to do this—for example, building larger nuclear arsenals, dispersing nuclear forces, predelegating launch authority to local commanders, and adopting a hair-trigger nuclear retaliatory doctrine—may signal the beginning of an intense, new nuclear arms race. Even worse, these steps may increase the danger of nuclear accidents, including unauthorized and accidental nuclear war.64 In the past, both U.S. and Russian early warning systems have sounded false [End Page 31] alarms of incoming nuclear attacks; this record suggests that the dangers associated with accidental nuclear war are serious.65<br />
<br />
The second implication of the United States' emerging nuclear primacy is that it may trigger dangerous dynamics during crises and wars. If Russia and China do not sufficiently reduce their peacetime vulnerability, they will feel compelled to do so if they find themselves in a crisis with the United States. Efforts to ready and disperse nuclear forces during a crisis, however, can be perilous, especially once conventional military operations begin. For example, a Chinese nuclear alert during a Sino-U.S. war over Taiwan might appear to U.S. leaders that China was preparing to use nuclear weapons.66 Under these circumstances, U.S. leaders would face great pressure to preempt a potential Chinese attack rather than wait and see if China strikes nearby U.S. military forces, a U.S. ally, or (less likely) the American homeland. (U.S. leaders are well aware of repeated comments by Chinese military officers suggesting that China might use nuclear weapons to destroy American cities if the United States supported Taiwan in a war for independence.67) In a similar vein, during a conventional war over Taiwan, U.S. military forces would likely attack Chinese air defense radars, communications hubs, military command and control sites, mobile missile launchers, and submarines. These attacks—designed to win the conventional war—would be indistinguishable to China's leaders from the steps the United States might take prior to attacks on China's small strategic nuclear force. Facing a possible nuclear strike, China might alert its nuclear forces or even initiate regional nuclear war to deter further U.S. nuclear escalation.68<br />
<br />
Third, if Russia and China do not adequately reduce the vulnerability of their nuclear forces, U.S. leaders will soon have the option of launching a disarming attack against either country. Some analysts consider this scenario unthinkable: it would, after all, entail enormous risks and horrifying costs. History and current policy trends suggest, however, that the possibility of a U.S. nuclear attack should not be entirely dismissed. Nuclear counterforce was the cornerstone of American national security strategy during the previous era [End Page 32]of U.S. nuclear primacy (the early 1950s until the early 1960s). During this period, U.S. leaders planned to launch a massive nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China if the Soviets launched a conventional attack on Europe.69 Indeed, in 1961, at the peak of the Berlin crisis, U.S. leaders modified war plans to improve the odds that a disarming strike on the Soviet Union would succeed, and President John Kennedy carefully explored the option of initiating such a surprise nuclear attack.70 Moreover, both the United States and the Soviet Union considered launching attacks on China to prevent its ascension to the nuclear club.71 In a new era of U.S. nuclear primacy, U.S. policymakers may once again be tempted to consider nuclear escalation during intense crises or if nonnuclear military operations go unexpectedly badly for the United States (e.g., in Korea).72  <br />

Plan<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should detarget its strategic missile forces and adopt verifable de-alerting measures including missile safing and refraining from installing launch inverters.  The United States federal government should put its four Trident submarines in the North Atlantic and North Pacific on modified alert.<br />

<br />
This report evaluates several of the most promising de-alerting options and finds many of them worthy of support. Recommendations are made with varying degrees of enthusiasm and qualification.<br />
<br />
Procedural changes to extend the launch timeline by dropping prompt launch and massive attack options from the emergency war plans. These changes could lengthen the timeline for both decision and execution, and preclude large-scale retaliatory strikes. By taking operationally meaningful, rather than cosmetic, steps to de-target the strategic missile forces, any move to bring them back to launch-ready status would incur significant delays in re-targeting. With some qualifications due to transparency and verification concerns, this report recommends these changes, which could readily be adopted, because they would reduce the risks of mistaken launch on false warning, require significant time to reverse (many hours to re-target; many days to revert to former procedures), preserve deterrence under the worst of plausible conditions, and build momentum toward a nuclear-free world. It is a qualified recommendation, however, because the degree of transparency and verifiability is low.<br />
<br />
Physical de-alerting measures that could be instituted immediately on the U.S. side by ‘safing’ Minuteman missiles in their silos—flipping a safety switch inside the silos that electronically isolates the missiles from outside launch signals—and refraining from installing special electronic devices known as ‘inverters’ on the tubes of Trident submarines going on patrol. These simple, practical measures are stronger in all the respects noted above for the procedural changes, and have the added virtues of extending the time to re-alert the bulk of the forces by approximately 24 hours and of lending themselves to a modest degree of verification that would build confidence over time. Analogous or comparable measures can be effected in the Russian posture, resulting in a stable nuclear balance that removes sudden first-strike and launch on warning completely from the array of response options available to decision-makers, and that all but eliminates the prospect of unauthorized actors, including terrorists, exploiting hair-trigger postures to cause a nuclear incident or actual firing.<br />
<br />
Unilateral de-alerting will shiift away from the perception of a U.S. first strike posture and induce Russian reciprocation<br />

<br />
De-alerting is feasible. Wholesale de-alerting happened once before, in 1991. There are many practical ways to extend the time needed to fire U.S. and Russian nuclear forces—by hours, days, weeks, months, and even years—while preserving stable deterrence during peacetime and in the remote event of a U.S.-Russian nuclear crisis. De-alerting options take the form of procedural or physical modifications, or both.<br />
<br />
  create an unmistakably second-strike posture geared to riding out an attack before retaliating. The traditional nuclear strategies of both nations would be transformed by this change; the pre-dominance of nuclear war-fighting would be ended . Further, the demands on the command system required in this “launch after attack” posture would promote a salutary new focus on enhancing the survivability of present arrangements.<br />
<br />
Ideally, both U.S. and Russia would stand down in unison. Reciprocal de-alerting would immediately yield major security and safety benefits to both sides. Because Russia’s strategic forces today are vulnerable to a sudden surprise attack, U.S. de-alerting would allay Russian fear of a disarming U.S. first-strike and justify Russia removing its own finger from the nuclear button Reciprocal Russian de-alerting would bolster U.S. force survivability but would be especially welcome for lowering the risks of a mistaken or unauthorized Russian launch.<br />
<br />
This beneficial de-alerting dynamic could begin with U.S. unilateral steps that would preserve the survivability of its nuclear forces and give Russia confidence to follow suit. Unilateral U.S. de-alerting would protect the United States if it causes Russia to begin to relax—physically or psychologically—its nuclear hair-trigger. Unilateral steps that jeopardize the survivability of nuclear forces obviously would not satisfy the criterion of maintaining stable deterrence and would thus not be recommended.<br />

Alert status has a crucial symbolic effect – the message the plan conveys about the likelihood of conflict will have a crucial moderating effect<br />

<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nti.org/e_research/official_docs/labs/de_alt_act_tnw.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nti.org/e_research/official_docs/labs/de_alt_act_tnw.pdf</a> <br />
Note that not all forms of high alert status imply a “use-it-or-lose-it” problem. Some alerting measures make forces less vulnerable and therefore better able to ride out a nuclear attack. For example, when 30% of U.S. bombers were on airstrip alert, they could have taken off quickly enough to evade a long-range ICBM attack. Russian land-mobile missiles can be sent out of their garrisons to survive by hiding. Missile-launching submarines in port can be sent to sea. Airborne strategic command posts can be sent aloft. In none of these cases does being placed on high alert have to imply a need or intent to launch weapons on warning. At the same time, most visible forms of high-alert status are likely to have a symbolic effect, sending a message, intended or incidental, ⎜to one’s possible adversaries about how likely one perceives conflict to be. Thus, when the U.S. took its bombers off day-to-day alert status, it presented the step as a symbol to the Soviet Union that cold war tensions had eased. If the bombers were now placed back on regular alert, they would convey the opposite message. <br />

<br />
<br />
Concerns about inadvertent launch In 1995, according to press reports, Russia came within minutes of launching its nuclear weapons after its early warning satellites detected the launch of a rocket off the coast of Norway.  Russian officials were unable to identify the source of the launch or distinguish it from a U.S. submarine-launched Trident missile.6 This incident highlighted growing weaknesses in Russia’s early warning system and raised concerns about the possibility of an inadvertent launch of nuclear weapons.  In response, analysts again called for the United States and Russia to remove their nuclear weapons from alert.  They argued that, even though the United States did not have gaps in its early warning system, it was also vulnerable to ambiguous warning and misunderstandings because of the short time lines associated with the decision process and the resulting pressure to launch promptly in the face of an incoming attack.  Moreover, analysts argued that, if the United States removed its weapons from alert, and Russia could confirm that change in status, then Russia might feel less pressure to launch its own weapons promptly when it received incomplete or ambiguous warning data   Specifically, if Russia detected evidence of a missile launch, but it knew that U.S. missiles were not on alert and it had observed no efforts by the United States to restore their alert status, then Russia would be less likely to conclude it was under attack and respond in kind.  Further, the pressure might be reduced enough to convince Russia to remove its weapons from alert, too. <br />

Small conflicts won’t cause a large scale reconstitution of nuclear forces<br />
<br />
Blair 95 (Bruce, president of the World Security Institute and Center for Defense Information, former senior fellow for the Brookings Institute in public and foreign policy, “Global Zero Alert for Nuclear Forces,” Brookings Occasional Papers, pg. 100-8)<br />
<br />
<br />
Transitional Stability. Scenarios requiring, or seeming to recommend, the regeneration of nuclear capability mostly strain credulity, but should circumstances call for preparing a nuclear option, the act of reconstitution should allow for transitional stability.  This stability depends on timely notification or warning of the change in posture, on preventing any spontaneous escalation of alert levels, and on taking counterbalancing responses designed to deny a potential adversary any decisive preemptive advantage it might otherwise obtain by changing its nuclear posture.<br />
<br />
Among the scenarios that might recommend or require a departure from zero alert, the following discussion treats four, beginning with the most plausible.<br />
<br />
The most likely circumstance is perhaps one in which the United States would generate a nuclear threat from North Korea to US forces deployed in South Korea.  In such a case, any US nuclear strike plan would involve very small numbers of US weapons.  The strategic command or a theater commander would likely draw up a plan whose nuclear component would more likely feature tactical than strategic weapons.  But the strategic command could also devise limited attack options or selected attack options that would employ strategic forces against the adversary.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the type and scale of the planned operation, however, the general rule to be followed would be that the party breaking out of the zero-alert posture would notify the other parties of its intentions, identify the pertinent weapons systems to be redeployed for combat, and clarify the alerting steps and combat actions to be taken. This norm could be strengthened by designating a special storage area from which a small number of weapons could be returned to alert if that ever proved to be necessary.  The limited number would provide reassurance that a larger regeneration was not being screened by the smaller contingency.  This arrangement, coupled itch joint monitoring already in place and national technical means of verification, should provide ample reassurance to the other parties to a zero-alert agreement in cases of very small operations.  Preparation of a small nuclear option to deal with third world contingencies should not trigger uncontrolled escalatory interaction between the major nuclear powers nor warrant any significant compensatory response by the on looking power.<br />

De-alerting will transform the deterrent relationship with Russia and be modeled by China, India and Pakistan<br />
<br />
Blair 8 – president of the World Security Institute (Bruce, “Increasing Warning and Decision Time (‘De-Alerting’)” International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament, Oslo February 26 – 27 2008,<br />
<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://disarmament.nrpa.no/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/Paper_Blair.pdf</a>) <br />
<br />
De-alerting even at the initial phase, entailing the removal of massive attack options from the war plans, implicitly contests the axioms of nuclear strategy that have shaped the operational character of U.S. and Russian deterrent forces for nearly 50 years. Implementing any of the four steps presented in this report will hinge on re conceptualizing deterrence and transforming the traditional war-fighting strategies. Dealerting presents more than a mere technical challenge of devising verifiable ways to reduce reliance on prompt launch capabilities. It so challenges traditional deterrent concepts and operational practices that it must be grounded upon a visionary and enlightened conception of national and international security.<br />
<br />
The core premise of that new conception is that the Cold War between the United States and Russia is finished and done, and that the prevention of nuclear terrorism and proliferation, and strengthening safeguards against the accidental and unauthorized use of nuclear weapons now lie at the core of their national security interests, and head the list of urgent nuclear priorities. The leaders of the United States and Russia have but to assert in their nuclear guidance that U.S.-Russian mutual nuclear deterrence no longer demands launch-ready forces servicing war-fighting objectives and the cosmic risks that such forces carry are no longer justifiable in the name of deterrence.<br />
<br />
Such guidance would overturn the longstanding view that deterrence demands real-time coverage of a comprehensive and long list of military, economic, and leadership targets in Russia and China, a readiness to rapidly generate the full U.S. strategic arsenal to maximum alert during a crisis, and a pre-disposition to launch on warning of an enemy attack in progress.<br />
<br />
Without visionary new presidential guidance, the default position will be the traditional one, and the path to standing down the Cold War postures will be obstructed. The default position, moreover, will create further barriers to de-alerting as it factors China’s nuclear modernization and general economic rise into U.S. threat perceptions, deterrence thinking, and actual nuclear planning. Since China was reinstated in the U.S. strategic war plan in 1998 the trend has been to view it increasingly as the next ‘designated enemy’ for U.S. military planners and the rationale for maintaining a large U.S. nuclear arsenal on high alert.6 The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review designated China as an ‘immediate nuclear contingency’ (whereas Russia was judged not to be an immediate threat) and that designation appears to have led to steadily increasing U.S. nuclear operations aimed at a growing list of Chinese targets.<br />
<br />
This growing pressure on China may well induce it to adopt the traditional countermeasures that decrease warning and decision time and thus heighten the risk of inadvertent or unauthorized launch against the United States. Shortening the Chinese fuse and adding a third nation to the launch-ready alert club would scarcely represent progress in the quest for mutual nuclear safety. Indeed, additional nuclear states such as India and Pakistan are also very likely to gradually shorten their fuses and heighten risks of nuclear inadvertence in the absence of U.S. and Russian progress toward standing down their launch-ready forces.
