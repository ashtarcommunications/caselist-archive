Observation One Inherency<br />
1. Everyday around the world women, and by women we are including girls over the age of 6 and above, are subject to grotesque violence solely because they are women. If the news report we are about to read shocks you or in any way moves you, just remember its one of millions that is happens everyday. The United States Government has done little to nothing to address this issue, while they continue to funnel billions of dollars a year into a failing and oppressive nuclear weapons system. In order to make sure there was food for herself and her family Dina, at the age of 17, went to the farm the crops she was abducted and raped by militia nearby, and left to die.<br />

<br />
In light of this ongoing violence against women Meghan and I advocate the following plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce the size of its nuclear weapons arsenal and substantially reduce the role of its nuclear weapons arsenal by an unconditional disarm of its nuclear weapons arsenal<br />

Observation Two Harms<br />
<br />
Harm One: Violence Against Women<br />
<br />
A. The United States’ investments do not serve its citizens, or the citizens of the world. As humans we are homeless, impoverished, and unprotected against the most basic and obscene crimes. While we are struggling to get by the United States Federal Government is spending billions of dollars into an oppressive nuclear program.<br />

<br />
B. While the United States Federal Government pours billions of dollars into it’s nuclear program they are not only ignoring social issues they are creating a militaristic society with a tendency to weigh military impacts over the impacts of everyday violence.<br />
<br />
Callaghan 2003<br />
<br />
C. Women around the world are under attack. The United Nations reports that one in three women around the world will experience violent acts against them. This is not only an alarming statistic, but the fact of the matter is it denies women full access to their lives. These violent acts only seem to increase in times of conflict and militarization. Violence against women takes a back seat to the overarching fear of war, that is promoted by this militaristic society.<br />
<br />

<br />
D. Everyday violence, such as violence against women, encompasses all areas of society, which kills more human beings than any instance of nuclear war that has happened in the past. This by far outweighs any nuclear war scenario you could outline.<br />
<br />

<br />
Harm Two Nuclear Rhetoric<br />
<br />
A. The United States’ continuation of nuclear policies produces a rhetoric that promotes patriarchal domination and control<br />

<br />
B. Nuclear Discourse is culturally constructed by male norms that perpetuate patriarchal practices.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>C.</strong> These patriarchal norms allow for the continued persistence of nuclear weapons. Until we disarm we will continue the cycle of violence created by the persistence of nuclear rhetoric.<br />
<br />
Observation Three Solvency<br />
<br />
A. When nuclear weapons are present in society even if there is not a declared “war” going on, militarism continues to run rampant. Through a complete disarm there would be a complete reduction of nuclear discourse.<br />
<br />

<strong>2003</strong><br />
<br />
B. Only through a complete disarm with the United States begin to challenge the militaristic and patriarchal norms that are prevalent in society. Not only would a disarmament be the way to challenge an existence of patriarchy in status quo, overall it is the best moral option that faces this years resolution.<br />
<br />
C. A full on rejection of militarism will be a critical way we can challenge and denounce patriarchal practices that allow for violence to persist in the status quo.<br />
<br />
Observation Four<br />
The Ballot<br />
<br />
Meghan and I advocate that the ballot should be given to the team that best debates within this round. Our job as the affirmative is to provide a topical affirmative that addresses important issues that affect our lives. Throughout our lives as rural, white women we have experienced patriarchy at its finest, and through our academic studies of international relations we have seen the impact patriarchy has on societies around the world. We are in no way claiming to solve for every instance of patriarchy or for every person in the world. Meghan and I came to this resolution with a question of how to find a way to challenge the dominance that exists in our world and how nuclear weapons policy perpetuates that dominance. Meghan and I are also not claiming that every woman or every society has the same problems or solutions. Through our individual experiences we are able to begin break this system of domination that perpetuates gross abuses against humanity. Though we don’t necessarily believe that taking a stance against gender-motivated violence and nuclear rhetoric necessarily makes us feminists, we will advocate global feminism in this round as the best ideology to challenge patriarchy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bring on your Feminism is essentializing, racist, and ignores intersections of oppression all you want. We are not and should not be held responsible for forms of feminism we do not advocate in this round. Feminism is a theory that has multiple different schisms within the discipline. We will not be held responsible for every piece of feminist scholarship that has ever been produced.<br />
<br />
Global Feminism is an ideology that works for women’s rights around the globe. Global feminism challenges patriarchy as well as western domination in theoretical practice. Overall each person in the world will have different needs, and understanding this intersection is the first step to challenging and dismantling patriarchy.<br />
