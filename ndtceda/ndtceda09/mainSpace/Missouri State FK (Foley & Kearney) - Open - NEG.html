The conventional bombing of Dresden was worse than the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br />
Herald Scotland, 2009 The Second World War was a just one. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/ian-bell/the-second-world-war-was-a-just-one-eventually-1.918223" rel="nofollow">http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/ian-bell/the-second-world-war-was-a-just-one-eventually-1.918223</a><br />
That explanation was given .... bombing to this day<br />
<br />
Nuclear bombings were ethical – the alternative would have been massive destruction with overwhelming casualties on both sides with even greater civilian suffering<br />
Nick Fotion is a professor of philosophy at Emory. Should nuclear bombs have been droped on Japan?. September 1995. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1995/September/ERsept.18/9_18_95nuclear.bomb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1995/September/ERsept.18/9_18_95nuclear.bomb.html</a><br />
However, it was not so common...how World War II ended<br />
<br />
Would have been a greater ethical tragedy to not use nuclear weapons on Japan – this proves conflict termination can often be our most appropriate option and the 1AC ethics claims are flawed.<br />

Few events in the history ...not to use it.<br />

The bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki were ethical and the best option – the alternative would have been the worst blood bath in history killing millions more.<br />

Every August, there are some ...of their Japanese conquerors.<br />
<br />
Conflict termination (as in Hiroshima and Nagasaki) is the most ethical alternative. Failure to bomb would have killed upwards of 100 million people and been much worse.<br />
Satoshi Kanazawa evolutionary biologist August 21, 2008, Politics Dropping atomic bombs on Japan was an act of utmost compassion<br />

Justifying nuclear attacks to save people requires us to ignore our moral intuitions and make calculations about the best alternatives.<br />

The aff must reduce the arsenal by 75%.<br />
<br />
Substantial reduction – in the context of nuclear weapons – is, at least, 75%.Gates, 2008 (Robert M., Secretary of Defense, U.S. Department of Defense Speeches, “Minot Air Force Base” December 1, lexis)Your mission at Minot today, and my experiences AND making it unnecessary for them to develop their own.<br />
The arsenal is 2,700 – that means the aff must cut about 2000 weapons.Kristensen, 2009 (Hans M., Project Director for the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, “United States Reaches Moscow Treaty Warhead Limit Early” February, fas.org/blog/ssp/2009/02/sort.php)The stockpile number is not correct AND estimated to possess approximately 9,400 warheads in all categories (see table).<br />
The aff doesn’t cut by 2,000, it’s not topical.Hanlon, 2006 (Mike, “ICBM Weapon System upgraded” October 11, gizmag.com/go/6453/)Boeing, a subcontractor to Northrop Grumman Mission AND Minuteman ICBMs currently in the nation's arsenal.<br />
