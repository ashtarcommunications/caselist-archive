 Politics as the affirmative understands it and responds to it does not exist. Modernity’s emphasis on technology and speed has destroyed a traditional understanding of the locus of politics which now takes place in the sphere of communication itself. The space of politics is temporal, not spatial<br />

This state of politics has reversed the Clausewitzean statement of society. Politics is now the continuation of war by other means. Our entire society is diverted toward war.</u><br />

THE STATE OF PURE WAR SEEN IN THE NUCLEAR AGE ALLOWS A STATE OF ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION. PURE WAR EXISTING IN EVEN THE PREPARATION FOR WAR IS THE COMPLETE END OF POLITICS VIA THE REIGN OF TERROR OF THE MILITARY SOCIETY. THIS MAKES THE ABSOLUTE DEATH OF ALL CIVILIZATION POSSIBLE.

IT IS AN ACCIDENT OF UNIMAGINABLE PROPORTIONS. EXTERMINATION AND TERRORISM ARE BUT THE FORERUNNERS OF THE DISASTER IMPENDING UNDER THE TOTAL WAR FORM OF POLITICS.

<br />
<span style="color: black;">The affirmative eschews techno-fix solutions, they're not going to manipulate international relations to secure ourselves against terrorism or foreign states. Instead they would wipe the slate clean, opening a space for new life. What this really means is that they refuse to take the work of averting nuclear war, instead they invite it, as apocalypse. After all, apocalypse means salvation, unveiling. Nuclear war will wipe away the sinful, the cities, the modernist dregs, leaving only the purified survivors, purified by the deaths of most of the world population.</span><br />

In fact, the US has been preparing for a nuclear war. Not with Star Wars or treaties or stockpiled food, but by ensuring that the right population will be attacked – by concentrating the poor and racial minorities in cities and eliminating social programs. The disadvantaged members of society are being prepped for nuclear annihilation, and the aff plan is just another step towards this economic, religious, and ethnic cleansing.<br />

<span style="border-collapse: separate; font-style: normal;">The affirmative offers the final solution to unfair and uneducational debate. In the drive to achieve theperfect debate space, the aff framework divorces ethics from action and restricts subjectivity to only be in terms of the state. Within this frame, our solve functionis to dispassionately carve the savage and barbaric from rational ordered society. Thus, they have cast critique debaters as the most recent sign of the savage – only the savage would violate their fair and educational debate, and this savage will be exterminated by framework<br />
Bauman life in fragments 95 p 193-5<br />
“modernity is not only about producing” “separation of action and ethics”<br />
<br />
This is not just another ingenuine appeal to the logic of the holocaust – at the root of every genocidal actionwe can find the reduction of the individual to the role-performer: the soldier, the bureacra, the politician the architect of a perfect society. Like a toddler pounding a square peg into a round hole, the affirmativereduces us to exchangeable amoral actors, completely divorced from responsibility for those actions. By construcing debatea s a game or role-ploaying, the affirmative legitimizes ethics free action and guarantes these actions will be carried out violently.<br />
Bauman 95 life in fragments: essays in post-modern morality p195-198<br />
“such conditions-conditions without which” and “will do perfectly”<br />
<br />
By positing critiques as unacceptable, the affirmative uniquely constructs the saveage within society that must now be eliminated. By reducing the debate to a problem that must be solved they make the extermination of the unwanted inevitable as hurdles to be overcome on the road to a perfect society<br />
Bauman p 198-0<br />
“the modern spirit’s” “new building site”<br />
<br />
The reshaping of subjectivity to separate action from ethics produces the bureaucratic nature of progressive society that inevitably leads to the genocidal mentality implemented in nazi germany. Of course, the affirmative will not produce hitler or Goebbels, but by forcing us to dispassionately consider whether nuclear weapons are good or savage, and rationally dictate government policy from a high level of remove, the affirmative framework reduces us all to the role of Eichmann – very proficient at answering questions of policy, but ignorant to larger questions of the human effects of those policies –<br />
Churchill 05 interview with amy goodman on democracy now!<br />
“well it goes ot hanna arendt’s” “people targeted for elimination”<br />
<br />
Of course we agre that {aff plan}. But we reject their framework which locks this debate space into a forum for amoral game-players, a training ground for future eichmanns, we would use it to reinject ethics into the actions we, as debaters, endorse. We refuse to be turned into robots by the affirmative framework, we instead use debate a s ablast furnace for our revolutionary will.<br />
Schnurer 03 gaming as control contemporary argumentation and debate<br />
“the real game: potlatch” “debate should be about taking risks and creating new meaning”<br />
<br />
The aff framework corrupts their policy, reducing it to only ever on more attempt to stamp out the barbarian in the human. Nuclear weapons are the new eil that must be exterminated. Instead we would advocate their plan for different reasons, to check the most terrible aspects of their policy.<br />
