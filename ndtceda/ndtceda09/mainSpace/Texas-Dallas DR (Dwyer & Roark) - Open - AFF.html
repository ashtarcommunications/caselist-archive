<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We’ll isolate four internal links.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">First, is nuclear leadership – creates a barrier to prolif prior to &amp; regardless of entry into force</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Choubey, ‘7 deputy director of the Nonproliferation Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(deepti, A Chance for Nuclear Leadership, Washington post, nov 7)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Whoever wins in 2008, the most important strategic foreign policy issue facing the next President and Congress will be how to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons. ……It seems foolish to forego the benefits of the test ban. This is a strategic flaw that Congress should begin to address now in preparation for the next Congress and President.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />
Second, GLOBAL NORMS – US action creates a norm that prevents prolif. AND – that is an independent internal link to preventing conflicts from escalating</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Graham and Kampelman, ‘8 – Ambassador, involved in the negotiation and/or review process of every major international arms control agreement in which the United States participated between 1970 and 1997 and Ambassador to the Conference on Security and cooperation in Europe from 1980 to 1984</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />
Third, PSYCHOLOGICAL BARRIER to prolif</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The most important effect of the CTBT may be psychological. An agreement to end all nuclear testing amounts to acceptance that further nuclear-weapon development will not enhance security. …… thus perpetuates uncertainty about the basic principles shaping the future of global security.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Fourth, TESTING – its inevitable – the impact is global prolif. US ratification jumpstarts the move to reverse the trend</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Without the CTBT’s entry into force, the damage caused by previous testing risks being overshadowed by the effects of a new wave of testing. Political, doctrinal and operational decisions could be taken at any time to reverse the taboo and moratorium on testing, further weakening the CTBT and endangering the goal of nuclear disarmament. The situation remains uncertain, and ……. If they continue unchecked, the worst scenarios that nuclear campaigners can dream up may become reality. But just as any nuclear-weapon test would have major political consequences, all efforts to bring the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty into force are steps toward real peace and security: and this is where we should all be directing our energy.</span><br />

China's nuclear doctrine remains subordinate to the ……the end of the decade, the ultimate size and posture of its improved nuclear arsenal will be influenced by U.S. nuclear policy and in turn could affect how Washington perceives the nature and intentions of China's continued rise as a major global power.<br />

CTBT ratification is the NUMBER ONE sign that we respect the international community, are committed to multilateralism, and revamps soft power – also key to prolif credibility at the 2010 NPT conference<br />
Joseph, ‘9 senior Democratic foreign policy staffer in the United States Senate<br />
(Jofi, Renew the Drive for CTBT Ratification, The Washington Quarterly, Volume 32, Issue 2 April 2009 , pages 79 - 90<br />
First, a pledge to work toward CTBT ratification would help …… disarmament. Upon taking office the next year, the Bush administration swiftly renounced these commitments, setting the stage for a 2005 conference viewed by all parties involved as an unmitigated disaster. A concrete pledge by the United States to seek CTBT ratification will therefore energize the 2010 conference, and offer Washington greater leverage to push through potential reforms it may seek regarding the export of reprocessing and enrichment technology or automatic sanctions against states that violate their IAEA obligations.<br />

Nuclear issues are the best way to change the perception of US leadership – it shores up our soft power – that’s key to solving a litany of issues<br />
Stanley, ‘7 PhD in the Walsh School of Foreign Service and Department of Government at Georgetown University<br />
(Elizabeth A, , “International Perceptions of US Nuclear Policy,” independent research project for the Advanced Concepts Group at Sandia National Laboratories, Feb,)<br />
Seen in light of this wider debate about cooperation and power in international relations, US nuclear policy can be framed in terms of its effects on US soft power rather than just traditional hard power framing. Obviously, US nuclear policy aims to strengthen US hard power, but it also has effects on soft power. …….credibility in upholding other international agreements and acting as a global leader in international institutions. Each of these reactions occurs simultaneously and interacts with each other, in turn affecting how the US responds to those reactions. The strategic interaction is complex and incredibly difficult to model.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soft power &amp; perception is key to effective leadership – builds alliances, checks counter-balancing, maintains domestic support – multilateral co-op is the best internal link to solving terrorism<br />
Jervis, ‘9 professor of international politics at Columbia University.<br />
(Robert, Unipolarity: A Structural Perspective, World Politics Volume 61, Number 1, January 2009<br />
To say that the system is unipolar is not to argue that the unipole can get everything it wants or that it has no need for others. American power is very great, but it is still ……a set of institutions and values. Building the world that the U.S. seeks is a political, social, and even psychological task for which unilateral measures are likely to be unsuited and for which American military and economic strength can at best play a supporting role. Success requires that others share the American vision and believe that its leadership is benign.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Commitment to multilateralism is vital to prevent counter-balancing and overstretch – which destroy US leadership<br />
Grygiel, ‘6 George H. W. Bush Chair in International Relations at Johns Hopkins University<br />
(Jakub “Imperial Allies” Orbis, Volume 50, Issue 2 (ScienceDirect)<br />
But the fact that the United States has achieved overwhelming power does not mean that it doesn’t need, and should not seek, alliances. Solitude is dangerous for empires, and alliances continue to be crucial ……. For example, without American support, Poland may pursue an increasingly Francophile, or Ukraine an increasingly Russophile, course, strengthening the anti-U.S. bloc in Europe. In Asia, the United States’ withdrawal from its commitments to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would lead some states to a more accommodating policy toward China, increasing that nation's sphere of influence to the detriment of American interests.<br />

This is a good thing, and it should continue to be a primary goal of American foreign policy to perpetuate this relatively benign international configuration of power. The unipolar order with the United States as the predominant power is unavoidably riddled with flaws and contradictions. It inspires fears and jealousies. The United States is not immune to error, like all other nations, and because of its size and importance …………….no one should imagine that a reduction of American power or a retraction of American influence and global involvement will provide an easier path.<br />

Adding to this political crisis, nuclear weapons… with the same blast effect.<br />

<br />
Contention 2 is Solvency<br />
<br />
The plan prevents weapons modification absent changes in the warheads while maintaining the skilled technicians and techniques developed under SSP to monitor and test weapon reliability.<br />

Stockpile Stewardship requires a massive R&amp;D… making and funding such improvements.<br />

Since the nuclear components of … and how closely to the originals do we want to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
