When these conflicts occur, the US will try to decide whether or not to use nuclear weapons. Arguments based on rationality and morality won’t work. The question is what sort of decision making we should use<br />

Contention Two: Sociobiology<br />
Evolution explains why people do what they do – people aren’t rationally calculating actors. They behave irrationally because the ultimate cause of their action is reproductive advantage. Examining the evolutionary motivations behind people’s action is a prerequisite to true freedom.<br />

The alternative to this is the “Blank Slate” doctrine, or cultural determinism. The problem is nothing comes from nothing – the mind can’t be a lump of silly putty, it has to come with certain drives and desires pre-loaded.<br />

There’s massive historical evidence on the question of city busting – all of it goes affirmative. Never in the history of warfare has city busting caused surrender.<br />

Interpretation – Any prediction about interaction of people requires a theory of human nature.<br />

Why should policymakers … of contemporary scholarship.<br />

<br />
Reasons to prefer –<br />
<br />
Need a theory – without a theory of human nature, no prediction is falsifiable. Circumstances are always different so history never directly answers questions.<br />
<br />
Multiple Theories Bad – this is killing debate. The problem isn’t conditionality, it’s multiple flows with inconsistent premises. It forces the 2AC to make contradictory arguments and turns what should be holistic argumentation into a million different flows.<br />
<br />
Voting issue – resolving how you evaluate arguments is a prerequisite to the arguments you evaluate.
