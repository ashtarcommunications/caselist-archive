Vital Decay--<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Sub-point A---The Atom Lives!</u></strong><br />
The aff approaches the existence of nuclear weapons from a perspective that privileges the understanding of biological life over inorganic material processes. This division of the world into passive matter and vibrant life makes it impossible to effectively de-center our calculation of events and futures from an exaggerated focus on human agency. This anti-empirical approach to reality forecloses the possibility of effective policy-making, dooming the plan<br />

You are currently working on a book entitled Vital Materiality:<br />
or feeds itself? Until we do that, political attempts to remedy the problem are likely to be ineffective.<br />
<br />
This is particularly true with respect to nuclear weapons systems which are defined through the opposition between the anxiety-driven impulse to secure geopolitical space and the vital process of the radioactive decay which is constantly undoing those attempts at security. This anxiety is evident in the advocates of RRW who describe detonation failure as “a worst case scenario”<br />
Bond ‘9 Alison, NYU Scienceline, “Battling Over Aging Nuclear Warheads” Popular Science, 04.15.2009 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-04/battling-over-aging-nuclear-warheads" rel="nofollow">http://www.popsci.com/military-aviation-amp-space/article/2009-04/battling-over-aging-nuclear-warheads</a><br />
Anxiety over the U.S. arsenal centers on the age of the<br />
be potentially recovered, reprocessed and used against you by the enemy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The aff’s politics is at base the same as the politics of armament. Their drive to disarm the nuclear arsenal is simply the security complex’s drive to secure the nation-state in reverse—they are both fundamentally impelled by an over-arching anxiety about the ‘dangerous trajectories’ of the material processes that constitute nuclear weapons<br />

The development of international armour is a self-generating, exponentially<br />

<br />
<strong><u>Sub-point B---A Ghost In the Machine.</u></strong><br />
The 1AC is a false architecture of humanistic despair, infecting us with the bad affects of a system that is designed to militarize our perception around a singular self and a world that is constantly available for apocalyptic extermination. You must resist the transmission of this melancholy at all costs, for it negates the pleasure of being alive.<br />

<br />
When Spinoza says 'The surprising thing is the<br />
as they pass’, the opposite of a morality of salvation, teaching to soul its life, not to save it.<br />
<br />
The creation of a ‘centers of analysis’ asserts the power of metaphysical ideology over the empirical vitality of vibrant matter. This centering of action around agency is an abortion reason of as a multiplicity by straight-jacketing our very thoughts in this debate round to an artificial limit of what is possible, and true—our freedom to look into the future to behold the nuclear gallows is an indenturing of vibrant material life to the graves of dead ideas. This is a world of constant mutual demolition against all material--we might as well end humanity right now<br />

How does one &quot;act&quot; on something, and what is the act or actuality of<br />

<br />
<strong><u>Sub-point C---Becoming Vital Decay.</u></strong><br />
Rather than re-capitulate the solution-fix mindset through disarmament, our alternative is to DO NOTHING. This NOTHING is by no means a passive void, but rather represents an space in which to encounter the process of radioactive decay AS A VITAL MATERIAL. Only through such an encounter can we destabilize the distinction between passive matter and vibrant life which is at the base of the systems of exploitation the aff criticizes<br />

<strong>Their rejection of enlightenment reason leads to “might makes right” conflicts between those with opposing epistemologies and replication of the religious warfare of the past.

The primary problem with epistemological pluralism is that there is no way… war rather than persuasion is the only possible consequence of speaking such a truth to power.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Human brains can be used for many things but in this debate they must be used as calculating machines which need to process information about the world and then produce a result that determines who wins or loses the debate</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The problem is that the affirmative has assumed that human brains are perfect calculating machines, capable of objectively performing calculations over the likelihood of the extinction of the entire human species, when the truth is that most humans lack even the basic cognitive capability to understand what the death of over six billion people truly means</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our framework for the debate is information-utility: the value of the calculation performed should come before the information that is calculated. This is the only way that we can challenge our limited scope to truly make calculations for the near-infinite future potential of the human race </span></strong><br />

<strong>The modern concept of homosexuality is a <u>social construction</u> – it was invented in 1892 by a translator</strong> <br />
<strong>Halperin 89</strong> (David, W. H. Auden Collegiate Professor of the History and Theory of Sexuality at the University of Michigan, “One Hundred Years of Homosexuality,” p 15-16)<br />
<br />
In 1992, when the patriots among us will be <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">celebrating the</span> five hundredth anniversary of the <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, our cultural historians may wish to mark </span>the centenary of <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">an intellectual landfall of almost <strong>equal importance for the conceptual geography of the human sciences</strong>: the <strong>invention</strong> of homosexuality by Charles Gilbert Chaddock</span></u>. Though he may never rank with Columbus in the annals of individual achievement, Chaddock would hardly seem to merit time obscurity which has surrounded him throughout the past hundred years. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">An early translator of </span>Krafft Ebing's classic medical handbook of sexual deviance, the<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> Psychopathia sexualis, Chaddock</span> is credited by the Oxford English Dictionary with having <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">introduced</span></strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> &quot;homo sexuality&quot; into the English language in 1892</span></u>,1 in order to render a German cognate twenty years its senior. 2 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Homosexuality, for better or for worse, has been with us <strong>ever since</strong></span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> <u>Before 1892 <strong>there was no homosexuality, only sexual inversion</strong></u>. But, as George Chauncey, who has made a thorough study of the medical literature on the subject, persuasively argues, &quot;Sexual inversion, the term used most commonly in the nineteenth century, did not denote the same conceptual phenomenon as homosexuality. 'Sexual inversion' referred to a broad range of deviant gender behavior, of which homosexual desire was only a logical but indistinct aspect, while homosexuality' focused on the narrower issue of sexual object choice. The differentiation of homosexual desire from 'deviant' gender behavior at the turn of the century reflects a major reconceptualization of the nature of human sexuality, its relation to gender, and its role in one's social definition. &quot; Throughout the nineteenth century, in other words, sexual preference for a person of one's own sex was not clearly distinguished from other sorts of non conformity to one's culturally defined sex role: deviant object choice was viewed as merely one of a number of pathological symptoms exhibited by those who reversed, or &quot;inverted,&quot; their proper sex-roles by adopting a masculine or a feminine style at variance with what was deemed natural and appropriate to their anatomical sex. Political aspirations in women and (at least according to one expert writing as late as 1920) a fondness for cats in men were manifestations of a pathological condition, a kind of psychological hermaphroditism tellingly but not essentially expressed by the preference for a &quot;normal&quot; member of one's own sex as a sexual partner. 4<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> </span><br />

2. This new persecution of the peripheral sexualities entailed an incorporation of perversions and a new specification of individuals. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">As defined by the ancient civil or canonical codes, sodomy was a category of forbidden acts; their perpetrator was nothing more than the juridical subject of them. The nineteenth century homosexual became a personage, a past, a case history, </span>and a childhood, in addition to being <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">a type of life</span>, a life form, and a morphology, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">with an indiscreet anatomy and possibly a mysterious physiology. <strong>Nothing that went into his total composition was unaffected by his sexuality</strong>. It was</span> everywhere present in him: <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">at the <strong>root</strong> of all his actions</span> because it was their insidious and indefinitely active principle; written immodestly on his face and body because it was a secret that always gave itself away.

We must not forget that the psychological, psychiatric, medical category of homosexuality was constituted from the moment it was characterized Westphal's famous article of 1870 on &quot;contrary sexual sensations&quot; can stand as its date of birth less by a type of sexual relations than by a certain quality of sexual sensibility, a certain way of <strong>inverting the masculine and the feminine in oneself</strong>. Homosexuality appeared as one of the forms of sexuality when it was transposed from the practice of sodomy onto a kind of interior androgyny, a hermaphrodism of the soul. <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The sodomite had been a temporary aberration; the homosexual was now a species</span></strong></u><strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span></strong> <br />

The comparatively recent genesis of heterosexuality strictly speaking, a twentieth century affair should provide a clue to the profundity of the cultural issues over which, hitherto, I have been so lightly skating. <u>How is it possible that until the year 1900 there was not a precise, value free, scientific term available to speakers of the English language for designating what we would now regard, in retrospect, as the mode of sexual behavior favored by the vast majority of people in our culture? <strong>Any</strong> answer to that question must direct our attention to the inescapable historicity of even the most innocent, unassuming, and seemingly objective of cultural representations. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Although a blandly descriptive, rigorously clinical term like &quot;homosexuality&quot; would appear to be unobjectionable as a taxonomic device, it carries with it a <strong>heavy complement of ideological baggage</strong> and has, in fact, proved a <strong>significant obstacle</strong> to understanding the distinctive features of sexual life in non Western and pre modern cultures.</span>&quot; It may well be that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">homosexuality properly speaking has <strong>no history of its own</strong> outside the West or much before the beginning of our century</span></u>. 2&quot; <u>For, as John Boswell remarks, &quot;if the categories 'homosexual/heterosexual' and 'gay /straight' are the inventions of particular societies rather than real aspects of the human psyche, there is no gay history.&quot;</u> <br />

<strong>Greek and Roman societies existed without our modern conception of homosexuality. Athenian society divided sexual partners upon lines of <u>active and passive, not male and female</u> – multiple reasons:</strong> <br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n </span><strong>older men were in padearastic relationships with boys when women were in abundant supply</strong> <br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">n </span><strong>many erotic contexts refer to ‘women or boys’</strong> <br />

<br />
Let me begin by observing that <u>the attitudes and behaviors publicly displayed by the citizens of Athens (to whom the surviving evidence for the classical period effectively restricts our power to generalize)</u> tend to <u>portray sex not as a collective enterprise</u> in which two or more persons jointly engage but rather as an action performed by one person upon another.&quot;/ I hasten to emphasize that this formulation does not purport to describe positively what the experience of sex was “really” like for all members of Athenian society but to indicate how sex is represented by those utterances and actions of free adult males that were intended to be overheard and witnessed by other free adult males. Sex, as it is constituted by this public, masculine discouse, is either act or impact (according to one’s point of view): it is not knit up in a web of mutuality, not something one invariably has with someone. Even <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the verb aphrodisiazein, meaning “to have sex” or “to take active sexual pleasure,&quot; is carefully differentiated into an active and a passive form</span></u>; the active form occurs, tellingly, in a late antique list (that we nonetheless have good reason to consider representative for ancient Mediterranean culture, rather than eccentric to it)64 of acts that &quot;do not regard one's neighbors but only the subjects themselves and are not done in regard to or through others: namely, speaking, singing, dancing, fist fighting, competing, hanging one self, dying, being crucified, diving, finding a treasure, having sex, vomiting, moving one's bowels, sleeping, laughing, crying, talking to the gods, and the like.&quot;&quot; <u>As</u> John j. <u>Winkler</u>, in a commentary on this passage, <u>observes,</u> &quot;it is not that second parties are not present at some of these events (speaking, boxing, competing, having sex, being crucified, flattering one's favorite divinity), but that their <u>successful achievement does not depend on the cooperation, much less the benefit, of a second party</u>. &quot; Not only is sex in classical Athens not intrinsically relational or collaborative in character; it is, further, a deeply polarizing experience: it effectively divides, classifies, and distributes its participants into distinct and radically opposed categories. Sex possesses this valence, apparently, because it is conceived to center essentially on, and to define itself around, an asymmetrical gesture, that of the penetration of the body of one person by the bodyand, specifically, by the phallus67 of another. Sex is not only polarizing, however; it .s also hierarchical. For <u>the Insertive partner is construed as a sexual agent, whose phallic penetration of another person's body expresses sexual &quot;activity,&quot; whereas the receptive partner is construed as a sexual patient</u>, whose submission to phallic penetration expresses sexual &quot;passivity.&quot; Sexual &quot;activity,&quot; moreover, is thematized as domination: the relation between the &quot;active&quot; and the &quot;passive&quot; sexual partner is thought of as the same kind of relation as that obtaining between social superior and social inferior.&quot; <u>&quot;Active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; sexual roles are therefore necessarily isomorphic with superordinate and subordinate social status; hence, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">an adult, male citizen of Athens can have legitimate sexual relations</span> only <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">with </span>statutory minors (<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">his inferiors</span> not in age but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">in social and political status):</span> the proper <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">targets</span> of his sexual desire <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">include</span></u>, specifically, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">women, boys, foreigners, and slaves all </span>of them persons <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">who do not enjoy the same </span>legal and political <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">rights and privileges </span>that he does.&quot; Furthermore, what a citizen does in bed reflects the differential in status that distinguishes him from his sexual partner: the citizen's superior prestige and authority express themselves in his sexual precedence in his power to initiate a sexual act, his right to obtain pleasure from it, and his assumption of an insertive rather than a receptive sexual role</u>. (Even if a sexual act does not involve physical penetration, it still remains hierarchically polarized by the distribution of phallic pleasure: the partner whose pleasure is promoted is considered &quot;active,&quot; while the partner who puts his or her body at the service of another's pleasure is deemed &quot;passive&quot; read &quot;penetrated,&quot; in the culture's unselfconscious ideological shorthand.) What Paul Veyne has said about the Romans can apply equally well to the classical <u>Athenians</u>: they were indeed puritans when it came to sex, but (unlike modern bourgeois Westerners) they were not puritans about conjugality and reproduction; rather, <u>like many Mediterranean peoples,</u> they <u>were puritans about virility.</u> 7 <br />

When the sexual system of the classical Athenians is described in that fashion, as though it constituted a separate sphere of life governed by its own internal laws, it appears merely exotic or bizarre, one of the many curiosities recorded in the annals of ethnography. But if, instead of treating Athenian sexual attitudes and practices as expressions of ancient Greek &quot;sexuality&quot; (conceived, in modern terms, as an autonomous domain), we situate them in the larger social context in which they were embedded, they will at once disclose their systematic coherence. For the &quot;sexuality&quot; of the classical Athenians, far from being independent and detached from &quot;politics&quot; (as we conceive sexuality to be), was constituted by the very principles on winch Athenian public life was organized. In fact, the correspondences in classical Athens between sexual norms and social practices were so strict that an inquiry into Athenian &quot;sexuality&quot; per se would be nonsensical: such an inquiry could only obscure the phenomenon it was intended to elucidate, for by isolating sexual norms from social practices it would conceal the sole context in which the sexual protocols of the classical Athenians make any sense namely, the structure of the Athenian polity. In classical Athens a relatively small group made up of the adult male citizens held a virtual monopoly of social power and constituted a clearly defined elite within the political and social life of the city state. The extraordinary polarization of sexual roles in classical Athens merely reflects the marked division in the Athenian polity between this socially superordinate group, composed of citizens, and various subordinate groups (all lacking full civil rights, though not all equally subordinate), composed respectively of women, foreigners, slaves, and children (the latter three groups comprising persons of both sexes). Sex between members of the superordinate group was virtually inconceivable, whereas sex between a member of the superordinate group and a member of any one of the subordinate groups mirrored in the minute details of its hierarchical arrangement, as we have seen, the relation of structured inequality that governed the lovers' wider social interaction.* Sex in classical Athens, then, was not a simply a collaboration in some private quest for mutual pleasure that absorbed or obscured, if only temporarily, the social identities of its participants. On the contrary, <u>sex was a manifestation of personal status, a declaration of social identity; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">sexual behavior did <strong>not so much express inward dispositions or inclinations</strong> (a!though, of course, it did also</span> do that) <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">as it served to <strong>position social actors in the places assigned to them</strong>, by virtue of their political standing, in the hierarchical structure of the Athenian polity. Far from being interpreted as an expression of commonality, as a sign of some shared sexual status or identity, sex</span> between social superior and social inferior was a miniature drama of polarization which <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">served to </span>measure and to <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">define the social distance between them. To assimilate both </span>the senior and the junior partner<span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;"> in a pacderastic relationship to the same &quot;(homo)sexuality,&quot;</span> for example, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">would have struck a classical Athenian as</span> no less <strong><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">bizarre</span></strong> than to classify a burglar as an &quot;active criminal,&quot; his victim as a &quot;passive criminal,&quot; and the two of them alike as partners in crime&quot;: burglary like sex, as the Greeks understood it is, after all, a &quot;non relational&quot; act. <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Each act of sex in classical Athens was </span>no doubt <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">an expression of real, personal desire</span> on the part of the sexual actors involved, <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">but their</span> very <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">desires had <strong>already been shaped by the shared cultural definition of sex</strong> as an activity that generally occurred only between</span> a citizen and a non citizen, between <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">a person invested with full civil status and a statutory minor</span></u>. The social articulation of sexual desire in classical Athens furnishes a telling illustration of the interdependence in culture of social practices and subjective experiences. It thereby casts a strong and revealing light on the ideological dimension the purely conventional arid arbitrary character of our own conceptions of sex and sexuality<u>. The Greek record suggests that sexual choices do not always express the agent's individual essence or reveal the profound orientation of the inner life of a person, independent of social and political life. Quite the contrary: the sexual identities of the classical Athenians their experiences of themselves as sexual actors and as desiring human beings seem to have been inseparable front, if not determined by, their social identities, their public standing</u>.72 lithe Greeks thought sex was &quot;non relational&quot; in character, for example, that is because sex was so closely tied to differentials in the personal status of the sexual actors rather than to the expressive capacities of individual human subjects. <u>Thus, the classical Greek record strongly supports the conclusion drawn (from a quite different body of evidence) by the French anthropologist Maurice Godelier</u>: &quot;it is not sexuality which haunts society, but society which haunts the body's 73 sexuality. Even the relevant features of a sexual object in classical Athens were not so much determined by a physical typology of sexes as by the social articulation of power.74 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Sexual partners came in two significantly different kinds <strong>not male and female but &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive,&quot;</strong></span></u> dominant and submissive. 7 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">That is why the currently fashionable distinction between </span>homosexuality and heterosexuality</u> (and, similarly, between <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">&quot;homosexuals&quot; and &quot;heterosexuals&quot;</span> as individual types) <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">had <strong>no meaning</strong> for the classical Athenians</span></u>: <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">there were not, so far as they knew, two different kinds of &quot;sexuality,&quot; </span>two differently structured psychosexual states or modes of affective orientation, corresponding to the sameness or difference of the anatomical sexes of the persons engaged in a sexual act; <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">there was, </span>rather, but <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">a single form of sexual experience which </span>all <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">free adult males shared</span></u> 7C_making due allowance for variations in individual tastes, as one might make for individual palates. <br />

This &quot;universal&quot; form of sexual experience could be looked at differently, to be sure, according to whether one viewed it from the perspective of the &quot;active&quot; or the &quot;passive&quot; sexual partner, but its essential nature did not change with such shifts in point of view. <u>In the Third Dithyramb by the classical poet Bacchylides,</u> the Athenian hero <u>Theseus</u>, voyaging to Crete among the seven youths and seven maidens destined for the Minotaur and <u>defending one of the maidens from the advances of the libidinous Cretan commander, warns him vehemently against molesting any one of the Athenian youths</u> (tin' êItheôn: 43) <strong><u>that is, any girl or boy</u></strong>. Conversely, the antiquarian littévateur <u>Athenaeus, writing six or seven hundred years later, is amazed that Polycrates</u>, the tyrant of Samos <u>in the sixth century B.C., did not send for any boys or women along with the other luxury articles</u> he imported to Samos for his personal use during 77 his reign, &quot;despite his passion for relations with males&quot; (I 2,540c e). Now <u>both the notion that an act of heterosexual aggression in itself makes the aggressor suspect of homosexual tendencies and the mirror opposite notion that a person with marked homosexual tendencies is bound to hanker after heterosexual contacts are nonsensical to us, associating as we do sexual object choice with a determinate kind of &quot;sexuality,&quot; a fixed sexual nature,</u> but <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">it would be a monumental task indeed to enumerate all the ancient documents in which the alternative &quot;boy or woman&quot; occurs with perfect nonchalance in an erotic context, as if the two were functionally interchangeable</span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">.</span> A testimony to the imaginable extent of male indifference to the sex of sexual objects,* one that may be particularly startling to modern eyes, can be found in a marriage contract from Hellenistic Egypt, dating to 92 BC. This not untypical document stipulates that &quot;it shall not be lawful for Philis cus [the prospective husband] to bring home another wife in addition to Apollonia or to have a concubine or ,•,,,7'i The possibility that one's husband might decide at some point during one's marriage to set up another household with his boyfriend evidently figured among the various potential domestic disasters that a prudent fiancée would be sure to anticipate and to indemnify herself against. A somewhat similar expectation is articu lated in an entirely different context by Dio Chrysosrom, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">a moralizing Greek orator from the late first century</span></u> Al). <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">In a <u>speech denouncing the corrupt morals of city life,</u> </span>Dio <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">asserts that even respectable women are so easy to seduce nowadays that men will soon tire of them and will turn their attention to boys</span></u> instead just as addicts progress inexorably from wine to hard drugs (7.150 152). According to Dio, then, <u>paederasty</u> is not simply a pis aller; it is not &quot;caused,&quot; as many modern historians of the ancient Mediterranean appear to believe, by the supposed seclusion of women, by the <u>practice</u> (it <u>was more likely an <strong>ideal</strong></u>) of locking them away in the inner rooms of their fathers' or husbands' houses and thereby preventing them from serving as sexual targets for adult men. In Dio's fantasy, at least, <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">paederasty springs <strong>not from the insufficient but from the superabundant supply of sexually available women</strong></span></u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">;</span> the easier it is to have sex with women, on his view, the less desirable sex with women becomes, and the more likely men are to seek sexual pleasure with boys. Scholars sometimes describe the cultural formation underlying this apparent refusal by Greek males to discriminate categorically among sexual objects on the basis of anatomical sex as a bisexu ality ofpenctration° or even more intriguingly as a heterosexuality indif ferent to its object,nt but I think it would be advisable not to speak of it as a sexuality at all but to describe it, rather, as a more generalized ethos of penetration and domination,52 a socto sexual discourse structured by the presence or absence of its central term: the phallus. If that discourse does not seem to have looked to gender for a criterion by means of which to differentiate permissible from impermissible sexual objects (but to have featured, instead, a gender blind distinction between dominant and submissive persons), we should not therefore conclude that gender was unimplicated in the socio sexual system of the ancient Greeks. <u>Gender did indeed figure in that system not at the level at which sexual objects were categorized</u>,* <u>to be sure, but at the level at which sexual subjects were constituted</u>.&quot; Let us not forget, after all, that the kind of desire described by Greek sources as failing to discriminate between male and female objects was itself gendered as a specifically male desire. Now, to define the scope of sexual object choice for men in terms independent of gender is almost certainly to construct different subjectivities for men and for women, to do so specifically in terms of gender, and thus to define male and female desire asymmetrically. For women and boys will qualify as equally appropriate sexual targets for adult men only so long as they remain relatively stationary targets (so to speak), only so long as they are content to surrender the erotic initiative to men and to await the results of male deliberation. A sexual ethos of phallic penetration and domination, in which the gender of the object does not determine male sexual object choice, requires the differential gendering of both desire and power: if women and boys had the kind of wide ranging, object directed desires that men have, and if they had the social authority to act on those desires, they would be more likely to frustrate or to interfere with men's sexual choices. Desire appears to have been gendered in precisely this way in classical Athens. <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Neither boys nor women were thought to possess the sort of desires that would impel them to become autonomous sexual actors in their relations with men</span></u></strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">,</span> constantly scanning the erotic horizon for attractive candidates uniquely adapted to their personal requirements</u>. On the contrary: both women and boys, in different ways and for different reasons, were considered sexually inert.<br />

<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Boys did not (supposedly) experience any erotic desire at all for adult men</span></u> ,85 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">whereas women's desire was</span> not directed in the first instance to individual male objects: it did not present itself as a longing for one or another man in particular but as an undifferentiated appetite for sexual pleasure; it arose, in other words, out of a more diffuse and generalized somatic need, determined by the physiological economy of the female body, and even then it was fundamentally reactive in character it appeared in response to a specific male stimulus</u> (whereupon, of course, it immediately became insatiable) <u>and it could be aroused, allegedly, by anyone</u> (even a woman)&quot; with the proper phallic equipment.* As Andromache remarks, with pardonable skepticism, in Euripides's Trojan Women, &quot;They say that one night in bed dissolves a woman's hostility to sexual union with a man&quot; 17 (665 66). The sexual system of classical Athens, which defined the scope of sexual object choice for adult men in terms independent of gender, was therefore logically inseparable from the gender system of classical Atliens, which distributed to men and to women different kinds of desires, <u>constructing male desire as wide ranging, acquisitive, and object directed, while constructing female desire (in opposition to it) as <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">objectless, passive, and entirely deter</span></u> 81 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">mined by the female body's need for regular phallic irrigation</span>. Instead of associating different sorts of sexual object choice with different kinds of &quot;sexuality,&quot; as we do, the classical Greeks assigned different forms of desire to different genders.</u> The relation between sex and gender in classical Athens, then, was perhaps just as strict as it is in modern bourgeois Europe and America, but it was elaborated according to a strategy radically different from that governing the relation of sex and gender under the current régime of &quot;sexuality.&quot; For those inhabitants of the ancient world about whom it is possible to generalize, <strong><u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">&quot;sexuality&quot; obviously did not hold the key to the secrets of the human personality</span></u></strong>.t <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The measure of a free male in Greek society was</span> most often taken not by scrutinizing his sexual constitution but by observing <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">how he fared when tested against other free males in public competition</span></u>. War (and other agonistic contests), not love, served to reveal the inner man, the stuff a free Greek male citizen was made of.89 <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">A striking example of this</span></u> emphasis on public life as the primary locus of signification <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">can be found in</span></u> the work of <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Artemidorus</span></u>, a master dream analyst <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">who</span></u> lived and wrote in the second century of our era but whose basic approach to the interpretation of dreams does not differ in this respect, at least from attitudes current in the classical period.&quot; Artemidorus <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">saw public life, not erotic life, as the principal tenor of dreams. Even sexual dreams</span></u>, in Artemidorus's system, are seldom really about sex: rather, they are about the rise and fall of the dreamer's public fortunes, the vicissitudes of his domestic economy,&quot; If a man dreams of having sex with his mother, for example, his dream signifies to Artcmidorus nothing in particular about the dreamer's own sexual psychology, his fantasy life, or the history of his relations with his parents; it's a very common dream, and so it's a bit tricky to interpret precisely, but basically it's a lucky dream: it may signify depending on the family's circumstances at the time, the postures of the partners in the dream, and the mode of penetration that the dreamer will be successful in politics (&quot;success in politics&quot; meaning, evidently, the power to screw one's country), that he will go into exile or return from exile, that he will win his law suit, obtain a rich harvest from his lands, or change professions, among many other things (1.79). Artemidorus's system of dream interpretation resembles the indigenous dream lore of certain Aniazonian tribes who, despite their quite different socio sexual systems, share with the ancients a belief in the predictive value of dreams. Like Artemidorus, these Amazonian peoples reverse what modern bourgeois Westerners take to be the natural flow of signification in dreams (from images of public and social events to private and sexual meanings): in both Kagwahiv and Mehinaku culture, for example, dreaming about the female genitals portends a wound (and so a man who has such a dream is especially careful when he handles axes or other sharp implements the next day); dreamt wounds do not symbolize the female genitals.'2 Both these ancient and modern dreatri interpreters, then, are innocent of &quot;sexuality&quot;: <u>what is fundamental to their experience of sex is not anything we would regard as essentially sexual</u>;* it is something essentially outward, public, and social. <u>Instead of viewing public and political life as a dramatization of individual sexual psychology, as we often tend to do, they see sexual behavior as an expression of political and social relations.&quot;' &quot;Sexuality,&quot; for cultures not shaped by some very recent European and American bourgeois developments, is not a cause but an effect. The social body precedes the sexual body.</u> <br />

<strong>This conclusion is the <u>clear theme</u> in the new study of ancient sexual behavior – we must <u>suspend</u> sexuality as a category for analyzing pre-modern societies.</strong><br />
<strong>Winkler 90</strong> (John, former professor of classics at Yale and Stanford, “The Constraints of desire,” p 4)<br />
<br />
<u>The <strong>key Foucauldian thesis</strong> is that “sexuality” is a <strong>distinctively modern construction</strong>, a new nineteenth- and twentieth-century way of speaking about the self as organized around well-defined (and therefore catalogable) sexual characters and desires.</u> It is impossible therefore to have, say, a history of <u>homosexuality</u>, since neither it not <u>heterosexuality nor even sexuality are timeless facts of human nature</u> (Halperin 1989). Since “sexuality” in this sense is a recent invention, Foucault’s fist volume, setting out this thesis about the nineteenth-century’s obsession with speaking about sex, had no reference to the ancient world. The next volumes, however, reflect his growing curiosity about how individuals came to inspect their own states of desire as if their desire were a central problem, and about the Greco-Roman context in which problems of desire had not yet been seen as problems of the self. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The introduction to Halperin, Winkler, and Zeitlin sets out many of the critical themes in this new study of ancient sexual behavior, <strong>above all</strong> the need to suspend our sexual categories (including the importance and centrality of sex) when studying another society, particularly a pre-modern one.</span></u> <br />

<strong>Vote negative as an insistent, methodological suspension of the affirmative’s tyrannical conception of homosexuality in favor of our critical genealogy.</strong>  <br />
<br />
<strong>This debate is key – the act of signing your ballot for the negative embodies the ideal of scholarly rigor that escapes from the restrictive term homosexuality. This debate round can enact what the real world cannot, acting as a critical site for pedagogy. At the least, reward the performance of our genealogy as making contradictions that are analytically informative.</strong> <br />
<strong>Halperin 2k</strong> (David M., W. H. Auden Collegiate Professor of the History and Theory of Sexuality at the University of Michigan, “How to Do the History of Male Homosexuality,” GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies - Volume 6, Number 1, p 87-123)<br />
<br />
In what follows I offer what I believe is a new strategy for approaching the history of sexuality in general and the history of male homosexuality in particular. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">My strategy is designed to rehabilitate a modified constructionist approach to the history of sexuality by readily acnowledging the existence of transhistorical continuities, reintegrating them into the frame of the analysis, and reinterpreting their significance within a genealogical understanding of the emergence of (homo)sexuality itself</span></u>. A construction ist history of (homo)sexuality, in my view, can easily accommodate such continuities and need not be afraid of or embarrassed by them. I begin where all histories of homosexuality must begin (like it or not), namely, with the modern notion of homosexuality, which, explicitly or implicitly, defines the horizons of our immediate conceptual universe and inevitably shapes our inquiries into same sex sexual desire and behavior in the past. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">If we cannot <strong>simply escape from the conceptual tyranny of homosexuality by some feat of scholarly rigor</strong> (as I once thought we could) by an <strong>insistent methodological suspension of modern categories</strong>, by an austerely historicist determination to identify and bracket our own ideological presuppositions so as to describe earlier phenomena in all their irreducible cultural specificity and time bound purity we can at least insist on taking our categories so seriously as to magnify their inner contradictions to the point where those contradictions turn out to he analytically informative. And</span> if we really try hard to make our modern definitions of homosexuality apply to the past, we will <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">place so much heuristic pressure on them that they will dissolve to reveal the shape of other, earlier categories, discourses, logics, coherences.</span> To follow the disintegration of our own concepts as we trace them backward in time can be the start of an inquiry into the alterity of the past. A genealogical analysis of homosexuality begins with our contemporary notion of homosexuality,</u> incoherent though it may be, not only because such a notion inevitably frames all inquiry into same sex sexual expression in the past but also because its very incoherence registers the genetic traces of its own historical evolution. In fact, it is this incoherence at the core of the modern notion of homosexuality that furnishes the most eloquent indi¬cation of the historical accumulation of discontinuous notions that shelter within its specious unity. <u>The genealogist attempts to disaggregate those notions by tracing their separate histories as well as the process of their interrelations, their crossings, and, eventually, their unstable convergence in the present day.</u><br />

<strong>The detailed historical approach of Greek and Roman society is a more productive <u>role for intellectuals</u> to gradually remake the world by interrupting the regimes of truth that reproduce the status quo.</strong>  <br />

Rather than starting with a reading of traditional academic analyses of the Northern Ireland conflict and offering a critique of particular ways in which the conflict has been represented and analysed in the literature, this chapter takes a step back. It considers not how or why the existing literature on the ‘troubles’ may be considered to be lacking in its analysis or its proposed solutions to the problem of Northern Ireland, but rather examines how that literature could be argued to be founded on certain prior assumptions, about the conflict and about the role of academic analysis, that are perhaps in need of challenge. I do not engage with the specific literature on Northern Ireland – I am not an expert on that particular topic – rather, I put forward a series of considerations about the ways in which work about conflicts, famines, genocides and other traumatic events is or could be framed. I argue that <u>framings that prevail in much academic or intellectual work are of a distinct ‘problem solving’ type, and that the narratives that they produce limit what can be achieved in practical, on-the-ground terms and can even be argued to perpetuate the ‘problem’ to which they attempt to provide a ‘solution’.</u> This is particularly the case, I will argue, where we are concerned with events of a violent, or what could be called traumatic, type. In summary, then, the chapter addresses ‘the problem of Northern Ireland’ by looking at how problems like this are constituted as ‘problems’ in the first place, and how this then conditions what forms of ‘solution’ become possible. Moreover, it argues, as does Nick Vaughan-Williams (2006) that <u>such problematisa- tions are often in part at least to blame for the persistence of the ‘problem’ they appear merely to identify</u>. <br />
In a sense the challenge that will be posed here is one that could be, and indeed has been, applied to much intellectual work in our particular tradition. The responsi- bility of intellectuals more generally is of course one that has been widely debated, and has resurfaced recently in relation to the so-called ‘war on terror’ (Smith 2004; Edkins 2005). To what extent can work arising from the ivory tower of academia have any relevance to the practical political choices faced by policy-makers and their opponents on a daily basis? How best can concerned academics intervene in the politics with which they would so like to be involved? Or, indeed, are they perhaps already deeply implicated in that politics, so that the question of interven- tion does not arise? <br />
There are two related but distinct preliminary points that are worth making here. First, <u>intellectuals are of course not as separate from political and social structures as might seem to be the case.</u> Antonio <u>Gramsci addresses the question</u> of whether intellectuals are ‘an autonomous and independent social group’ (Gramsci 1971: 5) as they so often appear. He argues against looking for criteria that distinguish intel- lectuals as such ‘in the intrinsic nature of intellectual activities, rather than in the ensemble of the system of relations in which these activities (and therefore the intel- lectual groups who personify them) have their place within the general complex of social relations’ (Gramsci 1971: 8). <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">We should focus not on what defines ‘an intel- lectual’ but <strong>rather on what categories are historically made available for intellectual activity and how struggles for dominance between different groups or classes can be conceived in these terms</strong></span><strong>.</strong></u> He distinguishes ‘traditional intellectuals,’ on the one hand, who have an apparent neutrality and absence of class-belongingness, but whose status and authority derives from their historical position and whose role is as ‘the dominant group’s ‘deputies’, exercising the … functions of social hegemony and political government’ (Gramsci 1971: 12) and ‘organic intellectuals,’ on the other, who are part of a subaltern group or class that is engaged in a struggle for dominance. ‘Traditional intellectuals’ are those who are commonly recognised as intellectuals: academics, writers, scientists and so on. ‘Organic intellectuals,’ on the other hand, though not recognisable as intellectuals, articulate the ‘new modes of thought’ (Gramsci 1971: 9) of their group. <u>Organic intellectuals serve to help disrupt rather than reinforce the prevailing hegemony.</u>  <br />

The second preliminary point is that <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">contemporary intellectuals in the Western context operate within a particular ‘‘regime’ of truth’</span></u> (Foucault 1980a: 133), <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">one that constitutes as ‘truth’ knowledge that is the product of scientific methods of working. Michel Foucault argues that the figure of what he calls ‘the specific intellectual’ is of central importance in present day struggles.</span> Specific intellectuals,</u> such as atomic scientists for example, who have a ‘direct and localised relation to scientific knowledge and institutions’ (Foucault 1980a: 128) <u>constitute a political threat because of their ability ‘to intervene in contemporary political struggles in the name of a “local” scientific truth’</u> (Foucault 1980a: 129). <u>In other words, because of their status as experts, and despite the fact that ‘the specific intellectual serves the interests of State or Capi</u>tal’ (Foucault 1980a: 131), <u>they remain in a strategic posi- tion to intervene on behalf of local struggles.</u> There are dangers, of course: the risk of remaining at the level of local struggles, of manipulation or control by other inter- ests, and of not being able to gain widespread support. Nevertheless, the specific intellectual should not be discounted (Foucault 1980a: 131<u>). What is important is the relation between ‘truth’ and power, and the way in which</u>  <br />
<u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">Each society has its regime of truth,</span> its ‘general politics’ of truth: <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true;</span> the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged of saying what counts as true.</u> (Foucault 1980a: 131) <br />
Foucault argues that, in our societies, the dominant regime of truth is centred on scientific discourse and the institutions that support this. The specific intellectual has a particular class position, as Gramsci noted too, and particular conditions of work, but more than that, a particular connection to the way that the politics of truth works. This gives such an intellectual the possibility of struggle at the level of the regime of truth. Of course, ‘this regime is not merely ideological or superstructural; it was a condition of the formation and development of capitalism’ (Foucault 1980a: 133), which means that interventions that challenge the regime of truth constitute a challenge to the hegemony of the social and economic system with which it is bound up. <br />
It is in this context of a particular, scientific regime of truth and the role of the intellectual that I want to discuss the ways in which the academic search for ‘causes’ and ‘solutions’ to the Northern Ireland conflict operates, and how this mode of working can prohibit change. <u><span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">The <strong>role of the intellectual</strong>, as both Gramsci and Foucault have argued, can be central to change and contestation, but it can also be part of the structures that <strong>prohibit change and keep existing structures and problem- atisations in place</strong>. </span>I suggest that <span style="background: none repeat scroll 0% 0% aqua;">the particular form of intellectual work that identifies ‘problems’ and then proposes ‘solutions’ is problematic. It <strong>ultimately rein- forces or reproduces certain ways of thinking</strong> and <strong>conceals the way that identifying something as a problem in the first place</strong> is already to take a particular stance in rela- tion to it. I argue that the alternative in the case of violence in particular is to engage in intellectual activity that brings to light struggles <strong>hidden in detailed historical records or localised knowledges – an activity that Foucault calls genealogy</strong> – and emphasises the necessity for a gradual remaking of the world, not through narrative accounts that regularise and normalise history in terms of cause and effect, but through a slow re-building, brick by brick.</span></u>
