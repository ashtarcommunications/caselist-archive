Counterplan: The United States Federal Government should set a universal cruising depth for its submarines and should disclose the cruising depth to all other submarine-operating governments. The United States Federal Government should offer to rotate cruising depths with other submarine-operating governments and should pressure all other submarine-operating governments to set and disclose their cruising depths. The United States Federal Government should eliminate the policy of following Chinese submarines with its nuclear submarines. The United States Federal Government should adopt a policy of preventing its nuclear sales to India according to the guidance of the G8. The United States Federal Government should recognize publicly China’s solid position defending the global non-proliferation regime.

Focusing on war as an event produces politics of crises and control that attempt to manage outbreaks of violence. This reproduces militarism and perpetuates the structural violence of “peacetime militarism”<br />

Philosophical attention to war has typically appeared in the form of justifications for entering into war…..tendencies to suspend or distort moral judgement in the face of what appears to be the inevitability of war and militarism.<br />

The representations of the 1AC inculcate a norm of negative peace, we should work to foster a more pacific discourse that promotes positive peace and social justice. It’s not what they do it’s what they justify- vote negative to reject the affirmatives description of peace as the absence of war<br />

The United States Congress should legislatively create a special committee of congress with the authority over the first-use of nuclear weapons. The committee should include the speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives, the majority and minority leader of the Senate, and the chair and ranking member of the Senate and House committees on armed services, the Senate committee on foreign relations, the House committee on international relations and the joint committee on atomic energy.<br />

A) Interpretation<br />
1) Reduce means to make smaller<br />
Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 2009<br />
[&quot;Reduce,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=66270&amp;dict=CALD" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=66270&amp;dict=CALD</a>, mss]<br />
<br />
reduce<br />
verb [I or T]<br />
to make something smaller in size, amount, degree, importance, etc:<br />
Do nuclear weapons really reduce the risk of war?<br />
The plane reduced speed as it approached the airport.<br />
My weight reduces when I stop eating sugar.<br />
We bought a television that was reduced (from £500 to £350) in the sales.<br />
To make a thicker sauce, reduce the ingredients by boiling for 5 minutes.<br />
I reduced the problem to a few simple questions.<br />
<br />
2) Restrict means to limit<br />
Compact Oxford English Dictionary, 2009<br />
[&quot;Restrict,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/orexxstrict?view=uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/orexxstrict?view=uk</a>, mss]<br />
<br />
Restrict • verb<br />
1 put a limit on; keep under control. 2 deprive of freedom of movement or action.<br />
<br />
3) Role of nuclear weapons is deterrence<br />
Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, 5-6-2009<br />
[Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, co-chaired by Perry and Schlesinger; William Perry, Stanford University professor and Preventive Defense Project co-director, former co-director of Center for International Security and Cooperation, former Secretary of Defense; James R. Schlesinger, Commission vice-chair, MITRE Board chair, consultant to the Departments of Defense and State, Defense Policy Board member, and International Security Advisory Board member, American Academy of Diplomacy member, first U.S. Secretary of Energy , former Secretary of Defense, former CIA director, former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, &quot;America’s Strategic Posture: The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States,&quot; United States Institute of Peace, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.usip.org/reports/strat_posture_report.pdf</a>, mss]<br />
<br />
Third, declaratory policy must reflect the central fact that the United States retains nuclear weapons for the purpose of deterrence—to help to create the conditions in which they are never used or even threatened. As argued in a prior chapter, the Commission conceives of deterrence in very broad terms, to include also assurance and dissuasion. Although the contemporary demands of deterrence are much different from those of the Cold War (and reliance on nuclear weapons has been appropriately reduced), the deterrence role of nuclear weapons remains crucial.<br />
<br />
B) Violation—adding RLOAD as a launch posture is extra-topical because it does not reduce or restrict—and Launch on warning is not a role because it does not deter others.<br />
<br />
C) Standards<br />
1) Plan has an extra-topical plank, allows the AFF to avoid debates about what US would transition to after LOW. Also allows them to claim extra-topical advantage based on adopting an RLOAD posture.<br />
<br />
2) Predictable limits- we shouldn’t have to debate cases we are less prepared for- their interpretation allows cases that involve any part of our nuclear arsenal if there is one piece of contextual evidence about role- AND debatability is less important than predictable limits and informed decision making- even if just one word or phrase precludes the RLOAD it’s a deterrent to research it as much as topical cases which makes debate unfair.<br />
<br />
3) Ground—they have to substantially reduce the role, they still allow for weapons to remain on high alert and allow for the US to launch just 10 minutes later, even if they are reduction it is not substantial enough to win a meaningful DA when the AFF gets to fiat out of nuclear war on this topic.<br />
<br />
D) T is a voter<br />

We advocate that the judge vote for negative to create a space for a new political order. That political order is affirmed through the politics of being-for-life found in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The truth-event of the resurrection is a radical act of affirmation that denies death meaning and ruptures the politics we have critiqued. Our ethic replaces the logic of reductive sacrifice (in the name of God or people) with the relentless affirmation of life that overcomes the politics of fear and allows ceaseless giving in the face of terror.<br />

Hence, the commonplace reading is not a … without fear of loss, in expectation only of the gain that is filiation and communion<br />

Forgiveness through the politics of life solves for the cycle of violence first because it rejects the logic of violence by having an individual surrender a due claim and second we replace attempting to obtain what you deserve with obtaining reconciliation with the other—only our ethics can solve for the capitalist mode of desire “less work for us more work for them”<br />

The refusal to cease suffering that is the basis of the politics of life does not disempower the oppressed—it ceaselessly affirms a new political orientation and is the only method to give agency to the most marginalized portions of society<br />

15 Apply shock to terminate a regional conventional war<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Violation: The affirmative only reduces maybe half of one mission by only disallowing attribution against inadvertent nuclear launch, which is not substantial.<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to prefer:<br />
<br />
1. Ground: allows affirmatives to spike out of disad or cp links saying they aren’t a big enough mission to effect deterrence or be perceived by Congress<br />
<br />
2. Predictability—they can say we’ll shift our focus to the other half of the mission to read unpredictable add-ons and link turns<br />
<br />
3. Explodes the limits by making any affirmative that takes away a part of a mission to be topical, it allows any permutation of certain missions like cutting a fifteenth out of all fifteen missions-makes the amount of affirmatives endless<br />
<br />
4. And, there is a topical version of the aff just stop strikes against intentional and unintentional attacks.<br />

B) Link – The aff obliterates Obama’s political capital<br />

INSKEEP: Once the Marines arrived today, they faced an eight hour firefight. … and the Afghan people would end up having gone through this combat. And that's why the shift in strategy is as important as any increase in troops. You're going from a focus on defeating the enemy in the field to securing the population.<br />

- Criteria for evaluation of arguments<br />
<br />
o This debate should be about whether or not the affirmative advocacy is desirable or undesirable. We believe the question of desirability should be resolved by imagining a world in which a plan was adopted and evaluating the consequences of that action. Specifically, the relevant question in this debate is should the United States Federal Government nuclear policy<br />
o We also believe the debaters have an obligation to communicate in a clear and persuasive manner and adapt to the judge, just like any public speaker has an obligation to adapt to their audience.<br />
o We also believe that all participants in this debate have an obligation to act in a manner consistent with the governing documents of CEDA and the ADA. Specifically, these documents are the CEDA constitution, the ADA constitution, and the ADA standing rules.<br />
o We believe our criteria for evaluating this debate is consistent with these documents for the following reasons.<br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">§ </span>1. Evaluating the consequences of political action promote the educational goals of the organizations</u><br />
<h2 id="toc25"> </h2>
 <br />
<h2 id="toc26"><a name="GSU Neg-The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion"></a><u>The resolution presents an agreed question which is the focus of the debate. Debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion</u></h2>
 <u>Ruth</u> <strong>Shively</strong><u>, former professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M, 20</u><strong>00</strong> <u>(Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 181-2)<br />
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must say “no” to- they must reject and limit- some ideas and actions. In what follows, we will also find that they must say “yes” to some thing particular, they must say “yes” to the idea of rational persuasion. This means, first, that they must recognize the role of agreement in political contest, or the</u> <strong>basic accord</strong> <u>that</u> <strong>is necessary to discord</strong><u>. The mistake that the ambiguists make here is a common one. The mistake is in thinking that agreement marks the end of contest—that consensus kills debate. But this is true only if the agreement is perfect—if there is nothing at all left to question or contest.<br />
In most cases, however, our agreements are highly imperfect. We agree on some matters but not on others, on generalities but not on specifics, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And this kind of</u> <strong>limited agreement is the starting condition of contest and debate</strong><u>. As John Courtney Murray writes:</u><br />
<strong>We hold certain truths; therefore we can argue about them</strong><u>. It seems to have been one of the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true.</u> <strong>There can be no argument except on the premise, and within a context, of agreement</strong><u>. (Murray 1960, 10)<br />
In other words,</u> <strong>we cannot argue about something if</strong> <u>we are not communicating: if</u> <strong>we cannot agree on the topic</strong> <u>and terms of argument</u> <strong>or if we have utterly different ideas about what counts as evidence or good argument</strong><u>.<br />
At the very least,</u> <strong>we must agree about what</strong> <u>it is that</u> <strong>is being debated before we can debate it</strong><u>. For instance,</u> <strong>one cannot have an argument about euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical group.</strong> <u>One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one's target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the sitting have no complaints. Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words,</u> <strong>contest is meaningless if there is a lack of agreement</strong> <u>or communication</u> <strong>about what is being contested</strong><u>. Resisters, demonstrators, and</u> <strong>debaters must have some shared ideas about the subject</strong> <u>and/or the terms</u> <strong>of their disagreements.</strong> <u>The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator's audience must know what is being resisted. In short,</u> <strong>the contesting of an idea presumes some agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about intelligibly contesting it. In other words, contestation rests on some basic agreement or harmony__</strong>.<br />
<span style="font-family: Symbol;">· </span>This is also supported by the fact that the ADA standing rules require affirmatives to have a plan text and for negatives to present a reason to reject the plan<br />
<span style="font-family: Wingdings;">§ </span>2. Our vision of debate is flexible, promotes diversity, and promotes the free exchange of ideas. While we advocate evaluating the political consequences of our plan in this debate, each debater has the flexibility to present their advocacy in the way they choose. They can interpret the resolution as a metaphor, , they can use it a mechanism for investigating our own attitudes and the way we talk about nuclear weapons. The consequences of imagining a plan can have many implications and the desirability of a plan should be determined if those consequences are shown to be greater than any alternate consequence or opportunity cost to the affirmative idea.
