US reliance on high yield nuclear weapons is undermining nuclear deterrence – redeploying non-strategic nuclear weapons such as the TLAM/N is critical to restoring nuclear capabilities<br />

This point has implications for the US nuclear arsenal’s volue for deterrence. In some instances… their possible deterrent effect.<br />

TLAM/N is the only way to compensate for the Russian numerical advantage in non-strategic nuclear weapons. Elimination of the TLAM/N makes Russian position impossible to counter<br />
Reynolds, 98, DTIC<br />
Planning of nuclear missions has been consolidated at the United States Strategic Command… balance with the Russian non-strategic arsenal.<br />

B. Participation: consultation must take plce before decisions are made so congress can participate – the permutation ensures congressional backlash<br />
Hamilton, 2<br />
Third, consultation must take place, to the extent feasible, before decisions, not after they have already been made. Congress should be given…it is most effective in advancing a foreign policy position when that position has strong support in both parties.<br />

Most productive way we can use the time we spend participating in debate this year is to explore the hypothetical effects of policy changes to government nuclear weapons policy – the aff has made a conscious decision to abandon that form of debate and this is a reason to vote against them<br />

The aff is prototypical example of cultural criticism whose very point is to be unproductive, they will claim to only affect the people in this room and it is exactly that form of naval gazing which prevents us from creating solutions to real problems.

Declatory policy cp 1nC<br />
<br />
Text:<br />
<br />
The difference between the plan and out counterplan is that the plan precludes, prohibits, and makes impossibl by fiat any U.S. first-use of nuclear weapons. Declatory policy is distinct – it’s a statement of intent about what the U.S. will do. But it does not fiat an atual prohibition on first-use.<br />
<br />
For clarity’s sake: the CP does not embrace a first-use nuclear doctrine. It establishes NFU as the guiding principle of U.S. nuclear strategy but does not preclude by fieat the chance that in some future crisis, reneging on a first-use declaration could be the vastly preferable option.<br />
<br />
This distinction is important and makes the CP competitive – the pplan is action policy and the CP is declatory policy. Under declatory NFU, it’s possible that in the face of incontrovertible evidence that an adversary is about to launch a nuclear strike, the U.S. could use nuclear weapons first.<br />
Bruno Tertrais, October-November 2009, Survival Vol. 51 No. 5, p. 26-27, “The Trouble with No First Use”<br />
The nuance is important. Declatory policies…the world viewed the U.S. actions.<br />
<br />
The net benefit---making NFU an action policy and completely prohibiting all scenarios for first-use costs hundreds of thousands of lives in an inevitable crisis---the CP’s declatory NFU enables the U.S. to override its declared posture and launch damage-limitation strikes against an imminent nuclear attacker.<br />
Bruno Tertrais, October-November 2009, Survival Vol. 51 No. 5, p. 26-27, “The Trouble with No First Use”<br />
A no-first-use policy might also have security…saving hundreds of thousands of his citizens.<br />
<br />
The CP’s the best middle ground---it refuses to tie the hands of future presidents while adopting the ubstance of NFU---the consequences of nuclear war mean declartory NFU would be only overridden in catastrophic circumstances.<br />
Wade Boese, 3-25-06, “Preventing Nuclear Disaster,” Online<br />
Nuclear weapons possessors should be published to…militarily unnecessary, and dreadfully dangerous.”<br />
<br />
Even if the risk of a crisis that justifies nuclear first use is low, you should err towards caution---you can never prove that there won’t be a contingency where first-use is the best available option.<br />
Stanley Foundation, 4-4-08, “A new look at no first use,” Online<br />
Some participants argued that the United…use might be the least bad choice.”<br />

There is another initiative that many experts advocate,…which are very much in the interests of the United States.<br />
