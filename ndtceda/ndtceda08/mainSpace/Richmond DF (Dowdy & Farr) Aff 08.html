The gov is uniquely positioned in an oppositional context with the US, is Iran. The gov of the US and Iran have long standing animosity based on purely symbolic opposition – in other words, constructive engagement and its focus are discursive – based on adv. Precisely because the structural differences are irresolveable we should not escape to blind fiat for rectification but merge our attempts at ending dehum and engaging the Other.<br />
Beeman 03 (Iran and the United States, Anthropological Quarterly<br />
“After World War II ….by their representative national leaders”<br />
<br />
PLAN USFG should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Iran by halting any encouragement of “velvet revolution’ in Iran, and it should include offering an elimination of preemptive action against them on the condition of acceptance and recognition of US de-escalation.<br />
<br />
Potential politics<br />
We are in a new era, marked by the reaction to the specter of the potential. The politics of preemption under the bush doctrine has become an ontological fan for smoking out the terrorist. This is not an empty theoretical gesture toward ontological violence rather the logic of indeterminate potentiality literally compels us to constantly identify the unknowable threats to the ordered polity. Real violence is visited upon the alterity who must be eliminate lest they threaten the constitution of the ordered Western world.<br />
Massumi, ph d prof of communication 2007 “Potential politics and the primacy of preemption,” theory and event 10.2<br />
“Preemption shares many characteristics ….its necessary condition of balancing polarity no longer obtains.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The shadow of the preemption doctrine has befallen Iran. WE are compelled to attack Iran not because they possess nuke weapons not because it maintains a constant threat to the US, rather we are compelled to strike Iran because it will have been a potential threat to the United States. We must resist striking we must resist the logic of preemption even in the face of potential catastrophe.<br />
Massumi, ph d prof of communication 2007 “Potential politics and the primacy of preemption,” theory and event 10.2<br />
“Asymmetrical warfare has come out…Are we “fat and happy” yet? Until them…”<br />
<br />
<br />
This dehumanization and refusal to compromise resides in a deep fear of the other creating resentment, driving us to eeliminate anything that in not domestic. This cycle of violence is repeated endlessly because there is always another danger lurking around the corner. <br />
Der Derian, 1998 The Political Subject of Violence p 101-105<br />
“Conventions of security act to suppress… mistrust and evil experiences”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our plan functions as a demand against Bush’s mimetic hared of the Iranian regime. Constructive engagement short circuits the self – enemy distinction that enables animosity in the first place.<br />
Der Derian 2002 War as a Game in the brown journal of world affairs<br />
“The charge of moral equivalency…if the world were prefect it wouldn’t be.”<br />

<br />
Moreover representation do effect constructive engagement and they are a location for possible intervention.<br />

“It is crucial to recognize that….and reconcile our differences.”<br />

Text: The USFg should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Syria by normalizing its relation with the Syrian government in the event that Syria pursues bilateral talks with the United States on Iraqi stability and it should include offering them a security guarantee that the United States will not seek regime change.<br />
<br />
Adv. 1 = Iraq<br />
- regime change - Asad interferes in Iraq (Leverett 2005)<br />
- this = tons of deaths in Iraq (Boot 2005)<br />
<br />
Adv. 2 = Exceptionalism<br />
- Bush Doctrine = exceptionalist (Wheeler 2005)<br />
- this = biopower and SOE (Dochterman 2002)
