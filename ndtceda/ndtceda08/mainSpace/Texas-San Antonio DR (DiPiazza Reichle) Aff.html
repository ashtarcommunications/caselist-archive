Answers To Off Case Args<br />
<br />
CP:<br />
Only makes sense in a world of consequential impacts.<br />
It’s a question of ethics.<br />
Neg’s ethics -&gt; systematic dualisms.<br />
CP doesn’t solve the aff- uses a calculative framework.<br />
<br />
Framework:<br />
Framework is an attempt to shit on the party.<br />
Neg framework doesn’t allow for value to life.<br />
We meet: we defend the overturn<br />
No ground loss- we won’t link out of disads.<br />
Ks check<br />
Disclosure makes predictability a moot point<br />
1ac is a disad to the framework<br />
Their ideas are based in herd mentality- we allow for individual education, feely 90T<br />
Counter interpretation: affs must justify their advocacy in one of the following three ways: deont, util, consequentialist<br />
Abortion is a moral question- it should be treated as such.<br />
We increase neg ground- they now get args like transcendental meaning good.<br />
PICs check<br />

Perhaps we live in a world where god is really really pissed off. Perhaps Joan Osborne was right and God is walking among us—a stranger ona bus trying to make its way home. What is this place that we call home? Britney spears is in and out of rehab, the Dixie chicks are winning grammy’s, Nicole Ritchie is disappearing and reappearing, Gonzales is impersonating Donald trump, astronauts are driving across coumtry in diapers, and anna Nicole smith is still on television… perhaps these are the things that make up a life. Why does any of this shit matter, why do we obsess over base meaningless ness? Without any guidance we are lsot in this wacky world. Abandoned, and having no way of knowing what happens when we die—we collect tid-bits of information and pretend that the factoids that we file into our minds will help us unravel the answer to our great dilemma. As a grouping of people, the culture of debate is ever attached to moral absolute and negativity and to the tragic side of life. We are told that avoidance of pain is always preferable to pleasure and that we are in a position to pretend to know why and how the world should be. The reality is that we are not in that position, in order to judge the purpose of life we would have to know the answer to the end. And so we find ways to justify our actions and negate portions of life, always hoping that somehow things can be better if only this or that were better, as though the horrible hangover shit in the morning can be avoided. The problem is that this is a sick way of viewing life that doesn’t see the freedom and beauty of existence. That this life, our one shot—our precious gift is beautiful… all of it… which includes this year’s resolution and the subsequent debate on abortion. In the decision concerning abortion the fundamental choice that the justices had to make about abortion is framed in terms of morality.<br />
Justice O’Conner et al explain in 1992. [Casey decision]<br />
“Men and women…rape or incest”<br />
Therefore Philip and I stand resolved that the United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) on the grounds that the state has no legitimate interest from the onset of pregnancy in protecting the health and the life of the fetus that may become a child.<br />
Affirm all life through a spirit of play and feeling of lightness. Our affirmation of the resolution is a revaluation of morality centering around personal morality that refuses to get caught up in suffering from life’s suffering. Instead we take pleasure in the very things that have caused us pain.<br />
Thiele 1990 (Leslie, Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: a study of heroic individualism p 186-192) “One must be able to laugh…ideal as himself”<br />
Heroic individualism and democratic representation don’t mix well. Democracy causes a herd mentality, detracts from the individual. Existential struggle with solitude is the only problem. Embrace our anti-politics and cultivation of sovereign individuals<br />
Thiele 1990 (Leslie, Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: a study of heroic individualism p 43-7) “Heroic individualism is not…within the soul”<br />
This contempt for life, or ressentiment, is the cause of fascism and Nazism and the need to justify the other as evil<br />
Mark Seem, 87, <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> p xvi-xvii “In confronting and finally…the outside world”<br />
<strong>2AC:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Framework Topicality</strong><br />
We meet—wont no link your disads<br />
1AC = Disad to your framework<br />
We get the net benefit of both frameworks<br />
The holding in Casey is a reaffirmation of Roe<br />
<br />
<strong>Ethics</strong><br />
Rather than looking to act on rule based ethics—virtue ethics bases its philosophy in how to live a life. An act in and of itself has no moral weight, but the person acting can be understood in terms of a morality—it’s a false assumption to belive that ethics is the only act based<br />
Brobjer 2k3 (Thomas, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 26, 64-78, muse) “For the past ten or…character-oriented perspective”<br />
Because an action’s consequences can’t be predicted before hand and because even the most altruistic gestures can end horrifically we prefer virtue ethics<br />
Brobjer 2k3 “Let me begin by summarizing…small together!”<br />
Aff ethic generates greater love for life<br />
<br />
<strong>Disad</strong><br />
Anti-political stance prevents backlash<br />
Disad only makes sense in roleplaying framework—its not a question of what will happen, but of our ethics<br />
Contempt for life breeds ressentiment—root cause of violence<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Counterplan</strong><br />
Counterplan is rooted in a bad ethic—the debate should be about your justification for doing the counterplan<br />
Perm—do both<br />

<br />
God hates you and nothing but his hand is stopping you from going into the depths of hell. God’s hand held you up.<br />
Jonathan Edwards<br />
<br />
Why does stuff matter? What happens when you die? Debate is attached to the tragic side of life . We are forced to know the answer to the end. This is a bad way of life that does not see the beauty of life. Abortion is framed in terms of morality<br />
<br />
Precise and only obligation is to live a life of one’s own moral. The court appears to contain the same authority of God and that’s bad. Take pleaseure in the very things that cause one’s pain.<br />
<br />
Cultivate hereoic individualism.<br />
Thiely 90<br />
<br />
Topicality<br />
1) We Meet – Defend Overrule of Casey<br />
2) No Ground Loss – Get core predictable ground<br />
3) D/A to Framework = Affirmative<br />
4) Education spurred by oneself is the best education (Individualistic Nature)<br />
5) C/I – Must defend the ethics o the plan<br />
7) Turn with mastery of the Heidegger argument<br />
8) Not Extra Topical<br />
<br />
Case<br />
1) Dualism = push for a better world<br />
Magnisum 98<br />
2) Rise above the desire to live for the other. We love all = an affirmation of this problematic bad love.<br />
Thiely 90<br />
3) Because actions and consequences can’t be predicted, we must have virtue ethics. The 1AC still has an ethical stance.<br />
4) No impact to dualism<br />
<br />
Critique<br />
1) Dualism leads to the denial of life<br />
2) Doesn’t consider the specific rights of groups<br />
3) Sense of pity for the other<br />
4) Solve the criticism if we solve for the individual<br />
5) Perm – Do 1AC and all non-competitive parts of the alternative<br />
<br />
D/A<br />
1) Case solves the terminal impact of the d/A<br />
2) Winning impact turns with democracy. It fosters a collective change mentality which is bad<br />
3) D/A = Irrelevant, must look at virtue ethics<br />
5) Claiming the other as equal = bad<br />

UTSA AFF… the aff changes a little round to round…<br />
<br />
Camus AFF:<br />
<br />
Why are we here? All things aside, this is the only real question, everything else is an answer that helps a little bit in the grand mystery, a way of describing and mapping the world that we live in. Abandoned, and having no way of knowing what happens when we die—we collect tid-bits of information and pretend that the factoids that we file into our minds will help us unravel the answer to our great dilemma. So, why do we continue to live in this world, this absurd and ridiculous reality, where we are destined to fail, where at our best, our life’s works are subject to being snuffed out by an unexpected death? The fact is that people leave this world, we don’t know why but they leave. Some decompose in the open air, some lay at the bottom of lakes, in trash cans, some are cremated—but the reality is that we will all die. This is nothing new. We live with a feeling in our hearts that things are not the way that we want them to be, we are all trained to believe that some day we will be movie gods or rock stars, first round debaters, CEDA champs, but we won’t—and that is the problem with reality, it seems to have a plan contrary to the way that we think life should be. Faced with the fact that our lives can end at any moment, and compounded by the fact that we are without instructions from our creator we are perpetually lost in this wacky world. And this is the Absurdity of reality. Faced with the absurd there are two options, suicide or continued existence without the need for meaningless goals, magical type thinking about other worlds, what if situations, and a refusal to hope.<br />
<br />
Albert Camus Explains in 1957 [Albert. Nobel Prize winner for literature. The Myth of Sisyphus and other Essays. Page 12-15]<br />
<br />
So then it is a question of the topic hail. Philip and I stand resolved that the United States Supreme Court should overrule ex parte quirin. This doesn’t mean that the Supreme Court will actually change its mind because we say so. After the events of September 11th 2001, President Bush authorized the detainment of enemy combatants at Guantanamo bay, citing the Quirin decision as precedent. Our affirmation of the resolution doesn’t come with an endorsement of every past action of the legal system, but rather this case and its discussion of the absurd cause. We aren’t members of the Supreme Court and don’t see the merit in pretending that we are. We have no problem saying that it would be nice if quirin were overruled, but we aren’t going to make believe that we can magically suspend reality for the sake of a game. We do believe that this year’s resolution, namely the quirin decision provides for an intersection with the Absurdity of life that is worth discussing. It is important to note that the information about the going on’s at Guantanamo are kept hush, and the recent “suicides” of three inmates remains a mystery, all we are told about their deaths are interpreted through military speak, as though their deaths were nothing but political… and Denbeaux and Denbeaux explain in 2006.<br />
<br />
On June 10th three… against our country.<br />
<br />
[debeaux et. Al. Mark, prof. Seton Hall School of law. June 10th Suicides at Guantanamo: Words and Deeds Compared. 21 August 2006.<br />
<br />
While we can never truly know the other and their reason for leaving this world we do believe that creating a space in the world that forces people to take their lives—as their only political recourse is wrong. It’s that simple. This discussion of suicide, the question of whether or not we should continue existing in the face of the absurd is the most important philosophical question, everything else is inconsequential.<br />
Albert Camus explains in 1957. [Albert. Nobel Prize winner for literature. The Myth of Sisyphus and other Essays. Page 3-6]<br />
There is but one serious… uselessness of suffering.<br />
<br />
So what is it that we are supposed to do, how are we supposed to live. Camus explains that when pondering the myth of Sisyphus, of a tragic hero who is cursed to ceaselessly role a rock to the top of a mountain, that we should imagine the moment when the stone is falling down the mountain, and we should imagine Sisyphus smiling. The consciousness of his plight, the understanding of the futility of his task, and his refusal to hope for another life—that is what makes Sisyphus the absurd hero. In this life we have our revolt, our freedom, and our passion.<br />
<br />
Bob Lane 1996. The absurd hero.<br />
Sisyphus is the absurd hero… the myths-retold in the works of Camus<br />
<br />
The conditions of guantanamo bay present a pressure cooker of insanity, torture, abuse, interrogations, sleeplessness, pain, water boarding, sexual humiliation… the absurd is everywhere, but guantanamo is not a space free of revolt. Abdulla al Noami explains.<br />
<br />
Clip form habeous shmabeous about an inmate dancing…<br />
<br />
Welcome to the theatre of the absurd<br />
A simpler than thou pace<br />
Fighting existentialism’s being race<br />
We dance<br />
Pantomiming reality<br />
Like shadows on Socrates cave<br />
An allegory fighting mediocrity<br />
Keeping our mind shut<br />
Frankenstein bolted and braced<br />
Stitched to the mind like Bobbit’s appendage<br />
Cause these thoughts threaten the human disgrace.<br />
<br />
A street corner visited by anyone<br />
Where once a bullet killed a president<br />
And then the idea conceived<br />
Toe keep important men out of convertibles<br />
Solved a problem without changing<br />
Walking on the moon<br />
Inside your television screen<br />
Brings Russia to its knees<br />
Anthropomorphizing of a conspiracy theory<br />
A phone booth that never saw a superman<br />
But witnessed firsthand<br />
The car chase and rape of a dividend<br />
A trailer park tornado disaster<br />
Makes the news for the first time<br />
As everyone leaves town<br />
Recording the ways we move around<br />
Like ants collecting objects<br />
A thousand times our weight<br />
As thought life were more than movement<br />
Over endless empty gates<br />
<br />
<br />
And molecules vibrating<br />
In the ways we chase love and embrace<br />
<br />
A collective refusal to dream<br />
A thousand backroads<br />
And everything between<br />
Because<br />
I have children<br />
That laugh in their sleep<br />
Smile and sing<br />
Of a life lived more simply<br />
Lovingly<br />
Honestly compassionately<br />
<br />
Had a brother told<br />
His life was small<br />
In relation with my own<br />
Falling into a shadow<br />
Dealing life’s problems away<br />
Like zip locked star kisses<br />
For suburbia to scratch and sniff<br />
<br />
What is the atomic weight<br />
Of a dream<br />
What’s the element between<br />
The flesh of skin<br />
And density of a scream<br />
Alchemists blending life with word<br />
And word with loss<br />
<br />
Abandoned in a mute universe<br />
With a silent creator<br />
A birth unknown and a death unknowable<br />
But what we need to be told<br />
Is everything’s going to be okay<br />
Soothed like a baby<br />
So we pretend we can make a difference<br />
And make a change<br />
Rearrange thought<br />
Place it in a box<br />
And take it out again<br />
When it’s convenient.<br />
<br />
Have you kissed your Stalin poster today?<br />
Or did you put a che t shirt on lay a way?<br />
Casue revolution is a happy warm spot<br />
waiting for a love hug disaster<br />
<br />
okay seriously though<br />
what have you done to incite this revolution<br />
wasting time yelling<br />
when you should be selling<br />
distributing and stockpiling weapons<br />
of capitalist destruction<br />
but don’t take it from me<br />
fire bomb your local charity<br />
escalate international hostility<br />
start a cult for the crazy religious sex<br />
make cocktails for the Molotov hex<br />
a personal impersonation imposter<br />
a twelve step recovery monster<br />
roll the rainforest in paper<br />
and inhale the trees<br />
<br />
cause your revolution will happen violently<br />
but you will always and never see<br />
the revolution inside of me<br />
this movement sees the etymology<br />
in the changing of the old guard<br />
for the avant-garde<br />
revolving door justice<br />
changing, growing, owning…<br />
all of my being<br />
<br />
politically speaking<br />
we are at the end of extremes<br />
between a hope ladder and a rope swing<br />
kissing away preconceived notions<br />
of what life should be<br />
a rejection of thought<br />
as though god were<br />
a letter carrier<br />
and a life story<br />
is delivered in times new roman:<br />
fort 12<br />
angry men on a jury<br />
to convict and condemn<br />
to mistrust, mis-own<br />
aggravate, and elevate to a level of misunderstanding beyond mystery<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
was told a single woman<br />
with two kids<br />
medical bills<br />
and a monthly check<br />
shouldn’t hit and run<br />
such a love sick, sad heroine gun<br />
but I have known<br />
a woman placed in<br />
a wishing well<br />
disheveled and thrown<br />
like finger worn dimes<br />
at the bottom of a suicide chase grid.<br />
<br />
Funny—these are the things<br />
We aren’t supposed to show<br />
Aren’t supposed to foster and let grow<br />
Cause these are the things about me<br />
That everyone has agreed to push<br />
Back and below the strongest undertow<br />
That you never want to know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Casey AFF: little miss sunshine<br />
<br />
The aff starts from a passage from Johnathan Edwards “sinners in the hands of an angry god.”<br />
<br />
Then talks about the holding of the decision…<br />
[Justice O’Connor, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter. Planend Perenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Robert P. Casey. No. 91-744. Supreme Court of the United States. 505 U.S. 833. June 29, 1992.]<br />
Men and women… rape or incest.<br />
<br />
Therefore Philip and I stand resolved that the United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) on the grounds that the state has no legitimate interest from the onset of pregnancy in protecting the health and the life of the fetus that may become a child.<br />
<br />
Then talks about how to weigh the aff (Nietzsche).. and we should embrace lightness and play.<br />
Leslie Paul Thiele explains in 1990.<br />
(Nietzsche and the politics of the soul: a study of heroic individualism… page 186-192<br />
one must be able to laugh… an idea as himself.<br />
<br />
