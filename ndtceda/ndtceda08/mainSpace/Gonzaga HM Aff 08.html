And, your slow proliferation arguments are irrelevant—Iran proliferation will be fast. They will be able to rapidly produce a virtual arsenal of nuclear weapons.<br />

Stay the present course, ……………..that we are doing something.<br />

Iran has proved ………………… this is not the case.<br />
<br />
Plan Text:<br />
<br />
Text: The United States federal government should offer the government of Iran a guarantee that the United States will not preemptively attack Iran and will normalize diplomatic and economic relations in exchange for Iran’s commitment to abandon its nuclear weapons program.<br />
<br />
The U.S. should offer Iran a grand bargain including fully normalized relations and a security guarantee in exchange for non-proliferation. The bargain is key to test Iran’s resolve, and they’d accept. Diplomacy is key to resolving the situation and isn’t appeasement.<br />

Tehran also …………….. offering the Iranians a grand bargain seems rather low-cost. 1AC -- Solvency<br />

If the logic ……………. a comprehensive agreement.<br />

The U.S. is key to any diplomatic solution with Iran – experience with EU negotiations proves Iran views any deal without the U.S. as worthless<br />
