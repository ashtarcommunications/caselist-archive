Afghanistan Affirmative- Updated post Cornell (February '08)<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
The government of Afghanistan is near collapse; the Taliban insurgency has gained ground, and the impact of the collapse is intensified by strife in Iraq.<br />
LA Times August 27, 2007 (&quot;Don't Fail Afghanistan: Iraq may be hopeless, but Afghanistan is worth defending. Here's why and how&quot;)<br />
<br />
Civilian casualties from U.S. forces have served to increase support for the resurgent Taliban, and patience with western forces is wearing thin. Inderfurth May 29,2007 (&quot;Losing the 'other war' in Afghanistan?)<br />
<br />
Violent attacks are on the rise in 2008; insurgents are gaining popularity where people have become dissatisfied with the Kabul government. Smith 2008 (&quot;Optimism turns to gloom in Karzai's hometown&quot;)<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Harms<br />
A) Afghan Instability<br />
<br />
Although Karzai has expressed opposition to civilian casualties, his inability to stop them is leading to increasing opposition, including calls for Karzai's resignation. Kay May 5, 2k7 (&quot;US Massacres of Civilians spartks protests in Afghanistan&quot;)<br />
<br />
Civilian casualties from bombings have driven civilians to support the Taliban as a means of defense. Bayani 2K7 (&quot;Afghanistan: Reconstruction Can Help Win War Against Taliban&quot;)<br />
<br />
Civilian deaths have resulted in calls for Karzai's resignation and have also helped the Taliban insurgents recruit. Johnson 2K7 (&quot;On the edge of the Big Muddy: The Taliban Resurgence in Afghanistan&quot;)<br />
<br />
Empirically, the Taliban in Afghanistan has been the source of violent attacks and its return to power would be devastating. LA Times 2K7 (&quot;Don't Fail Afghanistan: Iraq may be hopeless, but Afghanstan is worth defending. Here's why and how.&quot;<br />
<br />
If Karzai's government fails to lead, collapse and instability will follow. The Guardian 2K2 (&quot;Afghan staying power: Karzai needs friends he can count on.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instability in Central Asia leads to competitiont between nuclear powers, threatening world peace. Star 2K1 (&quot;The War Against Terrorism and U.S. Bilateral RElations with the Nations of Central Asia&quot;)<br />
<br />
B) Pakistan Spillover<br />
Instability in Aghanistan risks spillover into Pakistan and the ousting of Musharraf. Nixon Center 2K2 (&quot;Afghanistan and Pakistan: Is the glass half empty or half full? A Panel Discussion&quot;)<br />
<br />
A coup in Pakistan risks a pre-emptive strike from India. San Francisco Chronicle 2K1<br />
<br />
A coup in Pakistan risks omnicide. Caldicott 2002 (The New Nuclear Danger by Dr.Helen, Nobel Peace Prize Nominee)<br />
<br />
C)Nato<br />
Civilian deaths have hurt U.S. relations with its NATO allies.<br />
Associated Press 2K7 (&quot;Nato partners chide US over civilian deaths: Recent operations that killed 90 Afghans causing friction over U.S. Mission&quot;)<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is the key test for the future and cohesion of NATO. Koenders 2K5 (&quot;Afghanistan and the Future of the Alliance&quot;)<br />
<br />
The Nato Alliance is key to stability among its member states and preventing nuclear war. Duffield '94 (&quot;Nato's Functions after the Cold War&quot;)<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
The U.S. must establish a policy of zero civilian casualties and coordinate more closely with local authorities in Afghanistan Inderfurth 2K7 (&quot;Losing the 'other war' in Afghanistan?&quot;)<br />
<br />
There must be a status of force agreement in order to provide stability; it is the only way to affirm the sovereignty of the Afghani government. Rubin 2K6 (Afghanistan: Interview with regional analyst Barnet Rubin)<br />
<br />
Warfare in the status quo privileges the lives of American soldiers over those of civilians: we must reject this thinking. Shaw 2K2 (&quot;Risk transfer militarism: small massacres and the historic legitimacy of war&quot;)
