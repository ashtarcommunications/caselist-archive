Speaking of the virtuality of violence means you don’t give a shit about suffering<br />
Baudrillard, The intelligence of evil, 2004<br />
The reality-fundamentalists equip…affects everything today.<br />
“Constructive engagement” unsuccessfully attempts to purge all evil from discourse – in which evil responds by metamorphosing into all viral and terroristic forms<br />
Brian Donahue, Marxism, Postmodernism, Zizek, PMC 12.2, project muse, 2001<br />
In any case, many of Zizek’s arguments…order returns in the Real.<br />
Regulated exchange, of otherness and difference, mandates terror and annihilation of all radical and absolute otherness. Only by rejecting all chance for encounter can the other remain other, and viral racism be abolished<br />
Baudrillard, The Transparency of evil: essays on extreme phenomena, 1993, pg 128-9<br />
Differences mean regulated exchange…distance comes into being.<br />
The ethics of the aff are predicated on the psychodrama of othejrness: forcing the subject to reveal itself into the real of artificial dramaturgy in order to claim ethical responsibility forces the subject to become interactive and the Other to die<br />
Baudrillard 93 [above] pg 126-7<br />
People resist hegemony from the primal scene<br />

&quot;We must not challenge former conceptions - it denies both the strategy and end of reversability - our essential objectivity allows us to alter situations of certitude and destroy and political reality&quot; Baudrillard 93 &quot;an ethic founded.... and confess it&quot;<br />

<br />
the ideological exclusion of death ushers in a universal view of the human which has led to all of the violent segregations and genocides in the west<br />
<br />
baudrillard, 73 [symbolic exchange and death, page 125-131]<br />
<br />
the alternative is a differet way of thinking that thinks reversibility and duality. Our world defines every term by the exclusion of its opposite. Life is not death/desire is not seduction. Our style of thinking challenges these notions by positing a world where all of thse terms are in play at once<br />

Baudrillard, 5 [the intelligence of evil, page 208-213]<br />
