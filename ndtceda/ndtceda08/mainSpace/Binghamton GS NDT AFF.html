<strong><u>Round Seven vs BC MS<br />
Aff- Same as Wiki</u></strong><br />
Our argument attacks the managerialist mindset that dominates the status quo. This mindset precludes the possibility of any other way of relating to the world. A vote for the affirmative is a ballot which recognizes a need to reveal our relationship with being through the medium of interruption. Voting affirmative means you acknowledge the inevitability of extinction and the possibility of your own death. To exist in that anxiety allows the world to disclose itself to us for just a moment through an active “letting be” or “running ahead towards one’s own death.” This does not necessitate a plan of action fiated by the federal government in order to affirm the resolution, but it also doesn’t foreclose the possibility of engaging in it. We do not instrumentalize the resolution, we let it be and in that sense it momentarily escapes the standing reserve. We affirm the resolution, but we don’t act upon it in such a way that utilizes it as a tool.<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Cards were mostly the same as the Heidegger aff on the wiki with a few extras-<br />
SQ policies and debate rely on crisis politics which dangerously lure us into believing that USFG action averts these absurdly generic prophecies of war and doom by doing plan, when it only puts to sleep our common sense and makes meaningful political action impossible.<br />
Hannah Arendt, “On Violence,” Harcourt Press, p.7-8<br />
Under these circumstances… reality and factuality.<br />
Our affirmation allows us to reconceptualize politics as infinite potentiality and recognize that the possibility of politics is always already around us.<br />
