Framework**<br />
<br />
Debate is best conceived of in terms of a competing dialogue- the creation of a “counter-word” to accompany the “word” is necessary to create genuine understanding:<br />
<br />
Bahktin, Russian philosopher and novelist, quoted in 1990 (Ed. Biz/ell and Herzberg, <em>The Rhetorical Tradition,</em> pg. 944)<br />
“we have already had occasion.....verbal intercourse endows a word with the light of meaning.”<br />
<br />
Fairness/generic framework theory args<br />
<br />
Fairness norms are critical to fostering an effective dialogic—abandoning them undermines pluaralism and diversity.<br />
<br />
Star Muir, prof. of speech communication @ George Mason Univ., 1993. (Philosophy and rhetoric, vol. 26; pg. 290-291).<br />
<br />
Dialogic role playing is key to tolerance and empathy<br />
<br />
Same Muir article<br />
“The first response to the charge of relativism....effort to gain such insight.”<br />
<br />
Oppositional discourses stop otherization and genocide: turns the case<br />
<br />
Douglas Ehninger, prof. of speech and comm.. at U. of Iowa, 1970 (Speech Monographs, vol. 37; 110)<br />
“But this process also is reflexive.....nation from nation.”<br />
<br />
2nc Cards:<br />
<br />
Arguing only from personal conviction leads to hedonism and the silencing of marginalized points of view—a switch side model is best to promote positive values.<br />
<br />
Hicks and Greens, 2000 ( Argument at Century’s End: Reflecting on the Past and Envisioning the Future, ed. By Hollihan, 2000; 303-304)<br />
“Day’s rejection of the administrative....self-interest and authoritative tradition.”<br />
<br />
The requirement that both sides of the topic be debated is the best way to create real world social change throughout a person’s life—we challenge the approach they take to the activity itself.<br />
<br />
From the same Muir Article<br />
“A second objection to debate.....into success on the job.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Consciousness is only raised through dialogic interaction—they don't solve for consciousness raising<br />
<br />
Same Bakhtin article<br />
“idealism and psychologism....only in the process of social interaction”<br />
