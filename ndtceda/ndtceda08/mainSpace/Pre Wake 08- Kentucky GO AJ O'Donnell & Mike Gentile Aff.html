 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Observation One: Eyes Wide Shut<br />
<br />
<br />
Status quo representations of modern “Factory Farms” revolve around discursive practices of euphemisms to water down and conceal the inherent violence towards nonhuman animals for the purposes of convenience and economics. These off-topic discussions precludes any ethical questions surrounding mass slaughter<br />

<br />
Observation Two: Out of Slight, Out of Mind<br />
<br />
Factory farms are a result of modernity’s uncritical acceptance of the social distance of non-human animal that allow their slaughter to remain invisible. Attempts to rid ourselves of these factories of slaughter must focus on the PRACTICE and INTENT of such actions, otherwise society is doomed to the reinforcement of the human/non-human divide that merely absolves the guilt of killing and skirting the inevitability of violence<br />

<br />
Modernity’s predominantly …(and killing) of animal Others.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This unethical distancing from non-human animals results in a slippery slope that blurs the lines between what can and cannot be killed, or dominated. Violence towards non-human animals is historically the root cause of all forms of violence and domination<br />

Utilitarianism isn’t a reason to vote negative because at its core it encompasses all sentient beings AND our obligation to the non-human animal other prioritizes it against other rationales; however, defending FACTORY FARMING in a utilitarian calculation makes violence inevitable. Utilitarian calculations don’t apply in the context of Levinas- Our evidence is more specific than any evidence they can counter with<br />

Contention Three: To Infinity and Beyond<br />
<br />
The current relationships between humans and nonhuman animals exists within the framework of the host in the stranger; however, the nonhuman animals are the hosts for whom humanity has taken hostage- to exploit them and their subjectivity, ALL WHILE the humans are incalculable stranger allowing violence towards animals to be continued indefinitely. The 1AC is the ethical questioning and reorienting this framework allows makes facets of violence inevitable.<br />

<br />
Thus for Laycock, as for Wood, and I …par excellence<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This reversal of status quo roles by the inclusion of non-human animals into our ethical relationship yields an incalculable obligation to these non-human animals who society deems as our Other- This necessitates highlighting our own vulnerabilities in terms of accountability and mortality as well as an unconditional affirmation in order to establish an ethical framework of operation because what is important is how we choose to respond to the others<br />

<br />
<br />
And- Studies show that Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations are responsible for the deaths of over 11 billion non-human animals per year. These factory farms represent the largest facet of any other animal slaughter programs<br />

Utilitarianism isn’t a reason to vote negative because at its core it encompasses all sentient beings AND our obligation to the non-human animal other prioritizes it against other rationales; however, defending FACTORY FARMING in a utilitarian calculation makes violence inevitable. Utilitarian calculations don’t apply in the context of Levinas- Our evidence is more specific than any evidence they can counter with<br />

Contention Three: To Infinity and Beyond<br />
<br />
The current relationships between humans and nonhuman animals exists within the framework of the host in the stranger; however, the nonhuman animals are the hosts for whom humanity has taken hostage- to exploit them and their subjectivity, ALL WHILE the humans are incalculable stranger allowing violence towards animals to be continued indefinitely. The 1AC is the ethical questioning and reorienting this framework allows makes facets of violence inevitable.<br />

Thus for Laycock, as for Wood, and I …par excellence<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This reversal of status quo roles by the inclusion of non-human animals into our ethical relationship yields an incalculable obligation to these non-human animals who society deems as our Other- This necessitates highlighting our own vulnerabilities in terms of accountability and mortality as well as an unconditional affirmation in order to establish an ethical framework of operation because what is important is how we choose to respond to the others<br />

First, The Question of Hospitality: I want to dwell here on hospitality, the contradictions and possibilities of the concept, the difficulty of hospitality’s place. Derrida argues that “pure …come, the animal<br />
<br />
The focus on the process of events over the initial action of the 1AC prevents ethical policy making and is empirically the root cause of war<br />

The questioning of animal violence must take root in our discussions of factory farms because it is the most effective and ethical step towards breaking down the constructions of nonhuman animal others<br />

Contention Four- Viva La Cow<br />
<br />
The government pumps billions of dollars a year into CAFOs; these subsidies are the life blood of the factory farms. Only by ending these subsidies can CAFOs be put out of business for good<br />

Finally, only the 1AC is a genuine attempt to juxtapose infinite obligation with original intent- the1NC is just empty rhetoric<br />
