LAND VALUES 1NR<br />
1. ext the 1nc lamb evidence an abrupt sub cut devastates land value banks and agroecon the plan overturns 70 yrs of predictable govt support-immediate shift wouls dramatically lower land values subsidies make up a third of all land values – that’s lamb<br />
2. short term perception sub cuts cause massive uncertainty in land markets- even one timepolicy changes can cause land price to plummetP2rMC<br />
Oecd 98 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=evRxfHf" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=evRxfHf</a><br />
Government pollicices affect prices, uncertainty about the future, and famrers’ risk aversion…prices may be felt for many years (Featherstone and baker)<br />
3. even getting rid of one commodity subsidy reduces all land prices- the cropland market is nationally integrated<br />
Gardner 03 <em>Government Policy and Farmland Markets</em> “US Commodity Policies and Land Values” google books<br />
4. the abrupt nature of plan guarantees it spills over-devestates investor confidence in govt support and causes a severe decline in land value<br />

a second possibility would be to reduce…plus expected governmental payments<br />
5. sub cuts create the perception of declining revenue immediately causing land prices to drop across the board<br />

Second, a dollar of farm commodity program payments…persist in some form and level<br />
6. investors- perception of subsidies cuts injects pessimistic expectations into land markets- the plan spills over <br />

theoretically, the value of land is actually…lagged one or more years (e.g., Burt 1986; Featherstone and Baker 1988). 4<br />
