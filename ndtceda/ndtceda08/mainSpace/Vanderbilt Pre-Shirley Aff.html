<strong>Plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer a security guarantee to the government of Afghanistan on the condition that Afghanistan makes verifiable progress in corruption reform efforts. The security guarantee should encompass a formal commitment by the United States to increase its deployment of troops and maintain a military presence in Afghanistan.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention One: The Offer</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Afghanistan will take the offer – it wants a long-term U.S. military presence</strong><br />

Since 1998 I have publicly warned of Russia’s war preparations…optimism is about to be shattered. The Russians know this is going to happen, and they are preparing even as we fail to prepare.<br />

Contention 4: Power Projection<br />
<br />
Perception that the U.S. is abandoning Afghanistan will create a power vacuum in the region that risks instability and conflict. The belief that the U.S. is leaving emboldens aggression by Russia and other powers.<br />

If Afghanistan faces dangers from its neighbors…Afghanistan’s viability as a developing economy and relatively open society.<br />

Central Asian instability will trigger security competition that risks nuclear war<br />

However, this does not mean that US actions…depend for its security on any one of them without imperiling the security of all the others.<br />
<br />
The declining military and financial commitments to Afghanistan have created the international perception that the U.S. has begun pulling out of Central Asia. The perception that the U.S. has lost interest in the region will cause us to lose basing rights.<br />

The first key implication derived from the analysis…previously attainable by lethal means alone.<br />
<br />
Negotiating a long-term security arrangement with Afghanistan will give the U.S. credibility to negotiate analogous agreements with Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan that facilitate maintenance of U.S. military presence in Central Asia<br />
