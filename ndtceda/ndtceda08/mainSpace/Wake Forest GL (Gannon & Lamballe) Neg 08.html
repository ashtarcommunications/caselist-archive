 <br />
(A) Interpretation:<br />
<br />
“Include” means “consists of,” excluding anything other than security guarantees and foreign assistance<br />
Justice Carley, November 28, 2006, Certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, 275 Ga. App. 189, Majority Decision in Berryhill v.

Ms. Berryhill argues that the word “includes” … supra (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary (5 ed. 1979)).<br />
<br />
(C) Prefer our interpretation:<br />
<br />
1. Limits: “Constructive engagement” is a vague term and allows the aff to add almost any foreign policy change into the plan. “Include must be a limiting term. Extra-topicality is also a voting issue: severing makes it a no-cost option and we shouldn’t have to CP from the start.<br />
<br />
2. Precision: “Include” has evolved into an exact and restrictive term, both in the law and foreign policy, making ours the only predictable and educational interpretation.<br />
<br />
3. Grammar: the use of “include” to modify a more general term indicates it is a definition of that term. Grammar is the only predictable way to read the resolution in context.<br />

1) Isolationism – the perception that the US is not committed to UNCLOS causes nations to believe that the US is unreliable and will spark counterbalancing – that’s Eagleburger and Moore<br />

Syria won’t make peace – numerous reasons.<br />

Syria's failure to prevent Sunni fighters … improve Iraq's internal stability.<br />

There’s no risk of a break in the Syrian-Iranian alliance – numerous reasons.<br />
-Iran has already made significant efforts to ground the alliance.<br />
-Current Syrian and Iranian governments are hardline and anti-West.<br />
-U.S. difficulties in Iraq, weakened pro-Western government in Lebanon encourage Syria and Iran.<br />
