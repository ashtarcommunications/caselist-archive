<u><strong>Round 4 vs Cal BP<br />
Scouted by LIz Kim, Harvard</strong></u><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Aff – Georgetown HZ versus Cal BP Round 4<br />
Liz Kim, Harvard<br />
1AC – Cotton with new advantage – deficits. Same plan text and same G20 advantage, endrocrine, and brazil deforestation/proliferation impacts<br />
NEW ADVANTAGE:<br />
Obama’s cred on deficit reduction is unraveling – he must make big cuts to subsidies to reign in the deficit<br />
France 2/27/09 – </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/" rel="nofollow">__www.tcsdaily.com__</a><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“before taking office, president barak obama pledged… boondoggles like the commodity credit orporation”<br />
Plan serves as a key symbol of fiscal sanity – only farm cuts enable across the board deficit reduction<br />
Budiansky et al, 1995 – us news and world report, 2/26<br />
“efforts to slash farm subsidies will be a bellwether for budget balancers… revenue they send to Washington”<br />
Don’t evaluate the budgetary impact of subsidies in a vacuum – the principle of budget management is the key – the philosophy that a single program doesn’t matter is the root cause of the budget crisis<br />
Cbpp 6/23/-5 – center on budget and policy priorities<br />
“some of the proposed new initiatives skee to address… would have on current and future citizens”<br />
Continuing deficits spark ec and political collapse<br />
Buchanan – economics – George mason, 97 – public choice – 90.1-4<br />
“it is perhaps too easy to become strictly provincial…. Piper must be paid”<br />
Deficits lead to a hollowing out of the us industrial base and forces higher interest rates an taxes that will collapse the ec basis for us primacy<br />
Layne 06- national interest, fall<br />
“these claims might come as news to most Americans… maintain its primacy”<br />
Renewed commitment to fiscal discipline is key to heg<br />
Steil, cfr, 2005,<br />
“first maong these measures- and the … world commerce and finance”<br />
War - khalilzad<br />
Impact fw of the da is the root cause of the deficit – evaluating short term polit benefits allows infinite deferral of budget issues<br />
Committee on economic development 2005<br />
“the options for fiscal restraint today are extremely…. Adhere to guiding principles”<br />
Analyzing the plan through the lens of structural fiscal responsibility is critical – neg’s cost – benefit calculus rigs the game<br />
Buchanan again<br />
“if fiscal irresponsibility could, indeed…. Focus of attention here”<br />
And inevitability – our impact makes every da inevitable – deficits will force rapid draconian subsidy cuts<br />
CED 5 again<br />
“evidence continues to mount that such… concern about the budget”<br />
2AC responses<br />
AT: T – “as necessary” = illegit<br />
no ground loss<br />
terminal action of plan = 82%<br />
no one could target - not a moving target - will defend whenever they read a card - can challenge federal warrant<br />
no solvency advocate -no have to eliminate certain amount<br />
nearly all is not meaningless - have a specific ruling - wto<br />
wto - mandates nearly all cotton subsides x-<br />
no solvency -not no link<br />
not a voter - have to read a card<br />
ci- nearly all by context x-<br />
core of the topic<br />
competing interpretations bad reasonability better</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">AT: LOS Good w/political capital link and oceans impact<br />
no pass now x- 3-16<br />
no pass – military- industrial-complex = no passage x.<br />
lugar loves the plan<br />
lugar key to agenda x-<br />
lugar key to los - key proponent (no evidence)<br />
aig destroys pc now x-<br />
costs pol cap - next few months- going to cut subsidies inevitably<br />
AT: Buyout CP<br />
Conditionality = voter<br />
Strategy skew<br />
kills education<br />
time skew<br />
1 conditional advocacy or two dispositional advocacies<br />
perm do the cp: eliminate all - cp is not a pic - people who receive aren't receiving a subsidy -<br />
prefer our interpretation – theirs makes no sense<br />
perm do both<br />
not a subs = no solve the aff - still spend money<br />
cp not budget neutral- kills fiscal discipline x-<br />
decision making fw = root cause of fiscal problems today x-<br />
links to the disad- still reduce subsidies<br />
AT: Gender K<br />
FRAMEWORK: affirm the resolution -<br />
best policy option - definitional support - resolved<br />
representation - fairness outweighs<br />
shouldn't have to defend gendered bias of the authors - just should focus on education and subsidies<br />
sci method is better to knowledge - alt --&gt; no screen fraudulent truths<br />
brown 2006, paul, notes from a dying planet. P. xv<br />
“scientists, and scholars in general… merit our serious attention”<br />
no link - no say agriculture in the 1ac there are no reps of agriculture - can't articulate why get rid of subsidies = bad<br />
cuts are inevitable - reproduce same problems<br />
perm do both - voting issue shift due to alt = no text - no ground for 2ac<br />
specific policy solutions key to progress .. Independent truth claims better<br />
Fierlbeck, 94, katherine, history and theory, v. 33, n. 1<br />
“in many respects, even the dismally…. If they were official laws”<br />
address healthy environment - focus away from production x-<br />
perm do the plan and all noncompetitive parts of the alt<br />
link = about the farm bill and process of passage – not about the plan<br />
simple rejection is bad because no change occurs<br />
elimination of cotton subsidies key to empathy in the WTO process<br />
gathii 6, 104 mich l. rev 1361<br />
“although the Untied states and countries in the… continues to create new”<br />
Empathy is the key determinant of global peace – can steer institutions toward nonviolence and prevent conflicts<br />
David western 9 – dissertation submitted at brown university<br />
“power, justice, empathy: how and why empathy matters for peace”<br />
“in answer to a survey that tasked “what is your… pay closer attention to”<br />
rethinking is easily coopted by the right<br />
whitworth, 94 – Sandra, feminism and international relations, towards a political economy of gender in interstate and non-governmental institutions, p. 22-23<br />
“this points also to the serious limitations involved in…. political irresponsible” </span><br />
