avery and i affirm the <em>topical exile</em>, which is <em>part of</em> “Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of one or more of: Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and Syria, and it should include offering them a security guarantee(s) and/or a substantial increase in foreign assistance.”<br />
<br />
we affirm the topic by advocating a <em>policy</em> that <em>belongs to</em> the topic, belongs to the part of the topic that metaphysics calls <em>nothing</em><br />
<br />
often, affirmative teams <em>define</em> the terms of the resolution, delimit its <em>boundaries</em>, and then affirm some policy that is easily <em>located</em> within those limits – following the works of martin heidegger and william spanos, we understand this topical strategy as <em>imperialistic</em>: the roman empire <em>enacted</em> a similar strategy of “<em>staking out</em>” its territorial boundaries to <em>enable</em> an uneasy peace or <em>pax</em>, which came to be known as <em>pax romana</em><br />
<br />
william spanos <em>america</em><em>’s shadow</em> (2000) pages 10-11: “[m]etaphysics is thus a circular mode of inquiry . . . [T]he logical economy of metaphysics is also to transform the indeterminate realm of the uncanny to a condition that enables its <em>management</em>”<br />
<br />
we are not claiming that we understand the <em>T</em>ruth of everything that is, just the opposite: we present our <em>topical policy</em> as a <em>contestatory fiction</em>, that is, as a productive way to affirm the topic <em>in this room</em>, as a response to the ways contemporary debate practices <em>naturalize</em> imperialism by requiring affs to affirm topic as <em>somet</em>hing<em>,</em> any <em>thing</em> – instead, we affirm the topic <em>in time</em><br />
<br />
time or temporality <em>disseminates</em> differences, which are hard to understand, tie down, or <em>stake out</em>: these indeterminate differences <em>provoke anxiety</em> – metaphysics since rome have tried to <em>freeze</em> these differences by deciding <em>in advance</em> what <em>counts as</em> truth, knowledge, and being<br />
<br />
metaphysics <em>looks at</em> the world from <em>above</em> or at the <em>end</em> – this metaphysical mode of inquiry accommodates every difference it can into a knowable circle, staking out the boundaries of what <em>is</em>: everything else is <em>banished</em> from the circle and declared <em>unknowable</em>, <em>chaotic</em>, and often treated as a <em>threat</em> to our “<em>ordered</em>” reality – territorial imperialisms follow the <em>same</em> procedure, staking out its boundaries and either accommodating difference to its territory or banishing it to the outside: in the <em>violent</em> worlds of geopolitics, the outside is often <em>annihilated</em><br />
<br />
we affirm the topical differences invariably produced when the topic is affirmed <em>in time</em>, that is, we affirm the <em>topical exile</em><br />
<br />
spanos, <em>america’s shadow</em>: “<em>Identity is the condition for the possibility of difference</em>”: the topic is not only a readily definable and delimited set of words, phrases, and terms of art – instead, we affirm what spanos calls, the topic’s “<em>marginal</em> — [its] radical Other — that is either accommodated to or banished from the totalizing circle articulated by the concentering imperial <em>logos</em> of Western metaphysics”<br />
<br />
spanos “9/11 and the forgetting of the Vietnam war” (2003) “The lesson the Vietnam War should have taught America, but apparently has not, is that in this globalized postcolonial age, only a rethinking of America’s perennial exceptionalist mission in the world’s “wilderness . . . even the Bush administration acknowledges when its deputies remind the American public that the war against terror does not have a foreseeable end, an ongoing, undecidable war against an undecidable enemy—not to say the establishment of a perpetual national state of emergency”<br />
<br />
we are not willing to <em>forestall</em> our political response to amerika’s <em>brutal</em> interventions into, for example, the middle east until we are “<em>old enough</em>” to fulfill debate’s <em>pre</em>-political expectations of what it means for us to be good, <em>liberal humanist</em> citizens<br />
<br />
amerika’s mission in the new world “wilderness” amounted to what spanos calls an “ontological invasion,” wherein we <em>harnessed</em> europe’s “representation of ontology, gender, culture, race, education, law, economics, politics, and so on” – amerikan <em>exceptionalism</em> is an extension of the roman territorial and metaphysical imperialism, described above, to the rest of the planet<br />
<br />
with god on their side, the puritan’s and the colonists, then the nascent amerikan nation attempted the extermination of native north amerika – the mission changed as amerika began to understand itself as authorized by a “true” understanding of democracy, human freedom, and economic liberty to exploit, murder and enslave hundreds of millions of africans, chinese, and countless other immigrants – amerika embraced its colonialist and imperialist identity throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: bringing the “truth” liberal democratic capitalism to the rest of the world, for example, the phillipines, guatemala, indonesia, timor, hondorus, nicaragua, and chile – we extend our genealogy through world wars one and two, the ongoing nuclear war against the planetary indigenous peoples, the korean war: we spend some time developing the exposure of our mission in the vietnamese “wilderness” as malignant and bring the genealogy to our present missions in the middle eastern and central asian “wildernesses”<br />
<br />
we combine genealogy with heidegger’s de-struction of metaphysical imperialism, an affirmative praxis that can “articulate” argues spanos “what the problematic determining the discourse of humanism has left unsaid, to disclose and liberate by hermeneutic violence the futural possibilities that the privileged and sedimented disclosure of structure has concealed and repressed throughout the indissoluble filed of forces that constitute being”<br />
<br />
de-struction reveals to the positive, projective possibilities of politics that are sedimented through brutal metaphysical and ontological practices<br />
<br />
affirming the topical exile <em>in this debate</em> allows us the <em>best hope</em> to avoid an “apocalyptic cataclysm” by learning the lessons of vietnam<br />
<br />
spanos: “9/11”: “despite its infinitely more powerful military might, the United States lost the [Vietnam] war to the recalcitrant Other it would subdue and accommodate … all calculated to decompose the relay of American power extending back from its forward-oriented military machine, through its progressivist capitalist cultural apparatuses, to the instrumentalist (Franklinian &quot;can-do&quot;) thinking that was planning and conducting the war from the Pentagon.”<br />

They didn’t really answer arguments on point or read evidence. They said framework was genocidal, and that policymaking was bad.<br />
<br />
They said the constructive engagement pic didn’t link because they didn’t have a plan, and proved T was bad because it forced the aff to defend colonialism.<br />
<br />
They affirmed the &quot;excess&quot; of the resolution, read a lot of Spanos in the 1AC, and argued that by constructing a genealogy of American imperialism and refusing to constitute the Middle East as &quot;knowable&quot; they could resist imperialism. An aff ballot was an endorsement of that. We read a lot of framework. They said policymaking was genocidal and useless, since we aren't policymakers, and that it was more important to politicize debate on a basic level and empower the college students of America to reject imperialism. 2AR analogized topicality to a &quot;free fire zone&quot; in Vietnam: by clearing out a space for the resolution, apparently, we were authorizing the destruction of difference.<br />

iraq owes the british air force for its independence (ernst main – iraq: from mandate to independence – 1935)<br />
<br />
u.s. lost the vietnam war to a recalcitrant other: the self-destruction its end-oriented philosophical, epistemological, and cultural imperialism was due to the unanswerability of strategic indeterminancy and errancy of amerika’s other (william spanos – “9/11 and the forgetting of the vietnam” – boundary 2 – 2003)<br />
<br />
i saw cruelty and brutality from our people against the villagers because everyone was suspect and perceived as politically ambivalent (douglas anderson, 3rd battalion, 1st marines – 1967-68)<br />
<br />
u.s. air force and navy aircraft dropped 5 x as many bombs in the first six months of this year as the first six of 2006 – air force engineers are expanding its air bases to last 5-7 years of hard use – salli hussein had her legs blown off in an air attack outside abu ghraib in november, 2006: her cousin and brother were killed (ali al-fadhily – inter press service – 2007)<br />
<br />
we begin our contestatory fiction and affirm this year’s resolved-colon (we read the whole topic) – specifically, we affirm the topical exile that belongs to the topic: the nothing, spectral other that belongs to and haunts triumphant, global “truth of science” (spanos, 9/11)<br />
<br />
we affirm topic in time and as an always transforming, unevenly developed lateral field of constituted and domesticated forces between, e.g., ontology and socio-politics (spanos, heidegger and criticism 1993)<br />
<br />
to situate destructive topical affirmations always already also situates at the sites of ontology, the subject, gender, race relations, law, nature, cultural production, education, economy, &amp; socio-politics<br />
<br />
the topical relay extends from foreign assistance, security guarantees, and constructive engagement through foreign policy, geopolitics, and academic debate to ontology, politics, and all the other topical sites<br />
<br />
temporality disseminates radical difference and difference precedes identify – we do not follow the resolved-colon to some neatly identifiable set of governments, policy actions, and terms of art<br />
<br />
we affirm the topical non-being that belongs to imperialist discourses and topical instrumentalism – or, the topic’s marginal, radical other that is usually accommodated or banished by con-centering imperial logos (mono-logic) of western metaphysics – the radically marginal that belongs to the topic is incalculable and incomprehensible to many contemporary (logocentric) debate practices (spanos, america’s shadow 2003)<br />
<br />
our topical de-struction inhabits the spectre that haunts the dedifferentiating, colonizing metaphysical light, which menaces triumphalist, amerikan exceptionalism and its instrumentalist foreign policy (spanos, as)<br />
<br />
the topical (ontological) exile haunts many contemporary debate practices and structures – the visible, imperial logos produces a world picture that treats everything in time and topical spaces as problems to be solved – we affirm the political possibilities of edward said’s unhomed, estranging and de-reifying mobility – the de-centering and disarticulating strategy of nomadic vietnamese insurgents refused to be answerable or accommodated (spanos, as)<br />
<br />
we refuse to see the topic as a totalized spatial image, or as a domain to be comprehended, mastered, and exploited – we must reverse the see-er/seen binary and resist the technological age dominated by re-presentational, calculative thinking and planning<br />
<br />
we respectfully decline to colonize the errant mind with a banalizing thinking that reduces everything to standing, disposable reserve – the global triumph of amerikan hegemonic thinking, which is indifferent to the ontological grounds of sociopolitical practices and reduces opposition to the terms it opposes – the impasse of oppositional thinking limits itself to political defeat (spanos as)<br />
<br />
we renounce the topical errand in the middle eastern wilderness and its ineffable, elusive errancy: we are not practically assailable to “benign” pacification, which ends in violence against the recalcitrant other in favor of a planetary anthropo-logic (spanos as)<br />
<br />
we need a radical genealogy of amerika’s exceptionalist mission in the world’s wilderness, due to the present historical, political occasion and pax americana: even bush admits the “war on terror” does not have a foreseeable end and is aimed at an undecideable enemy, which establishes a perpetual national state of emergency (spanos, 9/11)<br />

<br />
<br />
find the possibilities of resistence from ed said<br />
<br />
<br />
guerilla strategy to the topic<br />
<br />
<br />
western binary - cant solve<br />
<br />
<br />
refuse to see the topic as a region to be exploited<br />
<br />
<br />
calculative thinking is bad<br />
<br />
<br />
decline to colonize humanities mind - people become disposable - like spanos says<br />
<br />
<br />
condemmed to think in hegemonic ways<br />
<br />
<br />
oppositional thinking is good - implore you to think this way - topical exile - renounce the topic as is -<br />
<br />
<br />
the liberal humanist discourse is the pacification of any resistance<br />
<br />
<br />
us intervention is genocidal violence - spanos says so<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>2ac</strong><br />

<br />
challenge this ideal and this imperialism<br />
<br />
america bombs the me in the name of saving<br />
<br />

<br />
racist violence in the american policy<br />
<br />
war on terrorism like vietnam are both bad - us exceptionalism - haunts americas past<br />
<br />
crutical failure is to groom debaters to be politicians<br />
<br />
