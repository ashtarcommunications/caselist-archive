Universal transcendent ethic solves. Transcendent norms of ethics allows us to recognize norms of right to life.<br />
State needs to respect right to life for ethics to be pursued in non-utilitarian ways<br />
Expanding moral community.<br />
Framework: policy option plan meaning<br />
Voting issue, reason to reject the alternative. Perm do both. Vulnerability.<br />
Existentialism bad – ignores subjectivity. If freedom exists in all situations then affirmative can enjoy freedom as well.<br />
<br />
Elimination of disagreement eliminates all rights to exist.<br />
<br />
State monopoly on legitimate violence.<br />
Abortion denies natural basis of human condition.<br />
Debate is not about liberation, it is about competing ideas.<br />

objective values good. Gay bashing. Refusing to impose morality means we cannot tell people why their values are bad. Specific to how the state chooses to respect the right to life. Beg question of whether or not they access the alternative that changes the attitude of people outside of the debate. When we engage in birth control or artificial contraception. Abortion is a refusal to welcome the stranger into the world. State has to impose morality on other people. Our ethic includes right to life, which takes out the terminal impact. Herbele, affirmation of life in every instance, suggests that life by privileged above all else, nuclear holocaust.<br />

a. Right to life solves.<br />
b. we solve the economy of sacrifice.<br />
Alternative can’t solve.<br />
Framework – advocate status quo or competitive policy option<br />
Perm – do both<br />
Doesn’t solve cloning<br />
Power relations are inescapable – resistance is always possible and transforms subjectivity.<br />
Campbell, 1998 (David, Millennium, Vol 27, No 3, p. 513)<br />
This means that there are two post-Nietzschean...forms of power’.63<br />
Turn – Agamben disables resistance<br />
Agamben’s account of biopower overlooks the insights of Foucault – power enables resistance – this is a reason that we should struggle for rights based on our inclusion in the biopolitical order rather than rejecting this order outright.<br />
Jean-Philippe Deranty, 2004 (Borderlands EJournal, Volume 3 Number 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004/deranty_agambnschall.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.borderlandsejournal .adelaide.edu.au/vol3no1_2004 /deranty_agambnschall.htm</a>)<br />
48. One can acknowledge the descriptive appeal ... than their messianic counterparts.<br />
Agamben’s kritik conflates democracy and totalitarianism – this dooms any progressive and emancipatory politics and sweeps the rug out from under groups struggling for social change.<br />
Deranty, 2004 (above)<br />
11. In the case of empirical examples, the erasure ... the struggle against oppression.<br />
Even if the state is founded on violence, this does not mean that i<br />
Turn – biopower relations are strategically reversible.<br />
<hr />
,<br />

Their alternative backfires because they rely on an unproblematic conception of sovereignty – they take for granted that sovereignty exists and that it has a determined structure, recreating the founding assumptions of sovereignty.<br />
Walker, 1999 (9 Transnat’l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 427, Fall)<br />
To imagine our possible futures is thus to encounter ... either power or authority.<br />
The alternative doesn’t solve – ‘whatever being’ promotes policy paralysis and fundamentally fails to challenge dominant forms of community<br />
Joseph 2002 (Against the Romance of Community p. xxix-xxxi.<br />
In The Coming Community, Giorgio Agamben quite similarly ... depend on and generate community.<br />
The autonomous subject is constituted through ontological violence – the glorification of the individual enacts a totalitarian rejection of our perpetual obligation to welcome the stranger.<br />
McAleer, 2005 (Graham, Ecstatic Morality and Sexual Politics, p. 158-160)<br />
Bernauer, like so many others, misunderstands ... known by the Son (Mk 13: 32; Mt 24: 36)<br />
COUNTERPLAN<br />
Multiactor fiat – counter interpretation on eor the other, utopian fiat.<br />
50 state fiat is illlegitimate – no literature, counter interpretation – not same direction.<br />
Doesn’t solve case. – DC<br />
Conditionality is bad – strategy skew<br />
Permutation – do both. – solves all net benefit – double solvency<br />
Permutation – do the counterplan<br />
Perm – plan and have the states rule that the fetus has a right to life<br />
Even if the states can act it isn’t in a constitutional context – allowing states to define constitutional personhood leads to animal rights and justifies denial of personhood of others<br />
Dworkin, 92 (Unenumerated Rights: Whether and How Roe Should Be Overruled, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 361)<br />
The National Constitution defines ... that claim ... The suggestion that states are free ... of pregnant women.<br />
Impact is no value to life<br />
Butler 2004 (Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence, xvii-xxi)<br />
Dissent and debate depend upon the inclusion ... about the effects of war.<br />
Supreme Court is critical to value change<br />
Bhagwat, 1998 (Hard Cases and the (D)Evolution of Constitutional Doctrine, 30 Conn. L. Rev. 961)<br />
Perhaps the most substantial problem with the ... that is another paper.<br />
Impact is independently extinction<br />
Bernardin, 2001 (The Catholic Church, Morality and Politics, p. 162-164)<br />
Fundamental to these shifts in emphasis ... of the consistent ethic.<br />
DISAD<br />
No uniqueness – no evidence that federalism is down now – it’s up now.<br />
US States News, 5/15/06 (Maine Wins in the U.S. Supreme Court, l/n<br />
The United States Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision ... and federalism cases.<br />
Morrison and lopez prove our argument<br />

PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey (505 U.S. 833) on the grounds that concepti possess a fundamental right to life as persons under section one of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Contention One: No Disads<br />
First, Overrule is Inevitable<br />
<br />
a) Establishment clause<br />
Weber, 1-5-07<br />
(Walter, Senior Litigation Council with the American Center for Law and Justice, National Review, “Supreme Standing”, L/N)<br />
<br />
Flast itself, however, … hear the case.<br />
<br />
b) Partial birth abortion<br />
Buffalo News, 10-3<br />
(06, “Jerry Zremski, “High court term expected to show conservative shift”, L/N)<br />
<br />
Instead, the court … of the precedent.<br />
c) Roe v. Wade<br />
Blogcritics.org, 1-12-07<br />
(L/N)<br />
<br />
The most recent … as purely opportunistic.<br />
<br />
Second, Past Rulings<br />
a) The court overrules every term<br />
O’Brein in ‘5<br />
(David, Prof. Government and Foreign Affairs at Virginia, “Storm Center: The Supreme Court in American Politics”, p. 181)<br />
<br />
The Court's reversal … those since 1937.<br />
<br />
b) Hudson v. Michigan<br />
Kennedy, 6-30-06<br />
(Ted, Senator, Washington Post, L/N)<br />
<br />
This is part … during their hearings.<br />
<br />
c) Assisted Suicide<br />
LA Times, 6-24-06<br />
(L/N)<br />
<br />
But in several … endorsed by Congress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Cloning<br />
<br />
First, The Casey courts use of due process will be expanded to create a fundamental right to cloning<br />
Journal of Medicine and Law in ‘02<br />
(Michael Bellinger, “The Constitutional Right to Therapeutic Cloning”, Fall, 7 Mich. St. J. Med. &amp; Law 37, L/N)<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court … reasoning of Casey. 69<br />
<br />
And, The court will use the Casey decision to strike down any congressional cloning action in the status-quo<br />
Journal of Medicine and Law in ‘02<br />
(Michasel, “The Constitutional Right to Therapeutic Cloning”, Fall, 7 Mich. St. J. Med. &amp; Law 37, L/N)<br />
<br />
Therapeutic cloning has … this fundamental right.<br />
<br />
But, Plan would ban cloning<br />
Lugosi in ‘06<br />
(Charles, Assistant Professor of Law at St. Thomas University, The Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy, “CONFORMING TO THE RULE OF LAW: WHEN PERSON AND HUMAN BEING FINALLY MEAN THE SAME THING IN FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT JURISPRUDENCE”, 4 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 361, L/N)<br />
<br />
Does the word … to rational regulation.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Court decisions denying personhood to the fetus allow stem-cell research and cloning– recognizing personhood would result in a ban<br />
Boston Public Interest Law Journal in ‘02<br />
(Carly Goldstein, “DIPPING INTO UNCLE SAM'S POCKETS: FEDERAL FUNDING OF STEM CELL RESEARCH: IS IT LEGAL?” 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 229, L/N)<br />
<br />
When considering the … destroys human life. 140<br />
<br />
Moreover, A total ban is critical to check cloning – it is key to enforcement – partial bans are doomed to failure<br />
Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity in ‘01<br />
(“Human Cloning: The Need for a Comprehensive Ban”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cbhd.org/resources/cloning/position_statement.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbhd.org/resources/cloning/position_statement.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
An overwhelming majority … human reproductive cloning.<br />
<br />
And, The world would model a US ban<br />
USA TODAY in ‘04<br />
(William, “Senate’s deadlock over cloning may be tough to break”, February 13, L/N)<br />
<br />
A leading advocate … controlling the process. &quot;<br />
<br />
Also, Global leaders look to the US – a strong cloning ban is key to global action<br />
Cameron et al, No Date (After 01)<br />
(Nigel, Dean of the Wilberforce Forum and Director of the Council on Biotechnology Policy, David A. Prentice, William Saunders, David Stevens, M.D., “Finding the Line Between Good and Evil: Cloning of Human Beings in Light of the Nuremberg Code”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=WA03I09" rel="nofollow">http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=WA03I09</a> )<br />
<br />
The United States … dignity of humankind.<br />
<br />
<br />
But, Without a total ban the US can’t send a signal for global action<br />
Garland in ‘02<br />
(Brent, M.S., Sr. Program Associate with the Scientific Freedom, Responsibility &amp; Law Program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science, PROFESSIONAL ETHICS REPORT , Volume XV, Number 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aaas.org/spp/sfrl/per/per28.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaas.org/spp/sfrl/per/per28.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
If the U.S. … as I do.”<br />
<br />
This prevents safe havens and human cloning<br />
Suffolk Transnational Law Review in ‘03<br />
(“CLONING CONSENSUS: CREATING A CONVENTION TO BAN HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE CLONING”, 26 Suffolk Transnat'l L. Rev. 411, L/N)<br />
<br />
The increasing forces … fundamental human rights.<br />
<br />
And, Cloning leads to a genocidal war between humans and post-humans – weapons of mass destruction will be used leading to extinction<br />
Annas et al in ‘02<br />
(George, Utley Professor and Chair of Health Law at Boston University School of Public Health, Lori Andrews, Professor of Law at Chicago-Kent, and Rosario Isasi, Health Law and Bioethics Fellow at Boston University School of Public Health, American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine, “THE GENETICS REVOLUTION: CONFLICTS, CHALLENGES AND CONUNDRA: ARTICLE: Protecting the Endangered Human: Toward an International Treaty Prohibiting Cloning and Inheritable Alterations”, 28 Am. J. L. and Med. 151, L/N)<br />
<br />
In this regard, … have serious limitations.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Right to life is key to challenge cloning – the failure end it risks a destruction of genetic and cultural diversity which is critical for human survival<br />
Wang in ‘01<br />
(Andrea, J.D. Candidate at Colorado, Colorado Journal of International Environmental Law and Policy, “Regulating Human Cloning Within an Environmental Human Rights Framework”, 12 COLO. J. INT'L ENVTL. L. &amp; POL'Y 165, L/N)<br />
<br />
Environmental human rights … of our population.<br />
<br />
Moreover, Cloning would be used by authoritarian nations to achieve global power – causes world domination<br />
Lynn in ‘1<br />
(Richard, Prof. Psychology at the Economic and Social Research Institute @ Ulster, “Eugenics: A Reassessment”, p. 302-303, 306)<br />
<br />
There can be … establish world domination.<br />
<br />
Individuals are docile subjects of state manipulation in this world – nuclear war is likely<br />
Kateb in ‘92<br />
(George, Prof Politics and Director of the Program in Political Philosophy at Princeton, “The Inner Ocean”, p. 121-123)<br />
<br />
I have said … and human extinction.<br />
<br />
Moreover, Cloning will make post-human experimentation inevitable based on a desire to perfect human life<br />
Kristol and Cohen in ‘1<br />
(William, Editor, and Eric, Fellow at the New America Foundation, The Weekly Standard, August 13, L/N)<br />
<br />
In his brilliant … is not inevitable.<br />
<br />
The impact is a biotech military with impacts comparable to nuclear war<br />
New Statesman in ‘2<br />
(John Gray, June 24, Volume 15, Issue 712, Proquest)<br />
<br />
The military uses … can be arrested.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, We’ll pre-empt your turns: embryonic stem cells are unnecessary – the following things solve<br />
a) Amniotic fluid<br />
Connor, 1-13-07<br />
(Ken, Chairman of the Center for a Just Society, “Persevere in Protecting Life”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://townhall.com/Columnists/KenConnor/2007/01/13/persevere_in_protecting_life" rel="nofollow">http://townhall.com/Columnists/KenConnor/2007/01/13/persevere_in_protecting_life</a>)<br />
<br />
Of course, this … produce cancerous tumors.<br />
<br />
b) Adult stem cells<br />
Fumento in ‘4<br />
(Michael, Author of “BioEvolution”, “Scientists in stem-cell cover-up”, May 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38633" rel="nofollow">http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38633</a>)<br />
<br />
Researchers are engaged … Prockop told Citizen.<br />
<br />
c) Cord blood<br />
New Scientist in ‘5<br />
(August 18, Andy Coghlan, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7864" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7864</a>)<br />
<br />
Hopes for treating … from human fetuses.<br />
<br />
Finally, you should prefer our authors – embryonic stem cell advocates are paid off hacks<br />
Fumento in ‘4<br />
(Michael, Author of “BioEvolution”, “Scientists in stem-cell cover-up”, May 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38633" rel="nofollow">http://wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38633</a>)<br />
<br />
Thus, ESCs have … clearly very promising.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Personhood<br />
<br />
First, the Casey court enshrined the constitutional status of un-person to fetuses – all legal scholars agree the congress and states lack any power to change this definition<br />
Kende in ‘96<br />
(Mark, Associate Professor at Thomas M. Cooley Law School, The American University Journal of Gender &amp; the Law, “MICHIGAN'S PROPOSED PRENATAL PROTECTION ACT: UNDERMINING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO AN ABORTION”, 5 Am. U. J. Gender &amp; Law 247, L/N)<br />
<br />
The two leading … as a person. 70<br />
<br />
And, this logic allows the state to designate any undesirable human being as a non-person – making legal personhood a whim of the state rather than an inherent attribute of human life is at the heart of the genocidal process<br />
Lugosi in ‘06<br />
(Charles, Assistant Professor of Law at St. Thomas University, The Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy, “CONFORMING TO THE RULE OF LAW: WHEN PERSON AND HUMAN BEING FINALLY MEAN THE SAME THING IN FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT JURISPRUDENCE”, 4 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 361, L/N)<br />
<br />
Judge Burke strongly … operation of law.<br />
<br />
Critically, An overrule of the Casey decision is needed to challenge this totalitarian conception of freedom – only fourteenth amendment personhood can restore the dignity and value of every human life by enshrining intrinsic worth of every human being under the law<br />
Lugosi in ‘06<br />
(Charles, Assistant Professor of Law at St. Thomas University, The Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy, “CONFORMING TO THE RULE OF LAW: WHEN PERSON AND HUMAN BEING FINALLY MEAN THE SAME THING IN FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT JURISPRUDENCE”, 4 Geo. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol'y 361, L/N)<br />
<br />
Linkage of the … with moral principles. 102<br />
<br />
And, scientific and medical evidence prove human life begins at conception<br />
Klasing in ‘95<br />
(Murphy, Assistant District Attorney in Harris County Texas, “The Death of an Unborn Child: Jurisprudential Inconsistencies in Wrongful Death, Criminal Homicide, and Abortion Cases”, 22 Pepp. L. Rev. 933, L/N)<br />
<br />
&quot;The unborn child, … brain-wave activity. 354<br />
<br />
Abortion initiates a war against humanity – the denial of personhood is at the heart of mass murder<br />
Fox-Genovese in ‘3<br />
(Elizabeth, Prof. History @ Emory, “Deadly Choice Abortion as a War Against Women”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-07-036-f" rel="nofollow">http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=16-07-036-f</a>)<br />
<br />
Among the many … to the challenge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, legal abortion treats the female body as a diseased object to be controlled and violated for male pleasure – this ethic of control is thoroughly anti-feminist<br />
Maloney in ‘95<br />
(Anne, Professor of Feminist Philosophy at the College of St. Catherine, “Cassandra’s Fate: Why Feminists Ought To Be Prolife” in “Prolife Feminism: Yesterday &amp; Today”, Edited by Rachel MacNair, p. 268-269)<br />
<br />
Some women's rights … their own bodies?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Ethics<br />
<br />
The plan is a gateway to calculation – the coherence of utilitarianism presupposes unconditional respect for the right to life – the alternative abandons humans to perpetual suffering and violence<br />
Rhonheimer in ‘98<br />
(Martin, Professor of Ethics and Political Philosophy at University of the Holy Cross, The American Journal of Jurisprudence, “FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, MORAL LAW, AND THE LEGAL DEFENSE OF LIFE IN A CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY: A Constitutionalist Approach to the Encyclical Evangelium Vitae”, 43 Am. J. Juris. 135, L/N)<br />
<br />
Even remaining within … in Evangelium Vitae.<br />
<br />
And, this makes your disad impacts inevitable – this perversion of social ethics fostered by the Casey decision is at the root of all mass violence<br />
Catholic Bishops of the US in ‘98<br />
(“Living the Gospel of Life”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nccbuscc.org/prolife/gospel.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nccbuscc.org/prolife/gospel.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
The nature and … no small part to Roe.<br />
<br />
Utilitarianism is incoherent – human good can’t be added in a ledger but must be only be determined by natural law – abortion is contrary to the very notion of human reason and natural order – it should be rejected<br />
Finnis in ‘89<br />
(John, Professor of Law at University College in Oxford and at Notre Dame, in “Abortion and the Constitution: Reversing Roe v. Wade Through the courts”, p. 117-119)<br />
<br />
Those supporting abortion … by modern culture.<br />
<br />
Finally, Utilitarian jurisprudence makes genocide inevitable – ethics must begin with justice conceived through natural order<br />
Rice in ‘89<br />
(Charles, Professor of Law at Notre Dame, Wake Forest Law Review, “Some Reasons for a Restoration of Natural Law Jurisprudence, Volume 24, Number 3, p. 539-571)<br />
<br />
The new ethic has … Heinrich Rommen noted:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2AC Euthanasia Add-On<br />
<br />
Casey leads to assisted suicide right<br />
Kelley in ‘98<br />
(William, Associate Professor of Law at Notre Dame, REVIEW ESSAY: INCULCATING CONSTITUTIONAL VALUES: CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, 15 Const. Commentary 161, L/N)<br />
<br />
The failure to … the fourth edition.<br />

<br />
In practice, the … will be killed. 27<br />
<br />
2AC Death Penalty Add-On<br />
<br />
Recognizing the right to life as fundamental would lead to death penalty abolition<br />
Bentele in ‘98<br />
(Ursula, Professor of Law at Brooklyn Law School, “Back to an International Perspective on the Death Penalty as a Cruel Punishment: The Example of South Africa”, November, 1998, L/N)<br />
<br />
[*290] The United States Constitution … satisfy this burden. 239<br />
<br />
The death penalty leads to extinction<br />
Riga in ‘81<br />
(Peter, Ph.D. in Theology, University of Puget Sound Law Review, 5 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 23, p. 35-36)<br />
<br />
It is often … but cannot create.<br />
<br />
2AC Medical Marijuana Add-On<br />
<br />
New challenges to medical marijuana are inevitable – the court will have to address due process<br />
King in ‘6<br />
(Andrew, Arkansas Law Review, “What the Supreme Court Isn't Saying About Federalism, the Ninth Amendment, and Medical Marijuana”, 59 Ark. L. Rev. 755, L/N)<br />

<br />
The impact is global nuclear war<br />
Beraden in ‘00<br />
<br />
2AC Free Speech Add-On<br />
<br />
An overrule is key to free speech – uniquely true for environmentalists<br />
Lugosi in ‘01<br />
(Charles, Visiting Professor of Law at University of Western Ontario, Denver University Law Review, “The Law of the Sacred Cow: Sacrificing the First Amendment to Defend Abortion on Demand”, 79 Denv. U.L. Rev. 91, L/N)<br />
<br />
A new era has … the First Amendment.<br />
<br />
That’s key to protect open scientific inquiry kills hegemony<br />
Regev in ‘6<br />
