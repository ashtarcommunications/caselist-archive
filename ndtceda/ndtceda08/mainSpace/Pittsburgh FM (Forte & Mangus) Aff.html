Pittsburgh FM v Rochester KW<br />
1AC: Morrison (New)<br />
OBSERVATION ONE: DECONSTRUCTING A MONUMENT TO THE CIVIL WAR<br />
“How does one remember an absence?” Remembering the thing itself risks negating its absence. We must remember an absence in a way that avoids displacing the past. This is the project of countermonuments<br />
Spaulding 2003 (Norman, professor of law at UC Berkeley, CONSTITUTION AS COUNTERMONUMENT:FEDERALISM, RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE<br />
PROBLEM OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1992, p lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
&quot;How does one remember…to passive spectators.”<br />
Courts uniquely affect the way we remember. When a court interprets the law, they shape our collective memory by situating the law between past precedent and present demands<br />
Spaulding 2003 (Norman, professor of law at UC Berkeley, CONSTITUTION AS COUNTERMONUMENT:FEDERALISM, RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE<br />
PROBLEM OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1992, p lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
I. Collective Memory,…evil past”:<br />
And, remembering the Civil War and the subsequent Reconstruction is challenging. These times exposed an absence of justice in the Constitution.<br />
Spaulding 2005 (Norman, professor of law at UC Berkeley, “THE DISCOURSE OF LAW IN TIME OF WAR: POLITICS AND PROFESSIONALISM DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION,” 46 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 2001, p. lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
What followed…in denial.<br />
And, the Reconstruction Amendments represented a move away from the federalist principles that had allowed slavery to persist in favor of stronger national power. But current jurisprudence remembers Reconstruction monumentally, where the very act of remembering is a form of institutionalized closure and a means to avoid recollection of federalism’s failure. The challenge is to overcome this collective amnesia by interpreting the Constitution countermonumentally<br />
Spaulding 2003 (Norman, professor of law at UC Berkeley, CONSTITUTION AS COUNTERMONUMENT:FEDERALISM, RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE<br />
PROBLEM OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1992, p lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
Courts, in sum…Virginia.<br />
Monumentalism is specifically enforced in US v. Morrison. The Morrison court’s preoccupation with the categorical boundaries between state and federal power hails the court’s revival of antebellum federalism. This federalism jurisprudence inscribes a monumental memory of Reconstruction. It is as if racial discrimination and slavery were an inconvenient historical anomaly “fixed” by the reconstruction amendments. This monumentalism means we forget that it was the federalist model itself that allowed slavery to persist<br />
Spaulding 2003 (Norman, professor of law at UC Berkeley, CONSTITUTION AS COUNTERMONUMENT:FEDERALISM, RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE<br />
PROBLEM OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1992, p lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
B. Monumentalist Memory Work… of Secession.<br />
How we remember the Civil War and Reconstruction is important. Forgetting the US history with slavery perpetuates and legitimizes racism; only by engaging with this history can we move to overcome racism<br />
Kapczynski 2005 (Amy, JD Yale Law School, “WALTER BENJAMIN AFTER THE 20TH CENTURY: THE FUTURE OF A PAST: HISTORICISM, PROGRESS, AND THE REDEMPTIVE CONSTITUTION,” 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 1041, p. lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
The most important history…felt today.<br />
We have a moral obligation to engage in institutional and collective transformations that dismantle the systemic effects of racism. Inaction is complicity with racism’s ongoing violence.<br />
KENN, 2001. [Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse University College of Law, Syracuse, New York.] “Institutionalized, Legal Racism: Housing Segregation and Beyond.” The Boston Public Interest Law Journal (Fall): 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35. p. lexis. <em>WPDU-JR.<br />
Until an effort… our lives?<br />
<strong>Thus, the plan:</strong><br />
<strong>The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), on the grounds that the dual sovereignty model of federalism must be rejected.</strong><br />
OBSERVATION TWO: RECONSTRUCTING A COUNTERMONUMENT<br />
By overruling Morrison, the affirmative is a place of constitutional demise. It is from this perspective that we can remember the Civil War and Reconstruction countermonumentally, in a way that confronts the dual sovereignty federalist model and the system of slavery that this model perpetuated. Voting affirmative is a countermemory, a resistance of the status quo collective amnesia.<br />
Spaulding 2003 (Norman, professor of law at UC Berkeley, CONSTITUTION AS COUNTERMONUMENT:FEDERALISM, RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE<br />
PROBLEM OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1992, p lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
[*2023] The federalism…collective memory.<br />
And, court action is crucial -the symbolic power of the Constitution makes court decisions uniquely suited to shape collective memory<br />
Berman 2000 (Paul Schiff, professor at University of Connecticut School of Law, “SYMPOSIUM OVERVIEW: PART IV: HOW (IF AT ALL) TO REGULATE THE INTERNET: CYBERSPACE AND THE STATE ACTION DEBATE: THE CULTURAL VALUE OF APPLYING CONSTITUTIONAL NORMS TO PRIVATE REGULATION,” 71 U. Colo. L. Rev. 1263, p. lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
The Constitution… Lessig urges.<br />
Moreover, countermonuments and the countermemories they produce is a project of resistance- they do not console but rather provoke, and demand change outside of the power of institutions<br />
Spaulding 2003 (Norman, professor of law at UC Berkeley, CONSTITUTION AS COUNTERMONUMENT:FEDERALISM, RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE<br />
PROBLEM OF COLLECTIVE MEMORY, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 1992, p lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
II. The Method of Countermemory…the Civil War.<br />
Instead claiming transcendence, counter-memory demands constant engagement with past injustices in acts of redemption. The affirmative’s project of counter-monuments infuses the court with a redemptivist mode of constitutional interpretation. This mode of constitutional interpretation uncovers discontinuities within historical narratives in an attempt to live more justly in the present<br />
Kapczynski 2005 (Amy, JD Yale Law School, “WALTER BENJAMIN AFTER THE 20TH CENTURY: THE FUTURE OF A PAST: HISTORICISM, PROGRESS, AND THE REDEMPTIVE CONSTITUTION,” 26 Cardozo L. Rev. 1041, p. lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
Benjamin thinks…disaster.<br />
Finally, this topic provides us with a unique opportunity. As we acquire legal education we must also understand how our legal fabric is still ordered around the practice of slavery. Failure to understand this relationship risks perpetuating the forces that allowed slavery to persist<br />
Levinson 1993 (Sanford, professor at University of Texas Law School, “Slavery in the Canon of Constitutional Law,” 68 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 1087, p. lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
I doubt,…of American society.<br />

The main criticism of state criminal… disparity between injury and recovery.<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE IS GENDER VIOLENCE<br />
<br />
<br />
WHILE THE SUPREME COURT APPEALS TO SEEMINGLY NEUTRAL LEGAL DOCTRINES, MORRISON CODIFIES DISCRIMINATION INTO THE LAW<br />
<br />
FIRST, MORRISON CLASSIFIES VAWA’S CIVIL RIGHTS LAW AS A FAMILY LAW AND USES FEDERALISM AS A GUISE TO AFFIRM THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DICHOTOMY<br />
<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
<br />
When VAWA was first proposed… under the guise of federalism.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, The public/private dichotomy in the Morrison decision serves as a shield, protecting abusers from scrutiny and allowing domestic violence to thrive<br />
<br />
Bevacqua and Baker 2004 (Maria, prof of women’s studies at Minnesota State University, and Carrie, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Anthropology and Director of Women's Studies at Berry College, “ ‘Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain!’: Power, Privacy, and the Legal Regulation of Violence Against Women,”</em> Women and Politics <em>vol 26 iss 3/4)<br />
<br />
This article considers issues of violence… primarily with the private sphere.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, THE IMPACTS ARE SYSTEMIC: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS INCREASING IN SCOPE ON A YEARLY BASIS. EVERY YEAR 4 MILLION ARE AFFECTED BY ABUSE WHILE MOST RAPISTS AND ABUSERS ARE NEVER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE<br />

<br />
For what emerges from analysis… accidental physical sense, a person at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO IS BIOTERRORISM<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite new reforms the United States remains unprepared to respond to a bioterrorist attack. Current federalism doctrine prevents the federal government from taking a leadership role.<br />
<br />
Kemper 2005 (Ryan R., attorney at Thompson Coburn LLP, “Responding to Bioterrorism: An Analysis of Titles I and II of The Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,” 83 Wash. U. L. Q. 385, L/N) <em>Pitt- MF<br />

<br />
Section 101 of the Bioterrorism Response Act… cover multiple jurisdictions<br />
<br />
<br />
And, states cannot effectively respond to a bioterrorist attack acting independently. Federal leadership is a necessity<br />
<br />
Buchsbaum 2002 (Lori L., Director of the Border Health Initiative of Project Concern International and JD Candidate at America University Washington College of Law, “The US Public Health Response to Bioterrorism: Need for a Stronger Legislative Approach, 7 Mich. St. J. Med. &amp; Law 1 , L/N)</em> Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
In this paper I will discuss three… public and private sectors.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But, the Supreme Court’s commerce clause doctrine of categorical federalism places issues of public health EXCLUSIVELY in the states’ hands.<br />

<br />
In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court… cannot support this interpretation.<br />

<br />
<br />
And, the Morrison decision is the hallmark of categorical federalism.<br />

Additionally, MORRISON’S VAGUE COMMERCE CLAUSE PRECEDENT UNDERMINES JUDICIAL PREDICTABILITY AND will result in Congress withholding passage of ANTI-TERROR LEGISLATION OUT of fear of court overturn<br />
<br />

AND STATES CAN’T FILL THE VOID- RELIANCE ON STATE LAWS RESULTS IN SYSTEMIC FAILURE<br />
HAGAN 2001. [Jennifer R.] “NOTES AND COMMENTS: CAN WE LOSE THE BATTLE AND STILL WIN THE WAR?: THE FIGHT AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AFTER THE DEATH OF TITLE III OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT.” DePaul Law Review. 50 DePaul L. Rev. 919 (Spring). P. lexis <em>WPDU-JR.<br />
The main criticism of state criminal… disparity between injury and recovery.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE IS GENDER VIOLENCE<br />
<br />
<br />
WHILE THE SUPREME COURT APPEALS TO SEEMINGLY NEUTRAL LEGAL DOCTRINES, MORRISON CODIFIES DISCRIMINATION INTO THE LAW<br />
<br />
FIRST, MORRISON CLASSIFIES VAWA’S CIVIL RIGHTS LAW AS A FAMILY LAW AND USES FEDERALISM AS A GUISE TO AFFIRM THE PUBLIC/PRIVATE DICHOTOMY<br />
<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
<br />
When VAWA was first proposed… under the guise of federalism.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, The public/private dichotomy in the Morrison decision serves as a shield, protecting abusers from scrutiny and allowing domestic violence to thrive<br />
<br />
Bevacqua and Baker 2004 (Maria, prof of women’s studies at Minnesota State University, and Carrie, Assistant Professor of Sociology and Anthropology and Director of Women's Studies at Berry College, “ ‘Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain!’: Power, Privacy, and the Legal Regulation of Violence Against Women,”</em> Women and Politics <em>vol 26 iss 3/4)<br />
<br />
This article considers issues of violence… primarily with the private sphere.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, THE IMPACTS ARE SYSTEMIC: DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS INCREASING IN SCOPE ON A YEARLY BASIS. EVERY YEAR 4 MILLION ARE AFFECTED BY ABUSE WHILE MOST RAPISTS AND ABUSERS ARE NEVER BROUGHT TO JUSTICE<br />
<br />
SOUTER AND BREYER 2000. [David H., Supreme Court Associate Justice; Stephen G., Supreme Court Associate Justice.] Dissenting opinion in the matter of the “UNITED STATES v. ANTONIO J. MORRISON, ET AL.; AND CHRISTY BRZONKALA v. ANTONIO J. MORRISON, ET AL. 529 U.S. 598.” Together with No. 99-29, Brzonkala v. Morrison et al., also on certiorari to the same court. Argued January 11, 2000. Decided May 15, 2000. p. lexis.</em> WPDU – JR.<br />
<br />
With respect to domestic violence,… the average sentence is 11 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the lives lost, everyday violence PARALLELS genocide and must be rejected. tO REMAIN SILENT IS TO BE complicit.<br />
<br />
Chowdhury 2002 (Rumna, JD Candidate at the University of Minnesota, “Kadic v. Karadzic – Rape as a Crime Against Women as a Class,” 20 Law &amp; Ineq. J. 91, L/N) <em>Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
The international attention begs the question… that demands immediate attention.<br />
<br />
<br />
FINALLY, GENOCIDE IS THE WORST FOR OF DEATH IMAGINABLE. THE CORPORATE ACT OUTWEIGHS ALL.<br />
<br />
Lang 1985 (Berel, professor of philosophy at SUNY Albany, “The Concept of Genocide,”</em> Philosophical Forum <em>vol 16)</em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
For what emerges from analysis… accidental physical sense, a person at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO IS FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>CITING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT IS “TRULY NATIONAL” AND “TRULY LOCAL,” THE MORRISON DECISION RELIES ON AN UNDERSTANDING OF FEDERALISM AS CATEGORICAL</strong><br />
<strong>Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:</strong><br />
<strong>Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III no.3 Dec, JSTOR)</strong><br />
<strong>“The Constitution requires… boundaries and autonomous spheres.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>ALSO, CATEGORICAL FEDERALISM IS IN PARTICULAR HARMFUL TO FEMINISM- A COMMITMENT TO CATEGORIES MAKES ALTERING GENDER ROLES IMPOSSIBLE</strong><br />
<strong>Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:</strong><br />
<strong>Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III no.3 Dec, JSTOR)</strong><br />
<strong>My willingness to stray… meaning of female and male.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>IN PARTICULAR, MORRISON STANDS AS A REFUSAL ON THE PART OF THE US TO INCORPORATE FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE METHODS</strong><br />
<strong>Resnick 2001 (Judith, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School, “Categorical Federalism:</strong><br />
<strong>Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” The Yale Law Journal vol. III no.3 Dec, JSTOR)</strong><br />
<strong>One cannot therefore dismiss… light of knowledge of gender subordination.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>AND, FEMINIST JURISPRUDENCE IS KEY TO REVEALING THE GENDERED ASSUMPTIONS OF LAW AND POLITICS THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. THESE GENDERED ASSUMPTIONS LIMIT THE WAY WE DEVISE SOLUTIONS TO GLOBAL CRISES- ONLY BY BREAKING WITH GENDERED WAYS OF THINKING CAN WE HOPE TO SOLVE EMERGING GLOBAL CRISES SUCH AS TERRORISM</strong><br />
<strong>Charlesworth and Chinkin 2002 (Hilary, Director of the Centre for International Governance and Justice and Professor of International Law and Human Rights at Australian National University, and Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science, “Sex, Gender, and September 11,” The American Journal of International Law vol 96 no 3, July 2002, accessed via JSTOR)</strong><br />
<strong>We do not want to suggest… our most pressing problems</strong><em>.</em><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>CONTENTION TWO: SOLVENCY</strong><br />
<br />
First, reverting back to the rational basis test would directly overrule the Morrison decision<br />
<br />
Goldberg 2001 (Jason Everett, “Substantial Activity and Non-Economic Commerce: Toward a New Theory of the Commerce Clause,” 9 J.L. &amp; Pol’y 563, L/N) <em>Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
In an attempt to reconcile the Morrison Court's… without acknowledging its tact.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, SUPREME COURT ACTION IS KEY- FAILURE OF THE COURT RECOGNIZE GENDERED VIOLENCE AS DISCRIMINATION REINFORCES INEQUALITY<br />
<br />
Johnson 2003 (Jennifer, Editor-in-Chief, Santa Clara Law Review, “PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON” 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, L/N)<br />
<br />
Those who seek to keep… simply reinforces its power.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ALSO, Supreme Court rulings stir national dialogue about the meaning of the Constitution<br />
<br />
Gerhardt 2005 (Michael J., professor at William &amp; Marty Law School, “The Limited Path Dependency of Precedent,” 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 903, L/N)</em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
Among legal scholars, a longstanding… the richer the dialogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and, vawa’s UNDERSTANDING OF GENDER VIOLENCE AS A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE RECONCEIVES THE VIOLENCE AS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM, INCREASES EMPOWERMENT, AND BREAKS WITH THE PUBLIC/PRRIVATE DIVIDE<br />
<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law at Camden, APPLYING THE DISCRIMINATION MODEL TO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: SOME REFLECTIONS ON THEORY AND PRACTICE, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 2003 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251<br />
<br />
The enactment of a federal statute… perpetrators of violence against women.<br />
<br />
<br />
FINALLY, EVEN IF WE DON’T SOLVE EVERY INSTANCE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AFFIRM THE plan’S stance against EXCLUSION from the lAW. Only by embracing the transformative potential of the law can we create a starting point for wider social change<br />
<br />
Weissman 2001 (Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs at UNC Chapel Hill, “Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly: Between “The Truly National and the Truly Local” 42 B.C. L. Rev. 1081, L/N) <em>Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
The indifference with which… improved legal culture to change society.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>INTERNATIONAL LAW ADVANTAGE</strong> we sometimes read:</em><br />
<br />
THE DECISION IN MORRISON NEGLECTS OBLIGATIONS CONFERRED BY INTERNATIONAL NORMS<br />
<br />
Davis 2000 (Martha, VP of NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, “International Human Rights and United States Law: Predictions of a Court Watcher,” 64 Alb. L. Rev. 417, L/N)<em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
In its decision, relying on the… persuasive under the circumstances.<br />
<br />
AND, THIS FAILURE UNDERCUTS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF US COURTS TO ACT AS A MODEL FOR PROMOTING HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
<br />
Davis 2000 (Martha, VP of NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, “International Human Rights and United States Law: Predictions of a Court Watcher,” 64 Alb. L. Rev. 417, L/N)</em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
United States courts' failure… reference to international law.<br />
COURT COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL NORMS WOULD BE THE BEST MODEL FOR GLOBAL HUMAN RIGHTS<br />
Schaack 2004 (Beth Van, prof of law at Santa Clara Univeristy, “With All Deliberate Speed: Civil Human Rights Litigation as a Tool for Social Change,” 57 Vand. L. Rev. 2305, L/N)<em>pitt-mf<br />
While ATCA-style litigation… Europe and elsewhere.<br />
SPECIFICALLY, U.S. ACTION AGAINST DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ACTUALIZES A GLOBAL NORM OF UNIVERSAL JUSTICE<br />
Copelon 2003 (Rhonda, professor of law at City University of NY School of Law, “International Human Rights Dimensions of Intimate Violence: Another Strand in the Dialectic of Feminist Lawmaking,” 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 865, L/N)</em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
At the same time, intimate gender-based… human security and human rights generally.<br />
<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE’S DEMAND FOR INTERNATIONAL LAW NOURISHES A POLITICS GROUNDED IN UNIVERSAL DIGNITY. THIS APPROACH TO SUFFERING ENACTS A FRAMEWORK THAT NOT ONLY RUPTURES THE WESTERN COLONIALIST APPROACH TO HUMAN RIGHTS, BUT IS ALSO THE ONLY MECHANISM FOR STAVING OFF THE MOST EXTREME GLOBAL ATROCITIES<br />
<br />
Raskin 1999 (Marcus, prof of public policy at George Washington University, “Re-framing International Law for the 21st Century: The International Law of Reconstruction,” 9 Transnat’l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 513, L/N)<em>pitt-mf<br />
[*514] Like law itself, international law… showed itself in the twentieth century.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FAILING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE JUSTICE INTO GLOBAL POLITICS MAKES PLANETARY EXTERMINATION INEVITABLE<br />
<br />
Tyson 2003 (Paul, “Linking the Global Economy to the Global Ethic,” Centre for Social Change Research at Queensland University of Technology, paper presented on Nov 21, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00000132/01/Paul_Tyson.pdf%29//" rel="nofollow">http://eprints.qut.edu.au/archive/00000132/01/Paul_Tyson.pdf)//</a> pitt-mf<br />
I confess, I am hoping to see a global revolution… and possibly the globe itself.<br />

<br />
<strong>OTHER STUFF:</strong><br />
<br />
Most times we include an underview at the end of the 1ac with evidence that many Supreme Court overrules are coming.<br />
<br />
2ac answers we seem to read a lot are…<br />
<br />
2AC AT: COURT CAPITAL<br />
Controversial decisions increase court capital<br />
ERWIN CHEMERINSKY [prof law, USC] FALL, 1994 “GUARANTEEING A REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT: CASES UNDER THE GUARANTEE CLAUSE SHOULD BE JUSTICIABLE.” 65 U. Colo. L. Rev. 849 LN</em> WPDU – JMM<br />
History demonstrates that judicial credibility… necessarily evolutionary design<br />
<br />
Court capital is resilient<br />

WALTENBURG [purdue], 2001. “The Legitimacy-conferring Authority of the U.S. Supreme Court” American Politics Research, Vol. 29, No. 6, 566-591 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://apr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/29/6/566" rel="nofollow">http://apr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/29/6/566</a><em> WPDU - JMM<br />
The ability of any political institution… promotes its policy authority.<br />
<br />
2AC AT: FEDERALISM<br />
Morrison’s model of cooperative federalism is key to prevent democratic deficits abroad<br />
Amman 2004 (Alfred C., Roscoe C. O'Byrne Professor of Law at Indiana University School of Law, “Federalism Through a Global Lens: A Call for Deferential Judicial Review,” </em>Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies<em> 11.1, accessed via Project Muse)Consider, for instance, the Court's invalidation of… democracy deficits and poverty.</em>
