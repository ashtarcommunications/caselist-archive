This debate is a sky-scraper stretching its ugly head up out of our populous deserts, craning its stiff neck in this blue sky, looking for the platform on which we stand, looking, tasting, feeling, our minds snaking out along sense-perceptions into the shadowy distance. What are we looking for? We have been searching the desert along time for strange creatures with poisonous spines that live in the shadows and come out at night to hunt one another and fornicate wildly, evolving and transmuting into one another as they feast and reach climaxes thrumming with shrieks of joy—they are fascinating creatures and we have been studying them for along time, we are scientists, taxonomists, data-gatherers, we have video footage of their feeding habits and know all of the places that they hide their purple gobs of shit deep in the black sand of this populous desert. We know how they run and fly, we have a couple grad students who get paid peanuts in work-study just to count the number of testicles that hang off their tentacles and describe in detail exactly what colors they turn whenever these little monsters get excited. We’ve measured the pitch of their shrieks and know the exact timbre, duration, oscillation and wavelength of their ear-shattering orgasms. We are almost ready to publish our encyclopedia entirely filled with the information that we’ve documented and organized alphabetically to avoid confusion, we’ve almost finished writing a grammar of their language and we’ve given them all cute names from TV shows like Captain Kirk and Pacey from Dawson’s Creek. But damn them, they’re furious critters! Every time we turn around they’re up to something else, turning into one another, pulling each other out of hats like rabbits, swallowing their children and then re-assembling by blowing them out their noses, they drink their cactus tea with Yage and special fungus and sit around laughing, some of them have even become human, if you can believe it or not. The encyclopedia is on its seven hundredth revision with all of the new features updated and included, but it looks like we’ll never see the end of it! So we got tired, cynical, disenchanted with the whole process. The grad students said: What’s the fucking point? and a lot of our senior researchers didn’t even have a word to say to them, they just shrugged and looked down at their shoe-laces. The creatures didn’t care, while we were worrying about our precious knowledge they played a game of polo-cricket riding on horse-spirits wearing necklaces of teeth.. We stopped our observation, abandoned our posts and went to sit down with them around their odorous fires, we assimilated ourselves to their morphogenesis and started creatively destroying our own habits of perception, learned new techniques for refracting light in our eyes to see the ghosts of the past wandering out in the wasteland, cooing their forgotten tragedies and moaning for sensations of the flesh—these strange protean creatures have taught us how to live again. But we were still looking for a new vantage point to destroy our theories with and wanted to learn more about the tangled sources of ancient wisdom and the secrets of the future, so the creatures gave us directions to travel in our dreams across the desert of black sand to the top of this tower, an ugly sky-scraper that has never existed and is now decrepit, filled with nothingness-- it is truly an eyesore and only the ghosts like to hang out in it because it makes their moans echo for further across the landscape. We stand on a platform of this megalith and look out over the desert through our cathectic eyeballs, we can only form these shapes as outlines like a bat echo-locating everything around with high-pitched squeaks and our far-away matter-brains are filling in all of the colors wrong in sickening pea-green and magenta. Everyone has vertigo but no one can throw-up since we conveniently left our stomachs back at base camp. The creatures have taught us how to understand this platform and informed us not to believe the ghosts who lie and shriek just to get attention, saying that we’re only hallucinating, that this is nothing but a collective fantasy that we’ve all egged each other on to step inside of. What is this skyscraper in the desert, and what is that we encounter? In every direction, the future stretches out along a dreamscape of fractal images that represent the different combinatorial possibilities of advancing seconds. In one we see indigenous people’s winning guerilla war victories against agents of imperialism, in another we see those same people’s children sewing the seams of designer shoes in a sweat shop with smiling advertisements and sickening slogans coating the walls like shiny mucus. In one we see a technological utopia where everyone seems happy and is playing peacefully with robots in the sunny grass, but less than a kilometer away  are the mushroom clouds and leukemia and people with mutant limbs surviving in the mountains and forests, hunting predators and subsisting off of berries. Like the creatures who pointed our way here, the scenery is constantly changing, as different varieties of possibilities are combined into different possible futures, many of which are echoes of the past. We could stand here for years, centuries and still not see everything. We see cycles and loops create systemic drift; as new events happen they add to the number of possibilities that this skyscraper-dreamscaper can generate—every instant a new book gets written of the future of the history of humanity and every instant millions of those books become possible and as the sky exhales and groans like we’re inside a pair of veiny lungs. We see these different paths of history picked out in radiant pictograms. Now pirates rule the world through a network of mobile floating cities that travel around plundering the riches of the greedy land-lubbers who are actually their subjects, now the North American continent is a spoiled nuclear wasteland being repopulated with heavily medicated Han Chinese who all wear lead vests, now someone has figured out how to poison the sunlight and unleashed a solar genocide on those Nords living under the ozone hole, now Antarctica has melted and frozen like microwaved ice-cream put back in the freezer, all covered with beautiful ice crystals ten thousand feet tall. We behold a silent splendor the likes of which none of us have ever seen. This is the disclosure of an infinite world, and we are fixated until one by one we fall into an unconscious stupor, awaking back to our naked bodies shivering feverishly in the desert night, being cared for by an empathetic creature with a devil’s tail and iridescent green spines. We fall asleep again dreaming of wandering around a carnival, trying on masks of the killers, the saviors, the heroes, the peasants, the lovers, the forgotten. Our faces are burning when we wake up to write the seven hundred and first revision of our manuscript but this time it’s not an encyclopedia, this time we stream our words to convey a sense of an arbitrary world full of peculiar perceptions that are treated as absolute truth. The saying goes: If you work in a windshield factory with a crack in your glasses, how many good windshields do you say are broken? We’re learning how to read the cracks that form our own metaphysical glasses like tea leaves, to understand the peculiar HOW of encountering the surrounding flows of raw material adding things through our own perceptual apparatus that was never there to begin with but always could have been. What we assemble for ourselves out of the rhizomatic circulations are arbitrary constructions that we may pretend are straight lines like some kind of massive, unitary BLUE PRINT, that stands over this desert like a marbled mausoleum crushing the life out of  the swirling patterns in the sand and the songs of birds—BOB WHITE, BOB WHITE— everything that charms our lives is pressed underground and all that is left is the desert with an abandoned sky-scraper filled with nostalgic ghosts. These little spiny creatures who have taught us so much are humans UN-disguised, they hold up nets in the desert wind and fish for fragments of a fluid design, they chart different competing logics that guide the flows, they draw pictures and sing songs to express their findings but they have no theories, only what they can sense themselves, they have no philosophers, only what they can think themselves.<br />
<br />
Here we have caught a fragment of design in our wind-net, from a 1986 short story by Stephen King:<br />
<br />
...if there is such a thing, if there’s a God who could simultaneously love us enough to serve us His own Son on a cross and send us all on a rocket-sled to hell just because one stupid bitch bit a bad apple, then the curse was just this: He made us like wasps instead of bees...<br />
Bees are nature’s kamikaze pilots, Bow-Wow. Look in that glass box, you’ll see the two who stung me lying dead at the bottom. Their stingers are barbed, like fish hooks. They slide in easy. When they pull out, they disembowel themselves....It makes them particular though...<br />
Wasps, on the other hand, have smooth stingers. They can shoot you up as many times as they like. They use up the poison by the third or fourth shot, but they can go on making holes if they like...and usually they do. Especially wall-wasps. The kind I’ve got over there. You gotta sedate ‘em. Stuff called Noxon. It must give ‘em a hell of a hangover, because they wake up madder than ever... That’s why people go on fighting, Bow-Wow. On and on and on. We got smooth stingers.<br />
(Stephen King, The End of the Whole Mess, Omni, 1986)<br />

We fly on this wind-scraps down historical continua—images of our collective selves as assemblages of mechanisms, collaborations of organs laid over a meshwork of hidden designs, a toolbox from which we fashion internal and external devices, the mechanism of hand-writing, the mechanism of planting seeds. Most of the tools we use to manipulate the world are like the material that compose it, they are value-neutral and can be used for varying degrees of actions that would be considered good or bad by conventional moral standards. A shovel, for example, can be used to dig a hole to plant a crocus, or to beat your sister to death. We would perhaps ascribe different values to those actions, but the values themselves are not intrinsic to the shovel. The history of technology finds the curls of its rhizomes in early devices empty of a transcendent values—the knife can be used for cutting vegetables as well as killing your neighbor, the spear can be used for hunting and holding shut the flap across the entrance to the dwelling. Over time, the creation of technology came to be a slave for different system of ideological control, religious, military, educational, medical systems all created values such as penitence, obedience, studiousness and cleanliness for which their streams of technological innovation formed to, like a vine wrapped around a straight pole. As the vine is shaped around the pole by the wind and sun, we see that the almost-constant social pressure of warfare was the main impetus which forced military technology to innovate before most other parts of society. As we drift backwards down the hallway of this historical continuum we see the use of gunpowder, originally invented by the Chinese along with fireworks as a means of entertaining crowds, join with the technology of the canon and the rifle to become converted into an agent of mass slaughter over several centuries of pressured innovation. In almost every case we see a structure of technological thought which suborns the beauty of self-organized material into a linearity of purpose—in other words, things start to become created with a singular use in mind which then shapes their creation and narrows their possibilities. The of modern era as characterized by the mid-twentieth century is the story of specialization to the point of absurdity and horror, technological innovations such as the Cuisinart with the list of functions that can be completed with a single touch of the button, to the gas chamber which is only built for one thing. Appropos of the topic, we can even see that the politico-economic construct of the energy incentive is designed in this way, a means to a political end, designed with a purpose that suborns its use to constant professionalization, bureaucratization and administration of the self-organized thrumming and labor of the market.
