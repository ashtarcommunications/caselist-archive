<h3 id="toc5"><a name="x-West Georgia MS Neg (Lost on a 3/0)-Off Case Args:"></a><em>Off Case Args:</em></h3>
 Framework:<br />
A. Interpretation –debate should be a site for contet over political proposals. This requires that the affirmative present a predictable plan of action and defends that their policy should be adopted by the USFG. Our interpretation is the most predictable given the working of the resolution<br />
<br />
1. The topic is defined by the phrase following the colon – the USFG is the agent of the resolution, not the individual debaters<br />
Webster’s Guide to Grammar and Writing – 2000<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/marks/colon.htm</a><br />
“Use of a colon before a list or an explanation…after the colon with a capital letter.”<br />
<br />
2. Resolved proves the framework for the resolution is to enact a policy<br />
Words and Phrases 1964 Permanent Edition<br />
“Definition of the word…establish by law.”<br />
<br />
3. Should denotes an expectation of enacting a plan<br />
American Heritage Dictionary – 2000 [www.dictionary.com]<br />
“Used …expectation”<br />
<br />
4. The USFG is the government in Washington D.C.<br />
Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2000 [<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://encarta.msn.com" rel="nofollow">http://encarta.msn.com</a>]<br />
“The federal government of the United States is centered in Washington DC.”<br />
<br />
B. Violation – the affirmative fails to defend a fiat based interpretation of their plan.<br />
<br />
Brightline test – could the arguments in the 1AC form the outline of a proposal to policymakers? Obviously they couldn’t.<br />
Lutz, Prof PoliSci U of Houston, 2k (Donald, Political Theory and Partisan Politics p.46)<br />
“The suprising fact is not…or not trying at all.”<br />
<br />
C. Our interp is better –<br />
1. Ground – the aff will always win that the principals of their advocacy are good in the abstract – we can only debate the merits of their framework if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
Michael Ignatieff, Carr professor of human rights at Harvard, 2k4, Lesser Evils, p.20-1<br />
“As for moral perfectionism…lead us to betray another.”<br />
<br />
And, without predictable ground debate becomes meaningless and produces a political strategy wedded to violence that fails to achieve productive change<br />
Shively, Professor of politics at Tx A&amp;M, 2k4 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 182)<br />
“The point may seem trite…the act of argumentation.”<br />
<br />
2. Limits – there are an infinite number of contexts through which they could advocate the plan. Our interpretation limits debate to promote politically relevant dialogue and structured communication<br />
Lutz, Prof PolSci U of Houston, 2k (Donald, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, p.39-40)<br />
“Aristotle notes in the Politics that…not in the vision of the non-theorist.”<br />
<br />
Exploding predictable limits neutralizes the discursive benefits to debate and renders their advocacy meaningless – only our interpretation preserves the revolutionary potential of a deliberative activity.<br />
Shively, Professor of politics at Tx A&amp;M, 2k4 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 180)<br />
“Thus far, I have argued…reject civility and democracy.”<br />
<br />
3. Topical education – by manipulating the topic to access their political project they skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government. Their education is distrusting of the institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are noble, their message results in fascist totalitarianism.<br />
Lewis 92 (Martin, Green Delusions p 247)<br />
“A majority of those born between…their instructors intentions.”<br />
<br />
4. Grammar – only predictable way to read.<br />
<br />
D. Topicality is a voting issue for fairness and jurisdiction<br />
1. It comes before all other args<br />
2. The fairness of the affirmatives advocacy must precede consideration of its merits or else all contestation is meaningless<br />
Shively, Professor of politics at Tx A&amp;M, 2k4 (Political Theory and Partisan Politics p. 180<br />
“The ambiguists must say…or harmony.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Framework 2NC cards –<br />
Some exclusions are inevitable because one team has to win and the other has to lose. It’s impossible to achieve perfect openness in communication<br />
Michel Foucault, Ethics Subjectivity and Truth, Essential Works of Foucault 1954-1984, Volume One, Ed. Paul Rabinow, 1997, p.298<br />
“This is tied up with…domination as possible”<br />
<br />
An experiment was done at a tournament where there was no topic – the participants were interviewed and resoundingly said that this lack of a topic drastically biases the negative<br />
Preston 2003. Thomas C Preston summer 2003. Professor of communications at the University of Missouri St. Louis. “No-topic debating in Parliamentary Debate: Students and Critic Reactions.”<br />
“The study involved…an advantage to the opposition.”<br />
