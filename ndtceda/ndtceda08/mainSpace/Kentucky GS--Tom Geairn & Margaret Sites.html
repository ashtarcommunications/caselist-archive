Kentucky (Aff) v Mary Wash GT Liberty 4<br />
Judge Rob Miller</strong><br />
<br />
1AC<br />
Observation One:<br />
Status quo representations of modern “Factory Farms” revolve around discursive practices of euphemisms to water down and conceal the inherent violence towards nonhuman animals for the purposes of convenience and economics. These off-topic discussions precludes any ethical questions surrounding mass slaughter<br />
Glenn 2004 /Cathy, a doctoral candidate @ the Department of Speech Commutations @ Southern Illinois University, “Constructing Consumables and Consent: A Critical Analysis of Factory Farm Industry Discourse,” Journal of Communication Inquiry; 28/<br />
<br />
Thus the plan- Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce its agricultural support by eliminating all United States’ domestic subsidies for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
Observation Two:<br />
CAFOs have been transformed by modern social practices that allow a social and ethnical distancing from the act of killing an animal – this reinforces the distinction between human and non-human and absolves all individual responsibility to non-human animals<br />
Smith 2002 /Mick, Division of Sociology @ the University of Abertay, “The ‘Ethical’ Space of the Abattoir: On the (In)huma(e) slaughter of Other Animals, Human Ecology Review, Vol. 9, No. 2/<br />
<br />
This unethical distancing from non-human animals results in a slippery slope that blurs the lines between what can and cannot be killed, or dominated. Violence towards non-human animals is historically the root cause of all forms of violence and domination<br />
Charkowski 2004 /Elaine, Free Lance, Santa Cruz based writer for feminist and environmental causes, “An injusry to one is an injury to all! Animal Rights linked to human rights,” Indymedia, Newswire, November, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://santacruz.indymedia.org/newswire/display/12905/index.php/" rel="nofollow">http://santacruz.indymedia.org/newswire/display/12905/index.php/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
The exclusion of non-human animals from our ethical and moral considerations put humans value on a pedestal. These arguments are inherently self-imploding and are the drawing of arbitrary lines that allow anything to be excluded. Only by ending factory farming can we redraw our decision calculus to include all sentient beings<br />
Wilson 2006 /Scott, Department of Philosophy @ the University of California, Santa Barbara, “Animals and Ethics,” The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/anim-eth.htm#SSH3a.iii/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/anim-eth.htm#SSH3a.iii/</a><br />
<br />
Observation Three-<br />
Studies show that Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations are responsible for the deaths of over 11 billion non-human animals per year. These factory farms represent the largest facet of any other animal slaughter programs<br />
Animals and Society Institute 2006 /A nonprofit and independent research and educational organization, “Animals in Agriculture Position Paper, July, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.animalsandsociety.org/resources/details.php?id=3/" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalsandsociety.org/resources/details.php?id=3/</a><br />

Disease<br />

Shifting away from CAFOs would prevent disease and hyperinfections.<br />

<br />
Solvency<br />
The government pumps billions of dollars a year into CAFOs; these subsidies are the life blood of the factory farms. Only by ending these subsidies can CAFOs be put out of business for good<br />
