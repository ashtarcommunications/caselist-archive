15 B.U. Int'l L.J. 433<br />
While the fundamental ideas are not ... discussion of the earlier cases, the Court said<br />

<br />
Center for Justice and Accountability 2k4<br />
[Amici Brief, Al Odah v US, 2003 U.S. Briefs 334, January 14]<br />
Many of the newly independent governments ...one of the first victims is the judiciary<br />

<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm</a><br />
This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security ... security and prosperity can be built<br />
<br />
Contention Four: International Political Rights<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s reluctance to use international human rights prevents the advancement of human rights worldwide.<br />
<br />
Alam, University of Chittagong Law Professor, Spring 2k4<br />
10 Ann. Surv. Int'l &amp; Comp. L. 27<br />

The U.S. appears to employ a double ... protected by U.S. law.<br />
<br />
International human rights prevent wars that escalate into genocides and nuclear wars.<br />
<br />
Human Rights Web in ‘97 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.hrweb.org/intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrweb.org/intro.html</a>)<br />
These are the second and third paragraphs ... but to preserve the human race.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan –<br />
<br />
In the next appropriate test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States v. Morrison by ruling that the civil rights remedy established in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 implemented the law of nations and is constitutional under the necessary and proper clause of Article One of the United States Constitution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Five – Solvency<br />
<br />
Applying the ICCPR to VAWA incorporates international human rights discourse into domestic law.<br />
<br />

<br />
Goldfarb, Rutgers Associate Law Professor, 2k3<br />
11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251<br />
VAWA's civil rights remedy ... individual perpetrators of violence against women.<br />
<br />
Our advocacy of human rights isn’t seduced by the law – instead we are acting on behalf of dignity and freedom – excluding rights amounts to gestural politics and non-action.<br />
<br />

25 Mich. J. Int'l L. 265<br />

COURT-STRIPPING<br />
<br />
-- Overruling Morrison is key to prevent future court-stripping – this is a new internal link to judicial independence.<br />
<br />
Geyh 2k6<br />
Chair in Law – Indiana Univeristy, When Courts &amp; Congress Collide, pp. 246-50<br />
Rehnquist took issue with the pending ... seems quite willing to do unto Congress<br />

2AC Topicality – Overrule means to reverse holding<br />
<br />
1. We meet – The irrelevance of the ICCPR was a holding of Morrison.<br />
<br />
Roth, 2k1<br />
Associate Poli Sci Prof – Wayne State, Fall, 47 Wayne L. Rev. 891<br />
In sum, the ICCPR Federalism ... strategy to circumvent them. 55<br />
<br />
2. Counter--Intepretation –<br />
<br />
A—Overrule means to supercede which means to replace.<br />
<br />
Oran’s Dictionary of Law in ’91 [Daniel, JD, 3rd Edition, pp. 347-8]<br />
Overrule: To reject or supercede.<br />
<br />
B—Decision refers the final judgement, not the opinion.<br />
<br />
West’s Law Encyclopedia in ’98 Online<br />
When referring to judicial matters<br />
<br />
C—In the context of Morrison, the sole question was the legality of the remedy.<br />
<br />
Epstein, 2000<br />
Law Professor – Chicago, Morrison Amicus Brief, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/legalbriefs/brzonkalavsmorrison.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pubs/legalbriefs/brzonkalavsmorrison.pdf</a><br />
The sole question in this case<br />
<br />
3. We meet this and its better for topic education – Overruling a judgement includes using alternate grounds and this is how the courts overrule major cases now.<br />
<br />
Weinstein &amp; DeMarco, 2k4<br />
Philosophy Profs – Vassar &amp; Bergen, Winter, 10 Cardozo Women's L.J. 423<br />
Scalia also continually insists that the Court did not ... conclusion of the prior opinion is wrong<br />
<br />
4. Our interp is fair –<br />
<br />
A—Strict Brite Line – We only allow cases that offer alternative intellectual foundations that change the outcome of the decision. There are a limited number of alternative justifications that could be provided to make VAWA legal.<br />
<br />
B—Ensures neg ground – VAWA bad, Morrison good, overruling bad, alternate grounds counterplans, and other core neg ground are all still viable negative arguments under our interpretation.<br />
<br />
5. Amicus Briefs Check – Our Aff is grounded in an Amicus Brief – that’s the 1AC Schneider &amp; Davis evidence. This means that our Aff is grounded in the literature and should be predicted by the neg.<br />
<br />
6. Their interp is bad for Aff ground –<br />
<br />
A—Overlimits – They allow only four Affirmatives. This leads to boring, repetitive debates and hurts creativity.<br />
<br />
B—Their interpretation moots Morrison, since the commerce clause holding has been overruled by subsequent decisions, and Quirin, which was overruled by Hamdan. Mooting areas kills resolutional focus which is the basis for predictability.<br />

Major Answers to Stare Decisis<br />

64 Alb. L. Rev. 417<br />
Today, however, the Court's continued ... American society is shifting expectations and perspectives.<br />

APSR, Vol. 94, No. 1, pg. 90<br />
Finally, others argue that Court procedures... appear to be relatively more stable as well<br />
<br />
<br />
-- Turn: Partial Birth Abortion<br />
<br />

A-- Overruling makes him think the Court has tanked its capital<br />

Rappaport, Law Professor – University of San Diego, Fall 2k4<br />
99 Nw. U.L. Rev. 369<br />
If these critiques of the Rehnquist Court are not accurate, then how should ... significant attacks on the Court<br />
<br />
B—This stops him from upholding the partial birth abortion ban which overrules Roe and ushers in a new conservative court. Oh, and it turns your disad since the vote is before the EPA decision.<br />

Interjecting international law into domestic law improves federalism.<br />
Shany, Hebrew University Public International Law Chair, 2006. 31 Brooklyn J. Int’l Law 341. “The promotion of international law at the constitutional law level…” “complicates the ability of the central government to adequately perform at the international law.”<br />

Morrison was wrong—VAWA didn’t hurt federalism.<br />
MacKinnon, November 2000. 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135. “How a federal law that duplicated no state law…” “…is hardly confined to violence.”<br />
<br />
Morrison undermined a key example of cooperative federalism which enhanced states’ rights. Goldfarb, Rutgers 2002. 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57. “The potential for a dialectic between the states and federal government…” “”an instance, not of state/federal conflict, but of state/federal efforts to cooperate…”<br />
