The plan: The United States federal government should increase its deployment of troops in Afghanistan on the condition that the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan demonstrates progress in its corruption reform efforts.<br />
<br />
Contention One: Corruption<br />
<br />
The Afghani government is a bastion of corruption an honest effort to curb corruption is necessary to prevent a domestic implosion and spur future reforms<br />
Motlagh, 2/18/07 (Jason, deputy foreign editor at United Press International in Washington, D.C., American Prospect, “Reform and Function” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allArticles/AD6AF099CF8099648725728400735300?OpenDocument%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allArticles/AD6AF099CF8099648725728400735300?OpenDocument)</a><br />
With billions more American taxpayer dollars …like removing the dead leaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Conditioning future assistance on these reforms is critical to ensuring that resources are being effectively used<br />
Wilder, 7/2007 (Andrew, Research Director for Politics and Policy at Tufts University, Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, “Cops or Robbers, the Struggle to Reform the Afghan National Police” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.areu.org.af/%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.areu.org.af/)</a><br />
• The Ministry of Interior (MoI) is notoriously …government and the international community.<br />
<br />
<br />
They’ll say yes, Afghanistan has empirically responded to conditional troop deployments<br />

<br />
And Karzai wants troops<br />
Lal, 2006 (Rollie, Rand Corporation, &quot;Central Asia and Its Asian Neighbors. Security and Commerce at the Crossroads,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A450305&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf%29" rel="nofollow">http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A450305&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf)</a><br />
The U.S. interest in preventing … arenas in which to cooperate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conditional assistance is uniquely better than unconditional assistance. The act of conditioning independently prevents conflict and instability even if reforms don’t solve<br />
Goodhand and Sedra, 1/2007 (Jonathan and Mark, Senior Lecturer in Development Practice, University of London, Research Associate at the Bonn International Center for Conversion, International Peacekeeping, Vol.14, No.1, “Bribes or Bargains? Peace Conditionalities and<br />
‘Post-Conflict’ Reconstruction in Afghanistan” p. 41)<br />
Aid has political impacts … insulate themselves from the state.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And conditions create the institutional framework that is necessary for pushing for future reforms<br />

‘Post-Conflict’ Reconstruction in Afghanistan” p. 41)<br />
The time frames set … and society more broadly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Instability<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is on the brink, levels of violence have risen to 2001 levels and there is a growing perception that the US isn’t committed<br />

Anderson, 9/25/07 (John Ward, Washington Post Foreign Service, “Emboldened Taliban Reflected In More Attacks, Greater Reach; U.S., Afghan Officials Disagree With Analysts’ Notion of a Major Resurgence,” ln)<br />
Preying on a weak government…they have time on their side.”<br />
<br />
However, despite hopeful signs the situation remains desperate, absent more troops instability will escalate into civil war, drawing in Russia, Iran, India, and Pakistan and an explosion of terrorism<br />
IHT, 12/1/06 (International Herald Tribune, “NATO's failure portends a wider war;<br />
Afghanistan I” ln)<br />

However, this does not mean …that the U.S. cannot ignore.<br />
<br />
And instability spills over causing Middle Eastern war and Pakistani regime change<br />
The Toronto Star, 7/18/07 (Generals warn of domino effect; “British report says dropping the ball in Afghanistan could leading to Islamists seizing power in Pakistan” ln)<br />

The United States retaliates: … capable of exacting revenge.<br />
<br />
<br />
NATO efforts are insufficient to solve the problem. US action with NATO solves instability while providing a veneer of multilateralism in the region that solves hegemony<br />
Serchuck, 8/26/05 (Vance, research fellow at AEI, WSJ, The Multilateralism Myth, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23085,filter.all/pub_detail.asp%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.23085,filter.all/pub_detail.asp)</a><br />

Notwithstanding past failures…will be ineffective.<br />
<br />
Contention Three: US Hegemony<br />
<br />
A commitment to Afghanistan is critical to repairing the trust deficit between the US and other major powers that makes coalition building possible. Absent that, US hegemony will not be sustainable<br />
