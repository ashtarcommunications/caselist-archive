<strong>IT IS NOT GREEDINESS AS HER MOTHER ASSUMES, BUT OUT OF A DESIRE TO BECOME AN EMBODIMENT OF WHITENESS JUST LIKE SHIRLEY TEMPLE; THAT PECOLA CONSUMES THE THREE QUARTS OF MILK. HER INITIAL VIOLENT RAGE AGAINST WHITE PRIVILEGE CANNOT BE SUSTAINED WHEN SHE REALIZES JUST HOW DEEP THE NORM OF WHITENESS AS PERFECTION PERVADES. MORRISON’S POINT IS TO DEMONSTRATE THE WAY THE WHITE BODY IS BOTH PRIVILEGED AND NATURALIZED INTO THE BACKGROUND OF OUR EVERYDAY LIVES. IN THIS NARRATIVE, MILK BECOMES A SYMBOL OF WHITENESS; ITS CONSUMPTION BECOMES THE ASSUMED NORM; CLEANSING “UGLY BODIES” AND LOCKING THEM IN A PRISON OF WHITENESS.</strong><br />
