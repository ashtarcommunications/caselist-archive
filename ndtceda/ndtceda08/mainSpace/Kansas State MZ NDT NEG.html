 No risk of confrontation with Russia<br />
Rebecca N White, “Inside Track: Voice of Putin,” 02/20/08, National Interest Online<br />
“Despite recent…to results.”<br />
The US-Russia relationship will only get stronger after their elections in March- foreign policy will be based on cooperation in order to ensure economic stability<br />
White, 08<br />
“For the moment…others interests.”<br />
Iraq stabilizing now<br />
Yochi Dreazen, Wall Street Journal Online, 10/25/07, “Fighting within Sects complicates US Iraq plans”<br />
“Iraq’s overall…for the country.”<br />
Iraqi civil war won’t escalate<br />
Ivan Eland, 07, “Would a full-blown civil war really be that bed for the united states?”<br />
“Even the worst…access to them.”<br />
<h3 id="toc6"><a name="x-Kansas State MZ-Off Case Args:"></a><strong><em>Off Case Args:</em></strong></h3>
 Dip Cap:<br />
Rice focused on Iraq<br />
Anence France Press, 9/12/07, “US to focus on restoring Iraq’s security amid Iranian threat: Rice”<br />
“US to focus on…she said.”<br />
Engaging Afghanistan requires huge amount of dip cap<br />
Khalizad, 05, ln<br />
“Intensive political and diplomatic engagement…than we had before.”<br />
Dip cap finite<br />
Anderson and Grewell, 2001<br />
Breakdown of negotiations spark conflict<br />

“The United States and South Korea: Reinvigorating the Partnership”<br />
“The capabilities of the two…imagination.”<br />
T QPQ:<br />
CE means an offer of positive incentives in exchange for explicitly definedpolicy change in the target country<br />
“Chester Crocker, 89, “Southern Africa: Eight Years later”<br />
“Regarding South Africa…internal change.”<br />
Almost any American foreign policy action can be interpreted as ‘engagement’- restricting CE to qpq is necessary to limit the size of the topic<br />
Haass and O’Sullivan, 00, “Terms of engagement: alternatives to punitive policies”<br />
“The term engagement…important disagreements.”<br />
RSI DA:<br />
A. The regional strategic initiative is currently working to reduce terrorism with its current funding<br />
Jim Coury, 05/10/07, “US State department releases report on terrorism”<br />
“Five years after…marginalized terrorists.”<br />
B. RSI could face cuts if money is tight- the State department support program is tenuous- this ev proves we use cooperation and not firepower to counter extremism<br />
LA Times, 07, “Focused on regional strategies, it has little money or help”<br />
“Singled out in…officials said.”<br />
Terrorism risks extinction<br />
Alexander 2003<br />
UN Credibility DA:<br />
A. UN is now taking the lead in Afghanistan<br />
Reuters, 03/28/08, “New UN envoy arrives to boost teamwork in Afghanistan”<br />
“The new UN…in the past.”<br />
B. The UN must lead in Afghanistan- US action is unsustainable and undesirable by the international community<br />
Joel Charny, “The Unied States in Iraq: An Experiment with unilateral humanitarianism”, 03<br />
“The US operational…is unsustainable.”<br />
C. 1. Takes out solvency- simultaneous action with the UN only adds cross-purposes which blocks solvency<br />
Khalilizad, 3/20/08, “Afghanistan’s New Deal”, NY Times<br />
“However, because of…must be a priority.”<br />
Afghanistan is key to UN credibility<br />
Stephen Harper, 2006, “Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s speech to the UN”<br />
“The United Nations….of this organization.”<br />
US undermining of the UN puts millions at risk of death from conflict and poor response efforts to natural disasters<br />
Clare Short, “We Must resist America’s attempt to Undermine the UN”, 1/1/05<br />
“I find this growing…developing countries.”<br />
CP:<br />
Excluded word Afghanistan- Khorasan instead<br />
British Khorasan into Afghanistan- this imperial act still resonates today in ethnic conflict and despotic policies, and is the biggest barrier to stability in the country- only a return to Khorasan will unite all different ethnic groups<br />
Khorasan zameen (website), 02/27/08<br />
“Before that…great history.”<br />
Afghanistan is imperialistic<br />
Ali Maisam Mazary, 09/28/06, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://citynoise.org/" rel="nofollow">Citynoise.org</a><br />
“Even to this day…sectarian violence.”<br />
Afghanistan was not chosen by native consent<br />
GP Tate, 01, Asian Educational Services, pg 2<br />
“The name Afghanistan…from Central Asia.”<br />
Imperialism collapses the economy<br />
Chalmers Johnson, Harper’s Magazine Foundation, 07/11/07, proquest<br />
“The United States…recession or collapse.”<br />
Imperialism is racist<br />
Davod Gordon, 89, “Images of the West”, p 25<br />
“Racism as a rationalization…their empires.”<br />
Racism is the means through which bio-power legitimizes extermination of others. It normalizes us to accept their death and torture<br />
Eduardo Mendieta, “To make live and to lett die- Foucault and Racism”, 02<br />
“This is where... in nature.”<br />

Round 2<br />
Nev vs. Georgetown FM<br />
<br />
Neg: T QPQ – must have a condition for ground<br />
T Foreign Assistance – economic or financial assistance AND must have<br />
foreign in the plan text<br />
T Government to Government – engage the HR commission not Afghan govt<br />
Images of Suffering Bad Kritik<br />
Counterplan – PIC out of the word assistance – it is patronizing we must take<br />
an ethical stance against them. Cooperation is better<br />
Assistance denotes top down process that renders recipients passive-<br />
cooperation is key to avoid the patronizing tone of engagement with<br />
Afghanistan<br />
Tandon, 2007 “The Reality of Trade: The WTO and Developing Countries”<br />
The North- South Institute”<br />
Oddly, years after … to the developing countries”<br />
<br />
This ethical relationship is unacceptable – we must choose specifically to<br />
reverse the relationship.<br />
Memmi, 1997 Racism p 165,<br />
Of course, this is debateable…. The stakes are irresistible.<br />
DA- Rice/Bush Relations-Focus Disad; Mpx NoKo Negotiations<br />
<br />
<br />
2ac: T Govt to Govt – HR Commission is apart of the govt. C/I: Should include<br />
subsidiaries. The HR Commission was consitutionalized by the Afghan Gov.<br />
PICs Bad<br />
Consequentialism args on the DA – also extensions from the 1ac<br />
CP - perm offer both<br />
K- perm: do plan without the bad reps, reps are key to solvency cross apply<br />
1ac evidence<br />
<br />
<br />
Block: Kicked the DA<br />
Kicked the K<br />
2nc: CP and PICS, case arguments<br />
cards on how cooperation is better than assistance, it will be perceive<br />
internationally, this is the only ethical stance bc it changes how we act<br />
towards the other, we will continually justify bad actions in the name of<br />
Afghans if we see them as dependent.<br />
1nr: T govt to govt, T FA- must have in plan text<br />
<br />
1ar: CP: extended the perm, US doesn’t have a “code” for cooperation, CP wont ever happen because cooperation not a term used, offers are never enforced ?<br />
<br />
2nr: Kicked DA, Covered PICs and went for the Counterplan.
