We only have one team, Buffalo CE (Ben Crossan and Renee Elich). Our affirmative is in the download page, the &quot;One Ace, y'see&quot; one. The Angela Davis evidence is from her book &quot;Abolition Democracy: Beyond Prisons, Torture, and Empire Interviews with Angela Y. Davis&quot; pages 62-69 and the literary excerpt we read is from J.M. Coetzee's <em>Waiting for the Barbarians</em> pages 101-106 in the penguin classics version that has a brown cover and a drawing of a kid crouching under straw people with helmets and spears. If you have an account with amazon.com you can search inside.<br />
