CAFOs are a leading producer of methane due to manure production- <br />
Danielle Nierenberg, “global farm animal production and global warming”, 1/31/08<br />
“Typically, cattle confined in feedlots…pig operations worldwide.”<br />
<br />
The way in which the manure is stored is vital to methane production<br />

Methane is a massive contributer to global warming<br />

Subsidies are key to making digesters cost-effective<br />
Energy Justice Network, “Anaerobic Digesters, 6/27/03<br />
“Costs such as those….by a government subsidy.”<br />

EQUIP is key- it is utilized to apply pressure on CAFOS in order to created increased manure management<br />

“To induce a change in current…often exceeds the cost-share.”<br />

<br />
<strong>Plan: The USFG should substantially reduce its agricultural support and eliminate at least nearly all domestic subsidies for CAFO’s directed to the national school lunch programs.</strong><br />
<strong>FIRST, SCHOOL LUNCHES ARE UNHEALTHY AND CAUSE CHILDHOOD OBESITY- HAM ‘03</strong><br />

<strong>AND, THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM IS NOT ONLY OUTDATED AND ALSO PROPS UP AGRIBUSINESS BY SUBSIDIZING THE CORPORATIONS IN ORDER TO ALLOW FOR LEFT OVER COMMODITIES TO BE ALLOWED INTO SCHOOL LUNCHES WHICH HELPS INCREASE OBESITY- YEOMAN ‘03</strong><br />

<br />
THE WAY IN WHICH WE ORIENT OURSELVES TO THE EARTH, SPECIFICALLY THROUGH OUR CREATION OF BIOFUELS IS FLAWED. IN FACT THE USFG BELIEVES THAT BIOFUELS ARE THE WAY OF THE FUTURE AND ARE THE SOLUTION TO ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS, SPECIFALLY THE CRAVING FOR OIL- ARMAS ‘07<br />
<br />
(Marcel Armas is a JD candidate at American University Washington College of Sustainable Development Law &amp; Policy, “EXPLORING HOW TODAY'S DEVELOPMENT AFFECTS FUTURE GENERATIONS AROUND THE GLOBE: FEATURE: MISLEADINGLY GREEN: TIME TO REPEAL THE ETHANOL TARIFF AND SUBSIDY FOR CORN”, 7 Sustainable Dev. L. &amp; Pol'y 25, Spring, 2007, L-N)<br />
<br />
The United States is recognizing…..the United States or the world<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, THE WAY IN WHICH THE USFG COMES TO THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE INHERENTLY WRONG. WE ARE ALWAYS SETTING UP DEFENSES AGAINST EARTH AND INSISTING THAT WE MUST ACT IMMEDIATELY TO ATTACK THESE PROBLEM. YET, THIS TECHNOLOGIZATION OF THE EARTH WILL MAKE THESE IMPACTS INEVITABLE- MCWHORTER ‘92<br />
<br />
Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Northeast Missouri State University<br />
(Ladelle, Heidegger and the Earth, ed. by Ladelle McWhorter)<em>JRC<br />
<br />
Thinking ecologically, that is…..provision or predetermined aim<br />
<br />
FURTHER, THIS IDEOLOGY HAS TRANSFERRED OVER TO DEBATE. JUST LIKE THE PESKY ENVIRONMENTALISTS, WE’RE ALWAYS SETTING UP DEFENSES AND MAKING PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES TO WIN THE ROUND. YET, THIS IDEOLOGY IS STUCK WITHIN THE PROJECT OF THE WAR MACHINE, ALWAYS DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO WIN AND INSISTING THAT WE MUST ATTACK IMMEDIATELY- MANN ‘96<br />
<br />
Mann in 96 (Paul, prof of English, Pomona, “The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare”)<br />
<br />
To the extent that modern warfare…..from the war machine it studies<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, THE INSISTANCE TO ACT TO A PERCEIVED PROBLEM IS NOT JUST A RESPONSE TO SOME EXTERNAL VIOLENCE, RATHER IT IS ROOTED IN THE HUMAN PSYCHE’S DESIRE TO OBEY. THIS PROCESS CREATES A CYCLE THAT CULMINATES INTO THE FEAR OF DEATH IN WHICH WE ARE CONTROLLED BY DEATH MEANING THAT LIFE BECOMES MEANINGLESS- MANN ‘96<br />
<br />
(paul, prof of English, Pomona, “The Nine Grounds of Intellectual Warfare”)<br />
<br />
When imposition is collective……The sentimental violence of dialectics.<br />
<br />
FINALLY, A PROCESS IN WHICH WE RELY ON STEP BY STEP ANALYSIS TO REACH A FINAL GOAL OR IMPACT, I.E. ADVANTAGES IS ONLY A FORM OF TECHNOLOGICAL COMMUNICATION WHICH COMMODIFIES THE JUDGE AND THE SPEAKER LEADING TO NO VALUE TO LIFE. OUR ACT OF CREATIVE COMMUNICATION IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE- MIFSUD ‘07<br />
<br />
Mifsud in 07 (Mari lee, On Rhetoric as Gift/Giving, Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol 40, Number 1, 2007, p. 89-107)<br />
<br />
Henry Johnstone did more…..meaningless transfers of energy.<br />
<br />
THE INSISTANCE THAT WE MUST STICK TO ONE MODE OF THOUGHT ONLY LEADS TO THE END OF STEALTHY AND SECRET MODES OF INTELLECT. INSTEAD A PROCESS OF NOMADIC THINKING ALLOWS US TO FIND THIS MORE STEALTHY WAYS OF WORKING WITHIN THE WAR MACHING. THIS ALLOWS US TO AFFIRM THINGS WITHOUT BEING CONNECTED TO THEM- MANN ‘96<br />
<br />
(PAUL, PROF OF ENGLISH, POMONA, “THE NINE GROUNDS OF INTELLECTUAL WARFARE”)<br />
<br />
The standpoint, identification with…..a response to this challenge<br />
<br />
WE ACHIEVE THIS NOMADIC MODE OF BEING BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE FATAL NATURE OF OUR CRITICISM. OUR RESISTANCE NEVER COMES TO A COMPLETION BUT EXISTS IN A STATE OF BECOMING THAT RESISTS ENSLAVEMENT- BAUDRILLARD ’05<br />
(JEAN. THE INTELLIGENCE OF EVIL OR THE LUCIDITY PACT. 2005. P. 212)<br />
<br />
The singularity of a language……it is going nowhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WHILE OUR CRITIQUE DOES NOT HAVE AN IDEAL STATE OF TERMINATION OUR CONCEPT OF FATALITY HAS THE POWER TO BRING THE WAR-MACHINE TO ITS OWN DEMISE. OUR TACTIC OF COUCHING DEBATE IN THE DISCOURSE OF WAR AND THEN AFFORDING THAT CRITICISM WITH THE CAPACITY TO DIE CREATES A SIMULACRUM WHICH EXPOSES WAR TO ITS OWN TRIVIALITY. THE DEATH OF OUR CRITIQUE BECOMES A “DOUBLE SUICIDE” WHICH TAKES THE CONCEPT OF WAR WITH IT- MANN ’96<br />
