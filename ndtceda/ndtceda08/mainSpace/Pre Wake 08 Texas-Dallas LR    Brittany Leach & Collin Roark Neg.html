Round 1 Wake<br />
Transition DA<br />
A. Uniqueness – Obama's ag policy deflects controversy in the status quo but consistency is key<br />
Brasher, 11-7-08 (Phillip, &quot;Farmers foresee little change under Obama administration,&quot; Gannett News Service, Lexis)<br />
&quot;Barack Obama told voters that…with where we want to go.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
B. Link – the plan ignited political volleying and destroys cooperation<br />
Brasher, 11-7-08 (Phillip, &quot;Farmers foresee little change under Obama administration,&quot; Gannett News Service, Lexis)<br />
&quot;But that doesn't mean there won't…For Cook, that would be progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coming days will define centuries – the transition will be smooth but cooperation is the watchword<br />
Washington Post, 11-9-08 (&quot;Preparing for the Obama Era; Bush Officials and President-Elect Working Together on Pressing Issues,&quot; Lexis)<br />
&quot;Faced with one of the most important transfers…who is advising the transition panel.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smooth transition is keyt o prevent immediate WMD warfare<br />
Washington Post, 10-26-08 (Ann Scott Tyson, staff writer, &quot;Military Prepares for threats during Presidential Transition&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/</a> wp-dyn/;content/article/2008/ 10/25/AR2008102501944,html )<br />
&quot;The U.S. military, bracing for the first…particularly for Iraq and Afghanistan&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Cap K</strong><br />
Reducing domestic support for commodity crops is only part of a capitalist strategy to increase the exportation of more specialized crops to force the third world into globalization<br />
Maitra, ‘97<br />
[Priyatosh Maitra, Economics Department, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, “Globalization of capitalism, agriculture and the negation of nation states,” International Journal of Social Economics, 24.1-3, 1997, Emerald]<br />
<br />
The current phase of internationalization...kind of industrial capitalist production in these economies.<br />
<br />
Capitalism extinction – we must embrace the alternative now<br />
Foster, ‘5<br />
[John Bellamy Foster, Prof @ U of Oregon Dept of Sociology, “Naked Imperialism,” The Monthly Review, Volume 57, Number 4, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0905jbf.htm" rel="nofollow"> http://www.monthlyreview.org/0905jbf.htm </a> ]<br />
<br />
From the longer view offered...movement against the new naked imperialism.<br />
<br />
Our Alternative is to not do the aff- capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected<br />
Herod, ‘4<br />
[James Herod, “Getting Free, 4th Edition A sketch of an association of democratic, autonomous neighborhoods and how to create it,” January 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/4thEd/4-index.htm" rel="nofollow"> http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/4thEd/4-index.htm </a> ]<br />
<br />
It is time to try to...which I will enumerate shortly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Elections D</strong>A<br />
McCain is up in the polls now- Silva 9-15, McCain’s electoral edge: Rove’s maps, “the survey that showed republican john mccain eroding” “lead in several red states”<br />
<br />
Subsidies are popular in farm states- Mccain gets the blame<br />
Register-guard 08 (“editorials: farm business as usual; congress perpetuates a wasteful subsidy system” may 23)<br />
<br />
Red state support is key to McCain victory<br />
Halperin 9-10 (mark, “cnn election center”) “brown: so we just told you…. that’s a big advantage for McCain.”<br />
<br />
Key to US-India Relations- Obama<br />
Aiyar 08 (Swaminathan, “India nees McCain as US president”) “in this regard McCain beats Clinton and Obama hollow” “personal likeability is irrelevant”<br />
<br />
Key to avoid India-Pakistan war that escalates to extinction<br />
Dugger 02 (Celia, “wider military ties with India offer U.S. Diplomatic Leverage”) “military cooperation between India and the United States” “could lead to a nuclear holocaust”<br />
<br />
Turns the aff- McCain would remove subsidies<br />
Burns 8-19 (Douglas, Harkin: McCain is hostile to farm country) “mccain opposes virtually all farm subsidies”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>China and Sudan CP-</strong><br />
<br />
Text: &lt;insert plan&gt; on the condition that China halts military support to Sudan.<br />
<br />
It solves- China should quietly be offered a QPQ of ag subsidy decreases for Sudan coop- it works<br />
Lange 08 (Mark, “the only way to alter China’s hand in Darfur,” Apr 30) “since china wields veto power… break lever on mass slaughter.”<br />
<br />
Sudan instability destabilizes the continent<br />
Kudzia 06 (David, Apr 20, writer for the Times Herald) “once again, darfur has popped back… out of stagnation and decline”<br />
<br />
Nuke War- Duetsch<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>GMO DA</strong><br />
Biotech strong now- Globe and Mail 6/28 “they have ever so quietly” “the two have been called the next Microsoft”<br />
<br />
Subsidy system is key to the entire GMO industry Allen 04 (Will, “the war on bugs”, jan) “billions of dollars in corporate welfare” “a serious and fatal blow”<br />
<br />
Biofuels are key- demand is key to convincing the pubic that GM crops are safe Marrero 08 (Carmelo Ruiz, “biotech bets on Agrofuels”) “biotechnology companies have become some of the main movers”<br />
<br />
Public support of GMOs is key to the survival of the industry Helgren et al 00 (Karin, “genetically modified foods: consumer views and regulations around the world”) “the security of knowing that Biotech is safe”<br />
<br />
GMOs are our buffer from annihilation from a super volcano that would cause extinction Trewavas 00 (Anthony, “GM is the best option we have”) “in 535 A.D. a volcano near the present Krakatoa” “the only buffer between us and annihilation”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Ethics K</strong><br />
The aff fixates their resistance in the realm of existing political institutions. We are only able to effectuate positive change insofar as the 1AC gives us permission. The aff's attempt to beat the system at its own game results in the colonizing of our collective consciousness and obfuscates alternative ways of thinking<br />
Hershock 99 &quot;Changing the way society changes: transposing social activism into a dramatic key&quot;<br />
I have argued at some length (Herschock, 1999) that evaluating...'being right' and 'being wronged.'<br />
<br />
It is this displacement of our personal ethical commitments that allows for genocidal violence to take place. The allowance of political institutions to determine what is and is not ethical action or is the root of all atrocities<br />
Zupancic 2K <u>Ethics of the Real</u> pgs. 96-97<br />
Another problem that still remains, however:...'essentially a by-product' of our actions.<br />
<br />
Embracing the alternative and divorcing our personal ethical commitments onto external institutions soolves. Every individual action is key, ethics is impossible without divorcing ourselves from the political nad hte realm of political action<br />
Thurschwell 2K3 &quot;Symposium: Nietzsche and legal theory (part II): specters of nietzsche: potential futures for the concept of the political in agamben and derrida&quot;<br />
I would not call this attitude utopian...concerns the political and political action.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Sexual Difference K</strong><br />
<br />
The affirmatives attempt to deconstruction the logocentric practices that undergrid the enframing of the world in the age of the world picture formulates a relationship to language and Being that is fundamentally masculine by denying the mother-son connection. The aff act as independent makers of the world but this effaces that self-creation is impossible. This means that they have a poor relationship to being – only the alternative can activate always already present connections of sexual difference as a starting point for tearing down the ontotheological tradition<br />
Faulkner, professor of philosophy university of Alberta, 2K1 (Joanne, Amnesia at the Beginning of Time: Irigaray's reading of Heidegger in The<br />
Forgetting of Air Contertemps 2 may )<br />
According to Irigaray, the unrepresentable... the question of sexual difference must be thought through.<br />
<br />
The affirmatives homogenization of the conception of being precludes sexual difference- the affirmative has rendered the potential for different male and female subjectivities impossible<br />
Deutscher, professor in French philosophy and gender at Northwestern, 2K2 (Penelope, A Politics of Impossible difference)<br />
The second concept that calls for preliminary...we have made it impos­sible that they could.<br />
<br />
The affirmative is exemplary of the western traditions erasure of the potential for a feminine subjectivity. The feminine has been colonized under the guise of sexual neutrality which sustains the masculine subject as universal through an economy of Sameness<br />
Deutscher, professor in French philosophy and gender at Northwestern, 2K2 (Penelope, A Politics of Impossible difference pg. 26-29)<br />
Since Irigaray devotes so much careful attention...that Freud excludes it as a possibility.<br />
<br />
The continued foreclosure of the potential alternative subjectivity of the feminine leads to the atrophy of existence and the annihilation of alterity<br />
Deutscher, professor in French philosophy and gender at Northwestern, 2K2 (Penelope, A Politics of Impossible difference)<br />
A similar question will arise...I seduce you, I order you, I instruct you, and so on&quot; (11.0).<br />
<br />
Vote negative to reject the politics of aff and in order to inhabit the silence of the 1ac- our alternative begins with sexual difference as the point of departure from the dominate culture- this is crucial to avoiding the erasure of feminine subjectivity of the aff and the squo – our alternative solves 100% of the aff because ending the exploitation of women is crucial to recasting the social order<br />
Franks, doctoral candidate oxford university, 2K3 (Mary Anne, Obscene Undersides: Women and Evil between the Taliban and the United States Hypatia 18.1)<br />
In This Sex Which is Not One (1985) Irigaray allows herself...the West is not yet able to recognize.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Exclude &quot;its&quot; counterplan</strong><br />
<br />
Counterplan text: The United States Federal Govnermtn should eliminate subsidization for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations<br />
<br />
The use of the word “It” embodies the I-it relationship which destroys the possibility of ethical relations and leads to our demise<br />
<br />
Tusabe, coordinator ethics and public management programme national organizing committee development ethics Uganda, 1995 (G., “Ethics and Social Reconstruction in Africa”, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.crvp.org/book/Series02/II-4/chapter_ii.htm" rel="nofollow"> http://www.crvp.org/book/Series02/II-4/chapter_ii.htm </a> )<br />
<br />
“With regard to the co-existent character…towards higher levels of development.”<br />
<br />
The I-it relationship justifies slavery and all other forms of oppression<br />
<br />
Nacanaynay, 2001 (Jesus, “Re: TELL ME MORE ABT. THE PHILOSOPHY OF BUBER” p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://buber.de/en/forum/messages/79" rel="nofollow"> http://buber.de/en/forum/messages/79 </a> )<br />
<br />
“How about the I-It relation?...as our view of the world.”
