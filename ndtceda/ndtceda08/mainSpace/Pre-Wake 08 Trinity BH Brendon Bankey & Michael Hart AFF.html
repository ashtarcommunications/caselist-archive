Contention Two: Biofuels Increase Food Prices<br />
Corn ethanol is the root cause food price inflation – diverts grain, cause land tradeoffs and sparks financial speculation – our evidence is most qualified and least biased<br />
The Guardian 2008 (Aditya Chakrabortty, ‘Secret report: biofuel caused food crisis,’ July 4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/jul/03/biofuels.renewableenergy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront</a>)<br />
Biofuels have forced global AND tackle climate change.&quot;<br />
The structure of the biofuels industry makes high food prices and supply shocks inevitable – two reasons. First, diverting food to fuel cuts exports in half and depletes emergency stocks. Second, the ethanol business model focuses on localized production. Minor supply disturbances will cause bidding wars which collapse all sectors of the food industry.<br />
