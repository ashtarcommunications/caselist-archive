IRONICALLY, US AG SUBSIDIES HAVE PROVIDED THE MOTIVATION FOR DE-GLOBALIZATION. IF IT WASN'T FOR US AGRICULTURAL PROTECTION, COALITIONS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (KNOWN AS THE G-20 AND G-22) WOULDN'T HAVE ESTABLISHED SO MUCH BLOCKING POWER IN THE WTO<br />

CAFO AFFS<br />
ANIMAL WELFARE COUNTERPLAN<br />
THEREFORE WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING COUNTERPLAN TEXT:<br />
The United States federal government should ban the following practices in agriculture in the United States: feeding animals majority grain diets, debeaking, confining hens in battery cages, taildocking, using woodchippers as a method of slaughter, force mating, confining to gestation creates, and re-impregnating dairy cows more than once every fifteen months. In addition, the United States federal government should make the medical neglect, confinement of animals in areas of waste, and infliction of gratuitous suffering on farm animals illegal in the United States. The United States federal government should provide all necessary funding and authority to the United States Department of Agriculture to enforce the counter plan.<br />
<br />
The affirmative relies on industry benevolence to change its treatment of animals. Our strategy focuses on regulation, not the free market<br />
