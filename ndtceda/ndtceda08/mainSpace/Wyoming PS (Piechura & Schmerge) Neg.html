Ryan 1999 – 109 Yale L.J. 249<br />
“one final introductory not is in order” … “rather which method holds the most promise for achieving integration”<br />
<br />
Unpopular rulings cause the court to preserve capital in subsequent decisions<br />
Mondak 1991 – American Politics Quarterly, Vol 19 No. 2<br />
“the impact of the content of supreme court rulings has important ramifications” … “minimizing rulings likely to prompt hostile public reaction”<br />

New York Times 7-8-2006<br />
“the supreme court has agreed to rule next fall” … “will no longer be able to hide behind a legal fiction”<br />

Florida Times Union 2006<br />
“fleming island residents made themselves perfectly clear” … “parents said school attendance boundary changes could lower their property values and hamper home sales”<br />
<br />
the world economy is completely dependent on the us economy and us consumers<br />
King 10-24-2005<br />
“we need to spread our a risks a little” … “the world economy is increasingly dependent on an overly-mortgaged us consumer”<br />
