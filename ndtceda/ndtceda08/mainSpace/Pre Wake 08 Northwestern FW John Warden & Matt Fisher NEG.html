A sliding-scale subsidy based on corn prices solves the entire case while preserving the benefits of a domestic biofuels market, like investment in cellulose<br />

The new vogue in energy policy is plant-derived alternative...many of the distortions that current policy has created.<br />

Specifically, the CP solves the entire case in the short term – corn prices are just above the level where the subsidy is zero<br />
MST (Minneapolis Star-Tribune), 10-27, 2008, “Corn prices up on hunch farmers will slow sales,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.startribune.com/business/33420874.html?elr=KArks:DCiU1OiP:DiiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU" rel="nofollow">http://www.startribune.com/business/33420874.html?elr=KArks:DCiU1OiP:DiiUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU</a><br />
Corn prices on Monday rose the most in a week...52 percent from a record $7.9925 on June 27.<br />
<br />
The counterplan creates a sustainable market for biofuel, solving corn tech lock-in and creating a bridge to next-gen biofuels – and, it prevents the accumulation of massive corn surpluses when prices are low<br />

The plan removes the incentive for Afghan farmers to grow wheat – they’ll switch back to opium for this fall’s planting season if the price of wheat drops<br />
AFP (Agence France Presse), June 5, 2008, “Food prices alone won't stop Afghan opium growers: experts,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMEw0labdlueLtTkC0_fnol7OB3A" rel="nofollow">http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gMEw0labdlueLtTkC0_fnol7OB3A</a><br />
Opium, of which Afghanistan produces more than 90 percent...incentive to encourage them to switch,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Recent gains in opium reduction are reversible in the short term – failure to lock-in alternative crops dooms Afghanistan to renewed instability that spills over to the entire region<br />
BBC News, Martin Patience, BBC News Kabul, 8-26, 2008, “UN reports Afghan opium decline,”<br />
The area of poppy production in Afghanistan and the yield of opium ...inextricable link between drugs and the conflict&quot;.<br />

Renewed instability fueled by re-Talibanization splinters both Pakistan and Afghanistan, inciting global nuclear war<br />

Natural Gas DA<br />
A. Natural Gas Prices high and stable<br />
Houston Chronicle, 10-2, 2008, “Natural gas wholesale prices likely to be stable”<br />
And that high production, combined with a...president of natural gas and crude oil sales.<br />

Food Aid DA<br />
LDCs are becoming food self-sufficient by protecting domestic producers – assistance could create global self-sufficiency, but a return to cheap U.S. exports would reverse all the gains<br />
William Tabb, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Queens College, October 2008, “Four Crises of the Contemporary World Capitalist System,” Monthly Review, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://monthlyreview.org/081006tabb.php" rel="nofollow">http://monthlyreview.org/081006tabb.php</a><br />
Today a quarter of all deaths in the world have some...free or low-cost agricultural exports in their countries.<br />
<br />
Dumping in-kind food aid causes price volatility, deters local food production, and cements poverty and food insecurity – flips the case<br />
David Harris, economist at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), the Centre for International Economics (CIE), Bonlac Foods Ltd and the OECD Secretariat in Paris, August 2007, “Food Aid and Agricultural Trade Reform,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/GLC/07-136sum.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rirdc.gov.au/reports/GLC/07-136sum.html</a><br />
The other concern with food aid is the affect on domestic...output and diversifying into other products.<br />
<br />
Agricultural production in the developing world is key to solve poverty – fastest reductions in history were because of production spurred by high prices<br />
Homi Kharas, Senior Fellow, Global Economy and Development, Wolfensohn Center for Development, August 6, 2008, “The Reality of Rising Food Prices: Benefits to the Poor,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0806_food_prices_kharas.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0806_food_prices_kharas.aspx</a>, accessed October 15, 2008<br />
In the last analysis, almost everyone agrees that we...decline in poverty in history. And it started with a rise in food prices.<br />
<br />
The impact to poverty is equivalent to nuclear war<br />

[James, Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, and a member of the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence, “Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and its Causes”, p. 191-196]<br />
The deadliest form of violence is poverty. You cannot work for one...for they are inextricably related to each other, as cause to effect.<br />
<br />
CAFO NEG<br />
Courts CP<br />
<strong>The United States Supreme Court should clarify that Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations no longer have protection under Right-To-Farm laws.</strong><br />
<br />
CAFOs will eventually become obsolete—the question is what we should do in the short term—eliminating CAFOs illegitimate claim to right-to-farm laws is critical to an environmentally friendly transition away from industrial animal farming—solves the entire aff<br />

Obviously, each community I have visited is different, but they all have many similarities. For...those who have the wisdom and the courage to claim it.<br />

Cattle DA<br />
The cattle market is weathering the credit crunch because of sustained demand – lenders are extending credit in the short term but are ultra-cautious about the potential for prices to drop<br />
Reuters 10-1, 2008, “Cattle ranchers feel pinch of credit crunch”<br />
The credit crisis has made it tough for ranchers...the last three to four years,&quot; Broadbent said.<br />
<br />
The plan devastates cattle prices – reduced demand and perception of uncertain future will force a cattle sell-off<br />
CFEA (Commodity Futures &amp; Equity Analytics), 2000, “Live Stock and Meat Futures,” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commodityseasonals.com/live_stock_and_meat_futures.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.commodityseasonals.com/live_stock_and_meat_futures.htm</a><br />
Cow-calf operations are businesses, and like any other...and prices increase as the whole process begins again.<br />
<br />
Cattle futures are marked at current market prices, not purchase prices for cattle – a sudden drop in purchase prices would leave banks holding tons of ultra-toxic assets – collapses the credibility of the farm banking sector<br />
The Cattle Report, 10-3, 2008, “THE BAILOUT and MAKING A SILK PURSE OUT OF A SOW'S EAR” online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.agcenter.com/newcattlereport.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.agcenter.com/newcattlereport.aspx</a><br />
Mark to market is very familiar with anyone operating...at the expense of the credibility of our financial institutions.<br />
<br />
That would collapse the banking industry and the economy – recent crises have shredded its resiliency<br />
