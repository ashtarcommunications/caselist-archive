Judge Comments:<br />
<br />
Holbrook (Neg) –<br />
When we have the test case argument, spend way more time on the kritik – no arg in 1ar about their alternative<br />
Alternative solves case because it’s conceded<br />
2ar is correct/persuasive, but they’re not in the 1ar on alternative, permutation<br />
Your Andrews ev doesn’t say we should abandon race<br />
<br />
Thad (Neg) –<br />
Neg wins for technical reasons – alt can solve racism – other rounds, this alt wouldn’t be persuasive<br />
Their alt evidence says we can take a psychological approach to reveling in racism<br />
<br />
Harris (Aff) –<br />
I vote on permutation – the links and alt are like 2 ships passing in the night<br />
If alt can overcome what exists because of aff, then aff creating binaries<br />
Aff does link but not made – aff tries to avoid death from racism and the alt is to aff<br />
<br />
<strong>Their link cards are aff cards – be more offensive in 2ac – this is our advantage<br />
If not the aff, the alt has no exploration of what it means to turn away<br />
Read more legal change key stuff<br />
Andrews ev is not radical enough – it’s cosmopolitan vision, not very radical<br />
<br />
*Reveling in death bad, bad for minorities, don’t know how that escapes, personal and institutional difference – theirs talks about how we experience as an individual but can’t do anything about institutions</strong><br />

C. Alternative – vote neg to reject the neoliberalism implicit in the affirmative. This solves the case.<br />
1. Rejection of the plan clears out a space to dissent against neoliberalism—saying “no” to the aff is the crucial first step to genuine political resistance, 2004<br />

Alito has staked out an unambiguously conservative position on one big issue: how to apply Article I, Section 8,<br />

Stephenson ‘99<br />
(Donald Grier, Professor of Government – Franklin and Marshall College, Campaigns and the Court: The U.S. Supreme Court in Presidential Elections, p. 233)<br />
In contrast to 1936, it is difficult to comprehend the shape of the campaigns or even the candidates of 1968, 1980, and 1984 without the Supreme Court.<br />
<br />
It seemed light-years since 1964, when a Democratic Congress was able to pass the Civil Rights Act only with significant Republican support.<br />
<br />
2. Current court conservativism is a precondition for Democratic mobilization<br />
<br />
Kirkpatrick ‘06<br />
(David, New York Times, 2-1, Lexis)<br />
Still, Democrats vowed to make an issue of Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts's decisions in elections this fall and beyond. ''We will be watching our two newest<br />
<br />
lose?'' said an e-mail message from Naral Pro-Choice America to its supporters. ''One word sums it up: numbers.'' The message continued, ''We don't have the majority in the Senate.''<br />

C. Impact<br />
1. Democrat win would spur engagement of North Korea --- key to strong U.S.-South Korean relations<br />
<br />
Korea Herald ‘06<br />
(8-15, Lexis)<br />
International experts have collectively raised concerns about the prospects for the decades-long partnership between South Korea and the United States as discord<br />
<br />
November elections. The prevailing sentiment is that although dramatic policy changes are unlikely, a Democrat-controlled congress would possibly be more willing to engage the North.<br />
<br />
2. Strong relations prevent conflict with the North<br />
Derek J. Mitchell, senior fellow for Asia projects in the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS¬), 9-22, 2001<br />

<br />
The capabilities of the two Koreas are matched to the extent that neither side could survive a war and afterwards claim anything but a<br />

Judicial invalidations of congressional enactments have the potential to remobilize the constituencies that agitated for those<br />

2. Lack of day care prevents full equality for women<br />
Heather S. Dixon, Associate, Case Western Reserve Law Review, Summer, 2005, Article: National Daycare: A Necessary Precursor to Gender Equality With Newfound Promise for Success, Columbia Human Rights Law Review, Lexis<br />
<br />
Contrary to the position taken by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, n49 in fact, all women are impeded in their quest for equality<br />

3. Governments must weigh consequences<br />
Owen Harries, editor and founder of The National Interest, Senior Fellow at The Centre for Independent Studies, Spring 1993/1994, The National Interest, “Power and Civilization,” p. Lexis<br />
Performance is the test. Asked directly by a Western interviewer, “In principle, do you believe in one standard of human rights and<br />
<br />
treat them as inviolable and over-riding. The cost of implementing and promoting them will always have to be considered.<br />
<br />
4. Moral absolutism suffers from tunnel vision that generates evil and political irrelevance<br />
Jeffrey C. Isaac, professor of political science at Indiana-Bloomington, director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public Life, PhD from Yale, Spring 2002, Dissent Magazine, Vol. 49, Iss. 2, “Ends, Means, and Politics,” p. Proquest<br />
As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, an<br />

<br />
5. Egalitarianism demands utility: consequentialism precludes zeroing out anyone<br />
Ronald Dworkin, Professor of Law and Philosophy at New York University, 1977, Taking Rights Seriously, p. 274-5<br />
Utilitarian arguments of policy, however, would seem secure from that objection. They do not suppose that<br />
<br />
more or less worthy of respect, than any other.<br />
<br />
6. Calculation inevitable: you have a duty to avoid worse consequences<br />
David Campbell, University of Newcastle Professor of International Politics, 1999, Moral Spaces: Rethinking Ethics and World Politics, edited by Campbell &amp; Michael J. Shapiro, p. 45-6<br />
In this context, justice enables the law, but the law is that which “is never exercised without a decision that cuts, that<br />
<br />
resistance to totalitarianism in all its forms.<br />
<br />
7. Human rights<br />
[A] Link –<br />

Relying on the Commerce Clause for human rights concerns perpetuates politics-as-usual. Any injustice that doesn’t impact the economy will be considered irrelevant.<br />

[James Gray, THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT VERSUS THE COMMERCE CLAUSE: LABOR AND THE SHAPING OF AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, 1921-1957, January, 102 Colum. L. Rev. 1, Lexis]<br />
The new lens - which is really just an old lens that was forgotten for awhile - is populist constitutionalism.<br />
<br />
validation of the New Deal statutes could still be defended as an expression of popular will, but the shape of the constitutional regime that followed would be suspect.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[B] Implication –<br />

Khalilzad 1995.<br />

Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity<br />

global nuclear exchange. U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />

Congressional cloning regulation won’t pass scrutiny under narrow interpretations of the Commerce Clause.<br />

[Roger H., The Fear of Drawing the Line at Cloning, 9 B.U. J. SCI. &amp; TECH. L. 379, Lexis]<br />
The Constitution grants and sets boundaries for legislative power. Under the Commerce Clause, Congress<br />
<br />
protecting non-viable embryos may not outweigh the rights associated with cloning.<br />

Impact –<br />
<br />
Cloning is inevitable, but regulation pushes it underground.<br />
Gough, Director of Science and Risk Studies at CATO Institute, 1998<br />

Politicians are rushing to make human cloning a crime. They need to slow down, step back and think carefully<br />

exchange of scientific information is generally open and where there's an inquiring press, than to drive it overseas and underground.<br />

Why is cloning important? The most immediate application of cloning is improved breeding by being able to<br />

eliminate animal suffering. The economics of factory farming place a very low priority on the comfort and life style of the animals.<br />

The political realm has failed. Calls for pragmatism and justice have left us with a culture of genocide, war, and terrorism. According to Lacan, this occurs due to our unconscious anxiety and fears being displaced upon the other. Therefore, the only way to remedy our age of violence is by addressing these unconscious desires through psychoanalytic method. Its critique of language and how it shapes our political reality is the only means of transforming peace from a utopian dream into a way of thinking.<br />
<br />
Joanna M. <strong>Byles</strong>, English Department @ University of Cyprus, “Psychoanalysis and War: The Superego and Projective Identification” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/2004_byles01.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.clas.ufl.edu/ipsa/journal/2004_byles01.shtml</a> <strong>2004</strong><br />
<br />
The problem for us today … a way of thinking.<br />
<br />
Our method comes first. Only by acknowledging that there is an incommensurable gap between our symbolic conception of reality and the Real can we begin to understand the political.<br />
<br />
Yannis <strong>Stavrakakis</strong>, teaching fellow at the Department of Government at the University of Essex,<br />
Lacan and the Political,p. 73-75, 19<strong>99</strong><br />
<br />
The field of social construction … politics and the political.<br />
<br />
And this is especially true in the context of law. There is no absolute legal truth that we can achieve. Therefore, only by analyzing the failures between the symbolic order and the real can we begin to understand our political attempts at law.<br />

The Aff’s belief in the law and that there is some truth behind the system only masks our relationship within the Symbolic Order.<br />
<br />
Dennis King <strong>Keenan</strong>, Professor of Philosophy, Fairfield University “Irigaray and the Sacrifice of the Sacrifice of Woman” Hypatia 19.4 <strong>2004</strong><br />
<br />
Žižek writes that belief … its foundation in Justice, Truth<br />
<br />
<br />
And it is this flawed belief in the law that is the root cause of inconsistency and indeterminacy. However, instead of realizing these lacks within the system, we incessantly attempt to master its excesses. Therefore, our superego creates “nightly law” as a means to correct our failed system. Through this underbelly of the Public law, violence and extermination become our new code in order to salvage society.<br />
<br />
Jodi <strong>Dean</strong>, Associate Professor of Political Theory Hobart and William Smith College “Zizek on Law”<br />
Law and Critique 15: 1–24 <strong>2004</strong><br />
<br />
In addition to the violence … even as they are formally disavowed.<br />
<br />
State reformism is horribly flawed. Catastrophes become inevitable as the system futilely works within the Symbolic. Only through the alternative and its tragic conception of reality can we disturb these fantasies of control.<br />
