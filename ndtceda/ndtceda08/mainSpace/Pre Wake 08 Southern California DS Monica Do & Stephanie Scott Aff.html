AFFIRMATIVE - COTTON<br />
<br />
Despite international pressure to adhere to WTO rulings to eliminate illegal cotton subsidies, the US refuses to comply. Cotton subsidies will remain intact.<br />
Xinhua 2008 [&quot;WTO: U.S. fails to remove illegal cotton subsidies&quot;, June 3, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90856/6423241.html" rel="nofollow">http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90856/6423241.html</a>]<br />
The World Trade Organization…illegal measures<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan:<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate nearly all of its domestic subsidies for cotton.<br />
<br />
US cotton subsidies are driving down global cotton prices and distorting the global market, undermining competition by developing countries<br />
Helling, Beaulier, and Hall 2008 [Madeline, Scott, and Joshua, student at Belloit College, Assistant Professor of Economics at Beloit College, and Assistant Professor of Economics at Beloit College, &quot;High Cotton: Why the USA Should not provide subsidies to cotton farmers&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://joshua.c.hall.googlepages.com/HighCotton.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://joshua.c.hall.googlepages.com/HighCotton.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Since the mid-1990s…for a profit<br />
<br />
<br />
Next, Depressed prices leaves 10 million West Africans with the basic means to survive, education, healthcare, and the revenues to pull themselves out of the cycle of poverty<br />
Pfeifer, Alpert, and Kripke 2004 [Kimberly, Gawain, and Emily, policy analysts for Oxfam and Senior Policy Advisor on international trade issues with Oxfam America and policy analyst for Oxfam America, &quot;Finding the Moral Fiber&quot;, Oxfam Briefing Paper 69, October, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Falling cotton…financial debt<br />
<br />
<br />
And the effects of the plan have global repercussions - US cotton subsidies impoverish hundreds of millions of rural peasants in China and India, resulting in internal instability and huge rates of suicide<br />
Einhorn and Srivastava 2008 [Bruce and Mehul, Asia regional editor in BusinessWeek's Hong Kong bureau and reporter for Business Week, &quot;WTO: Why India and China Said No to U.S.&quot;, Business Week, JUuly 30, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2008/gb20080730_027680.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2008/gb20080730_027680.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business</a>]<br />
<br />
Following the collapse…current budget<br />
<br />
US cotton agribusiness is pushing for further expansion into African markets, creating competition for market access and scarce resources<br />
Zachary 2007 [G. Pascal, formerly a senior writer for The Wall Street Journal, &quot;Out of Africa: Cotton and Cash&quot;, New York Times, January 14, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/business/yourmoney/14duna.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/business/yourmoney/14duna.html</a>]<br />
Dunavant's decision…American growers<br />
<br />
<br />
And, only a COMPLETE overhaul of US cotton subsidies creates conditions that allow West African countries to make the infrastructural adjustments necessary to change structural violence<br />
Rizvi 2007 [Haidir, &quot;US Cotton Subsidies Cost W. Africa Millions: Report&quot;, June 26, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/06/26/2116/" rel="nofollow">http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/06/26/2116/</a>]<br />
More than…he added<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact is structural violence, which is equivalent to an ongoing thermonuclear war every decade<br />
Gilligan 2000 [James, Department of Psychiatry Harvard Medical School, Violence: Reflections on our deadliest epidemic, p 195-196]<br />
The 14…the world<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover, this form of structural violence is the sole driver fueling the AIDs spread. The only way to tackle the problem of the AIDs pandemic is through poverty alleviation<br />
Lindsey 2001 [Daryl, &quot;A pandemic fueled by poverty&quot;, Salon.com, June 27, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2001/06/27/aids_poverty/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2001/06/27/aids_poverty/index.html</a>]<br />

Every age…in jeopardy<br />
<br />
<br />
Substantial cuts in commodity subsidies are a growing political reality – recent WTO decisions against US cotton will encourage future complains. The only question is which ones we cut and why<br />
Shumaker 2007 [Michael J., &quot;Tearing the Fabric of the World Trade Organization: United States – Subsidies on Upland Cotton,&quot; North Carolina Journal of International Law &amp; Commercial Regulation, Spring, Lexis]<br />
<br />
Developing countries…relevant here<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently, though, US failures to adhere to the WTO cotton rulings are eroding faith in the multilateral trade system's ability to arbitrate and enforce<br />
Morris 2006 [Madeline, reporter for the BBC news, &quot;What now for Doha?&quot;, BBC News, August 1, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5235670.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5235670.stm</a>]<br />
Another option…fairer world trade<br />
<br />
<br />
And US non-compliance with WTO rulings sets a precedent for other countries to violate multilateral trade standards<br />
Rusu and Benicchio 2007 [Laura and Romain, Press officer for Oxfam America and Advocacy officer for Oxfam International, &quot;Oxfam says US must reform illegal cotton subsidies or lose credibility, following wto panel ruling&quot;, Oxfam Press Release, October 16, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/?p=989" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/?p=989</a>]<br />
According To…International rules<br />
<br />
<br />
Reviving Doha is unnecessary. What is critical is preventing backsliding of Doha progress towards protectionism<br />
The Star 2008 [&quot;Hsien Loong: Need for trade liberalization&quot;, August 27, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/27/business/1891755&amp;sec=business" rel="nofollow">http://biz.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/8/27/business/1891755&amp;sec=business</a>]<br />
The lack…overall agreement<br />
<br />
Right now, Brazil is seeking sanctions and only full and complete compliance with WTO rulings appeases it<br />
Sibaja 2008 [Marco, writer for the Associated Press, &quot;Brazil seeks sanctions against US&quot;, Associated Press, June 3, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=105&amp;sid=1414743" rel="nofollow">http://www.wtop.com/?nid=105&amp;sid=1414743</a>]<br />
Brazil will…he said<br />
<br />
<br />
Specifically, these sanctions would force suspension of intellectual property rights and concessions in service sectors<br />
International Center for Trade and Sustainable Development 2008 [&quot;Brazil to Seek US$4 Billion in Sanctions against US&quot;, WTO Cases • Volume 12 • Number 23, June 25, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ictsd.net/i/news/bridgesweekly/12271/" rel="nofollow">http://ictsd.net/i/news/bridgesweekly/12271/</a>]<br />
But Before…another sector<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover, Brazilian sanctions would have a domino effect as other countries impose their own sanctions<br />
Stratfor 2008 [&quot;Brazil: Cotton Sanctions Could Create Larger Aftershocks for U.S.&quot;, June 5, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/brazil_cotton_sanctions_could_create_larger_aftershocks_u_s" rel="nofollow">http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/brazil_cotton_sanctions_could_create_larger_aftershocks_u_s</a>]<br />
Under WTO rules…WTO members<br />
<br />
<br />
And, retaliation will escalate into trade wars<br />
Giacomo 2005 [Carol, diplomatic correspondent for Reuters, &quot;US says may retaliate against Brazil over trade&quot;, Reuters, October 6, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://lanr.blogspot.com/2005/10/us-says-may-retaliate-against-brazil.html" rel="nofollow">http://lanr.blogspot.com/2005/10/us-says-may-retaliate-against-brazil.html</a>]<br />
There's always…pharmaceuticals industry<br />
<br />
Eliminating cotton subsidies is key to reviving the framework of multilateral trade and bringing countries back to the table<br />
Mehta 2008 [Pradeep S., Secretary General of Consumer Unity &amp; Trust Society, &quot;Multilateral talks never fail&quot;, The Economic Times, August 9, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Guest_Writer/Multilateral_talks_never_fail/articleshow/3343865.cms" rel="nofollow">http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Guest_Writer/Multilateral_talks_never_fail/articleshow/3343865.cms</a>]<br />
It was actually…move ahead<br />
<br />
<br />
Luckily, US moves to fully comply with WTO mandates restores the credibility of the multilateral trading system<br />

The affirmative is also the perfect example of agricultural reform – rather than complete and immediate overhaul, a case-by-case basis starting with cotton will provide political cover while jump starting wide-scale reform efforts<br />
