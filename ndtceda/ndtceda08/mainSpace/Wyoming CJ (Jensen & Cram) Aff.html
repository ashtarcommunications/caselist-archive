Plan Text<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1 (1942), on the grounds that the decision violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution, holding: (1) That military commissions are not lawfully constituted. (2) That detainees are not held in lawful custody for trial before a military commission because the no cause has been shown for their detention.<br />

<h2 id="toc47"><a name="Critical Quirin Aff-Observation One: The Greatest Trick the Devil Ever Pulled"></a>Observation One: The Greatest Trick the Devil Ever Pulled</h2>
<br />
FIRST, A LITTLE HISTORY—THE DECISION IN QUIRIN ESTABLISHED THE PRIVILEGE OF VIOLENCE, BUT ONLY FOR SOME, EMBODIED IN THE DOCTRINE OF THE ‘UNLAWFUL’ COMBATANT<br />
ZACHARY (J.D.) 2005<br />
[Shlomy, “Between the Geneva Conventions”, Israel Law Review, Winter/Spring, p. ln wyo-tjc]<br />
The term unlawful … belligerency unlawful&quot;. n37<br />
<br />
SECOND, IN THE FACE OF BUSH’S REVIVAL OF THE TERM IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM, THE LEFT HAS CONCEPTUALIZED THE SPACE OF GUANTANAMO BAY AS THE EXCEPTION, THE BLACK-HOLE OUTSIDE OF LAW. THIS IS EXACTLY NOT THE CASE. GUANTAMO IS AN INSTANTIATION OF THE EXCESS OF LAW IN OVERDRIVE<br />
JOHNS (Univ. of Sydney, Faculty of Law) 2006<br />
[Fleur, “Guantanamo Bay and the Annihilation of the Exception”, European Journal of International Law, Vol. 16, No. 4 wyo-tjc]<br />
Is Guantánamo Bay, Cuba,…interrogation and resistance.<br />
<br />
THIRD, THE RESULT OF THIS CUNNING RUSE HAS BEEN THE LESS THAN RADICAL CALL TO RETURN TO LAW. THIS MOVE FETISHIZES AND REDEEMS LAW, ERASING IT’S CONSTRUCTION OF VIOLENCE AND ALLOWING IT TO RUN ROUGHSHOD OVER THE MAJORITY OF HUMANITY<br />
NEOCLEOUS (Politics &amp; History @ Brunel University) 2006<br />
[Mark, “the Problem with Normality”, Alternatives, no. 31 <em>wyo-tjc]<br />
To criticize the use of emergency … in the fabrication of social order.</em><br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc48"><a name="Critical Quirin Aff-Observation Two: The Advantage"></a>Observation Two: The Advantage</h2>
<br />
FIRST, THOUGHOUT HISTORY, SOCIETY HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY CONFOUNDED AT THE FAILURE OF LAW TO CONTAIN VIOLENCE—WE SEE LAW AS A ‘LESSER EVIL’ THAT IS NECESSARY TO HUMANIZE WAR. QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, THE LAWS OF WAR, AND ESPECIALLY THE DOCTRINE OF ‘UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS’ SERVES TO LEGITIMIZE AND PROTECT STATIST FORMS OF VIOLENCE AND CRUSH DISSENT<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln wyo-tjc]<br />
In 1928, the parties to the … engaged in by other people. n9<br />
<br />
<br />
SECOND, CASTING CERTAIN FORMS AND TYPES OF COMBATANCY AS ‘UNLAWFUL’ CONSTRUCTS A NORMALIZED FORUM OF VIOLENCE, GRANTING LAW THE AUTHORITY TO CHOOSE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR ENTIRE POPULATIONS<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln wyo-tjc]<br />
By granting the … fora in the last few [*13] years.<br />
<br />
THIRD, THIS STATIST MODE OF VIOLENCE IS A PERPETUAL GENOCIDE WHERE OUR LEADERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THE DICTATORS AND TERRORISTS THEY PURPORT PROTECT US FROM ONLY IN NAME—CHALLENGING AND DESTROYING THE WAR-MACHINE IS THE ONLY HOPE.<br />
<br />
SHAW (Prof Int’l Relations and Politics at University of Sussex) 2000<br />
[Martin, “The Contemporary Mode of Warfare?”, International Political Economy, vol. 7, no. 1, p. 171-80 wyo-tjc]<br />
There is here something of a mismatch…provide a framework of legitimacy for all the new warriors.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin 317 U.S. 1 (1942) by holding that there is no distinction between lawful and unlawful combatancy.<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc49"><a name="Critical Quirin Aff-Observation Three: The Third Observation"></a>Observation Three: The Third Observation</h2>
<br />
FIRST, LEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS OF ‘UNLAWFUL COMBATANCY’ AND LEGAL WAR ARE HIGHLY CONTINGENT—EXPOSING THE VULNERABILITY AND POLITICAL NATURE OF THESE LEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS IS CRITICAL TO RENDER LAW’S CONSTRUCTION OF VIOLENCE VISIBLE, AND ALLOW A TRUE ALTERNATIVE TO FILL THE VOID<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln wyo-tjc]<br />
The third proposition … rather than simply bemoaning its misuse by all the major participants.<br />
<br />
SECOND, DISSAPPEARING OF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAWFUL AND UNLAWFUL VIOLENCE SOWS THE SEEDS FOR PROPER SOCIAL CHAOS, RENDERING VISIBLE THE VIOLENCE INHERENT WITHIN BOTH LAWS CONSTRUCTION OF PEACE AND WAR<br />
BERMAN (Prof of Law at Brooklyn Law School) 2004<br />
[Nathaniel, “Privleging Combat?”, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, p. ln wyo-tjc]<br />
At a hypothetical level, there are two condition…, have considerably destabilized the entire legal construction of war.<br />
<br />
THIRD, ONLY BY REFUSING TO TAKE LAW AT ITS WORD AND EXPOSING LAW AS VIOLENCE CAN WE CREATE THE TRUE STATE OF EMERGENCY—BREAKING LAW’S MONOPOLY ON VIOLENCE ALLOWS TRUE RADICAL POLITICS TO ENTER. MAKE NO MISTAKE. IT WILL BE VIOLENT, BUT WE MUST EMBRACE THIS TO OVERCOME THE FASCISM OF LAW<br />
NEOCLEOUS (Politics &amp; History @ Brunel University) 2006<br />
[Mark, “the Problem with Normality”, Alternatives, no. 31// wyo-tjc]<br />
The question to ask, then… bourgeois world of the rule of law.<br />
<br />
THE 1AC ALLOWS YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE STATE IN A NEW WAY. INVOKING A STATE OF EMERGENCY EXPOSES ITS IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION AND THE VIOLENT CONTRADICTIONS THAT SUSTAIN IT. VOTING AFF IS WRITING AGAINST THE STATIST IMAGINARY, ALLOWING FOR RESISTENCE TO ITS FAULTY UNDERSTANDING OF IDENTITY<br />
Neocleous 2003<br />
[Mark, Teaches politics @ Brunel, Imagining the state, Philadelphia: Open University Press, 6-7/uwyo-ajl]<br />
The last point … end to the possibility of fascism.<br />
