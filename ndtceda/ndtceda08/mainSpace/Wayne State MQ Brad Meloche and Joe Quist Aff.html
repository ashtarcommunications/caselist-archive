<u><strong>CAFOs Aff - Pre-John Carroll</strong></u><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention One: Welcome to <em><u>The Jungle</u></em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>In 1906, Upton Sinclair’s <u><em>The Jungle</em></u> highlighted how the American meatpacking industry was structured as an amoral jungle where a highly exploitive and dangerous capital rationality rules. However, Upton could not know that what he discovered in the Chicago meatpacking district was just the beginning of what would become the modern atrocity known as Concentrated Animal Feed Operations. As Professor Nibert, Associate Professor of Sociology at Wittenberg University explains in 2002:</strong><br />
<br />
(David Alan, Animal Rights/human Rights: Entanglements of Oppression and Liberation, Contributor Michael W. Fox, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, Lanham, Maryland)<br />
<br />
Corporate cupidity has intensified … the willpower these animals have. &quot;41<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Contention Two: Market Fundamentalism</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>CAFOs have emerged as the most significant type of animal farm and have wiped out small local farms. Like Walmart, these operations are fixated on cost efficiency and profit above all other values. The result is massive escalation of suffering and oppression of animals in the name of capital rationality.<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>This intensive obsession with efficiency produces horrible violence, animal diseases and terrifying genetic modifications. Within this context, 300 animals are slaughtered every second as animals are transformed into unfeeling machines through the logic of capitalist rationality.<br />

Intensive confinement also reduces … avert your eyes on the part of everyone else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>This system of animal subjugation encourages other nations to create conditions of explotation, despair and poverty within their nations in order to supply cheap feed and meat for US CAFOs. This is just one example of how the capitalist logic of animal exploitation leads to the oppression of all life.<br />

<strong>Allowing this rationality to dominate agriculture makes biosphere collapse and extinction inevitable<br />

<br />
Today, giant corporations dominate … including humanity itself.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>This capitalist logic makes all their impacts inevitable – populations are sacrificed on the altar of market fundamentalism and outside struggles are crushed<br />

<strong>Resisting this reliance on economic evaluation is the ultimate ethical responsibility – the current social order guarantees social exclusion on a global scale<br />

For Zizek it is imperative that … an otherwise sound matrix.<br />
