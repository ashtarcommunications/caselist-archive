<strong>Observation One: The Status Quo</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Biofuels supported by subsidies and tariffs in the status quo are a response to America’s desire to escape its need for oil. Crop production for biofuels is up and may lead to just as many harms as status quo fossil fuels</strong><br />

<strong>This pragmatic reform through technology forces our surroundings into standing reserve where even human beings are expendable and obliterates our connection with Being</strong><br />

<br />
<br />
…Thus we affirm that the United States Federal Government should not subsidize biofuels…<br />
<br />
Our affirmation rejects the policies that solidify the metaphysical ontology of the status quo. It is an interruption of the flawed hermeneutic cycle that allows the subsidization of biofuels which places the natural environment into standing reserve – to be used solely for human consumption. Biofuels are only given value based on the importance they play in human society. Rejecting subsidies of biofuels and interrupting this flawed ontology is an acknowledgement that a mindset shift is necessary – only by interrupting our current relationship to nature and our relationship to Being can we hope to avoid the standing reserve that becomes inevitable in a world with current US agriculture policies.<br />

<strong>Our affirmation is an interruption that is necessary to avoid environmental managerialism in the status quo that thwarts value to life and makes extinction through nuclear war and environmental destruction inevitable.</strong><br />

“What is most illustrative… forgetfulness of 'the mystery'.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>This loss of Being is even worse than nuclear war – given that a questioning of Ontology is necessary to understand Being, the ontic way of knowing extinction will always be secondary to the loss of a value to life without said questioning – making extinction of the body inevitable in a world where Being is not first questioned.</strong><br />

<strong>Observation Three: Ontology</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>To avoid the inevitability of impacts such as nuclear war, value to life, extinction and terrorism an ontological shift must occur. Ontic knowledge will only be useful in a world where we take the time to form the questions necessary to better understand our Ontology. Current agriculture policy is a blind leap of faith that is always doomed to fail so long as we don’t examine our Ontology first – only</strong> <strong>ontological examination can lead to a true understanding of our world.</strong><br />
