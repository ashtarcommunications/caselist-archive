<br />
Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
Morrison represented a seachange in the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence – it signaled that the Court would actively police Congressional regulations in preservation of federalism<br />
Adler 05 – Visiting Associate Professor at George Mason University School of Law<br />
[Jonathan H., &quot;IS MORRISON DEAD? ASSESSING A SUPREME DRUG (LAW) OVERDOSE,&quot; Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review, Winter, 9 Lewis &amp; Clark L. Rev. 751, LN]<br />
While modest in scope...limits of the Commerce Clause once again.<br />
<br />
Despite a seemingly contrary result, the Court's subsequent Commerce Clause decision in Raich did not abandon the logic of Morrison. It presented a different question. The Court will continue to follow Morrison in subsequent cases.<br />
Brown 05 – Professor at Boston College Law School<br />
[George D., &quot;Counterrevolution?-National Criminal Law After Raich,&quot; Ohio State Law Journal, 66 Ohio St. L.J. 947, LN]<br />
Nonetheless, there are reasons to believe...federalism found in Lopez.<br />
<br />
PLANS<br />
<br />
Explicit Overrule<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), by holding that a rational basis test is the appropriate test when evaluating challenges to Congress's authority to regulate under the Commerce Clause. The test should permit regulation when Congress has a rational basis to conclude that the regulated activity taken in the aggregate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.<br />
<br />
Implicit Overrule<br />
The United States Supreme Court should hold that a rational basis test is the appropriate test when evaluating challenges to Congress's authority to regulate under the Commerce Clause. The test should permit regulation when Congress has a rational basis to conclude that the regulated activity taken in the aggregate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Solvency<br />
Returning to rational basis review of Commerce Clause challenges will clarify the Court's jurisprudence and prevent ad hoc invalidation of important statutes<br />
Dral and Phillips 01 – J.D., University of Tennessee; and Professor of Law at University of Tennessee<br />
[Christy H. and Jerry J., &quot;Commerce By Another Name: The Impact of United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison,&quot; Tennessee Law Review, Spring, 68 Tenn. L. Rev. 605, LN]<br />
It is true, as Chief Justice Rehnquist points out...imposed by rules of law.&quot; 238<br />
<br />
Advantage : The Endangered Species Act<br />
Morrison has sparked a wave of litigation aimed at rolling back federal environmental protections<br />
Austin and Schang 04 – Senior Attorneys and Directors of Endangered Environmental Laws Program at Environmental Law Institute<br />
[Jay and Scott, &quot;Fundamentalist Federalism,&quot; Environmental Forum, Sep./Oct., <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.endangeredlaws.org/pdf/FundamentalistFederalism.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.endangeredlaws.org/pdf/FundamentalistFederalism.pdf</a>]<br />
Lately, though, judicial innovation has...debate at the highest levels.<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court will soon take up a case forcing it to rule on the constitutionality of the ESA<br />
Bishop 06 – Partner Specializing in Environmental Law at Mayer, Brown, Rowe &amp; Maw<br />
[Timothy S., &quot;DOES THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT REGULATE COMMERCE?&quot; 24th Annual Law Conference, Coronado, CA, February 23-24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mayerbrownrowe.com/publications/article.asp?id=967&amp;nid=6#search=%22DOES%20THE%20ENDANGERED%20SPECIES%20ACT%20REGULATE%20COMMERCE%3F%22" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayerbrownrowe.com/publications/article.asp?id=967&amp;nid=6#search=%22DOES%20THE%20ENDANGERED%20SPECIES%20ACT%20REGULATE%20COMMERCE%3F%22</a>]<br />
The major federal environmental statutes...State for protection, not FWS.<br />
<br />
Roberts' presence on the Court makes the ESA uniquely vulnerable to strike down – he doesn't think it is a valid exercise of power under the Commerce Clause<br />
Fortenberry and Beck 05 – J.D. Candidates at University of Baltimore School of Law<br />
[Paul Alexander and Daniel Canton, &quot;CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS - CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATIONS OF ARTICLE III AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE: WILL THE 'HAPLESS TOAD' AND 'JOHN Q. PUBLIC' HAVE ANY PROTECTION IN THE ROBERTS COURT?&quot; University of Baltimore Journal of Environmental Law, Fall, 13 U. Balt. J. Envtl. L. 55, LN]<br />
Five years later, the Court again narrowed...Roberts will have a substantial role in its development.<br />
<br />
Morrison will result invalidation of the ESA's take provision which is crucial to the preservation of endangered species<br />
Tanabe 01 – Production Editor of University of Hawaii Law Review<br />
[Jamie Y., &quot;THE COMMERCE CLAUSE PENDULUM: WILL FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW SURVIVE IN THE POST-SWANCC EPOCH OF 'NEW FEDERALISM'?&quot; Environmental Law, Fall, 31 Envtl. L. 1051, LN]<br />
The continued expansion by Congress...environmental law in the coming decade.<br />
<br />
Morrison's categorical distinction between economic and non-economic activities creates a web of confusion in the lower courts and will lead to peculiar interpretations of the ESA that undermine the effectiveness of the overall statutory scheme – Morrison must be overruled to preserve biodiversity<br />
Scopp 05 – Editor-in-Chief of University of San Francisco Law Review<br />
[David W., &quot;Commerce Clause Challenges to the Endangered Species Act: The Rehnquist Court's Web of Confusion Traps More Than the Fly,&quot; University of San Francisco Law Review, Spring, 39 U.S.F. L. Rev. 789, LN]<br />
The ESA highlights Lopez-Morrison's analytic weaknesses...abandon its failed experiment.<br />
<br />
Even if the ESA is never invalidated, uncertainty about its legality under the Commerce Clause ensures a steady stream of litigation that drains resources needed to protect endangered species<br />
Environmental Law Institute accessed 06<br />
[&quot;DECISIONS THAT ENDANGER OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.endangeredlaws.org/recentdecisions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.endangeredlaws.org/recentdecisions.htm</a>]<br />
Citing an unbroken string of precedents...species will remain at risk.<br />
<br />
Biodiversity loss will cause planetary extinction<br />
Diner 94 – Judge Advocate General’s Corps of US Army<br />
[David N., Military Law Review, Winter, 143 Mil. L. Rev. 161, LN] bg<br />
No species has ever dominated...may be edging closer to the abyss.<br />
<br />
ESA has an overwhelming record of success – it's 99% effective at preventing extinctions<br />
Rocky Mountain News 06<br />
[Kenneth Duncan, &quot;Endangered Species Act working,&quot; April 2, LN]<br />
A recent study by the Center for Biological...successful in preventing extinctions).<br />
<br />
Supreme Court clarification of Commerce Clause doctrine is vital to prevent future ESA challenges<br />
Clarke 06 – Student Note Editor for Southeeastern Environmental Law Journal and J.D. Candidate at University of South Carolina School of Law<br />
[Diane Summers, &quot;IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN: THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IMPLEMENTING THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE,&quot; Southeastern Environmental Law Journal, Spring, 14 Southeastern Envtl. L.J. 297, LN]<br />
Whether Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause...consistent basis for future analyses.<br />
<br />
Advantage : The Treaty Power<br />
Limitations on Congress's Commerce Clause power will inevitably spillover into foreign affairs and result in major restrictions on the treaty power<br />
Swaine 03 – Assistant Professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School<br />
[Edward T., &quot;DOES FEDERALISM CONSTRAIN THE TREATY POWER?&quot; Columbia Law Review, April, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 403, LN]<br />
No treaty has ever been struck down...inclined to cabin the treaty power. n47<br />
<br />
Perceived limitations on the treaty power undermine U.S. bargaining power<br />
Swaine 03 – Assistant Professor at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School<br />
[Edward T., &quot;DOES FEDERALISM CONSTRAIN THE TREATY POWER?&quot; Columbia Law Review, April, 103 Colum. L. Rev. 403, LN]<br />
This authority is now challenged...give them legitimacy, is as yet unclear.<br />
<br />
Treaty power is critical to U.S. soft power and overall leadership<br />
Bohorquez 05 – Student in International Institute at UCLA<br />
[Tysha, &quot;Soft Power -The Means to Success in World Politics,&quot; December 1, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.international.ucla.edu/print.asp?parentid=34734" rel="nofollow">http://www.international.ucla.edu/print.asp?parentid=34734</a>]<br />
A country has more soft power...however loose that framework might be.<br />
<br />
Collapse of U.S. hegemony will create a global power vacuum that ensures multiple nuclear wars and economic depression<br />
Ferguson 04 – Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution<br />
[Niall, &quot;A World Without Power,&quot; Foreign Policy, Jul/Aug, Academic Search Elite]<br />
Critics of U.S. global dominance...not-so-new world disorder.<br />
<br />
Advantage ___: Federalism<br />
First, Morrison was a major triumph for establishing federalism and states’ rights<br />
SEATTLE POST, 2K TWO-FOR-ONE SALE: PRESIDENCY AND CIVIL RIGHTS SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER, Sept. 10, Lexis]<br />
<br />
And, this expanded upon the Lopez decision?Morrison clearly affirmed state’s rights over Congress and entrenched federalism<br />
McCall And McCall 2006 [Madhavi, Associate Professor of Political Science, San Diego State University and Michael, Assistant Professor of Sociology, San Diego State University, &quot;Chief Justice William Rehnquist: His Law-and-Order Legacy and Impact on Criminal Justice&quot;, Akron Law Review 2006, 39 Akron L. Rev. 323]<br />
<br />
And, don’t count on the status quo; Roberts?who will have considerable influence in the future?will continue to push states’ rights<br />
Hagel 2005 (Chuck Hagel, US Senator, Nebraska Republican Party Webpage, &quot;Roberts-led court could make history&quot; September 16, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.negop.org/newsdetails.asp?id=60" rel="nofollow">http://www.negop.org/newsdetails.asp?id=60</a>)<br />
<br />
And, overturns are unlikely?VAWA proves on this issue specifically?Roberts empirically pushes for states’ rights<br />
NOW 06 (&quot;Save the Supreme Court ? Save Women’s Lives&quot;, National Organization for Women, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.now.org/issues/judicial/roberts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.now.org/issues/judicial/roberts.html</a>)<br />
<br />
And, federalism must be curtailed?it promotes inter-state debt, crushing the national economy<br />
Wildasin, June/1/04 ? Professor University of Kentucky School of Public Policy<br />
[David, National Tax Journal vol 57 ? &quot;the institutions of federalism&quot; lexis]<br />
And, that causes immediate worldwide nuclear wars, the destruction of the biosphere and civilization<br />
Thomas BEARDEN, Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army and absolute badass, 2000 (June 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
And, US Federalism practices get modeled worldwide<br />
Calabresi 1995 (Steven, Professor of law at Northwestern University School of Law., Prof of Law ? December 1995; MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW, &quot;A government of limited and enumerated powers<br />
Specifically, US federalism will be modeled in Afghanistan?only US leadership will allow it to grow there<br />
Santos Mar 25, 2002 - former UN Afghan mediator [Charles Santos, Insight on the News, &quot;Would federalism, with strong regional powers, bring peace to Afghanistan,&quot; pg. lexis]<br />
And, federalism will doom progress in Afghanistan by plunging the country back into bloody civil wars<br />
Strmecki, 2002, Vice president and director of programs of the Smith Richardson Foundation<br />
[Marin J., &quot;Would federalism, with strong regional powers, bring peace to Afghanistan,&quot; Insight on the News, Mar 25, pg. lexis]<br />
<br />
And, Afghani instability escalates and sparks war in Kashmir<br />
Cohen May 01 - senior fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution [Stephen P. Cohen, The Brookings Institute, &quot;Moving Forward in South Asia,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/comm/policybriefs/pb81.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/comm/policybriefs/pb81.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
And that causes global nuclear winter<br />
Fai 01 ? Executive Director of Kashmiri American Council [Ghulam Nabi, &quot;The most dangerous place,&quot; Washington Times, Jul 8, LN]<br />
<br />
And, federalism will furthermore be modeled in Iraq?Iran interference is not an issue<br />
St. Petersburg Times 2003, (April 25, , pg.- l/n)<br />
<br />
And, federalism will fail and lead to Iraq civil war due to ethnic differences<br />
Eland 2005 (Ivan, International Journal on World Peace, March v22 i1 p39(43), &quot; The way out of Iraq: decentralizing the Iraqi government.&quot;)<br />
<br />
And, breakup of Iraq would spillover into the Middle East, creating a larger regional war<br />
Yaphe 2003 (Judith, December 4, 2003, &quot;Three states is no solution,&quot; The Globe and Mail, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ndu.edu/inss/Repository/Outside_Publications/Yaphe/Yaphe_G&amp;M_Dec03.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ndu.edu/inss/Repository/Outside_Publications/Yaphe/Yaphe_G&amp;M_Dec03.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
And, Middle East war will escalate and trigger global nuclear conflict<br />
Steinbach 02, Member of DC Iraq Coalition John, &quot;Israeli Weapons of Mass Destruction: a Threat to Peace,&quot; Waging Peace, March, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/02.03/0331steinbachisraeli.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/02.03/0331steinbachisraeli.htm</a><br />
<br />
Overturning Morrison is key?The Supreme Court crafted US v. Morrison to advance the Rehnquist Court’s agenda of emphasizing federalism<br />

Overturning Morrison is key?The Supreme Court crafted US v. Morrison to advance the Rehnquist Court’s agenda of emphasizing federalism<br />

<br />
And, Roberts' presence on the Court makes the ESA uniquely vulnerable to strike down ? he doesn't think it is a valid exercise of power under the Commerce Clause<br />

<br />
And, Morrison's categorical distinction between economic and non-economic activities creates a web of confusion in the lower courts and will lead to peculiar interpretations of the ESA that undermine the effectiveness of the overall statutory scheme ? Morrison must be overruled to preserve biodiversity<br />

And, even if the ESA is never invalidated, uncertainty about its legality under the Commerce Clause ensures a steady stream of litigation that drains resources needed to protect endangered species<br />

[Niall, “A World Without Power,” Foreign Policy, Jul/Aug, Academic Search Elite]<br />
<br />
Thus, the PLAN:<br />
<br />
In the next relevant test case, The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), by holding that a rational basis test is the appropriate test when evaluating challenges to Congress's authority to regulate under the Commerce Clause. The test should permit regulation when Congress has a rational basis to conclude that the regulated activity taken in the aggregate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
Returning to rational basis review of Commerce Clause challenges will clarify the Court's jurisprudence and prevent ad hoc invalidation of important statutes<br />
