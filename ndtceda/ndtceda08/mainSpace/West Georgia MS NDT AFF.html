 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">advantage one: technocratic hegemony</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the expert opinion on energy has been dominated by the belief that the public’s belief are adequately represented by market behavior. The public has thus been reduced to a passive role in the politics of energy.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tatum, 95. (Energy Possibilities: Rethinking alternatives and the choice making process)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“one of the most disturbing…which preferences are revealed.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Within the domain of techno-scientific hegemony there is no possibility for “new solutions.” The culturally produced view of the world preordains the solutions to it that deemed possible.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tatum, 95’. (Energy Possibilities: Rethinking alternatives and the choice making process)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Quite apart from trying to discover…in ignorance of the consequences.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We Do not elieve that biomass is the ultimate answer to any of these problems. We defend if knowing full well that it is only a crucial step toward asking the right questions.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tatum, 95..p. 12. Energy Possibilities: Rethinking alternatives and the choice making process. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“merely taking the effort…burden that it may be.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Opposition to that scientific hegemony is silenced by experts in the name of necessity</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Tatum, 95..p. 12. Energy Possibilities: Rethinking alternatives and the choice making process. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“it is often argued...to have made an error.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The expert opinion on energy has been dominated by the belief that the public’s belief are adequatedly represented by market behavior. The public has thus been reduced to a passive role in the politics of energy.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“one of the most disturbing things…that larger process..”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The absurdity of scientific objectivity has been carried to its extreme in today’s society has represented itself as intrinsically public, even when it’s commissioned by corporation or the government</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Haraway, 96. (Donna, “The Disunity of Science: Boundaries, contexts, and power” p. 430-32.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“at the center of this story…will count as the best science.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The result – technoscientific discourse of danger is the ultimate performance of war against the world around us and the people that inhabit it.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Haraway, 96. (Donna, “the disunity of science: boundaries contexts, and power” p. 437-39.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“This powerful tropic system…as it is to the status of knowledge made.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The implications are hardly neutral. The union of science and business threatens to create and Orwellian nightmare where racism and fascism triumph on a global scale. The world being created will have no room for debaters as anything other than machines. We would be obstacles to the smooth functioning of a system radically outside of our control capable of the worst atrocities imaginable.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Karnoouh, 2002. (Claude, “Technology and Destiny” Telos, No. 124, Summer, p. 71-84)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Furthermore: it is likely that all world governments…epoch for talking about being.”</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">their interpretation collapses unto itself – language is not a neutral conduit for thought, meaning no perfectly stable interpretation is even possible</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Schlag, 90. (Pierre, prefessor of law @ univ of Colorado. Stanford Law review, November Lexis.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“one answer is precisely…participants in construction communication.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Pretending to be policymakers in debate prepares us for a type of seeing the world that has left millions of dead bodies scattered here and there around the globe</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond;">Nuclear apocalypse can no longer be a reality. The bomb has already gone off. Reflections on nuclear catastrophe feed a consumptive mode of being in which the apocalypse is productibility.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Garamond;">In the age of <em>posthistorie,</em> the end of the world….the grammar of the end of the world.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Garamond;">Security colonizes all politics and becomes the sole criteria for legitimation of state action --- this leads to a cycle where security and terror only serve to legitimate each other</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Garamond;">Bell, 2005 [ Biopolitical Stategies of Security: Considerations on Canda’s New National Security Policy]</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Garamond;">As an instrument of governance, security….citizens, democrats, or even humans.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Garamond;">The Rhetoric of Nuclear apocalypse is a mechanism to maintain state domination, it ensures perpetual control of the population in the name of saving it from extinction</span><br />
