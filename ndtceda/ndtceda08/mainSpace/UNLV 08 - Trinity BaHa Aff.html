Plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate its domestic subsidies for corn based ethanol. The United States Federal Government should no longer require compliance with mandates that can be met with conventional biofuels.<br />
<br />
Contention One: The Sacred and the Holy<br />
<br />
Human communities are defined by the narratives they use to distinguish between self and other.  Sacred orders define themselves by a fixed transcendent idea of the human and seek to eradicate the profane other.  Alternatively, holy communities seek self-transcendence through the affirmation of the dignity of others through justice and compassion.<br />
Fasching and DeChant 2001 (Darrell and Dell, prof and director undergrad studies in dept. religious studies @ south fla.  Comparative religious ethics. P. 10)<br />
Human religiousness is AND and my stories.<br />
<br />
Holy Communities are produced through an alienated theology, which rejects the pretension towards certainty in our own narratives, leaving us open to the transformative impact of the experiences of others.  The apologetic theology of sacred orders is a methodology of domination.  Its foreclosure of the possibility of truth in difference condemns us to an apocalyptic stalemate moving ever closer to human self-destruction<br />

<br />
Contention Two: Starving the Holy Community<br />
<br />
Continued corn ethanol production will push food out of reach for the world’s poor, resulting in starvation. You will not see or hear these people dying, they will simply fade away. In exchange for their lives we get to fuel our SUVs. <br />
Runge 2007 (C. Ford Runge, McKinght University Professor of Minnesota's Department of Applied Economics “The Prospects for Biofuel Development Rush Transcript; Federal News Service,” Council on Foreign Relations, 6-12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/13602/prospects_for_biofuel_development_rush_transcript_federal_news_service.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/13602/prospects_for_biofuel_development_rush_transcript_federal_news_service.html</a>)<br />
But the primary focus of the AND implications of U.S. policy.<br />
<br />
The ultimate failure of US biofuels policy is seen in the government’s justification of subsidies. When faced with the fact that our policies starve the world, we fall back to rhetoric of national security. This sacred logic ignores the fact that subsidy reductions would drastically reduce food prices.<br />
AP 2008 (Associated Press, “Stop biofuels to fight word hunger, food scientists say,” 4-30, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/04/30/tech-corn-prices.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2008/04/30/tech-corn-prices.html</a>)<br />

Affirming human dignity is a precondition to establishing a holy community.<br />
Fasching 1993 (Darrell J., Professor of Religious Studies at University of South Florida, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, Pp. 202-203)<br />
The tale of our time is a AND  emergence of a global civilization.<br />
<br />
Holy communities are defined by openness to others.  This requires us to actively listen.  Compassion is an experience of immersing yourself into the stories of others and responding to their needs.  Contemplation of feelings fosters attentiveness to the causes of exclusionary violence and establishes a foundation of trust and reconciliation that provides a political alternative to a Sacred politics founded on hostility towards strangers.<br />

<br />
Finally, to refuse political compassion is to place your own ethnic and national stories in the place of God and to regard all others as excess to be eliminated.  Holy communities are founded on self-transcendence which is only possible when we allow our relationship with others to transform ourselves.  This is an affirmation of particularity and difference which refuses Sacred Orders in the name of the possibility of a positive reading of interdependence.<br />
