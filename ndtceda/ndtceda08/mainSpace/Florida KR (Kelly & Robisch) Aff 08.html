<strong>Bush will strike Iran by 2009 at the latest-he feels this is the only way to ensure American security and Bush feels it will cement his legacy.</strong><br />

&quot;So this is the calculus facing <u>Bush</u>...<u>.his courageous and visionary leadership.&quot;</u><br />
<br />
<strong>The Pentagon has already drawn up plans to attack Iran and US carrier fleets have already been given targets-even if the US doesn’t strike,<br />
Israel will.</strong><br />
Marlborough Express September 4th 2007 [“Bush has Iran in his sights” Tuesday, 4 September 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4189962a6520.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stuff.co.nz/4189962a6520.html</a>]<br />
&quot;Overseas newspapers and websites are abuzz..... <strong><u>matter of when - and by who.</u></strong> &quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>First is Retaliation</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>US strikes leads to an Iranian assault against the Strait of Hormuz-these attacks would comprehensive enough to shut down the entire strait</strong><br />
Timmerman 2006 [Nobel Peace Prize Nominee for his writing on Iran, 2006 (Kenneth, “Iran Readies Plan to Close Strait of Hormuz” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/2/28/181730.shtml%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/2/28/181730.shtml)</a>]<br />
&quot;Iran's Revolutionary Guards are making....information contained in the NDAJA plan.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Even if Iran couldn’t completely shut down the Strait of Hormuz, it still will do enough damage to severely disrupt oil markets</strong><br />

&quot;In any case, Iran could....Hezbollah and Syria to threaten Israel.&quot;<br />

<strong>This guarantees oil shocks and a global recession</strong><br />

&quot;As an obvious consequence of the instability...would be reeling from recession.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>And even if Iranian attempts to shut down the strait fail completely, strikes on Iran will trigger a Chinese sell-off of the dollar that will<br />
collapse the US economy</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Second is US-EU Relations</strong><br />
<strong>The threat of force by Washington is the only thing that will collapse US-EU relations-</strong><strong>the EU will put up with other hardline measures, it’s<br />
the threat of force that collapses relations.</strong><br />

<u>&quot;Even the Europeans, however, are skittish</u> ... separated the two countries since 1979.&quot;<br />

&quot;Over time, Kissinger warned, the....armaments race and ... a huge conflict.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Proliferation:</strong><br />
<strong>Strikes will fail because we have weak intelligence, the sites are too dispersed and bunker busters can’t reach the underground sites- but<br />
these attacks lead to redoubling of Iran’s nuclear project ensuring that they will get the bomb</strong><br />

<u>&quot;When sanctions fail</u>, some are already... are already signs of escalating Iranian mischief.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And if Iran is allowed to control a nuclear weapon then this will dramatically increase proliferation throughout the Middle East and world-Iran<br />
is the litmus test for proliferation</strong><br />

&quot;Meanwhile, <u>Iran</u> <u>is testing the line in</u> .... destruction that can threaten our existence.&quot; &quot;<br />

<strong>Additionally, Iranian proliferation would lead to proliferation throughout the Middle East, creating an inevitable nuclear war and destroying<br />

&quot;Indeed, <u>the emergence of a nuclear-armed</u> <u>......quickly can have extremely dangerous consequences</u>.&quot;<br />
<br />
<strong>Hence the Plan:</strong><br />
The United States Federal Government should normalize diplomatic relations with the government of Iran and offer them a security guarantee that the United<br />
States Federal Government will not preemptively attack Iran or support any other entity attempting to do the same.<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Solvency</u></strong><br />
<strong>Only a security guarantee would lead to Iranian denuclearization-Iran doesn’t openly acknowledge it wants a guarantee so it doesn’t look<br />
soft, but a security guarantee is exactly what Iran wants in exchange for denuclearization</strong><br />
