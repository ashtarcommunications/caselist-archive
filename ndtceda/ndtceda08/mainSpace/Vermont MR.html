BROKE NEW AFF ROUND 2 AT NOVICE NATIONALS<br />
<br />
CAFOS- Absent Referent. The &quot;plan&quot; is the removal of nearly all subsidies<br />
<br />
They challenge debate by interrogating subjectivity and problematising what it means to be human<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Aff: Dairy<br />
<br />
Contention One – No Change for Dairy –<br />
<br />
For dairy, the 2008 Farm Bill did not change anything – no milk support programs were eliminated, the milk industry continues to cling to anachronistic subsidies, undercutting the industry. Jesse, Cropp and Gould ‘8 [Ed (professor and Extension dairy marketing specialist, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison/Extension), Bob (emeritus professor), and Brian W. (associate professor in the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, University of Wisconsin- Madison); “Dairy Subtitle: Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008”; Marketing and Policy Briefing Paper No. 94; Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison Cooperative Extension, University of Wisconsin-Extension; June <em>nick]<br />
For dairy, the 2008 …unable to compete globally.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – the Domestic Dairy Industry –<br />
<br />
- - Dairy subsidies collapse the industry – we have three internal links –<br />
<br />
(a) Overproduction –<br />
<br />
U.S. dairy subsidies generally harm the industry by artificially raising domestic milk prices, encouraging overproduction – that stifles industry growth.<br />
Jones ‘6 [Sallie (Policy Analyst with CATO’s Center for Trade Policy Studies); “Milking the Customers: The High Cost of U.S. Dairy Policies”; Trade Briefing Paper No. 24; November 9; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6764" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6764</a></em> nick]<br />
The U.S. dairy program… minimal &quot;disruption&quot; to dairy farmers.<br />
<br />
(b) Price Volatility –<br />
<br />
Federal dairy price supports create price “floors” which increase price volatility which risks massive downside price swings.<br />
Blayney and Normile ‘4 [Don and Mary; “Economic Effects of the U.S. Dairy Policies and Alternative Approaches to Milk Pricing”; USDA’s Economic Research Service - Report to Congress; July <em>nick]<br />
Price variation arises from … meals away from home (Jackson-Smith and Barham, 2000).<br />
<br />
And – specifically – the Federal Milk Marketing Order system drives uncertainty in the dairy market, discouraging investment and innovation.<br />
International Dairy Foods Association ‘7 [“Ensuring a Healthy U.S. Dairy Industry: Blueprint for the 2007 Farm Bill”; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.healthdairyindustry.org" rel="nofollow">www.healthdairyindustry.org</a></em> nick]<br />
The rules under the classified … the system creates.<br />
<br />
And - price volatility destroys the dairy industries ability to predict the cost of business.<br />
Blayney and Normile ‘4 [Don and Mary; “Economic Effects of the U.S. Dairy Policies and Alternative Approaches to Milk Pricing”; USDA’s Economic Research Service - Report to Congress; July <em>nick]<br />
Price variability is a concern for a number of reasons. Increased volatility adds challenges for farm business planning, debt repayment…producer’s bottom line.<br />
<br />
(c) Market Innovation -<br />
<br />
Domestic price supports discourage dairy producers from innovating to the niche products that are set to dominate the market.<br />
Jones ‘6 [Sallie (Policy Analyst with CATO’s Center for Trade Policy Studies); “Milking the Customers: The High Cost of U.S. Dairy Policies”; Trade Briefing Paper No. 24; November 9; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6764" rel="nofollow">http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6764</a></em> nick]<br />
If the nature of government … than milk production capacity.”9<br />
<br />
And – innovation is key to the survival of the industry.<br />

The U.S. dairy industry …opportunities in the marketplace.<br />
<br />
-- The dairy industry is key --<br />
<br />
Dairy industry is vital to the U.S. economy – it’s a critical industry for retail sales, jobs and economic growth.<br />

The 2007 Farm Bill offers an …generating widespread public support.<br />
<br />
Additionally, high dairy prices drive inflation.<br />

Rising prices for meat, dairy …consumer price index.<br />
<br />
This agricultural inflation causes higher interest rates and slows the economy.<br />
Beck ‘7 [Marc A.H. (Senior Vice President of Marketing for the U.S. Dairy Export Council); “The Implications of ‘Agflation’”; August 10; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cheesemarketnews.com/guestcolumn/2007/10aug07.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheesemarketnews.com/guestcolumn/2007/10aug07.html</a></em> nick]<br />
In other words, in developing …a raft of new dynamics to consider.<br />
<br />
And – the response to inflation is credit liquidation cycles – the result is global war.<br />
Bailey ‘90 [Senior Director of International Economic Affairs, THE WORLD AND I, p. 33 <em>nick]<br />
Central bankers have … might well be destroyed in the process.<br />
<br />
And ultimately economic collapse causes extinction.<br />
Bearden ’00 [Thomas (Retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel and director of the Association of Distinguished American Scientists, CEO of CTEC Inc., Fellow Emeritus at the Alpha Foundation's Institute for Advanced Study); “The Unnecessary Energy Crisis: How to Solve It Quickly”; June 24; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.seaspower.com/EnergyCrisis-Bearden.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.seaspower.com/EnergyCrisis-Bearden.htm</a></em> nick]<br />
History bears out that … least for many decades.<br />
<br />
Contention Three – the Chinese Milk Market –<br />
Current dynamics in world dairy markets have brought the U.S. dairy sector to a crossroads – growth of dairy consumption in emerging markets such as China represent new opportunities. However, government intervention into the dairy sector distorts market signals and discourages producers, stalling global dairy competitiveness and foreclosing access to new markets – sector liberalization now is critical.<br />
Blayney et al. ‘6 [David (Agricultural Economist); “U.S. Dairy at a Global Crossroads”; Economic Research Report Number 28: A Report from the Economic Research Service <em>nick] Most dairy sectors worldwide… trade liberalization.<br />
<br />
And – unmet Chinese milk demand causes Chinese food price inflation.<br />
Walker ‘7 [Martin (UPI Editor Emeritus); “Chinese Prosperity Will Set Off Global Food Inflation”; August 8; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Chinese_Prosperity_Will_Set_Off_Global_Food_Inflation_999.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Chinese_Prosperity_Will_Set_Off_Global_Food_Inflation_999.html</a></em> nick]<br />
China has … much relief in sight.<br />
<br />
And – now is key – the recent tainted milk scandal in China will spike milk prices.<br />
Patton 9-19-08 [Dominique (Staff Writer); “China: Dairy Sector Faces Higher Costs in Wake of Scandal”; September 19; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.just-food.com/article.aspx?id=103818" rel="nofollow">http://www.just-food.com/article.aspx?id=103818</a> <em>nick]<br />

<br />
And – increased Chinese prices and associated economic and political disruptions crushes Chinese economic growth and leads to conflict.<br />

<br />
Plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should eliminate Federal Milk Marketing Orders, the Milk Income Loss Contract, the Dairy Export Incentive Program, the Milk Price Support Program and any United States dairy tariffs.<br />
<br />
Contention Three – Solvency –<br />
Eliminating U.S. dairy support de-balkanizes the U.S. milk market, reducing domestic milk prices, creating price stability, making U.S. milk competitive abroad and securing the domestic economy.<br />
Balagtas ‘7 [Joseph V. (Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University); “U.S. Dairy Policy: Analysis and Options”; June 15; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aei.org/docLib/20070515_balagtasfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aei.org/docLib/20070515_balagtasfinal.pdf</a></em> nick]<br />

High milk prices drive low income consumers out of federal food programs and force significant nutritional trade-offs for low-income consumers – federal food programs are forced to use dairy replacements other than milk.<br />
