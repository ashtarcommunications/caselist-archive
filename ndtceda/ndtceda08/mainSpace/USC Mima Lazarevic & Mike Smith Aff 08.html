<br />
The harsh blockade of Gaza didn't start in mid June when Hamas took… Clearly, Abbas and his aides have much to explain to the Palestinian people. They also have much to atone for. This is if they still possess any sense of shame<br />

<br />
The Fatah attacks against Hamas in Gaza were initiated at the whim of, and with arms and training provided by, the United States and Israel… most Palestinians have not fallen for these blandishments, which offer nothing in return for their abject surrender to Israel.<br />
<br />
AND - AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY LOVES TO LABEL PALESTINIANS AS TERRORISTS. THE IDEA THAT HAMAS ARE TERRORISTS AUTHORIZES ISRAEL TO ADVANCE A COLONIAL PROJECT OF CRUELTY. THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE SEEN AS BIOLOGICALLY PRONE TO VIOLENCE. SUCH SWEEPING ACCUSATIONS DO SERIOUS VIOLENCE TO UNDERSTANDING THE ROOTS OF PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE AS RESISTANCE AGAINST OCCUPATION.<br />

Hamas has overwhelmed Fatah in the Gaza Strip and sent the fragile coalition government in Palestine into a… Middle East and elsewhere as the primary means to peace and security.<br />

4. Counter-Interpretation— Constructive Engagement is the maintenance of ties – not sanctions<br />
Minn Naing Oo, LLM Candidate at Columbia, December, 2000, Constructive Engagement, Legal Issues on Burma Journal, No. 7<br />
<br />
In essence, Constructive Engagement is a policy… government and push it along the path to political and social reform.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND – “OFFER” IMPLIES CONDITIONALITY – DICTIONARY.COM – “to give, make, or promise”<br />
<br />
5. Prefer our interpretation<br />
A – CONTEXTUAL – IT DEFINES CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT AS A TERM OF ART BOTH THROUGH A POLITICAL DICTIONARY CONTEXT AND A HISTORICAL CONTEXT<br />
<br />
B – predictable limits – unconditional incentives affs ARE EASIER TO DEBATE BECAUSE THEY DONTT REQUIRE predictING infinte aff concessions<br />
<br />
C –ground – we prevent bidirectionality by requiring aff 7. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THE UNCONDITIONAL CP – THERE IS OTHER GENERIC CP GROUND THAT YOU CAN USE, LIKE ALTERNATE AGENT CPS, OR ENGAGING/SANCTIONING ISRAEL WHICH IS MORE RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC LITERATURE THAN GENERIC CONDITIONS BADimplementation and ensuring that affs engage rather than pressure.<br />
<br />
6. THERE IS NO EXACT DEFINITION OF WHAT A “CONDITION” IS – PROVES THEIR INTERPRETATION ALLOWS FOR ARBITRARY AFFIRMATIVES<br />
Frerks – Netherlands Inst. Of IR – October, 2006<br />

<br />
<br />
8. NO GROUND LOSS– EVERYTHING THAT’S BEING WRITTEN ABOUT PALESTINE IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS IS ABOUT THE SPLIT BETWEEN HAMAS AND FATAH. THE PLAN REVERSES THE DESIGNATION THAT HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. YOU STILL HAVE DEMO PROMO BAD ARGS, PEACE PROCESS BAD ARGUMENTS, 2 STATE SOLUTIONS BAD ARGUMENTS, A SANCTION ISRAEL CP, SELF DETERMINATION BAD, THE ISRAEL DA AND EVERY US INFLUENCE BAD DA ON THE PLANET BECAUSE IT SCARES RUSSIA, CHINA AND IRAN<br />
<br />
<br />
9. COMPETITING INTERPRETATIONS BAD: IT ARBITRARILY LIMITS OUT AFFIRMATIVES – PREFER REASONABILITY BECAUSE IT PRESERVES A FAIR DIVISION OF GROUND WITHOUT MAKING T ABOUT OFFENSE/DEFENSE SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GENERATE OFFENSE ON T FOR THE AFF. POTENTIAL ABUSE IS ARBITRARY AND FORCES JUDGE INTERVENTION.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a wide-ranging literature on the issue of aid conditionality… definition as well as a conceptual-descriptive framework to deal with the topic.<br />

<br />
Writing again about Gaza only……… havoc and death whenever it pleases.<br />
<br />
FURTHERMORE – US ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON HAMAS WILL FRACTURE THE PALESTINIAN BODY POLITIC FOR YEARS. THE US IS CREATING A SELF PERPETUATING CYCLE OF PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE<br />
CROOKE, helped facilitate a number of ceasefires btwn Israele-Palestine, 2K7<br />
(Alastair, a member of the Mitchell Commission, LRB | Vol. 29 No. 13 dated 5 July)<br />
<br />
At the same time, the West imposed financial sanctions…… consequences that no one could have foreseen.<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION TWO: THE DEMONIZATION OF RESISTANCE<br />
<br />
THE US IS ENCOURAGING SUFFERING IN ORDER TO CONVINCE THE PALESTINIANS THAT HAMAS IS AT FAULT. AS IN IRAQ, WE ARE LITERALLY KILLING OFF A POPULATION TO INSPIRE A REGIME CHANGE. THIS DENIAL OF ENGAGEMENT IS A DEFERRAL OF US RESPONSIBILITY<br />

<br />
The Fatah attacks against Hamas in Gaza were initiated at the whim of, and with arms and training provided by, the….. abject surrender to Israel.<br />
<br />
AND - AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY LOVES TO LABEL PALESTINIANS AS TERRORISTS. THE IDEA THAT HAMAS ARE TERRORISTS AUTHORIZES ISRAEL TO ADVANCE A COLONIAL PROJECT OF CRUELTY. THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE ARE SEEN AS BIOLOGICALLY PRONE TO VIOLENCE. SUCH SWEEPING ACCUSATIONS DO SERIOUS VIOLENCE TO UNDERSTANDING THE ROOTS OF PALESTINIAN VIOLENCE AS RESISTANCE AGAINST OCCUPATION.<br />
GREGORY 2004 (DEREK – PROFESSOR OF GEOGRAPHY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA IN VANCOUVER – COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF SOUTH ASIA, AFRICA, AND THE MIDDLE EAST 24.1 – “PALESTINE AND THE WAR ON TERROR” – PG 183-195)<br />
<br />
Identities and oppositions<br />
It is hard to imagine how…. everywhere except in their own looking-glasses.<br />
<br />
BUSH’S STRATEGY TO TURN HAMAS INTO AL-QAEDA IS DESIGNED TO CONVINCE THE WORLD THAT ISLAMIC RESISTANCE SHOULD BE ELIMINATED, BECOMING A CRITICAL LINK IN THE IMPERIALIST AMBITIONS OF THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR. AT THE SAME TIME, THE BOOGEYMAN OF PALESTINIAN TERRORISM HAS BECOME A PRETEXT FOR THE US’S UNCRITICAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAELI APARTHEID<br />
BENNIS AUGUST 10 (PHYLLIS – IPS FELLOW AND FELLOW OF THE TRANSNATIONAL INSTITUTE IN AMSTERDAM. WRITER, ANALYST AND ACTIVIST ON MIDDLE EAST AND UN ISSUES – “BUSH LAUNCHES A NEW MIDDLE EAST INITIATIVE.

<br />
However inevitable the failure….. and a host of U.S. and European monitors).<br />
<br />
THE ABILITY FOR THE UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL TO DESIGNATE THEIR ENEMIES AS “TERRORISTS” CULMINATES IN A PROCESS OF DEHUMANIZATION THAT MAKES THE LIVES OF PALESTINIANS DEVOID OF VALUE AND WORTHY OF PHYSICAL EXTERMINATION<br />
PETRAS 2006 (JAMES – BARLTE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT BINGHAMTON UNIVERSITY – THE POWER OF ISRAEL IN THE UNITED STATES – 148-49)<br />
<br />
After reading hundreds of books and articles and listening…….. of the purported &quot;civilizers&quot;. (148-49)<br />
<br />
ADDITIONALLY – THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION’S FLAGRANT USE OF TERRORISM IS ETHICALLY UNACCEPTABLE.<br />
FALK 2K2 (Richard, The Nation, 4/29)<br />
There is little doubt that part… condemned, it deforms our understanding.<br />
<br />

<br />
FINALLY, AS SCHOLARS AND INTELLECTUALS, WE SHOULD HAVE AN INTELLCTUAL AND MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DISMANTLE THE REDUCTIVE FORUMALES WHICH LEAD US AWAY FROM HUMAN EXPERIENCE<br />
Said, literary theorist and activist, 2003 [Edward, Intro to 25th Anniversary Edition, Orientalism, Vintage Books, Pg. xxiii-xxiv]<br />
<br />
For those of us who by force of circumstance actually live the pluri-cultural life as it entails Islam and the West, I have… elsewhere for so long.<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should lift all sanctions for the entire Palestinian authority recognizing that the January 2006 Palestinian legislative council elections established Hamas as the elected ruling party in the Palestinian territories.<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION THREE: ENDING THE WAR ON GAZA<br />
<br />
RECOGNIZING THE LEGALLY CONSTITUTED GOVERNMENT OF PALESTINE DEMONSTRATES THAT INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY CARES ABOUT THE SUICIDAL SPLIT OF THE PALESTINIANS<br />

<br />
Is this abysmal Palestinian situation a harbinger of things… mired in continual U.S.-instigated warfare.<br />
<br />
GAZA WON’T GET ANY BETTER UNTIL THE US ENDS THE WAR AGAINST HAMAS<br />
LENDMAN 2007 (Stephen, BA Harvard, MBA Wharton, CounterPunch, A Deepening Humanitarian Crisis, 7/9)<br />
<br />
Ever since, they've paid dearly for their choice…. Palestinians still strongly support.<br />
<br />
ISOLATING HAMAS DILUTES THE NATIONAL LIBERATION FRAMEWORK. ONLY A UNITY GOVERNMENT CAN RESIST ISRAEL’S FAKE PEACE<br />
KARKAR, president of Women for Palestine, 2K7<br />
(Sonya, CounterPunch, Squirming Under Israel's Security Matrix, 7/2,<br />

<br />
The divisions that have….. tightened Israel's control.<br />
<br />
PALESTINIANS WANT US INTERNATIONALIZATION OF PEACE – WASHINGTON HAS A MONOPOLY ON ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN STEWARDSHIP<br />
Toensing, editor of Middle East Report, 2K7 (Chris, Bitter Lemons International, 4/19)<br />
<br />
The Palestinians have long sought…… obvious to all concerned, the clout in the Quartet resides in Washington.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
REVERSAL OF TERRORIST DESIGNATION CHANGES THE IDEOLOGICAL COORDINATES. OUR AFF IS AN EXAMPLE OF A TRUE POLITICAL ACT – BY REVERSING THE IDEA THAT HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION WE BEGIN TO TALK WITH REAL PARTNERS – IT CHANGES OF THE IDEOLOGICAL COORDINATES RENDERING THE UNTHINKABLE THINKABLE<br />
ZIZEK 2K3 (Slavoj, The Iraqi MacGuffin, 11/04, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/iraq1.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/iraq1.htm)</a><br />
And as the story……. renders the unthinkable thinkable.<br />

<strong>Round 3 – Aff vs Weber</strong><br />
<strong>2AC:</strong><br />
ENGAGMENT WITH ISLAM CAN TURN INTO A CITE OF RESISTING CAPITAL. We NEED TO UNDERSTAND ISLAM AS RESISTANCE NOT NECESSARILY ISLAMO FASCISM<br />

The paradox is thus….. modernizers<br />

In the same way that the distinction…..secondary fundamentalist misuse<br />

OUR AFIRMATIVE IS AN EXAMPLE OF POLITICAL TOGETHERNESS THIS GROUP IDENITY IS A WAY TO CONTEST LINES OF DIFFERENCE AND SAMENESS<br />

Political collectivities…..communicative<br />

CLAIM OF SUFFERING EXPANDING THE PARTICIPATION OF THE MEANING<br />
Susan Bickford, Hypatia, Fall 1997 v12 n4 p111<br />
This is relevant….coalition politics<br />
<br />
<br />
THE IS INTRINSIC VALUE TO COMPASSION AND ETHICS AND THE ATTACHMENT TO THOSE THAT ARE SUFFERING – IT IS IN THE MOMENT OF COMPASSION THAT WE ARE MOST HUMAN THAT THE ALT VIEW OF LIF IS AN OVERLY PESSIMISTIC NIGHTMARISH VIEW REALITY<br />
