That the United States Federal Government should offer to normalize relations with the government of Iran.<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
Contention One: The Affect of Fear<br />
<br />
First, December 3rd, 2007: “If there was ever a possibility that President George W. Bush would drop bombs on Iran, the chances have now shrunk to nearly zero.”1<br />
<br />
Now, March 3rd, 2008: “Suddenly, the confrontation with Iran had reignited.”2<br />
<br />
In less than three months, media sentiment on Iran had swung from war on, to war off, to war on again. Between December’s U.S. National Intelligence Estimate and March’s IAEA report, the facts may have changed but the climate of information had not. Information has evacuated its relationship to fact and persuasion in favor of an affective function, shaping the sentimental structures that discipline our bodies, causing them to react to information before it even reaches the level of thought.<br />
<br />
This is why George W. Bush could last week proclaim about Iran that “[t]hey’ve declared they want to have a nuclear weapon to destroy people,” even though a leading expert claims that “That’s as uninformed as McCain's statement that Iran is training al-Qaeda.”3 In a society permeated by the affect of fear, complex webs of meaning are inexorably reduced to a single, emotional signified: THREAT. It is this paranoia that sows the seeds for a new wave of fascism.<br />
<br />
Massumi, professor of Communication at Université de Montréal, 2k5 [Brian, “Fear (The Spectrum Said),” Positions, 13.1, muse]<br />
<br />
This taming of television's affective role accomplished a number of ….<br />
<br />
ground on which it itself operates.<br />
<br />
The affective economy produced by our refusal to see Iran as anything but our own stereotyped projection has overdetermined the American idea of Iran for fifty years—the symbolic gap created by this lack of communication produced an unbearable anxiety surrounding our relationship to Iran, and the installation of the Shah in 1953 was our attempt to bind this anxiety through violent control.<br />
<br />
When this violent repression returned as open rebellion in 1979, all the pent up fears were unleashed at once and the media happily produced the spectacle of fundamentalist barbarism that we so very much desired. Today’s policy of regime change is both a violent repetition and a massive intensification of this suppression of otherness. By refusing engagement with any Iran except for one that acts in our own image, the affect of fear continues to govern our relationship to Iran in the imagae of an evil spectacle, in need of our righteous purification.<br />

For Said, this post-Cold War neo-Orientalism …to effect the passage to empirical fact. (Massumi, 2005a: 10)<br />
<br />
Pre-emption is not just a doctrine, but the manifestation of a general orientation toward the world which grounds subjectivity in violent ideological configurations through the affective anchor of fear. The resulting constriction of lines of identification produces a downward spiral of paranoid violence which ultimately exceeds the control of any institution<br />
<br />
Massumi, Professor of Communication the Université de Montréal, 2k7 (Brian, “Potential Politics and the Primacy of Preemption”, 10:2, p. Project Muse]<br />
<br />
Preemption stands for conflict unlimited:…...National security objectives will not be crystal clear, formulated in timely fashion, or fully underwritten by national will.13<br />
<br />
Contention Two: The Uncertainty of Otherness<br />
<br />
In a climate of regime change, the question of Iran has always-already been answered, and that answer is WAR. In the current political field, establishing a basic symbolic relationship with others is a prior question to any possible policy. Before we can ask the question how should we engage Iran? we must determine whether or not the image we are engaging is anything more than a projection condensing all that we hate and fear under the signifier Iran: Iran the Evil, Iran the Despot and the Nazi, Iran the Terrorist, the Muslim, the racial and sexual other, Iran the Monster.<br />
<br />
Against this affective climate of fear, we must reassert the symbolic link of communication and become resolved: that the United States Federal Government should offer to normalize relations with the government of Iran. This is not a call for diplomatic politics as usual or grand bargains, this is not the normal of normalization. Rather, it is to reassert this monstrous other in the place of the normal and thus call into question the one-sided nature of the normal itself.<br />
<br />
Only thorugh an affirmation of symbolic connection against the affect of fear can we step out of the radical violence of the status quo and introduce a poltics of hope that deploys the possibility of dialogue against the suicidal enclosure of the world in a mirror-image of the self<br />
<br />
Morris, Associate Professor of Anthropology, 2k4 [Rosalind C., “Images of Untranslatability in the US War On Terror,” interventions 6.3, 401-423, Taylor &amp; Francis, 419-423]<br />
<br />
What haunts television viewers …will then find itself overwhelmed in the auto-da-fe´ of terrorism. To fail now will be to commit to suicide.<br />
<br />
Our affirmation of the conditions of dialogue marks a rupture in the affective economy of fear and it is in this space where we can begin to propagate an affect of HOPE. This is a necessary gesture towards escaping our current escalating cycle of violence against the unknown.<br />
<br />
Instead of the scripting of otherness into the images we desire and the anihilation of all those which refuse to fit, our affirmation embraces the uncertainty of our encounters with others, others who can say yes or say no, others who can diverge from our ideals and yet remain within the realm of the symbolic. Only by chaning our relation to the aesthetic-information regimes that mediate the horizon of our knowledge can we shift our political terrain from a climate of fear to a climate of dialogue sustained by the affect of hope<br />
<br />
Anderson, Department of Geography at University of Durham, 2k6 [Ben, “Becoming and being hopeful: towards a theory of affect,” Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 24: 733-752]<br />
<br />
It is the specific conceptualization that affect exceeds its …a future elsewhen or elsewhere in favour of an immanent transcendence from within vectors of diminishment.<br />
