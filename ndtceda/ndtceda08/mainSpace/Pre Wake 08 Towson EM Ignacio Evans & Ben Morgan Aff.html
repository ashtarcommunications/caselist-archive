Towson EM Aff –<br />
Advocacy: for the debate community to confront Black rage.<br />
Black rage consists of the following:<br />
It is based on righteous indignation, or anger at injustice and suffering<br />
It is composed of specific components<br />
1.    Deliberate challenge to white supremacy en-route to producing anti<br />
– white supremacist scholarship<br />
2.    A clear, direct and deliberate statement of commitment to<br />
transforming the conditions of black people<br />
3.    3. The use of some counter hegemonic aesthetic (which includes<br />
music, poetry, visuals, etc.<br />
4.    Advancing the subjecthood of people of color<br />
<br />
<br />
As people of color become complacent and accept racism oppressive<br />
power structures become harder to fight.  We must no longer be silent<br />
and express our suffering through rage.<br />

<br />
&quot;Racism is alive and well… she uses writing as a form of empowerment<br />
and as a weapon to end the silence.&quot;<br />
<br />
The improvisational the black vernacular repurposes the language of<br />
the oppressor to move toward a greater sense of community and<br />
resistance<br />
<br />
George Yancy 2004 (Penn State University, The Journal of Speculative<br />
Philosophy 18.4, 273-299)<br />
<br />
&quot;From what has been delineated above… nuances and tone African American.&quot;<br />
<br />
The debate community participates in a crime of omission and<br />
commission in regard to the dire conditions of black people.  Embedded<br />
in the political theory that is dominant in political discourse is the<br />
perpetuation of the global system of white supremacy.<br />
<br />
Charles Mills, The Racial Contract, 1997, p. 1<br />
<br />
&quot;White supremacy is the unnamed political system… see as political,<br />
are highlighted.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Black rage allows us not to be victims of the system but proactive in<br />
breaking it down.<br />
<br />
M.D.C. Bowen 1996<br />
(&quot;What is black rage?&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mdcbowen.org/cz/parables/rage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdcbowen.org/cz/parables/rage.htm</a>)<br />

&quot;certainly ms. chideya is not the first, nor will she be the last… if<br />
you harbor racist ideas wittingly or not, it *is* your fault and your<br />
responsibility… bear scrutiny on the issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Black rage is a political tool that we as blacks can use<br />
<br />
M.D.C. Bowen, same cite<br />
<br />
&quot;there is a vested interest in american politics… sista souljah, for example.&quot;<br />

&quot;Renewed, organized black liberation struggle can not happen if we<br />
remain… redemptive struggle possible.&quot;<br />

&quot;Slavery is the great leveler of the black subject's positionality…<br />
nonetheless, be pursued to the death.&quot;<br />
<br />
We must engage the negritude movement to become black through our multiplicity<br />

The white gaze teaches black people to hate themselves<br />
Yancy 2005 (Journal of Speculative Philosophy 19.4, 215-241)<br />
<br />
&quot;In the face of my white teacher's racism… above all else, above all:<br />
&quot;sho' good eaten'.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
AT: Framework<br />
1. We meet - we have a connection to the topic, slavery was the<br />
original ag subsidy<br />
2. We're in a post - resolutional era, the time of plan focused debate<br />
is over, Neg is trying to turn back the clock. They read a Kerpen card<br />
about Inherency<br />
3. Counter Interp - Debate must change each time to be transformative<br />
and have depth<br />
4. Can't sever ideology from practice, neg marginalizes critical<br />
debate, turns education<br />
5. Fariness, objectivity, etc all white supremacy<br />
6. Predictability - we are cause we are on the case list, Towson has<br />
been saying this for a long time and this is just an excuse to<br />
sidestep this issue, they read a Friere card<br />
7. We are a form of political protest so we have an effect on the<br />
political system<br />
8. Don;t tell us how to debate, thats the white gaze
