 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Psyhoanalysis K:</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The affirmatives direction towards food supplies and hunger addresses a root question of subjectivity - criticizing the failure of farm policy to achieve universal abundance is not only structurally impossible but makes the idea of ending hunger into an object which stands in the way of our fantasy of wholeness</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Jenny Edkins Whose Hunger? Concepts of Famine, Practices of Aid 2000 p. 123-124</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“famine images, like the sexual images they...world free from hunger”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">their impact scenario is based on refusal to acknowledge environmental issues and adopt a relation of responsibility towards the world-we must accept nature Rather than force it to provide us with meaning we desire.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Zizek. 1993. “Looking Awry An Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture. P.34-36</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“is not the ultimate form of the...by the name of Chernobyl.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In globalization and terrorism we realize the same phenomenon-the point is that neither is true fundamentalism, instead the structure of both American Democratic fundamentalists and Islamic fundamentalists is one of tolerance and distrust which justifies ridding one’ self of the intruder. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Slavoj Zizek. 2006. “The Antinomies of tolerant reason: a blood dimmed tide is loosed: a glance into the archives of islam. Lacan.com</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“the excitation and the sense of...demanding respect for the others.”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This creation of lost wholeness is ultimately responsible for the possibility of violence - those who stand in the way of our fantasy become worth of destruction and elimination</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Zizek 95 &quot;Ideology between Fiction and Fantasy,&quot; 16 Cardozo Law Review 1511</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our argument can be briefly summarized...acquired by the remainder...</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our alternative is to reject the idea implicit in the affirmative that one must identify within the boundaries of the system, instead we make the impossible choice of the act, which recognizes the lack inherent in the false choice of our subjectivity and re-organizes the coordinates of the world - only this impossibility can deal with the fact that within the current structure revolution will occur</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Zizek 2000 &quot;Class Struggle or Postmodernism? Yes, please!&quot; Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left 2000</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Precisely because of this internality...terrain for a new beginning.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our criticism also reveals why they cannot access their impacrs the affirmative assumptsion of a simple cause and effect function of subsidies is not only wrong, but reflective of a general ideology which ignores the necessity of evaluating our justifications and methodologies.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Nick Srnicek. “Complexity and the Food Crisis” The Accursed Share. May 13, 2008.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“in considering the causes of the recent...time building real bridges”</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">in the context of this debate round, the act is the creation of liberated territory where the endless repetition of fantasy and the system as a whole are suspende. Rejection of the aff’s false choice immediately opens space for true utopian freedom outside of otherwise inevitable violence and domination and represents an absolute ethical imperative. </span><br />

Debate like politics has been hijacked by a demand for solitary focus on implementation – we will argue that debate should be a space for thought. It should include, but not be limited to the plan as such our alternative is necessary to promote thought and open the space for new conceptions<br />
butler and stephens “play fuckin loud:zizek vs the left” . the symptom, issue 7, spring 2006<br />
“so what, then…identified the problem”<br />
<br />
connecting the k with traditional politics destroys its efficacy – our k of identification are the proper politics and can only be addressed at the level of analyzing subjectivity<br />
stavrakakis 99 “lacan and the political”. Routledge 118-9<br />
“in fact, articulating…of political reality”<br />
The creation and articulation of the world outside myself depends upon the process of internalizing that world – makes our alt a priori question to evaluating your impact claims<br />
moore and fine 94, ‘psychoanalytic terms and concepts’<br />
“presumably, in the newly…and objective reality”<br />
Your attempt to distinguish ‘real impacts’ from the question of desire fails – desire frames the articulation of your impacts in the first place and is decisive in our attempts to deal with them – if we win a link to your aff we must refuse this articulation to accept these changes<br />

The aff's attempt to convince you that the plan is good appeals to far-fetched scenarios of global destruction - you should reject them for their convoluted internal link chains. &quot;There's always a risk&quot; is not a reason to vote aff - low probability internal link chains should not be used as an excuse to pass the plan.<br />

Katsulas, Debate Coach at Boston College, &quot;The Use and Abuse of Risk Analysis in Polcy Debate,&quot; Paper Presented at the 78th Annual meeting of the Speech Communication Association (Chicago, IL), October 29th-November 1st 1992, Available Online via ERIC Number ED354559, p. 10-12<br />
first, and foremost...risks in debates.<br />
Rejecting low probability internal link chains is key to rational policymaking - accumulated experience proves that appeals to the possibility of catastrophic causal chains should not influence decision-making<br />
