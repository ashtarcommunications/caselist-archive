Your affirmative case: corn ethanol<br />
Your advantages: Food $, hypoxia<br />
1NC off case position #1: ecofem<br />
Agricultural policies are inherently a feminist issue because women play a central role in food and crop production. However, economic development programs privilege the work and production of men and ignore the contributions of women which perpetuates discrimination.<br />
Petra Kelly 97<br />
(Third world women.. only the men)<br />
<br />
Under the guise of benevolence, the aff creates a neoliberal agricultural policy that removes subsidies and governmental regulation. These neoliberal policies are destructive because of the harm they do to women.<br />
Alison Jaggar 02<br />
(The term “globalization”…the world’s women)<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s mode of ecological citizenship which focuses heavily on the environment and neoliberal ideals ignores the social dynamics of gender that create inequalities. This re-entrenches patriarchy and prevents sustainability of life.<br />
Sherilyn MacGregor 06<br />
(How might citizenship …or ecologically)<br />
<br />
The continuation of patriarchy ensure environmental catastrophe and nuclear holocaust.<br />
Petra Kelly 97<br />
(Many women are…protect life on earth)<br />
<br />
Reject the aff and embrace ecofeminist citizenship. The negative is the antithesis of the affirmative – ecofeminists embrace subsidies and demand them in order to help promote equality. Our approach is one from the bottom up that uses the state as a tool to stop injustices and pays particular attention ot social relations and how they affect sustainability – the affirmative is a top down patriarchal action that ignores difference.<br />
Sherilyn MacGregor 06<br />
(I am sympathetic...as a matter of justice)<br />
<br />
The ballot acts a form of disobedience a way to challenge the patriarchal oppression that exists in our everyday lives<br />
Petra Kelly 97<br />
(We cannot just …that characterize patriarchy)<br />
<br />
1NC off case position #2: Peace<br />
Asses the framework of state politics first. They are a velvet glove hiding far worse than Iron Fist. Removing one form of trade warfare only paves the war for war by other means. They just shift state strategy – politics is war by other means.<br />
Burke 07<br />
(thus war and existence…to do our will)<br />
<br />
WE have no need for an alternative – this is a turn: claiming to increase peace is just a mask. Using international law and institutions to restrain the state from violence is an impossibility – the overall superiority and power of the United States means that the threat will always be there. Rationing out “free trade” like salt or tobacco just perpetuates deeper inequalities. At some point, there will be a crisis between these governments and because of the plan’s initial gesture internationally the resulting conflicts will be more devastating<br />
Sampson 05<br />
(according to foucaults… violence” is feasible)
