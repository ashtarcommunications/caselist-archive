President Jimmy Carter: “ The survival of Israel is not a political issue, it is a moral imperative, that is my deeply held belief and it is the belief that is shared by the vast majority of the American people…a strong secure Israel is not just in Israel’s interest. Its in the interest of the US and in the interest of the entire free world”<br />
<br />
The wall being constructed between Israel and Palestine is a manifestation of an emerging global logic bent on securing nationalist identity. The wall between US/Mexico and Israel/Palestine are inextricably linked. Violence of “the Palestinian conflict” is rooted less in religious antagonisms and more on a social imagination of space.<br />

the wall now being built to prevent…………………………..of any difference and all doubt.<br />
<br />
We risk losing our whole way of life without a solid border between us and Mexico….I believe not only should we have a border wall we should not allow illegals in and deport immediately all illegals who are here. Any children born here from illegal parents should also be deported. That is the onloy way we can start to rebuild the disaster that has befallen us…this illegal infiltration ust stop now. Deport all illegals and their children and don’t allow any more in by building a wall on this border now<br />

I am a 14 year old living in Houston Texas and I am strongly for the wall along the border…just think if the terrorists that flew into the WTC had come into the country through Texas. Well then that wall had it all ready been built would have saved hundreds of thousands of lives…there are 7th graders at my school that steal, rob, yell at teachers, be a problem and get in fights just for the hell of it. Now I’m not racist or anything, but I’ve noticed everytime that there Mexican…I hope to god and pray that we’ll do what should have been done a while ago and BUILD THIS WALL!!!<br />

Colin Powell:<br />
Since Israel’s establishment over 50 years ago, the United States has had an enduring, an ironclad commitment, to Israel’s security. The United States- Israeli relationship is based on the broadest conception of American national interests in which our two nations are bound forever together by common democratic values and traditions. This will never change<br />
<br />
We must understand Israel and America in a historical montage mutually constituting each other with mythic nationalist stories, we must counter these stories<br />

Claims of threats and disorder originate from the middle east are justifications for endless violence<br />
Noorani 05 “The Rhetoric of Security” The New Centennial Review, 5-1-05<br />
The entire frame of the DA is wrong: Wars are produced by the deep currents of history, by the roles that ordinary people have played, the disads could be found in the window of a couple of weeks, unless we combat the amnesiac temporarily of the disad frame we doom ourselves to the very impacts the negative speaks of, the DA’s causal understanding prevents the recognition of the banality of global violence and thus maintains<br />

Part 1: Setting<br />
<br />
He had started his morning this way for what seemed to be one hundred years. Ah… The United States Federal Government the third, he had tried to quit smoking in the early nineties but he had never stuck to it. The LAND… yes… something about the land always made USFG need a smoke. He slipped on his tattered blue suede shoes and wrapped the thick red robe with the tightly woven <em>American Idol</em> logo around his abdomen and slipped out his window to the fire escape. He began to climb. As he passed Mrs. Applebottom’s window he heard the usual shriek: “oh my lord, is that my cute little Fed jr? My how you’ve grown, haven’t you?” “Yes, Mrs. Applebottom—“ “how is your mother, she still holding that damned scale all day long? I mean, I know a job in the justice department is nice especially for a woman, but when is she going to retire, the girls and I never see her anymore, Margaret was just saying the other day, “where’s Justice?”—is your mother still blind?” “It’s a blind-fold, Mrs. A, and retirement isn’t that relevant to my family, a lot of people think we are going to live forever.” “well isn’t that cute,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>speaking of that, you know who I saw in the coffee shop the other day, oh my goodness you two should meet, oh my lord—“ “who was she, Mrs. A?” “oh, I walked into starbucks and there she was eating a cruller, the Internet, in the flesh. I mean she has lost the luster she had in her twenties but she still has a nice pair of legs.” “I gotta go, I have important national business to attend to…” he quickly whisked himself up the railing and onto the roof. This was where he could relax and release a few CO2 emissions along with the other polluters. He had always smoked in secret, in fact most people who even knew of the habit where dead or had been driven into exile. Just as the sweet nicotine was entering his patchwork lungs he heard something shuffling behind him. He quickly snapped his head around to see his boyhood friend (who had become accustomed to sneaking up behind The United States Federal Government and scaring him). “Izzy! You bastard! Who are you the Cheshire cat? Jesus!”<br />
Israel: “hey you are supposed to be calling me by my official name now, The State of Israel; you wouldn’t want to be accused of anti-Semitism now would you?”<br />
USFG: “quit busting my balls, I just ran in to Mrs. Applebottom.”<br />
Israel: “that old bag? Man, I thought she was dead. Is she Jewish?” “I don’t know she lives in New York, probably… whatever, she’s an American.”<br />
Israel: “aren’t all good american’s jews?”<br />
USFG: “goddamnit Izzy, I am trying to smoke!”<br />
Israel: “Relax Fed, How did Nixon put it? He said: ‘America admires people who can scratch a desert and produce a garden. The Israelis have shown qualities that Americans identify with: guts, patriotism, idealism, a passion for freedom, I have seen it. I know. I believe that.’”<br />
USFG: “man, I still catch shit for that guy. When did he say that?” He inhaled more smoke, relaxation.<br />
Israel: “how do you expect me to know? My memory is shit.”<br />
USFG: “yeah mine too. Goddamn, I can’t believe 2001 is almost over, Goddamn new century”<br />
Israel: “a new century for FREEDOM, USFG. Wait a second, what the hell is that?” USFG: “what are you talking about? You people are so par-a-noid…” he was struck speechless as he turned to see what The State of Israel was staring at. USFG saw a plane flying low over the New York City skyline, it was like a movie in slow motion, his vision seemed to zoom in and out on the plane, jumping from close-ups to wide angles. The trance was immediately broken as the plane smacked into the side of the world trade center. Everything seemed sharp and intensified. His cigarette fell limply to the ground as he heard his boyhood sidekick mutter: “I think I better get back home, I think I have some work to do.” After witnessing events which would the next morning would be catalogued and told as the story of “the Tragedy of 9-11” The United States Federal Government stumbled down the rickety fire escape and into his apartment, he methodically turned off the lights, covered the windows with some dirty towels and went to sleep. Many people contend that from that moment forward he would never be the same.<br />
Part 2: Rising action<br />
[News theme] Good evening, you are watching the nightly news with Derek Gregory. Tonight’s top story: now three years since September 11, 2001, we here at Nightly news wish to assess the impact on The United States Federal Government in that time. Many observers have been quick to note that since the attacks, “USFG” as he likes to be called has become reclusive, he makes only a few select appearances, which has caused many in the country to ask: What is the united states government now anyway? For that matter what is the meaning of America? For answers to this question we must look back in history, before September 11, if that is possible to imagine. According to Wikipedia, “<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">After </span><span style="COLOR: windowtext; mso-ansi-language: EN"><span style="COLOR: windowtext"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">World War I</a></span>, the <span style="COLOR: windowtext"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations" rel="nofollow">League of Nations</a></span> approved the <span style="COLOR: windowtext"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Mandate_for_Palestine" rel="nofollow">British Mandate for Palestine</a></span></span><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN"> with the intent of creating a &quot;national home for the Jewish people,&quot;” sources inside The USFG’s inner circle tell me that his father once warned USFG that the fate of world could be measured by humanity’s treatment of the Jews. Some have speculated as to whether USFG has Jewish lineage, some have even speculated that USFG is not a human at all. In any case nobody doubts the closeness of these two governments. From the very beginning of his short life The State of Israel, or as USFG calls him, “Izzy” has been none to closely associate with our government as close friend. Colin Powell once said of the two, “</span>Since Israel's establishment over 50 years ago, the United States has had an enduring and ironclad commitment to Israel's security. The United States-Israeli relationship is based on the broadest conception of American national interests, in which our two nations are bound forever together by common democratic values and traditions. This will never change.<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">1</span> Which brings us to the events of three years ago. “‘America’ and “Afghanistan,” “Israel” and “Palestine,” were jointly (not severally) produced through the performance of imaginative geographies in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks… America took advantage of those same attacks and mobilized those same imaginative geographies… to wage another war on Iraq… Architectures of emnity are not halls of mirrors reflecting the world – they enter into its very constitution… As the American response to September 11 unfolded and preparations were made for an armed assault on Afghanistan, James Der Derian cautioned that “more than a rational calculation of interests takes us to war. People go to war because of how they see, perceive, picture, imagine and speak of others.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">2</span> This topic has caused much consternation among the public, here to sort it out is our special studio guest: Michael J. Shapiro. Mr. Shapiro has written countless books on the topic of American identity. Michael, what do you have to say about they two friends, USFG and Izzy. </span><br />
<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">Shapiro: “the culture of a country, exactly like its ecology, turns out to be a living thing, sensitive and even fragile.”3</span><br />
Gregory: This seems pretty clear in light of USFG’s recent depressive mood swings. Do you think this recent development will place the country in danger?<br />
Shapiro: “Unified and fixed national cultures are inventions, fantasies designed to legitimate the idea of a ‘nati<span style="mso-ansi-language: EN">on-state.’ Once one relaxes territorial models of identity and recognizes the amoeba-like historical presencing of cultural boundaries, there can be no culturally dangerous others, only dangerous ways of fixing ‘culture.’”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">4</span> “The narrative and repressions characterizing Israeli nationhood, from ancient times to the present, display striking similarities with the problem of producing a culturally unified American nation and with the cultural anxieties articulated along the way. Not the least of the points of comparison is the similarity in the frontier narrative of the modern Israeli state with the legendary American Story.”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference">5</span> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><br />
Gregory: That’s all for tonight, thanks to Mr. Shapiro, and good night.<br />
[News Theme]<br />
“USFG, Fed, wake up! Wake up, your TV was on!”<br />
“I know, don’t call me that anymore, I wanna be called “The State” it’s more Orwellian.”<br />
“whatever, listen to me, it is a new century, you gotta stop all this depressing shit, there is a fucking war on! Come on buddy, you haven’t even answered any of your fan mail… um, you know at some point you are going to have to present a plan.”<br />
“I think Dubya has that covered Izzy. Leave me alone”<br />
“Look its easy, just stay on the offensive, go to the press, give them a couple diatribes about the American spirit and tell them you are going to stay the course. Just keep doing what you are doing, it will be fine. Trust me, I know, I live there. You can’t associate with… them, you know, we made a pact. You can’t go back on our deal; you can’t negotiate with the insane.”<br />
“Stop pestering me, we were young, it is a different world now! Look, don’t worry; you know I’ve got your back.”<br />
“That’s all I needed to hear, “The State,” I’ll see you at Jim’s party. You better be there!” and with a twirl Izzy strutted out of the dreary apartment.<br />
<br />
Part 3: Climax<br />
He kept on thinking to himself, <em>How will I be able to explain why I’ve waited over six years to present this? How can I explain myself at all?</em> He look out across the room: it was packed with reporters and scholars capable of being researched in search engines ranging from Lexis-Nexis to Project Muse, his podium was exploding with microphones, Israel was standing in the back of the room with a giant grin on his face, off to the side was Libya (she and USFG had been dating for several months). Before he started reading, USFG shot his old friend a quick look of consternation, like something was slipping through his fingers, and then the look faded and he began to read: “On this day, January 19, 2008, I, The United States Federal Government, present the following plan:<br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt">Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of one or more of: Afghanistan, Iran, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and Syria, and it should include offering them a security guarantee(s) and/or a substantial increase in foreign assistance.” </span><br />
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><br />
After reading these words, he glanced to the back of the room, Izzy’s look was cold and it seemed as if a tear was running down his cheek, after he took his first question from the press he glanced again and Izzy was nowhere to be found.<br />
