&lt;Narrative from Invisible Man&gt;<br />
<br />
This division has also been a part of my partners experience. He writes “I am a white male, and I have benefited from white privilege. In high school identity was not something I thought about because it was not something I experienced. There was no diversity. I was not forced to confront issues of race until I came to Missouri State, and am ashamed to say that I gave race issues little thought before the legal topic. Debating the Milliken decision opened my eyes.”<br />
<br />
Identity does not absolve responsibility. In The Invisible Man, Dr. Bledsoe, despite being Black, becomes complicit with the process of the narrator’s invisibility because he is more concerned with his own position<br />
<br />
Musick ‘03<br />
“What makes Ellison’s Invisible Man Invisible?”<br />
“The narrator continues…perceptions of him”<br />
<br />
Recognition of our responsibility creates a point for transforming relations and politics. We affirm our infinite obligation to the other. This allows us to construct a radically different future free of systems of repression and power<br />
Rosenthal ‘03<br />
A time for being ethical: Levinas and Pragmatism<br />
“This position gives a new…another chance”<br />
