Resolved: that the United States federal government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.<br />
<br />
Then there is a long and crazy story involving buffalos, maps, race, class, oranges, Ahh-Mh-Dee-n-a-jad, Russia not getting elected for the topic, imagination, calculation bad… I’m not typing that out – what follows is pretty much verbatim for what they read.<br />
<br />
We are enchanted by the topic, it is a wondrous imaginative crossroads. Debate produces its universe through ritual imaginative acts, magical acts. We make the world according to the lectures we form of it. This world producing optic too often ignores the mystical and awe inspiring imagination upon which it rests, too many are quick to tell stories of disenchatment, from the preoccupation with death and fear, to the obsession with refusal, rejection and cynicism, in our search to both define and destablize the foundations of debate we ignore its inherent beauties, its imaginative potential, Jane Bennett (The enchantment of modern life: attachments, crossings, ethics) writes “the very characterization of the world as disenchanted ignores and then discourages affective attachment to the world” it is time to see how the mundane in the debate is also magical, we see this topic as something to be affirmed for its amazing capacities for possibility, by its very nature, affirming this topic is an act of re-imagining politics, Dillon writes (Politics of Security: Towards a political philosophy of continental thought. 1996 p 1-2) “In making its contribution … human being’s freedom as possibility”<br />
<br />
Debate exists as a dialogue between world imaginations, recognizing the topic as crossroads of imagination is necessary to understand the process by which many global realities come to fruition. Arjun Appandurai, (“Grassroots Globalization and the Research Imagination” Public Culture 12.1 (2000) pg 7-8) writes “the capability to imagine regions and worlds is now itself a globalized phenonmenon… real worlds are globally produced. This production happens substantially in public spheres… look at research as a practice of imagination”<br />
<br />
We must take this closer look, at the very practivce of imagination the imaginative crossroads, the topic, but we must not fall prey to a purely cynical vision, in order to be truly engaged in the world, in order to tryly engage debate and this year’s resolution, we must allow ourselves to be enchanted by the topic, it is a site for imaginative possibility, it magically ignites thoughts in all of our heads, : mundane and magical: Jane Bennett (Same site as above, pg 111) “Picture a world where wondrous events compete … the actual world to its virtual possibilities”<br />
<br />
Yes affirm the resolution! Yes, Yes Bennett continues (same site p 3-4) “Enchantment is something that we encounter, that hits us … it is a state of interactive fascination…”<br />
<br />
And so when faced with this year’s imaginative crossroads, we say YES, and affirm it without equivocation.
