Aff about a box <br />

Akan daraul (A history of secreat societies, Citadel Press 1961/1989 asserted in 1961<br />
<br />
The are we practice is known as assassination, a world dervived from Arabic word “Assasseen”. But, the direct translation of this is not a bringer of death and destruction, it in fact means ‘guardians’ and we do not visualize ourselves as killers, but rather as guardians of the secrets.<br />

Advocacy statement: We affirm the secret inside the box <br />
<br />
We are here to help make a positive change but in order to complete our mission without incident; we must, like the Assassins of yore, maintain a level of secrecy. We cannot tell you why we are here, but you are safe <br />

Imagine what might be-rest are secret <br />
<br />
Our secrecy is a positive effort because we aim to uniquely address topic education. If it weren’t for our secret goal, we would be trapped in the realm of the debate norm, talking about the same old things from round to round; things that have been researched fully and are commonly understood thrououhgt the debate community. But, because we are being unique in our approach to the topic, we are providing unique education, which is better in the end because unique and interesting knowledge is more likely to inspire personal reaserch and discovery.<br />
We uniquely benefit education within in the round. When the plan is transparent then the line of thought is simply linear. But, by keeping our goal secreat we encourage a tangential, creating a web of knowledge. And at the center of this web is the topic, with off-springs and branches leading to different areas of knowledge base and at the outer edge of everyone’s personal knowledge. We are advoacates of this form of knowledge instead of general tpic education,<br />
Secrecy is a means of leveling the playing field for weaker teams is is a tool for fairness <br />

The methods of strategic-to one’s enemies <br />
<br />
Predictability is a scewed idea anyways. Very few, if any, people can predict the future, it is a secreat. We are all sense of predictability in that we aren’t predictable at all. Searching for transparency will only move truth elsewhere <br />
As Umberto Eco 92<br />
(Interpratation and Over Interpratation pg 35)<br />
But this pattern-on the ground <br />
<br />
Trying to limit the search for the truth is impossible. It is a slippery slope that never ends. Discovery our secret would only lead to yet another secret so on and so forth.<br />
As Umberto Eco 92<br />
(Interpratation and Over Interpratation pg 32)<br />
Its is only possible-power of communication <br />
<br />
Tactics aren’t fortified postitions, this ends the delusions of certain language <br />

Let me advance here-newly transformed state <br />
<br />
Strategy puts us in a state of warefare, when we adopt the ideas of others we become soldiers <br />
Mann 99 (Masocritism )<br />
Beyond these familiar-a military transport <br />
<br />
More contemporary forms of a warefare do not rely on ground positions or borders <br />
Mann 99 (Masocritism )<br />
To repeat-and smart bombs <br />
<br />
Intellectual warefare is key <br />
