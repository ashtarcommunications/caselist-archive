Q- How does sugar subsidies hurt trade with nafta<br />
A- violates nafta. Sugar to ethanol deals with excess supply of sugar. Mexican sugar doesn’t go to us market bc the us just buys it all. Sugar is straight up not used.<br />
Q-us mexico relations imperative- if we increase border patrol doesn’t that solve<br />
A- mexico is a failed state- increase likelihood of terrorist use mexico as access point to launch an attack against the US<br />
A-can’t produce eth domestically bc subsidies. Allows sugar to eth program to become competitive. Us sugar is higher than international prices<br />
Q-why does it violate nafta<br />
A:-bc agreement was to get rid of restrictions that artificially inflate prices, such as sugar</span><br />
