 BORDERS<br />
State centric cartography neglects struggles of marginalized peoples by cementing its own ethical model into all thinking about international relations; we should reject the state centric model of the globe and not attempt to redraw boundaries<br />
Shapiro__1997 (Michael J. Shapiro [critical international relations theorist and a professor of Political Science at the University of Hawaii]; Violent Cartographies: Mapping Cultures of War; Minneapolis: University of Minnesota; pp. 32-33) [As I have…global map] DR<br />
<br />
The nation-state is unable to deal with the problems of the 21st century – by advancing state-centric solutions the affirmative legitimizes territorial warfare and genocide<br />
Agnew and Corbridge_95 (John Agnew and Stuart Corbridge [Department of Geography UCLA and Professor of Human Geography the London School of Economics and Political Science] ; Mastering Space: Hegemony, territory and international political economy, London and New York; Routledge., P.5b-6t<br />
<br />
We must abandon the dualistic conceptualizing such as domestic/international and chaos/order in order to understand where these boundaries overlap - only a discursive approach that explores these boundaries is able to break away from these deeply entrenched western practices<br />
Blieker, Professor of Poly Sci and IR @ Univ of Queensland, 2000<br />
(Roland, “Popular Dissent, Human Agency, and Global Politics” p. 189) KZ<br />
<br />
Our alternative is a fundamental re-conceptualization of the world that understands territories not as determined by a material structure but as a social construction – understanding the world as a long series of individual choices<br />
