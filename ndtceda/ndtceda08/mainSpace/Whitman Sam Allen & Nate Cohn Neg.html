A. A fragile coalition has emerged enabling Warner-Liberman to pass now – maintaining the atmosphere of bipartisanship is key.<br />
Darren Samuelsohn, Writer for Environment and Energy Daily. 1/15/08. Environment and Energy Daily, “Dems face election-year test with global warming bill.”<br />

C. Impacts – <br />
<br />
1. Lieberman-Warner is crucial to solve disease spread, food wars and global warming.<br />
Joseph Lieberman, US Senator from Connecticut. 10/22/07. Hartford Courant, “Fighting Global Warming the Right Way.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/op_ed/hc-lieberman1022.artoct22,0,2290548.story" rel="nofollow">http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/op_ed/hc-lieberman1022.artoct22,0,2290548.story</a><br />
&quot;With all the irrefutable evidence that climate change is real, dangerous and proceeding faster than many scientists predicted, this is &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;that would boost our economy.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Disease mutation cause extinction<br />
South China Morning Post, 1-4-1996. “Leading the way to a cure for AIDS.”<br />
&quot;Despite the importance of the discovery of the &quot;facilitating&quot; cell, it is not what Dr Ben-Abraham wants to talk about. There is a much &quot;<br />

William Calvin, theoretical neurophysiologist at the University of Washington, Atlantic Monthly, January, The Great Climate Flip-Flop, Vol 281, No. 1, 1998, p. 47-64 <br />
&quot;The population-crash scenario is surely the most appalling. Plummeting crop yields would cause some &quot; <br />

C. Warming causes extinction. [Gender Paraphrased]<br />
Bill Henderson, Environmental Scientist. 8/16/06. Counter Currents, “Runaway Global Warming Denial.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/cc-henderson190806.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/cc-henderson190806.htm</a><br />

AND<br />
&quot;President Bush will visit in two week's time.&quot;<br />
<br />
If we don’t stop AIDS in Africa we face total extinction – this is a systemic risk that outweighs all other risks.<br />
Michael Muchiri, Kenyan Ministry of Education, psychology graduate student at Gadjah Mada University. March 6, 2000. The Jakarta Post, “Will Annan finally put out Africa’s fires?”<br />
&quot;But his vision, unless backed up by the essential nitty-gritty from the United Nations and other countries, is somewhere off in cloud- &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;beginning of the end of the black race and maybe the human race.&quot;<br />

GSE reform is gaining momentum now – it’s high on the agenda and should pass soon.<br />

AND<br />
&quot;promise in short order.&quot;<br />
<br />
Only by continuing bipartisan momentum can GSE reform pass.<br />
Christopher Dodd, Senator from Connecticut. 2/7/08. Federal News Service, “Hearing Of The Senate Banking, Housing And Urban Affairs Committee; Subject: Reforming The Regulation Of The Government-Sponsored Enterprises.”<br />

Passing GSE reform now is vital to stave off a massive credit liquidity crisis.<br />
Mel Martinez, Senator from Florida. 2/7/08. Federal News Service, “Hearing Of The Senate Banking, Housing And Urban Affairs Committee; Subject: Reforming The Regulation Of The Government-Sponsored Enterprises.”<br />
&quot;OFHEO and HUD share the regulation; it isn't all under one roof. And in this bifurcation and without the &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;time when tremendous needs for liquidity exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
That causes extinction.<br />
Norman Bailey, Senior director of International Economic Affairs, The World and I, 1990, p. 33-34<br />
&quot;The thirties, after all, began three months after the inception of the Great Depression arid ended four months &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;and the future of [hu]mankind.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the DA would definitely turn the case.<br />
Bernardo V. Lopez, Writer for Business World. 9/10/98. BusinessWorld. <br />
&quot;What would it be like if global recession becomes full bloom? The results will be catastrophic. Certainly, &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;possibilities. &quot;<br />
Lopez continues…<br />
&quot;Unemployment in the US will be the hardest to cope with since it may have very little capability for &quot;<br />

&quot;global recession will degrade a step further.&quot;<br />
