    Plan Text<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support by eliminating all of its fisheries access agreements. We reserve the right to clarify.<br />
<br />

<br />
America doesn’t want to accept that elimination of fishery subsidies is inevitable – US encourages global reductions but opposes any reduction that would enhance capabilities of developing nations.<br />
Chayter – 99 (Beatrice, “An Examination of Trade and Environmental Policy Responses to the Challenge of Fisheries Subsidies.”, Review of European Community and International Environmental Law, Vol. 8, Issue 3<br />
<br />
More recently, the United States, Iceland, and New Zealand…national and regional results.<br />
<br />
Fisheries access agreements are internationally recognized as unsustainable and undesirable, prompting a trend away from their implementation.<br />
Mwikya – 6 (Mbithi, “Fisheries Access Agreements: Trade and Development Issues, ICTSD Natural Resources”, International Trade and Sustainable Development Series Issue Paper No. 2)<br />
<br />
Fisheries access agreements, while likely to continue…forms of fishing agreements.<br />
<br />
The United States is the exception – maintaining a dense network of access agreements.<br />
NTSD – 6<br />
Google<br />
<br />
Access agreements involving fleets from DWFNs are usually…the EU, the US, and Japan.<br />
<br />
ADV<br />
<br />
The world is on the verge of a global oceanic collapse, the source of which is the over-fishing practices of American Distant Water Fishing Fleets…they keep changing locations until nothing is left.<br />
Sack – 1<br />
Google<br />
<br />
Yet by the 1990s, Status of the world’s fish stocks…has had grave environmental, social and economic effects.<br />
<br />
Access agreements → overfishing; US agreements are exploitive, most evident in South Pacific.<br />
Mwikya – 6 (Mbithi, “Fisheries Access Agreements: Trade and Development Issues, ICTSD Natural Resources”, International Trade and Sustainable Development Series Issue Paper No. 2)<br />
<br />
Fisheries access agreements give rise to serious concerns…illegal fishing in these waters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is simply nowhere else to fish.  The South Pacific is all that is left, but even they can’t meet the global demand, this guarantees collapse of global fish stocks no later than April 2009.<br />
AP – 6<br />
Google<br />
<br />
South Pacific countries are sitting on a time bomb…commonly known as Pirate Fishing.<br />
<br />
8 million people die of starvation every year because of America’s fish demand – the coming collapse will deny food to a billion people and cause extinction.<br />
OCEANA – 8<br />
Google<br />
<br />
On a world-wide scale, approximately one billion…for holes in the ozone layer.<br />
<br />
Access agreements in the South Pacific cripple local economies.<br />
Ovetz – 5<br />
Google<br />
<br />
In exchange, small island nations in the South Pacific…significant declines in local supply and quality.<br />
<br />
The fishing prices and economic dependency forced by access agreements causes conflict between local fishers and the Distant Water Fishing Fleets.<br />
ITSD – 7<br />
Google<br />
<br />
Access agreements also have the potential to create…fleets and artisanal and small-scale fishers.<br />
<br />
These disputes will escalate into armed conflict causing extinction.<br />
Ovetz – 5<br />
Google<br />
<br />
Today, the ocean is again a place of conflict…that depend on it is a risk.<br />
<br />
Access Agreements not only force developing nations out but also forced developed nations in – results in massive competition in limited space.<br />
Ovetz – 5<br />
Google<br />
<br />
Flush with subsidies, the growing global industrial fishing fleet…deplete the fisheries and move on.<br />
<br />
Great power wars<br />
Zimmerman 96 (Tim, US News and World Report, “If World War III comes, blame fish”, 10/21, lexis)<br />
<br />
The conventional wisdom has it that democracies…many boats and too few fish.<br />
<br />
SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
Fisheries are an underperforming asset – the only way to reverse this is if access agreements are curtailed.<br />
World Bank – 8<br />
Google<br />
<br />
Global marine capture fisheries are an underperforming global asset…is an increasing drain on society.<br />
<br />
Eliminating access agreements will eliminate just as the presence of US fishing vessels, it will also spillover to other conservation issues.<br />
Crawford – 4 (James, “The Law of the Sea in the Asian Pacific Region: Developments and Prospects”, Publications on Ocean Development, Vol. 21, p. 145)<br />
<br />
Other factors that would contribute to the continuation…more conservation/protection oriented.<br />
<br />
Access agreements in South Pacific is coercive and unsustainable.<br />
Bostwick – 95 (“Empowering South Pacific fishmongers: a new framework for preferential access agreements in the South Pacific tuna industry”, March, lexis)<br />
<br />
[C]learly, tuna represents the South Pacific’s most valuable renewable…Central Pacific fishing areas are depleted.
