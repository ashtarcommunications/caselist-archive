1AC: Iran grand bargain<br />
Advantages: Prolif, US-Iran relations, Democracy<br />
Plan (really really really long):<br />
<br />
Increase constructive engagement by proposing a grand bargain<br />
Offer a security guarantee including a commitment to not use force to change the borders or regime of Iran, removal of unilateral sanctions, normalized relations, involvement of American corporations in Iran’s economy, support for Iran’s entry into the WTO, declassification of Iran as a terrorist-sponsor state, and ongoing strategic dialogue for assessing implementation issues<br />
<br />
In return, Iran would be expected to provide full transparencey regarding its nuclear fuel cycle and weapons programs, sign, ratify and implement the Additional Protocol of the NPT, issue a statement expressing support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, commit to transforming Hezbollah into an exclusively political and social organization, discourage violence from Palestinian opposition groups, halt its provision of training, supplies, and funding to terrorist organizations as designated by the Us, commit to ongoing human rights dialogue with the Us, and work with America to promote order in Iraq.<br />
<br />
Acceptance should require that the entire package be agreed upon initially, with specific negotiations to follow.<br />
Implementation is guaranteed through normal means.<br />
<br />
1NC:<br />
Constructive Disengagement CP + K<br />
<br />
2AC: Impact turns ---hege good: oil, Israel freakout DA, power vaccum, econ/trade<br />
<br />
RFD: AFF<br />
CP not win sustainable impact to links<br />
Role of ballot card not that good<br />
“How we decide to engage” question is damning --- no a2 if we don’t engage them, the result will be a more hostile policy from the Us in dealing with Iran<br />
SAY: FIAT SOLVES<br />
<br />
Massive DA to US withdrawal from Middle East --- fiat solves escalation in the region but Ferguson/Brezinski says middle east response is bad --- states would take weapons and ferment hostile relations<br />
<br />
Possible case args: Iran would say no – why escalation would be inevitable and US-Arab conflict has been poisoned by Iraq<br />

<u>A world in which the United States exercises leadership</u> would have tremendous advantages.

Second, such a world <u>would have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with the world's major problems</u>, such as nuclear proliferation, renegade states, and low level conflicts. Finally, US <u>leadership would help preclude the rise of another global rival, enabling the US and the world to avoid another cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including a global nuclear exchange</u>.<br />

1AC: Iran grand bargain<br />
Advantages: Prolif, US-Iran relations, Democracy<br />
Plan (really really really long):<br />
<br />
Increase constructive engagement by proposing a grand bargain<br />
Offer a security guarantee including a commitment to not use force to change the borders or regime of Iran, removal of unilateral sanctions, normalized relations, involvement of American corporations in Iran’s economy, support for Iran’s entry into the WTO, declassification of Iran as a terrorist-sponsor state, and ongoing strategic dialogue for assessing implementation issues<br />
<br />
In return, Iran would be expected to provide full transparencey regarding its nuclear fuel cycle and weapons programs, sign, ratify and implement the Additional Protocol of the NPT, issue a statement expressing support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, commit to transforming Hezbollah into an exclusively political and social organization, discourage violence from Palestinian opposition groups, halt its provision of training, supplies, and funding to terrorist organizations as designated by the Us, commit to ongoing human rights dialogue with the Us, and work with America to promote order in Iraq.<br />
<br />
Acceptance should require that the entire package be agreed upon initially, with specific negotiations to follow.<br />
Implementation is guaranteed through normal means.<br />

“How we decide to engage” question is damning --- no a2 if we don’t engage them, the result will be a more hostile policy from the Us in dealing with Iran<br />
SAY: FIAT SOLVES<br />
<br />
Massive DA to US withdrawal from Middle East --- fiat solves escalation in the region but Ferguson/Brezinski says middle east response is bad --- states would take weapons and ferment hostile relations<br />
<br />
Possible case args: Iran would say no – why escalation would be inevitable and US-Arab conflict has been poisoned by Iraq<br />
