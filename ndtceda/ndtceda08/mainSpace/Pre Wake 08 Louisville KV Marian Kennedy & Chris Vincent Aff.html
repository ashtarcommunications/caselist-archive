<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">This vital economic sector in our countries is seriously threatened by agricultural subsidies granted by rich countries to their cotton producers. <strong><em></u>According to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, cotton subsidies amounted to about $5.8 billion<u></em></strong> in the production year of 2001 to 2002, nearly equal the amount of cotton trade for this same period. <strong><em></u>Such subsidies lead to worldwide overproduction and distort cotton prices, depriving poor African countries of their only comparative advantage in international trade.<u></em></strong>  </span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"><strong><em></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">Not only is cotton crucial to our economies, it is the sole agricultural product for our countries to trade. Although African cotton is of the highest quality, our production costs are about 50 percent lower than in developed countries even though we rely on manual labor. In wealthier countries, by contrast, lower-quality cotton is produced on large mechanized farms, generating little employment and having a questionable impact on the environment. Cotton there could be replaced by other, more valuable crops.</span><u></em></strong><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt">  </span></span><br />
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 14.0pt"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">In the period from 2001 to 2002, <strong><em></u>America's 25,000 cotton farmers received more in subsidies -- some $3 billion -- than the entire economic output of Burkina Faso, where two million people depend on cotton. Further, United States subsidies are concentrated on just 10 percent of its cotton farmers. Thus, the payments to about 2,500 relatively well-off farmers has the unintended but nevertheless real effect of impoverishing some 10 million rural poor people in West and Central Africa.<u></em></strong>  </span></span><br />
