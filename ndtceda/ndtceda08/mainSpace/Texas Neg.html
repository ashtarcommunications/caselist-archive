Texas 1NC<br />
T: Original Question<br />
1. ICCPR was never argued in front of the court—Kimball 1999 (from one f the briefs);Interpretation—Justice Stevens<br />
2. Fresh questions in front of the court destroys predictable limits; legitimacy of the view, reverses Madison, Questions that the course hasn’t addressed are tip of the iceberg<br />
<br />
Justice Stevens 2000, 120 S. Ct. 1084, Feb. 29, 2000; “But it is one thing to conclude…a sub silentio overruling”<br />
<br />
Lisa Kemler, 1999, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://supreme.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://supreme.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/index.html</a>; “Amici Curia “International Law Scholars and Human Rights Experts”…we think this omission precludes consideration of other unstated grounds”<br />
Kritik—Constitutive Criminality<br />
1. vawa’s civil remedy provision trades in domination by men for domination by the criminal justice system; leal recouse only normalizes gendere violence under this banner of crime to justify authoritative intervention by the state; this reinforces gender domination and deflects investigations into the root causes of violence; Nancy Meyer-Emerick 2001, The Violence Against Women Act of 1994 Page 16-17, Google Books; “Applying Foucault’s analysis…federal policymakers intended”<br />
2. legal recourse is disempowering—women have to submit themselves to the criminal justice system as a prerequisite for redress. This normalization depoliticizes male violence and invalidates gendered experiences—G. Kristian Miccio 2005, 42 Hous. L. Rev. 237 Summer 2005; “The Protagonist discourse…women who are battered”<br />
3. Discursive constructions of crime is enforced by authoritative intervention—splitting humanity into the dichotomy of criminal and non-criminal. This categorization is the ultimate denial of humanity which is repsonbile for all atrocities in the last century including gendered violence—Stuart Henry and Dragan Milovanovic, gaddass criminologists, constitutive criminology, page 179, “Crime, then is not caused by things, events, or factors…power play that is crime”<br />
4. Our alternative is vigilante justice—for sexual violence in particular, people should not look to the legal system for justice but rather take matters into their own hands—you cannot rape a .38!—Marie Gottschalk, 2006, The Prison and the Gallows: The politics of mass incarceration in America, p. 131-132, GoogleBooks, “but these measures had some significant…wish I had thought of it”<br />
<br />
ILaw:<br />
1. international assimilation of human rights leads to promotion in china<br />
M. Isabel Medina 2001, 47 Loy. L. rev. 535, Spring 2001; “let me return you…watering it down?”<br />
2. making women’s rights the focus only bolsters resistance<br />
Kristin Bumiller 2005, “Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective” from <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads</a>; “In general, U.N. enforcement of CEDAW…conditions of pluralism between and within states”<br />
3. us violation of il is inevitable—homelessness<br />
4. we can’t solve il bc violations and bush still exist—gitmo<br />
5. turn—using il is oppressive forcing the court to violate civil liberties elsewhere<br />
Roger P. Alford, 69 Alb. L. Rev. 653 2006, “In short, a genuine embrace…decisionmaking but sophistry”<br />
6. impact is the court will rollback rights hurting intl credibility<br />
Michael D. Ramsey, 98 A.J.I.L. 49 January 2004 (The u.s. constitutiona and international law: international materials and domestic rights: reflections on atkins and Lawrence); “The difficulty is further compounded by the problem…cover for an agenda determined elsewhere”<br />
Gender Adv:<br />
1. sq solves—unconstitutional<br />
Hausner 2002, 11 BU Pub Int. L. J. 261 Spring Summer, 2002 “Section 13981 offered…against individual perpetrators”<br />
<br />
B. Garners movements necessary to solve the case—Martha. F. Davis, 47 Loy. L. Rev. 535 Spring 201, “Meanwhile women’s rights…campaign against violence”<br />
<br />
2. victimization—civil remedy treats women as victims—Picart 2003, “Much that has been written… mixed results in this case”<br />
3. reinforces patriarchy—picart 2003 “to close, despite vawa….agency and victimhood”<br />
4. aff reifies the ppd—picart 2003<br />
“ultimately, while the Vawa itself…private vs. the public”<br />
5. rape shield—civil suits lack access ot rape shield laws<br />
Corinne Casarino, 1996, 6 BU Pub Int L. J. 185 Fall, 1996, “Another possible drawback to using…or the defense attorney”<br />
6. causes revictimization<br />
Mary E. Bahl, rape shield laws: who really needs protectin? <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.impactpress.com/articles/aprmay00/rape4500.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.impactpress.com/articles/aprmay00/rape4500.html</a>; “it would seem after viewing…may be served consistently”<br />
7. no impact bc gender violence is uncertain<br />
Jeremy rabkin 1997, American spectator, vol. 30, issue 5, master file premier; “but it is rather unclear who really suffers more from official “gender bias”…be denounced as “gender bias””<br />
8. civil suits commodify justice—money is inadequate; Leslie Bender, 1990 Duke L.J. 848 September 1990; “I am the first to admit that there are a lot of questions…place for feminist retorts”<br />
9. Acquaintance rape turn—civil lawsuits de-legitimaze acquantaince cases which trivialize rape—Corinne Casarino, 6 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 185 Fall 1996; “widespread use of civil lawsuits…to be treated as such”<br />
10. gender animus turn—gender animus standard perpetuates crazy rapist myth which hurts efforts to confront rape—christina e. wells and erin elliot motley 2001, 81 B.U. L. Rev. 127, Feb. 2001; “Vawa’s provision of a civil rights action…undercuts the feminist agenda”<br />
11. Third Party Liability—VAWA increase third party liability suits—Corinne Casarino 1996, “Third-party liability provides…know the victim”<br />
12. This dilutes the fight against rape—Casarino 1996; “Third-party liability also philosophical problems…report the crimes against them”<br />
13. Intersectionality—VAWA limits claims to gender thus ignoring the intersectionality of other oppressions causing failure—Picart 2003, “What this essay has sought…sexual harassment context”<br />
14. FRE turn—Federal rules of evidence changes ensure that civil suits will not be fair—they will be inquisitions on the defendant hurting the agenda—wells and motley 2001 “federal rules of evidence…undercut the agenda”<br />
15. Settlement turn—civil suit structure heavily favors settlement—Robert Cooter and Thomas Ulen 2004, “Law and Economics: Fourth Edition” page 409, “We have explained that voluntary pooling…avoid the waste of litigation costs”<br />
16. This turns case—Daniel Shuman, 42 Kan. L. Rev. 115 Fall 1993, “Not all victims leave… disputes lacked importance or attention”<br />
17. Fifth Amendment Turn—Fifth Amendment loopholes in civil suits mean the victim will lose—Casarino 1996, “The defendant in a criminal trial…may work against the victim”<br />
18. Losing cause more suffering and sends a signal of legitimizing rape—Susan. K. Smith, “Civil Remedies for Victims of Sexual Abuse” ==<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.smith-lawfirm.com/remedies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smith-lawfirm.com/remedies.html</a>;; “No case can be feasible…and morally accountable”<br />
19. Funding Tradeoff—ICCPR trades off with VAWA funding provision—John Dinan Congressional responses to the Rehnquist Court’s federalism decisions—Publius; page 1 (25) vol. 32, no. 3, june 22, 2002, l/n “The failure to overcome the effects…during the 106th congress”<br />
20. The impact is 1.6 billion dollars—Martha F. Davis, 47 Loy. L Rev. 535 Spring 2001, “Second, Morrison itself challenged only…for gender motivated violence”<br />
21. Civil Remedies prevent reform of criminal rape law—Casarino 1996, … “Civil compensation in acquaintaince…brought in a civil court”<br />
<br />
Texas 2NC: T, Kritik, Gender Adv.<br />
<br />
Topicality:<br />
Our interpretation—rule exactly oppostite the same question—reason why iccpr was never found in the decision even though there was a brief given; 2 supreme court rules; the court ruled that the brief was not considered for a reason; this is different than lopez where the court mentioned different grounds but did not rule (good ev)<br />
Our interp is not a holding; scalia concludes negative in their evidence;<br />
If they meet—their evd. Assumes that 14th would be topical, iccpr was never a 14th amend. Issue<br />
Kennedy evd is not specific to the aff; iccpr is a spec. treaty that has legal mandates ;and this is not a constitutional question but a statutory question<br />
Lawrence did explicitly list the other questions, but not rule on them; bad standard<br />
Their interpretation—we can permute to do both; limit to the final decision on the holding; they don’t meet iccpr grounds; they can’t overturn the final decision; and opinion is critical to final precedent; back in 200; quirin proves<br />
Our interp is best bc it preserves the best aff flex, bc the aff can rule against different holdings; they expand to any law review or website to multiple reasons; can’t predict, this outweighs; and disadvantage; justice seteves says guarantees links to stare decisis and legitimacy—new facts and hands; this would overrule the stare decisis disad; heart of the topic; they allow any critical teams to become topical; case list; they set a precedent<br />
They say: overrule is to reject; their defiiton assumes overruling a lower court—they don’t meet<br />
Rehnquist—assumes sole authority; rule on the authority of the holding<br />
Their c/I spec doesn’t apply; no extra-topicality claims<br />
They say unfair: our interp. Is best and take away arbitrary interpretations<br />
And we can’t cover the args<br />
Explosion outweighs; vote negative bc topical adv. Are good; framework topical claims; potential abuse—neg. value for the future; should’nt be forced to run cp or disads<br />
Kritik:<br />
1. perm—links bc civil remedies assume redress; voter; tradeoff; guarantees expansion of civil programs under vawa (ev); more ev;<br />
2. alt solves bc our focus on vigilante justice solves rape; you can shoot someone with a judge; considered alternative analysis; they assume positive directional approach; in a local setting, societal norms are ambiguous and always change, but if we can point to a specific solution, that affects change<br />
3. we solve ilaw bc we promote a model of justice<br />
4. all about the signal sent—necessary for federal recourse rather than state<br />
5. law may be good, but jurisdiction over civil cases is bad; role-playing doesn’t have to assume sc action; and role-playing is bad (ev)<br />
6. answered back by alternative claims; they can’t access a deterrence based model<br />
7. rapists are inevitalble; civil remedies are just symbolic (ev);<br />
8. we are political action just as much<br />
9. fw: our interp is negative against the choice of the fw; not fair for potential debates; reciprocal bc they choose resolutional area; we choose fw to debate this; no abuse—heart of the topic; about the entiretly of the case but about the basis of the case; side bias arguments don’t apply<br />
10. they say civil remedies trade off; facilitate retribution—oj simpson found guilty in civil court; becomes relevant to justice; instability<br />
11. impact—extinction; outweighs the case; creates a class of society to discriminate against; domestic violence is only a subset of violence (x); k turns the case; turns away from the root casue of violence, and subsumes; prerequisite for depoliticizing male violence; theoretical models ignore real causes; perpetuates patriarchy<br />
<br />
1NR<br />
<br />
ILaw:<br />
1. their ev. Is pre-iraq war; says if the scouts was turned into a real agent it might work, but it is inadequate, other countries think that we’re hypocrites<br />
2. exd.2; us promoting HR would be counteracted by other countries thinking we’re hypocritical<br />
3. jurisprudence makes it worse bc other countries think we’re hypocrites<br />
4. exd 3 use of HR increases our rights expectations of the SCOTUS; if they increase the rights through ilaw, it will be expected to do soin the future and it won’t do that which decrease its legitimacy (x)<br />
5. ethics is irrelevant they have to win a model or a movement to solve; sc must be legitimate to solve<br />
<br />
Gender:<br />
1. their evd. Between state and federal; civil courts are bad at all levels<br />
2. homeless evd is vacuous<br />
3. exd 1—sq solves; atty general already file for the same action (iccpr); already united women’s progress movements led by women pushing for Morrison; either the sq solves, or the movements don’t do anything and mena no solve<br />
4. tradeoff has already happened; necessarily trade off with shelter costs, long run is worse for women 1.6 billion<br />
5. exd overloaded in states—women would flood the courts<br />
6. lobbies can’t increase the efficiency of the federal court; the fed. Would just pass down to the states and their resources are strapped<br />
7. west doesn’t say ethic is best; we internal link turn; their movement is a false symbol of women’s progress<br />
8. arbitrary choice to go to the court; Rosenberg evd. Is the impact<br />
9. anti-movement movements are emp. Evidence; civil rights caused de facto seg.<br />
10. cvictimiation—actual process of going to trial caseuss victims; our evd. Make shte distinction; women would have to recount and tell their stories and look at perpetrators; don’t have choice about how to seek remedy in the future they don’t lead to more spillover to other remedies<br />
11. their Goldfarb evd. Doesn’t say that rape shield laws wil be in the federal courts; our evidecnac epplies—rape shield DOESN”t appy to tort laws; they would have to expose their sexual history which uniquely leads to victimization and turns the case<br />
<br />
1AR Notes/Cards<br />
W/m Lawrence; bowers proves; majority did not overrule anything; scalia more ev.; overrule; holdings are inherently arbitrary look to what the court says<br />
c/i—must change the outcome; most limiting; links more; link to stare decisis; other k teams would still be topical; 3 claims in the Morrison area; doesn’t explode limits; no central holding in casey; better to interpret overrule on what the court says—goldstein 2002; competiting interpretations are bad subst. crowd-out; cant’ punish for someone else does; GET THIS EVIDENCE<br />
<br />
ILAW: sets an international norm—waters 2005; implementation of int’l HR solves everything (ev); spillover to judicial culture that solves; homelessness is irrelevant;other countries looking to gender violence; won’t decrease in future<br />
<br />
Gender: Turns are non-unique; only distinction is whether or not the state judges are worse; federalization causes a norm—hagan 2001; prefer our evd. Jds; group the status quo fails; Morrison was bad; NOW evd. Shows that despite movements, people still die everyday; congress; civil remedy doesn’t cost anything; only 60 cases even if we cause it to pass; bernecke evidence conceded; victimization: social equality; Rosenberg is bad; concedes west evd. Consequences don’t matter as long as justifications are good; these are irrelevant; sheifd is non unique; plan doesn’t do anything<br />
<br />
K: either the alt solves, or the alt fails and the plan sovles; must shift culture, before the rape actually happens norm has to happen or the rape occurs still; schlag doesn’t apply bc demands on the state, we change the culture, we don’t demand the law change; law is good and can change culture; turns—socializaion solves the vagueness arugment; mackinnon describes the court as the highest sovereign; prevents; FW—net choice means args aren’t responsive; aff choice; they could pick another ground; look to what the plan does and not consequences; if there’s no civil alternative, only option is criminalization which is inherently worse; sye evd—lack of judicial remedy makes it worse; doesn’t solve w/o changing the court now (ev)<br />
