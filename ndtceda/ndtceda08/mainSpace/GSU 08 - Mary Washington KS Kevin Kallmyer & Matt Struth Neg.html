Framework<br />
CP<br />
<br />
We affirm the vision sent to us by the topic. “Resolved: That the United States federal government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all o f the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat, given to recipients whom earn more than $250,000 annual income per year, and end the “three-entity” rule”<br />

Block Strategy:<br />
Framework<br />
Switch Side Debate is Good<br />
<br />
Eric English, Stephen Lano, Gordon Mitchell 2007 “Debate as a Weapon of Mass Destruction,” Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/EnglishDAWG.pdf<br />
<br />
This episode is a representative anecdote…find debate so threatening.<br />
<br />
[the speech association of America… America’s youth / Wallace… free society / this outcome seems paradoxical… find debate so threatening]<br />
<br />
Exclusion is inevitable but the most inclusive strategy requires rules and order to protect contest<br />
Shively 2000<br />
[Ruth, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, edited by Portis, Gunderson and Shively, “Political Theory and the Postmodern Politics of Ambiguity,” 178-181]<br />
<br />
The first point here is that the ambiguists cannot embrace all disruptive actions or resist all attempts to categorize…reject civility and democracy.<br />
<br />
Informed decision-making – unpredictable or unfair debates preclude an informed discussion that rigorously tests the efficacy of their approach – this collapses civic deliberation because it prevents informed clash. This outweighs all other impacts – fairness is a prerequisite for voting for one team’s arguments or advocacy over the other’s – because we can’t test the truth-value of an argument or advocacy without rigorously testing it.<br />
<br />
Agreed question through the resolution is a prerequisite for gains from argumentation – debate is worthless without the predictability that is necessary to generate a starting point for discussion<br />
<br />
Shively 2000<br />
[Ruth, Political Theory and Partisan Politics, edited by Portis, Gunderson and Shively, “Political Theory and the Postmodern Politics of Ambiguity,” 181-182]<br />
<br />
The requirements given thus far are primarily negative… some basic agreement or harmony.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sandbagging is bad – if either side is unresponsive to an argument they shouldn’t get to make new answers later – that skews the other team’s strategy since every speech is based on the preceding opponent’s speech – otherwise the aff would always win<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ballot doesn’t solve - Debate inherently fails as a forum for personal political change<br />
<br />
A. No mindset shifts – people attribute losses to tactics and performance, not ideology<br />
<br />
Deborah Tannen, Georgetown University professor of linguistics, 1998 [“The Argument Culture,” p. 174]<br />
<br />
Another scholar who questions the usefulness of opposition as the sole path to truth… to poor performance or to an adversary’s unfair tactics.<br />
<br />
B. Dialogue fails – individuals lie and manipulate facts to win<br />
<br />
Deborah Tannen, Georgetown University professor of linguistics, 1998 [“The Argument Culture,” p. 9-10]<br />
<br />
But with most arguments, little is resolved, worked out, or achieved when two people get angrier and less rational by the minute…. The problem is, we can’t.<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Fairness<br />
<br />
A: The Link<br />
<br />
Policy debate centered on the merit of the resolution is key to fair debate – it’s a voting issue<br />
<br />
1. Predictability – The resolution sets to topic for discussion – allowing the aff to choose their own ground outside the resolution makes it impossible for the negative to be prepared – there are an infinite amount of non-policy advocacies unrelated to the topic that are impossible to predict – this leaves the negative unprepared to debate.<br />
<br />
2. Aff conditionality – only a resolutionally-based plan prevents shifting advocacies – their framework allows aff vagueness, allowing the aff to become a moving target which destroys discussion, advocacy skills and fair ground<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Implementation- the aff will always win the principles of their advocacy are good in the abstract – we can only debate the merits of arguments if they defend the specific consequences of political implementation<br />
<br />
Michael Ignatieff 2004 [ The Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror 20-21<br />
As for moral perfectionism…betray another.<br />
<br />
<br />
Roleplaying the government is the only way to assess state action and acquire the knowledge to challenge it<br />
<br />
Ryan Gallowsay 2001<br />
[Debate as a Dialectic www.ndtceda.com/archives/200102/0588.html]<br />
<br />
Second, dialectics are more persuasive than… Viva le Revolution.”<br />
<br />
Our Framework solves orthodoxy and fundamentalism – it’s progressive, not committed to status quo ideology<br />
<br />
Eric English, Stephen Lano, Gordon Mitchell 2007 “Debate as a Weapon of Mass Destruction,” Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies, www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/JPubs/EnglishDAWG.pdf<br />
<br />
Second, while the pedagogical benefits of switch-side debating… and reflexivity in the face of fundamentalism<br />
<br />
The left is splintered – political engagement is crucial to heal it – promotes cooperative action and historical legacy provides a focal point for progressive intellectualism<br />
<br />
Bronner, 2004 [Stephen Eric, Reclaiming the Enlightenment, CIAO, ix-xiii]<br />
<br />
The issue is no longer what party…secondary concern<br />
<br />
Policy strategies are necessary to solve oppression – voting aff is an empty symbol<br />
<br />
Grossberg 1992 [Lawrence, we gotta get out of this place; popular conservatism and postmodern culture 390-391]<br />
<br />
But this would mean that the Left could not remain outside… to fight them<br />
<br />
<br />
Degrees of fairness are possible – struggle to uphold more fair ideals<br />

CP<br />
The United States federal government should &lt;insert plan mandates&gt;, while maintaining agricultural support for individual recipients of subsidies whom earn less than $250,000 annual income per year, and end the “three entity” rule.<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Competition<br />
The plan and counterplan are mutually exclusive, any permutation would sever out of the plan’s complete removal of subsidies<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
An effective payment cap on subsidies solves the case and leads to a broader ag reform – resolves US trade commitments, dumping, and family farm collapse<br />
