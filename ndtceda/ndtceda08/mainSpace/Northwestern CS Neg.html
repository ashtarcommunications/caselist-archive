You have no solvency deficit – the only question is whether or not we should use latin<br />
Your boggs evidence says that dominate institutions will take over the legal system and destroy rights – the aff will result in the same thing<br />
We outweigh on magnitude – when the public does not have access to the legal system, extinction is inevitable,<br />
This scenario makes death inevitable, we will go to war if citizens’ rights and interests are lost<br />
You Can’t Access Public Engagement<br />
And the Plan Reduces Public Engagement<br />

There’s no solvency deficit to using English in the CP text –most Latin terms are merely ritualistic and don’t carry any independent weight<br />

“Stare Decisis is a …..guides the Court’s”<br />
Only the explicit and unambiguous refusal to use Latin reforms the legal system –the permutation fails<br />
Macleod, Student Note, 1997<br />
39 B.C. L. Rev 235<br />
“Second, external pressure….the legal community:<br />
Audience is the most critical factor when considering what words to use –the public can’t access a legal system built around arcane latin phrases<br />
Cohen, ‘99<br />
67 U. Cin L. Rev. 491<br />
“Moreover, legal writing….for a different purpose”<br />
Impact turns the Case –<br />
Use of Latin Strengthens dominant structures of white, Male dominance –only returning back to English makes the law accessible<br />
Macleod, Student Note, 1997<br />
39 B.C. L. Rev. 235<br />
“The influence of……as it has ever been”<br />

<h2 id="toc43"><a name="Pre NDT-Clear Statements CP"></a>Clear Statements CP</h2>
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should establish a clear statement standard to interpret the Commerce Clause. The Court should make four findings regarding the standard. First, the standard only applies to the text of a statute. Second, the traditional rationality standard should be applied. Third, this standard is consistent with the reasoning and outcome of its post-Lopez decisions. Fourth, Raich is a prime example of how Congress can function as a collaborative partner in determining the limits of constitutional power. The United States Congress should establish a civil remedy for gender violence. In the text of the Act, Congress should enumerate that past legislative findings grant authority to legislate under the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
The CP solves the whole case without overruling Morrison<br />
A) Rational standard entails great deference<br />
B) Provides a new basis to re-enact the civil remedy<br />

Against our Edelman Aff, they said Overpop Bad--failure to focus on the future means we don't plan effectively for overpopulation crisis. They read alot of &quot;duty to future generations&quot; args as well.<br />
<br />
They also read a CP in the 1NC and extended in the block that rescinded the global gag rule. They kicked it in the 2NR though.<br />
<br />
from blake:<br />
NU's strat was an Opop DA. their link arg approximated &quot;must be concerned with future to develop family planning strategies. they initially had a CP to repeal the global gag rule, which they claimed solved Opop. The CP was kicked in the 2nr. Other than this, they also had a bunch of dickenson cards on case (not all biopolitics is holocaustal) and maybe a Brenkman card or two.<br />

NU CS read one of their PICs out of something small and irrelevant in the plan text. Against us they PICed out of the capital S in Supreme Court. The net-benefit was originalism good, because the constitution didn't want the court to be &quot;Supreme&quot;. NU BW read a counterplan that expanded commerce clause interpretation, but didn't overrule Morrison. The net-benefit was PBA overpopulation.<br />
