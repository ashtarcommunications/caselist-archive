Ban Dumping Counterplan<br />
<br />
Text- The Untied States Federal Government should ensure export prices for cotton capture the full cost of production, including the cost of marketing and a reasonable profit. The United States Federal Government should establish a supply management system for cotton including price floors, set aside and/or quota systems designed to prevent the export of cotton below the cost of production.<br />
<br />
Ban dumping is key. Research indicates that subsides aren’t the root cause of low prices, ending dumping is critical to alleviate poverty. Ending subsidies just causes farmers to switch over commodity crops increasing overproduction in those sectors.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial">Our alternative forms the basis for a radical global struggle of social distribution of power against Eurocentrism. Our use of subaltern epistemologies reframes the conception of the current colonial global order.
