 A short play that claims to mock the 1AC’s heroism attempt. The alternative is to not respond heroically to break the cycle but rather to revel in the harms, not move toward transcendence. The link arguments are to apocalyptic rhetoric, etc.<br />

 ON FRAMEWORK:<br />
<br />
[]Policymaking is the struggle between different forms of reasonging--our discourse and representations shape reality and are criticial to any understanding of bureaucratic policymaking<br />
<br />
Rosemary E. Shimko 2004 &quot;Discourses of Denial: Silencing the Palestinians, Delegitimizaing Their Claims&quot;. Journal of International Affairs. Volume: 58. Issue: 1 Pg. 1 Gale Group 2005<br />
<br />
&quot;Critical constructivism and theories...is denied? What then?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
[]The community we build is more important then the rules we play by. We purpose a counter interpretation to agree to disagree--founding a community based on commonality or a set of appropriate agreements destroys difference, their framework requires homogeneity and the destruction of all perspectives that are deemed outside of &quot;the political&quot;<br />
<br />
Secomb 2000 (Linnell, a lecturer in Gender Studies at the University of Sydney, &quot;Fractured Community&quot; Hypatia-Volume 15, Number 2, Spring 2000, pp.138-139)<br />
<br />
&quot;This reformulated universalist...homogeneity and transparency.&quot;<br />
<br />
[]Their attempt to exclude modes of thought that don't answer the resolution devastates the potential for human emancipation<br />
<br />
Foucault 80 (Michel, French Theorist, &quot;Question of Method,&quot; Published in Michel Foucault: Power ed. James D. Faubion, p. 235-236<br />

&quot;But paralysis isn't...have realized their ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
ON THE CRITICISM<br />
<br />
<br />
[]Efforts to cleanse and classify society into just/unjust, legal/illegal, safe and dangerous are methods of abjection that result in society casting off all parts it sees as impure while denying the fact that the ugly other is also a part of the self--this erasure is what allows bodies to be excluded, hidden, mistreated, and ultimately extinguished<br />
<br />
Wilkie-Stibbs 2006 [Borderland Children: Reflections on Narratives of Abjection. The Lion and the Unicorn 30.3 2006 (316-336) lectures in English, Children's Literature, and Childhood Studies at the University of Warwick, UK.]<br />

[]Strangers, Gods, and Monsters challenge our preconceptions of reality--revealing tokens in our fractured psyches<br />

Richard Kearney 2002 [Kearny is The Charles B. Seelig Professor in Philosophy at Boston College and has written many peace proposals for a Northern Ireland Peace Agreement &quot;Strangers, Gods, and Monsters: Ideas of Otherness.&quot; Pg. 4-5<br />
<br />
&quot;Strangers, godsandmonstersare the central...disaster and regard as wholly evil.&quot;<br />

<br />
-so many things died - persia - moving and conquering kings and cities - built roads and alexander was the unity -<br />
<br />
-he could see the beauty in all things - the shit became the mud - kept walking before the battle<br />
<br />
-he had a dream and asked someone to make sense of it - the mystic - make the clients sit with him -<br />
<br />
-explains his dream - the calvary unit was in battle without horses - gaining ground - fighting - and tolamy had a terrible injurty - alexander was beheaded<br />
<br />
-alexander watched the battle be lost and was disgusted<br />
<br />
-mystics said that you cant see head things on - the resistance - not violence - truth and secret with rapture<br />
<br />
-theatrical process -<br />
<br />
-alexander has no idea what the mystic says - mystic also says that he cant experience joy and must push forward<br />
<br />
-the hero must be whole and clean - and be safe - for our need of structure - the waste is always coming back into our life<br />
<br />
-alexander stopped taking his medicine<br />
<br />
-all people will unite under one great macedonia<br />
<br />
-alexander is not a hero - just a story - alexander thinks that he is the solution to the worlds problems<br />
<br />
-alexander kills the mystic - and the mystic says that god is not the problem killing him achieved nothing - plato was before him -<br />
<br />
-alexander wants to vanquish the christ man<br />
<br />
-wants to battle his problems<br />
<br />
-alexander saw bodies all over ready for battle<br />
<br />
-alexander wants to &lt;&lt;insert part of the 1ac&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
-debate is about story telling<br />
<br />
-the 1nc is defacement - what the mystic says - somethinng that doesn’t actually reveal truth<br />
<br />
-the judge - the judge should see which story is better<br />
<br />
-sit in the shit<br />
<br />
-&quot;imperialism happens and that’s totally cool&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Block<br />
-debate is story telling - nothing happens in the world after debate - no impacts - no team will deny this arg - what happens to the indv psyche<br />
<br />
-act of defacement - the world is no longer bad - assumption the 1ac is the truth - reject the claims to truth - cant weigh the implications<br />
<br />
-the 1ac is the purification of their story - and the horrifying of the world<br />
<br />
-trying to make the world clean and sterile - the hero is the perfect - alexander was a god - thought that he could transform the world<br />
<br />
-spanos - says the bad is the west and they must clean this up by affirming - this is an oppression - t<br />
<br />
-say that the geneology can save the world - there is a link - they say they are the only ones who can solve<br />
<br />
-the purificattion of the world is the link<br />
<br />
-the ballot should represent the political - this is violent should not be put above the ugly of the world<br />
<br />
-interrogate the defacement<br />
<br />
-cant make no link args<br />
<br />
-they are political - the neg is not<br />
<br />
-the policy entrenches violence<br />
<br />
-no answer to why things are bad - and why imperialism is bad<br />
<br />
-alexander saw them as good<br />
<br />
-challenge that imperialism is bad<br />
<br />
-the possibilities are already open - don’t have to vote aff to do this - don’t need the aff<br />
<br />
-the claims of what must be done are reasons to reject the aff<br />
<br />
-they are the only answers in the debate<br />
<br />
-drive to eliminate our own guilt in the world<br />
<br />
-say that other people don’t understand and that’s why they cant solve<br />
<br />
<br />
-the aff cant leave the world as it is<br />
<br />
-the story - situates the tellers in the uglyness of the world<br />
<br />
<br />
-ext the ev - before there was a god there was a plato - there are always god like figures - the aff tries to do this again<br />
<br />
-the impact of the neg is - when people lash out if there is opposition towards them<br />
<br />
-when we feel so high about our thoughts - everyone else becomes unpure<br />
<br />
-everyone becomes the people to be rejected and there is resentment for the world and<br />
<br />
-vote to let the world be itself<br />
<br />
-alexander silenced other people - was imperialist<br />
<br />
-alexander also did bad thins<br />
<br />
-fort hayes thinks that they are soo pure<br />
<br />
-this is dangerous and violent<br />
<br />
-cx - the neg is critizing criticism itself<br />
<br />
<br />
1nr<br />
<br />
the alt is defacement - the story of alexander and the bad shit in the world<br />
<br />
a powerful political strategy<br />
<br />
the imperialism that we seek to fight will always comeback<br />
<br />
they are on a high horse<br />
<br />
the shit is part of us<br />
<br />
only in defacement we can reveal the terrible secrets<br />
<br />
attacking it head on does nothing - must confront the asshole<br />
<br />
defacement is internal process - authentic<br />
<br />
tostek says this solves<br />
<br />
not a genology radical politics - but imperialism is part of us - they think that they are T ttruth<br />
<br />
let imperialism happen<br />
<br />
let shit shit<br />
<br />
defacement breaks the circle and lets the world be xx tostek<br />
it’s a confrontation of death<br />
<br />
<br />
do not be afriad xx tostek<br />
<br />
<br />
fear is part of the system and a way to keep it intact and running<br />
<br />
<br />
don’t be afraid<br />
<br />
<br />
defacement is insistent on silliness<br />
<br />
<br />
don’t deface exceptionalism the neg solves this better<br />
<br />
<br />
neg is telling a better story
