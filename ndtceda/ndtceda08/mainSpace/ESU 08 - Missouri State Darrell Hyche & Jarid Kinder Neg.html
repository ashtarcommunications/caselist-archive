<strong>Their claims of solvency are a claim of overcoming, but such claims – situated in the realm of post-human discourses, function as a form of techno-discourse, meaning they link to their own criticism and embrace a logic which has led to the worst of impacts</strong><br />

<strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Their case impacts stem from the 4</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">th</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> phase of potentialization – affirming a 5</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">th</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> phase, partage, which is not outside rationality, provides a far more effective approach to handle 4</span><span style="text-decoration: none;">th</span><span style="text-decoration: none;"> phase impacts than the case through dialogue</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Claims of overcoming include a built-in apocalypse followed by a post-human/post-history – such claims themselves should be rejected, as Heidegger eventually admitted in 1961 that their opposition to metaphysics is itself a form of metaphysics, which means the case turns itself</span></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: none;">Enframing link – their notion that rationality works through enframing falsely implies that rationality itself can be contained (enframed?) -- this undermines the dichotomy that forces abandonment of rationality in favor of pre-rationality – vote instead to explore the transformation potentials of rationality</span></strong><br />
