Gender K 1NC<br />
A – framework<br />
The aff’s ordering of experience and knowledge is fundamentally gendered – the lens through which the view the world structures ways of being and acting<br />
Peterson and runyan 99- global gender issues pages 1-13<br />
“whenever we study a topic we do so… effect of gender on world politics’<br />
B Links<br />
1. the aff is an arbitrarily produced solution in search of problems under the rubric of conventional agricultural rationality, ag production, research and methods are hegemonic and hostile methods of gender construction<br />
Kloppenburg 91 – rural sociology, vol 56, no 4, Carol Cohn “sex and death in the rational world of defense intellectuals” (1987:717-8)<br />
“no less than those who would challenge the way…science is presently constituted”<br />
2. ag policymaking expands and compounds patriarchal understandings of the farm and society. Debates on subsidies reproduce dominant binaries and hierarchies of violence<br />
Sciullo 2006 – a feminist analysisi of the farm, 28 whittier l. rev 709<br />
“laws often have unintended consequences – consequences that… protests and other transgressive activities.”<br />
3. representations of agribusiness production dynamics and academic research adopts a masculinist gaze that targets the body as a site of construction and destruction. The very foundation of agriculture is infused with discourses of subjugation and rural fantaies of masculinity<br />
Brandth 2006 – agricultural body-building, journal or rural studies 22<br />

Outweighs and turns the case. Patriarchy forms violent ways of thinking that make failed ag methods and extinction inevitable<br />
Warren et all 94 – feminism and peace, hypatia, vol 9, no 4<br />
“operationalized, the evidence of patriarchy as a …. Regional ,national and global contexts.”<br />
D. Don’t call it an alternative<br />
Our method of criticism is to make facile gestures difficult – rejection and exposing of patriarchal structures opens space for resistance to violent agriculture<br />

The United States federal government should offer the cotton industry a buyout whose yearly payments to each farmer are equal to no less than twice that farmer’s largest per year gross income earned from cotton in exchange for accepting the limination of existing United States cotton subsidies as necessary to comply with the World Trade Organization decision regarding cotton subsidies and agreeing to no longer engage in subsidized cotton practices offsetting any increase in payments over the amber box limit. </span><br />
