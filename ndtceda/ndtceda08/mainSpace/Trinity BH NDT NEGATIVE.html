Cutting ag subsidies requires the USFG to act because they are government programs<br />
Wikipedia 09<br />
An agricultural subsidy is…such as soybeans.<br />
Although the aff discusses ag subsidies, they have changed the point of stasis for debate way from the resolutional question pertaining to govt action by asserting a new question for the debate.<br />
Deliberative argument requires an agreement established before the debate in order to determine the relevance of any argument. Without a point of stasis, debates could easily devolve into ridiculous claims like vote for us because we are San Antonio Spurs fans and Tim Duncan is awesome. The logic of the aff makes every arg relevant and therefore makes deliberative argument impossible.<br />
Wallton, 2004 (Relevance in Argumentation, pg. 126)<br />
Such matters of how a chain…that should be solved.<br />
Deliberative argument is critical to marginalization and violence . The aff’s move to abandon deliverative argument because it has the potential to exclude perspectives ignores the spectrum of power relationships that exist through society. Their naïve belief that total inclusion in an unfettered public discussion will end discrimination is dispromven by the violent history of social hegemony.<br />

Evolution K<br />
People don’t think in images – storage, association, language, memory, and non-visual concepts prove<br />
Pinker 2002 [Steven, The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature, PhD at Harvard in experimental psych, p. 215-216]<br />
Though mental images … of the source.<br />
Evolution is key to understanding deception – the alt is to give all power to elites and give up the attempt to expose falsehoods<br />
Pinker 2002 [217-218]<br />
Recognizing that we are … they are promulgated.<br />
Calling us racist is absurd – evolution based politics proves elites don’t act in our self interest, calls attention to the oppressed, proves justice is innate, and explains self-deception like institutional racism. Arguments to the contrary are ideological attempts to censor science<br />
Pinker 2002 [110-111]<br />
At Harvard there were … virtue in the other.”<br />
The blank slate attempts to resolve the tradeoff between equality and freedom by pretending it doesn’t exist. This justifies the extermination of the Kulaks, the Armenian genocide and anti-Semitism. Embracing evolution is key to making this decision intelligently.<br />
Pinker 2002 [151-152]<br />
Some people have suggested to me … humane manner.<br />
We’re not Social Darwinists – that theory wasn’t grounded on biology, contradicted fundamental tenants of evolutionary theory and wasn’t advocated by Darwin. Social Darwinism is really Spencerism.<br />
Kirsch 2-9-09 [Adam, The New Republic, “Lessons from the Guilded Age: What Social Darwinists didn’t get about evolution”]<br />
Spencer is little-read today … it was “substantially atheistic.”<br />
The alternative is consilience – advocate the 1ACbut start with evolution. This is necessary to the good kind of reductionism, which is the only way to understand things.<br />
Pinker 2002 [69-72]<br />
History and culture … inscrutable ghosts.<br />
Censoring science is pushing us towards extinction, destroys freedom of thought – every policy of the Bush Administration proves, wars, climate change, the environment, and health.<br />
National Coalition Against Censorship 2-18-09 [“Science informing politics, not politics informing science”]<br />
Science based policy had a rough time … function as “ultimate sovereign.”<br />
Embracing evolution is key to prevent extinction<br />
Boutler 2002 [Michael, “Extinction: Evolution and the End of Man” 181-182]<br />
Perhaps it was that cold realization … not just dangerous.<br />
Recognizing human nature is necessary to oppose discrimination – their ethics tie a moral claim to a factual one, and justify socializing people into slavery.<br />
Pinker 2002 [145]<br />
So could discoveries in biology … servitude or degradation.<br />
Evolutionary understandings of humans proves all people should be treated equally.<br />
Arnhart 7-24-2008 [Larry, “Krannawitter on Lincoln, Darwin, &amp; Biblical Historicism”]<br />
Krannawitter might respond to this idea … takes up this debate.<br />
Considering evolution is key to understand the structure of the mind, allows people to interact naturally, resist oppression and save the ethical claims of the 1AC from being falsified later. We can’t be free or solve problems until we understand the structures of our mind.<br />
Pinker 2002 [xi-xii]<br />
Though many of my arguments will be … argue) be enhanced.<br />
Any philosophy that contradicts science will inevitably be destroyedl The question isn’t whether you accept evolution or not, it’s whether the 1AC’s ethics will survive the transition.<br />

<strong>Tragedy K</strong><br />
This year’s resolution has brought to light the ongoing tragedy of agriculture in America. We have considered the economics and the ecology of farming. We have seen the international and the domestic politics of this ancient institution, and, as the 1AC made clear, it is time for our national investment in the practice to end.<br />
Yet, we cannot help but feel that something important is missing from this discussion. The farmers themselves are deeply embroiled in these issues and yet they themselves are absent. Thus, we begin our side of the debate with one farmer’s desire to leave his mark:<br />
Hanson 96<br />
Victor Davis, Fields Without Dreams 4-5<br />
I've been back here fifteen … longer—behind my wall.<br />
Victor Davis Hanson grew up on a farm, spent nine years wasting away in academia learning the classics, only to return to the farm with his brothers in a futile struggle with the soil, losing money while the world passed him by. Now the plants are dug up, the fields unkempt, and suburbia is creeping in. These were the best years of his life. He further explains:<br />
Hanson 96<br />
Victor Davis, Fields Without Dreams 89-93<br />
In 1983 we could not do what the new laws … be wasted and lost for good.<br />
Hanson is a pessimist. Rather than give up the fields and chase his dreams, he chose fields without dreams. In those fields he found no comfort, progress, salvation, or happiness, but unadulterated joy against a society who has forgotten it.<br />
Joyful pessimism is what the affirmative misses, and it is the central figure of our telling of the tragedy of American agriculture. We affirm the doomed farmer against optimism, against progress, against the bland re-selling of free markets and liberal politics. And pessimism is precisely what makes stories like Hanson’s matter:<br />
Dienstag 4<br />
Joshua Foa, Associate Professor of Politics at the University of Virginia. Tragedy, Pessimism, Nietzsche. New Literary History 34:1 Project Muse<br />
So, while the pessimistic conception … speak of a terror that liberates.<br />
Hanson’s story reminds us that western civilization began in the fields, where the first farmers affirmed their difference from nature and created themselves as political animals. Out of the fields also came the dionysia, the mad celebration of the struggle with nature. The dionysia came into the cities in the form of pessimistic tragedy where the horror of this struggle with nature found artistic expression. This was a time of heroes and gods who became great through struggle and through the representation of that struggle. When Greek civilization gave up on the agrarian struggle with nature and instead valued the philosophy and the reason of the cities, it came under the delusion that civilization had won and that the world could be molded into ever-more perfect forms. This delusion is reflected in tragedy, where the mad Dionysian chorus gave way to descriptive and moralistic commentary. This is a debate about tragedy, and the affirmative’s optimism is a bland script. Optimism reeks of the old Socratic lie equating Truth with virtue. Rather, we contend that Truth gives us hollow virtues and worse art. This is how Socrates poisoned Greek Tragedy and continues to poison the agricultural tragedy of the 1AC. Life is essentially chaos, and chaos entails suffering. It is a repulsive folly to blame suffering on anything in particular, for this reactivity can only end in blaming life, collapsing into a nihilistic will to nothingness.<br />
Saurette 96<br />
(paul, phd political theory @ johns Hopkins, “I mistrust all systematizers” millennium 25:1)<br />
According to Nietzsche, the philosophical … philosophical principle of modernity.<br />
We do not blame them for their nihilism, nor do we decry their performance as false. We rather affirm our difference. The tragic pessimism of the doomed farmer gives us a much more compelling portrait of agriculture and its role in society than their romantic optimism could ever aspire to.<br />
Hanson 96<br />
