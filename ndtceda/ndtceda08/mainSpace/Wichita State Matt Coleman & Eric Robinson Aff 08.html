Reasons to Prefer<br />
A&gt; 2AC ground is exclusively predicated on the 1AC thus in all instances we should get leverage the 1AC otherwise it skews the 2AC strategy and kills predictable affirmative ground.<br />
B&gt; Topic Education: Policy focus assures a discussion about the merits of US engagement towards the ME, increasing the quality and quantity of education.<br />
C&gt; Aff Choice: The 1AC is the only stable source of ground in the debate and should dictate the nature of the debate, and you can read the K on the Aff which solves all of your offense<br />
D&gt; This argument must be answered in the 1NC or its sandbagging which skews 2AC strategy and is an independent reason to vote affirmative for Competitive equirty<br />
