In the status quo, American rhetoric about the Middle East deludes us into thinking that the Arab-Israeli conflict is happening somewhere far away. This is incorrect - The violent Rhetoric of the Arab Israeli conflict is happening right here and right now.<br \/>\nKhawaja , 2003.

The discursive conflict around Israel and Palestine starts in the American academy, but it doesn\u2019t stay there. Intellectual Zionist rhetoric trickles down to \u201cstreet\u201d speech where it does its damage in the form of arguments for extermination of the Palestinians. The connection between intellectual and street discourse is living and real, in our institutions.<br \/>\nKhawaja , 2003.

In the academy, the charge of anti-Semitism has been expanded to any criticism of Israel. This silences productive discourse and makes it impossible to asses what is and is not anti-Semitic. <br \/>\nButler, 2004 - (Judith, Professor of English and Rhetoric at Berkeley, Precarious Life, p102)<br \/>\n<br \/>\nObservation 2 \u2013 The Charge<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA. In the academy, yet another accusation of anti-Semitism is being deployed. These recent claims of a \u201cnew anti-Semitism\u201d are designed to exploit the historical suffering of Jews and immunize Israel from scrutiny.<br \/>\nFinklestein, 2005.

This discourse around anti-Semitism re-envisions any critique of Israel as anti-Semitic by attributing prejudice to the speaker. The criticism is thus treated not as a productive discourse, but seen instead as a cloak for discrimination against Jews.<br \/>\nButler, 2004 - (Judith, Professor of English and Rhetoric at Berkeley, Precarious Life, p102)<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nC. These charges are carry extreme weight. Anyone with any proposal to change status-quo Israel is accused of wishing to destroy all Jews. This is a flawed argument for four reasons.<br \/>\nKhawaja , 2003.

The accusation of a desire to kill all Jews treats any critic of Israel, whether academic or terrorist, as an unjust enemy whose moral maxim makes peace impossible.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nE. This leads to Extinction. As great Carl Schmidt is, he is wrong. Constructing enemies as unjust breaks down the safeguards of sovereignty and law, Schmidt\u2019s construction of the enemy breaks down the law, which breaks down the concept of the friend. This throws humanity into total war without limits and creates an absolute threat to humanity.<br \/>\nMoreiras, Director of European Studies at Duke, 2k4 (Alberto, \u201cA God without Sovereignty.

This interpretation of Anti-Semitism, which has protected Israel from kritik has actually produced real anti-Semitism against not just Israel, but Jews more broadly.<br \/>\nFinklestein, 2005.
