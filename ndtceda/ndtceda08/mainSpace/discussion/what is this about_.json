The argument &quot;framework&quot; is usually meant to instruct the judge on how to evaluate evidence. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nSarah Spring, University of Iowa."},{"user":"support","created":"2009-06-22T09:58:35-07:00","body":"thanks for the explanation of the site and the term -- I was a high school and college policy debater myself and it is fun to find myself on one.  I don't recall the term &quot;framework&quot; from my time, but that doesn't mean we didn't use it.  I can see how my article could be a framework for this argument, and am amazed the students found such an obscure little article and came up with this application of what I was arguing in it.  I am quite flattered, actually, as well as curious how they would ever have found it!  All we had when I debated was the library, rolls and rolls of microfilm of NYT and such, and our trusty file card boxes and legal pads.  Can't even imagine what it would be like to be a debater now with the internet and computers as tools!"}]}
