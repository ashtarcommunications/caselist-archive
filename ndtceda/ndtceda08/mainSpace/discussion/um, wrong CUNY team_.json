CUNY BV would be the ones attending this tournament - they're on the GSU caselist as NYU BV (which if you knew anything about the aff, would explain a lot.)<br \/>\n<br \/>\nCUNY is part of the NYC Coalition.  We promise to post correctly today, but changes were being made.  It's a Miliken aff and most of GSU applies.","replies":[{"user":"support","created":"2006-11-10T22:14:59-08:00","body":"GSU info from NYU BV reposted here as well."}]}
