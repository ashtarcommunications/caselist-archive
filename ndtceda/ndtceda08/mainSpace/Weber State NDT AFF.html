<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You cannot make predictions or that they’re ever accurate</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ethical thinking and consequences are mutually exclusive with Christianity</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yoder ev- making predictions causes more violence</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our metaphysics is better than yours </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Risk assessments used to avoid hard outcomes are immoral- you shouldn’t bend to them</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>CP</strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Perm- do the plan and cp, no reason they’re mutually exclusive</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Williams evidence- always potential to use anything in a violent</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We can win the round on this defense</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We view the world in a way that allows us to understand animals</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our arguments are gateway issues to evaluating any of their criticisms </span><br />

Predictions and calculations are bad.<br />
A framework trick used is that they “defend instrumental affirmation, but not the consequences of the plan” and they defend “free fiat” (imagine what might not be)<br />
They list several positions their AFF still allows ground for which includes: Heidegger, Deleuze, and other philosophers that criticize faith<br />

 <br />
<strong>We begin observation one: CAFO's, Idolatry, and God's Creation</strong><br />
<br />
Current politcal discussions about agriculture take place in a world framed and defined by human power. Agricultural products, naturally occurring parts of creations, are reframed as another cog inthe machine of human manufacture where raw materials are converted into processed goods by humans for their own consumption<br />
<br />
Brewer in 2007 (Joe [staff, Rockridge Institutef] &quot;The frame, The farm, The harm&quot;, July 27, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rockridgenation.org/blog/archive/2007/07/27the-frame-the-farm-and-the-harm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rockridgenation.org/blog/archive/2007/07/27the-frame-the-farm-and-the-harm</a>)<br />
<br />
Members of Congress are drawing battle lines ... impacts on commodities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And the subsidization of CAFO's is emblematic of the results of human freedom from God's covanent. Farms are transformed into sunless hells filled with miserable, violent and traumatized animals awaiting a mechanical death. Subsidies are crucial to htis, providing the underlying economic possibility for the new science of raising livestock.</strong><br />
<br />
Scully in 2006 (Matthew [FMR Advisor Gov. of Arizona] &quot; A sunless Hell&quot; The Arizona Republic, Febuary 19, 2006)<br />
<br />
Basically, pork producers ... the subsidies coming.<br />
<br />
<strong>And, this reduction of animals to the status of mere commodity disorts our vision of the world, banishing God's grace and denying the goodness of creation. Everything that lives eats, showing us both the gratuity of God's gift and our interdependence with the world, but when food becomes only a cheap commodity we lose sight of the sacredness of creation replaceing it with ta profane vision of the world as something to be wasted and consumed.</strong><br />
Wirzba in 2008 (Norman, [Prof of Theology @ Duke] After Modernity? Secularism, Globalization, and Re-Enchantment of the World: Agrarian after modernity - an opening for grace, Edited by James K. A. Smith)<br />
Moreover, agrarianism also ... grace at mealtime.<br />
<br />
<strong>And this profane view litterally empties the world of meaning. Creation is transformed into a utilitarian and scientific &quot;nature&quot; that exist only to be exploited and used. We'll isolate two impacts to this:<br />
First, this framing of the world banishes ourability to see God's care for and involvement in the world. IN the absence of his saving hope, the world appears flawed and humans turn to the ancient history of Gnosticism, seeking the destruction of the world to escape its suffering.<br />
Second, ther simply is no ethical or moral value within the idolatrous mindset of technocratic utilititarianism. The world without God is just Lions eithing their cubs, the holocaust and death.</strong><br />
<br />
Wirzba in 2008 (Norman, [Prof of Theology @ Duke] After Modernity? Secularism, Globalization, and Re-Enchantment of the World: Agrarian after modernity - an opening for grace, Edited by James K. A. Smith)<br />
<br />
The pratical and ecological implications ... life of God at work.<br />
<br />
Now, Observation Two: Our Hope in God's Providence<br />
<br />
We praise God's mercy and the creation that he has given us. IN the same way that Mary prayed the Magnificat, fortelling God's mercy and compassion, especially for the most powerless, we present the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce it agricultural support by eliminating all domestic direct and indirect agricultural subsidies for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations. Funding and enforcement guaranteed.<br />
<strong>And, we also believe that our action here, our affirmation has as much political importance as some game where we imagine the technological and bureaucratic results of plan's passage. We offer it up to God trusting that he will reverse the injustices and suffering of this world.</strong><br />
<br />
Jones in 2004 (Patricia [Director of C AFOD a Catholic Aid Agency] &quot;Turning the World Upside Down&quot; May 9, 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ely.anglican.org/parishes/camgsm/sermons/S2004e/pj1_sermon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ely.anglican.org/parishes/camgsm/sermons/S2004e/pj1_sermon.html</a>)<br />
<br />
We don't Campaign....in today's world<br />
<br />
<strong>And, this approach of Christian witness and hope in God's providence is the only way to navigate jthe inevitability of human violence toward each other and creation. The current responses either justify violence because of it's inevitability or feed into the false theology of human control and manufacture by believein gthat we can solve violence through a change in ideology or a comprehensive policy approach.</strong><br />
<br />
Williams in 2005 ( Scott [Prof Philo and Ethics @ Waynesbury College] <em>Christian Century</em>, May 31, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3215" rel="nofollow">http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=3215</a>)<br />
<br />
How are Christians...of the Kingdom<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Three is God's Providence and History</strong><br />
<br />
First, beofre the neg gets all worked up about whether we will defent the unstrumental implementation of plan, the answer is yes, you'll get all your links. The question of instumental outcomes or whether plain is literally enacted due to our advocacy is different. Views of history that assume that humans simply grab ahold of historical processes and move the world towards what they want are fundamentally flawed, ev if you dont belive in God. Himans cannot predict history or dictate its events becuase the relationship of cause and effect isn't as simple, visible or manageable as the policemakers and debates assume it is. In fact, sunch attempts to force a certain historical outcome often ironically backfires, the Thousane Year Reich collapes in under 20 years. This is absolute defense to futuristi claims they may make.<br />
<br />
<strong>Yoder in 94 (</strong>John Hoard [ Prof of Theology @ Notre Dame] <em>The politics of Jesus)</em><br />
<br />
One way to...the outset about.<br />
<br />
<strong>And it is precisely the idea that history can be manipulated by human action suck as political and social campaign, that drive war and violence throughout the world because it fails to recognize the true promise of eternal glory as was guaranteed in the resurrection of Christ. Any attempt to change this only creates autonomous ethical values that justify all evil in the name of the decidedly good cause.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Yoder in 94 (</strong>John Hoard [ Prof of Theology @ Notre Dame] <em>The politics of Jesus)</em><br />
<br />
The vision of...or assured survival<br />
<br />
<strong>And, we acknowledge the aff is basked in the Christian practice of hope for the world based on God's gratutious creation of it and His providential control over history. We don't say subsidies shouls be repealed becuase the results would be good, but that they deny the goodness and autonomy of God and the world he created. Current practices deny this goodness by engaging in optimism instead of hope by believing that human actions are justifeid through predictin future events and avoiding the bad ones. This destroys history, making it only the constant repetition of what we desire it to be rather than being what it is, NEW, UNPREDICTABLE AND UNSEEN</strong><br />
<br />
Mathewes in 2007 (Charles T [ Assc. Prof of Religion @ Univ. of Virginia] A Theology of Public LIfe)<br />
<br />
We begin by...help us resist<br />
<br />
<strong>And, the offensive impact: Without hope in God's revelation of a truly new history and justice we fall into a hopelesness beyond despair or suffering. Faces with the impotence or our ability to eradicate evil, we engage in constant meaningless brutality and violence. The worst effect of despair is not this plague of violence, but also our utter indifference to it. Suffering becomes purely abstract and meaningless. After all, who cares who dies in Africa, in South America, in Baltimore or even on my block? It doesn't effect me, so it doesn't matter.</strong><br />
