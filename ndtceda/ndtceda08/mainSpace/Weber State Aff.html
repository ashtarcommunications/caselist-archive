Women are brutally killed and beaten because of their gender.<br />

Journal of Hate Studies. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web02.gonzaga.edu/againsthate/Journal2/GHS101.PDF" rel="nofollow">http://web02.gonzaga.edu/againsthate/Journal2/GHS101.PDF</a> Accessed 07 Aug 2006.<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision serves as a symbol that the Court will not act to prevent gender-based violence. Even if VAWA’s wouldn’t have worked, it would have been an important victory for women.<br />
Alberto B. Lopez in 2001. “Forty Yeas and Five Nays – The Nays Have it: Morrison’s Blurred Political Accountability and the Defeat of the Civil Rights Provision of the Violence Against Women Act” The George Washington Law Review 69 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 251, February, 2001.<br />

State based remedies fail to combat gender based violence, federal remedies are needed to fill the gap.<br />
Yvette J. Mabbun in 1997. “Title III of the Violence Against Women Act: The Answer to Domestic Violence or a Constitutional Time-bomb?” St. Mary’s Law Journal 1997.<br />
<br />

The State’s lack of redress is rooted in militarism and is the sole cause of violence.<br />

Overturning Morrison is a pivotal move in combating violence against women, it will send a strong signal against gender motivated violence.<br />
Meredith Takahashi in 2002 “Violence Against Women Act: A Vehicle for Lasting Social Change, or An Incomplete Assessment of the Societal Ailment of Gender Motivated Violence?” Journal of Law &amp; Social Challenges 2002<br />

Public denial and privatization of domestic violence has lead to the oppression of women. VAWA is a necessary first step in reinvigorating a feminist movement and putting a spotlight on violence.<br />

We make the presence of militarism visible, this is critical to resisting violence<br />
Chris J. Cuomo in 1996 War is not just an Event: Reflections on the significance of everyday Violence Hypatia Vol.11 no. 4 Fall 1996.<br />
<br />
Only by looking at the unequal social structures instantiate by the court can we hope to reverse militarism and prevent war.<br />
