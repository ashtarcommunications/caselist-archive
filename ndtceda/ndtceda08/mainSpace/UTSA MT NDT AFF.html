(The full citations for the cards are not up yet, but I'll fix that shortly.)<br />
<br />
Modern civilization's ability to function relies on its ability rationally determine what is considered best for society. This mentality is deeply ingrained within nearly every thought and action that we take, whether we realize it or not. The development of agricultural production is the epitome of this – food production has been consolidated within industrial farms in order to create massive food stocks for the future.<br />
<br />
Thus modern society developed the practice of monoculture. Farmers stopped growing a different types of commodities and switched to a model that emphasized continual forward progress and efficiency. Every crop within a monocultured farm is exactly the same – all are produced from the same genetic strain in order to maintain a predictable stability. Monoculture requires intense control of all aspects of life. Fields are planted in such a way as to produce maximum output. Control is kept through uniform growing requirements in order to standardize all aspects of crop life. Crops are sectioned off into compartmentalized vectors to prevent interaction between any of the organisms.<br />
<br />
This top down control and sanitization parallels the way society is treated. Our heteronormative government is the farmer, while every living being under its control is viewed in terms of its contribution to a productive future. These hegemonic structures look upon American soil and identify individuals that stand outside the idealistic genetic makeup of a productive citizen – these differences are broken up by identities that include race, sex, class, gender, age, and others. These constructions are created and understood to be flaws to the societal whole.<br />
<br />
This productive futurism relies on oppressive hetero-culture in order to continue its power. The future is the carrot held on the stick in front of us as we are continually denied any true societal change. Future goals are used as a destructive tool for heteronormativity to justify the elimination of queer populations to achieve those future goals. However, the future we desire is always outside of our grasp - it is merely a fantasy to coerce people to constantly maintain the controllable present.<br />
<br />
Giffney 08 “Queering the Non/Human” GBR: Ashgate Publishing.<br />
“Reproductive futurism imposes…to its ideals.”<br />
<br />
But this linear understanding of time is a heteronormative concept. While queer communities are forced to work towards it, they are incapable of experiencing that outlook. For the queer, there is no future – queer sexuality, explicitly denies the reproductive outlook because there simply is no place for it. The queer cannot understand the ideal stable future that is so desired by heternormativity – queerness knows that there is no such thing as stability and that life, identity, our bodies and our world are fluctuating parts of infinite possibilities.<br />

“This book makes…reproduction, and death.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This heteronormative thought is one that creates and establishes an invisible center – one that is definable and sanitary. This center is subconsciously desired and worked towards, but always kept from our grasp. This construction of producing and reproducing standards for rationality, desirability, and superiority becomes the primary instrument for power and violence. Modern day society relies upon this unspoken rule in order to legitimize its decisions and rationalistic scenarios. Our institutions and theories of understanding are backed by a force that creates and sustains the systemic marginalization of the abnormal.<br />
<br />
Yep 03 “The violence of heternormativity in communication<br />
<br />
Therefore, we affirm a queer counter public in opposition to the dominant agricultural discourse of heteronormativity.<br />
<br />
The heteronormative temporality is founded on its ability to perceive time as a striaght line. Within this debate round, we are faced with the question of the resolution. Should the USFG eliminate its support for some agricultural commodities? Our options are limited to either a conservative approach that attempts to recall the past, or a progressive approach that pushes for a new future. In response to these options, we affirm a queer counterpublic. A queer counterpublic is a communal group that operates outside of THE public. THE public is a social totality – one that is organized around dominant group structures. This public seeks to define and normalize publics around itself and thus control them. Agriculture has many of these publics, but by far the most dominant is the aspect of hetero-normative futurism.<br />
<br />
Warner 05[ Public and Counterpublics. Zone Books New York.]<br />
“several senses of the noun…visibility and common action”<br />
<br />
<br />
This counter-public is one where no one is forced into the closet, and thus does away with there inherent hetero-normative cover up of THE public. The usage of public discourse is to gain support for the counter public. This is critical in recognizing within ourselves the potential to challenge hierarchies. The counter public is not just the ability to have a place for ourselves to be free – it is a group that supplies different ways of imagining stronger social ability.<br />
<br />
Dominant publics are ones that seek to normalize and define the scope of universality and rationality. Counter publics are spaces which the poeisis of these scense is transformed. A queer counter publics can operate in anyway that disturbs the thoughts of THE public. In order for agency to be taken seriously, we must inhabit this new worldview by devoting attention to it. It may be difficult to see what this world would look like, but it is a question of diffusing the role for state based thinking. If the state is seen as a mandatory and desired force, the counter public loses focus and any hope for transformation.<br />
<br />
Warner 05 same cite<br />
“within a gay…public life itself.”<br />
<br />
<br />
A queer adjustment to the way we consider time is critical. Queer time embraces the models of temporality that break down models of time that break down societal binaries. The queer counter public is the critical site for new temporal understandings.<br />
