Plan: The United States federal government should condition its assistance to the Palestinian Authority on the assistance not being for the purpose of regime change activities targeted at the elected Palestinian Authority. The United Stated Federal Government should invite the elected Palestinian Authority to participate in the November Middle East peace conference. The conference should be used to renew the Palestinian power sharing agreement.<br />
