Topicality – overrule includes overrule the holding<br />
Overruling a decision requires overruling the holdings as well as the judgment<br />
Lieberman, 1999 (A Practical Companion to the Constitution, p. 338)<br />
Overruling: When the Supreme Court declines to follow ... in that case.<br />
Enemy combatant status was not a holding of Quirin. The aff is not topical.<br />
Woolman, 2005 (Enemy Combatants: The Legal origins of the Term “Enemy Combatant” Do not support its present day use, 7 J. L. &amp; Soc. Challenges 145)<br />
The term “enemy combatant” first appears in the ex parte ... of the term “enemy combatant.”<br />
Quirin didn’t decide an issue of enemy combatant status. Casey proves this was not an overrule<br />

Counterplan – Amendment<br />
Solves without overruling<br />
Vermeule 2004<br />
CP solves the case.<br />
Denning and Vile, 2002 (November, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 247, ln)<br />
And what about the Fourteenth ... such an ideal prevail?<br />
Constitutional amendments can overturn Supreme Court decisions.<br />
Vermuele, 2004<br />
<br />
THEORY<br />
1. Legal precision and education<br />
A. Denning and Vile evidence from the 1NC proves the counterplan is one of two ways to overrule a Supreme Court decision.<br />
B. Solvency advocates exist and conclude neg.<br />
Denning, 1997 (65 Tenn. L. Rev. 155, ln, Brannon P)<br />
Because the amending process ... one is ever called.<br />
C. The affirmative attempts to wish away an essential debate that is occurring in the literature between judicial self-correction and congressional amendments to reverse decisions. This is a debate that we will never have an opportunity to have on other topics because they don’t deal with constitutional interpretations.<br />
Bryant, 2003 (26 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 501, Spring, ln)<br />
No doubt these recent invocations ... our constitutional order.<br />
2. Negative flexibility – it’s particularly important at the NDT where teams are more likely to have new affirmatives or advantages that we don’t have time to research. The affirmative ahs infinite preparation to develop answers to the amendment CP whereas we can’t possibly predict what their aff will be.<br />
3. Topic specific education – testing the desirability of the Supreme Court is topic specific education. This isn’t a typical agent CP debate – having the Supreme Court as an actor in the resolution is particularly rare and requires counterplans to use Congress or the Executive. This is not a tribunals topic, it is a COURTS topic, which proves the necessity of the counterplan.<br />
4. Research skills – theoretical objections that don’t change throughout the year are bad for debate. They ecncourage laziness because instead of finding answers to a counterplan, you only go for theory. The NDT is the perfect forum for punishing laziness because it’s the last tournament of the year and requires a final thorough examination of the topic.<br />
5. Positively not object fiat – the object of the plan and resolution is a Supreme Court overrule – not a supreme cour tinterpretation of the Constitution. The counterplan doesn’t even fiat Supreme Court action. We do not fiat a particular court stance, only what the constitution says. Their ability to read ‘no enforcement arguments prove.<br />
6. Ground – because the counterplan isn’t object fiat, the aff can still utilize a number of offensive arguments. They can make arguments about how the amendment isn’t interpreted broadly or how the Court will not enforce it. Also, because it’s an agent counteprlan, they can win offense off of the importance of utiliziung the Court to overrule a decision or reasons why Congress is bad.<br />
7. Literature – there is a wade variety of literature – specifically wihtin the context of Quirin – acknowledging the power of an amendment. Here’s proof from an influential senator.<br />
McCain 2005 (Department of Defense Appropriates Act 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://shameful9.liberatedtext.org/0106McCain2.html(" rel="nofollow">http://shameful9.liberatedtext .org/0106McCain2.html(</a><br />
General Rives said if teh White House ... otherwise, lets live by it.<br />
Theory – our counteprlan is one of two legitimate ways to overrule a Supreme Cour tholding – tihs comparison is essential to understanding the distinction between Court and Congressional action<br />
Forsythe, and Presser, 2006 (10 Tex. Rev. Law &amp; Pol. 301<br />
Our constitutional system provides ... this tragic decision.<br />

AT: Racism ADV<br />
Turn legal decisions whitewash racism and can’t solve for the scoeital structures that create educational inequality.<br />
Stephen Halpern, 1995, <u>On the Limits of the Law</u> 11-13<br />
“In a major review article, Dorothy Strickland… every three black children now live and attend school.”<br />
Turn – legal language- legal discourse is tied to norms and stereotypes – use of these terms makes racism more insidious and provces that a court decision can’t initiate change.<br />
Halpern, same cite, page ix – xi<br />
“In translating asocial problem into the “language” of the law… to provide such understanding.”<br />
Turn – judicial action leads to backlash which leads to roll back and entrenches racism.<br />
Reva B. Siegal, 117 Harv. L. Rev. 1470, 2004 “Brown at Fifty: Equality Talk: Antisubordination and Anticlassification Values..”<br />
“As Part I of this article demonstrates.. brown declared racial segregation of public schools unconstitutional… or it will lack authority as law.”<br />
No solvency – overturning Milliken fails – the case is too entrenched<br />
Rahdert, prof of law @ Temple, 2004, 13 Temp. Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 785<br />
“Perhaps the most disturbing feature of this situation is that it has become a widely.. educationally for millions of African American children.”<br />
Turn – in-school segregation<br />
a. deseg leads to separation of students in school through other means, turning the case.<br />
Janet Eyler and Leslie Ward, 1983<br />
“Resegregation: Segregation within desegregated schools in in the consequences of desegregation”, p 126-7<br />
“Within-school resegregation refers to the separation… greater chance of classroom resegregation.<br />
b. this turns the case – in school backlash excludes and subordinates black children for life.<br />
Ware, 1999<br />
18 St. Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 465<br />
“The flaws of the Finger Plan and similar remedies… and standards were eroded.”<br />
AT: New advantage<br />
Turn Movements<br />
a. court-ordered deseg tradesoff with resources for political movements that arekey to solve the case.<br />
Bradley Joondeph 1999, 56 Wash &amp; Lee L. Rev. 169<br />
“Another potential cost in continuing court-ordered desegregation.. to protect the interests of minority groups. ..<br />
b. Political mobilization towards the other branches is k ey to slve the root cause of racial inequalities.<br />
Joondeph, same cite<br />
“A more fundamental advantages of political mobilization over litigation.. can tackle these problems directly.”<br />
Turn – assimilation – integrating schools results in multiple scenarios of cultural genocide – presumes that African American children need to be assimilated into white education and destroys African American institutions.<br />
Alicia Mioli 2000 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1903, August<br />
“This subsection describes how race consciousness applies to education issues. . to control and shape their children’s education.”<br />
Turn – Local Control – Milliken revitalizes participatory democracy through local communities – this is keyu to solve racial discrimination. Civil rights gains in the south prove our argument.<br />
Brown-Nagin 2000, 50 Duke L.J. 753<br />
“Participatory democracy: a historical rationale for a second look… the local level has been at least as important as litigation. “<br />
<br />
Turn – White Guilt – integrating schools assuages white guilt without causing real change – prevents actual solutions to racism.<br />
Joshua Lachs 1999 “The Legal Environment of School Desegregation Policy: Brown I – Milliken I” p. 22<br />
“Taken as a whole, school desegregation has gone little beyond racial mixing.. the great trade-off for societal integration.”<br />
AT: Callahan<br />
The outcome of the plan is most significant – the mere pursuit of “good” often generates evil by itself.<br />
Jeffrey C. Isaac 2002, “Ends, Means, and Politics” <u>Dissent</u> Spring<br />
“Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world… it promotes arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.”<br />
Right to life trumps other ethical claims<br />
George Kated 1992 <em>the inner ocean</em> p. 12<br />
“For the state to override – that is, sacrifice… wrong if they resist being sacrificed.”<br />
Extinction is the greatest of all crimes – outweighs all.<br />
Paul Watson, 1994<br />
[ “The politics of extinction,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wizard.net/~ethan/extinction.htm" rel="nofollow">__www.wizard.net/~ethan/extinctio n.htm__</a> ]<br />
“Gone forever are the European elephant… two words spell out each other in reverse.”<br />
Willingness to allow a greater number to die proves a complete disrespect for the importance of the value of each individual life.<br />
Wasserman and Strudler 2003, <em>Philosophy and Public Affairs</em> 31.1<br />
“We have argued that there is not yet an adequate nonconsequentialist account.. consequentialism in forced choices among lives.”<br />
<br />
Legal decision-makers must evaluate consequences – moral claims are subjective and not falsifiable<br />
Richard Posner 1999 <em>The Problemativs of Moral and Legal Theory</em> p. vii-x<br />
“My primary interest is the law.. by reference to the “real world” effects of constitutional criminal procedure.”<br />

A) The supreme court is likely to rule for Leegin and overrule Dr. Miles<br />
Boyle and Green 3/19/07, Legal Times, factiva<br />
“The supreme court will decide this term whether minimum… per se rule will continue. Recent history suggests it will.”<br />
Judicial overrules sap court capital and legitimacy<br />
John Yoo 2001, 68 U. Chi. L. Rew. 775<br />

D) overruling Dr. Miles in Leegin is key to business confidence and the overall US economy.<br />

“Bad law, like a bad habit, can be hard to break.. That’s good medicine for the economy as well.”<br />

Federal Rules CP<br />
Text The Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will amend Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to include a clarification that evidence of de jure segregation is not necessary in educational integration litigation. Enforcement through normal means.<br />
Federal Rules frequently amended to reverse the consequences of a Supreme Court decision<br />
Mullenix 2001, 69 Tenn. L. Rev. 97<br />
“The Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.. Supreme Cout’s holding in Schiavone v. Fortune, 477 U.S. 21 (1986).”<br />
Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure only requires an investigation of international discrimination – the counterplan expands the scope of discrimination to the same degree as the plan.<br />
Hugh Joseph Beard 1989, 49 La. L. Rev. 1239<br />
“The first supplemental determination is whether there has been intentional… discriminatory acts, that must be eliminated.”<br />
The CP solves the case, but avoids our net benefits. A change to federal rules is more than just a minor procedural change – it has DRAMATIC effects for society at large. Only the counterplan allows the Court to establish binding law in the same direction as the affirmative while avoiding the ‘judicial process’ of overruling a previous decision.<br />
Redish &amp; Amuluru 2006, 90 Minn. L. Rev. 1303,<br />
“To a certain porition of the populace, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure… come to consensus on the subject.”<br />
The Rules Enabling Act provides the Advisory Committee authority to propose rule chances for the federal judiciary – congress empirically goes along with these proposals. The result of the counterplan would be uniform acceptance of the new rule among all federal courts WITHOUT requiring an overrule because it’s not part of an actual court decision.<br />
Stempel 2001 52 Ala. L. Rev. 529<br />
“To appreciate the latest round of Proposed Amendments.. conform their conduct more closely to the Rules.”<br />

<em>AT: Perm</em><br />
1. Double-Bind: Either -<br />
a. the perm is intrinsic because it fiats the Court ruling on new Fed Rules of Evidence, which isn’t fiated in the plan or the CP OR<br />
b. The perm links to the DA because the Court has to overrule Milliken<br />
2. Even if they win the perm isn’t intrinisic it still links to the net benefit overruling requires an act of admitting that the Court was WRONG in the initial Milliken decision. This triggers our link.<br />
3. Severance – the perm doesn’t include an overrule because new grounds isn’t an overrule<br />
Meghan M. Peterson 2004, 37 Creighton L. Rev. 653<br />
“the court determined it could not resolve Lawrence… court’s decision on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”<br />
4. Overruling means the court admits error- this cripples legitimacy<br />

“During the course of the controversy over adoption.. requests to testify and are cancelled for lack of public interest.”<br />
The CP solves best – allows for public deliberation on the issue<br />

The CP doesn’t require the court to overrule or even have a decision – the Justices understand that their role is extremely limited which short circuits any link to the net benefit. The Advisory committee does all of the leg work.<br />
Griffin Terry 1995, 63 U. Cin. L. Rev. 869<br />
“the Advisory Committee has been primarily responsible for changes.. take in the rulemaking process if it is to take one.”<br />

Small business module:<br />
Dr. Miles per se rule destroy small businesses by creating perverse incentives for manufacturers to integrate vertically<br />
Thomas Leary 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nam.org/s_nam./bin.asp?CID=378&amp;DID=237826&amp;DOC=File.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://www.nam.org/s_nam./bin .asp?CID=378&amp;DID=237826&amp;DOC =File.pdf__</a><br />
“In fact, an outright agreement on resale price may not even have as great an effect.. to fostering the creation and maintenance of small businesses.”<br />
They’re key to the US economy<br />
Conroy 7/13/05 FDCH<br />
“The U.S. economy is dependent upon the initiation and growth of small businesses for its vitiality.. making small business the engine of economic growth.”<br />
Small businesses are THE reason for economic resiliency<br />
Sullivan 02 FDCH, l/n<br />
“The RFA, SBREFA and the Office of Advocacy exist because… a vital one for small business.”<br />
Invalidating the per se rule in Dr. Miles is key to reducing large costs on businesses and consumers.<br />
Englert 2006, “there is a consensus among lower courts, antitrust scholars, and economists that vertical.. imposes large costs on businesses and consumers alike.”<br />
Foreign Direct Investment is critical to the US economy – perception of economic decline means investor pullout.<br />
Mark Tran 2003, the Guardian<br />
“In plain English, America relies on the rest of the world to finance… dependence on foreign capital is set to increase.”<br />
Legal clarify is key to biz con. The outcome of the decision is irrelevant.<br />
Oesterle 2005, “Samuel Alito: A ‘Pro-Business’ Justice” 11-07<br />
“Support for the stories is found in selected cases decided by Alito among the 700 opinions.. Supreme Court business opinions that is pro-business.”<br />
Economic self-interest ensures manufacturers won’t skyrocket prices under resale price maintenance<br />
Angland 2/07<br />
“A common reason advanced for the rule of per se illegality… subject to the rule of reason”<br />
Overruling Dr. Miles results in better products and services – these benefits for the consumer are more substantial than price concerns.<br />
Meyers 3/14/07 The Oklahoman<br />
“What implications could there be for domestic manufacturers if the resale price rules were overturned.. for the consumer may be substantial.”<br />
Manufacturer-driven retail price management will be pro-consumer.<br />
Leary and McDavid 3/19/07<br />
“There is indeed a consensus that manufacturer-driven RPM.. than dealer-driven RPM.”<br />

A. Reproductive Freedom isn’t free<br />

Constitutional Amendment<br />
<br />
An amendment solves all of the benefits of a judicial decision, without the costs of violating precedent<br />
Vermeule ’04 (Adrian, Prof of Law @ The University of Chicago, “Constitutional Amendments and the Constitutional Common Law” September <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html</a>)<br />
These points, however, capture only one side of the ledger. Precedent, and the… constitutional rules should be changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
The CP solves– not likely to be reversed or challenged<br />
Vermeule ’04 (Adrian, Prof of Law @ The University of Chicago, “Constitutional Amendments and the Constitutional Common Law” September <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html</a>)<br />
A benefit of formal amendments, then, is to more… and refought at lower cost in subsequent periods.<br />
<br />
<br />
Constitutional amendments can overturn specific Supreme Court decisions<br />
<br />
Denning &amp; Vile ’02 (Brannon P, Assistant Prof of Law, Southern Illinois University School of Law; John R, Chair, Dept of Political Science @ Middle Tennessee State University; November, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 247 ln)<br />
Perhaps the most important function that the Article V amending process… application of ordinary political pressure.<br />
<br />
<br />
CP solves legal clarity best – it provides a stable environment for investments<br />
Vermeule ’04 (Adrian, Prof of Law @ The University of Chicago, “Constitutional Amendments and the Constitutional Common Law” September <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html</a>)<br />
It follows from these considerations that common-law constitutionalism… adjusted most recently by the 25th Amendment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
An amendment is a ‘transforming act’ for society and causes social change – 13th amendment proves<br />
<br />
Denning &amp; Vile ’02 (Brannon P, Assistant Prof of Law, Southern Illinois University School of Law; John R, Chair, Dept of Political Science @ Middle Tennessee State University; November, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 247 ln)<br />
By forever prohibiting slavery, the Thirteenth… does not recognize property in human beings.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Amendment process is key to publicizing the issue and sparking debate<br />
<br />
Denning &amp; Vile ’02 (Brannon P, Assistant Prof of Law, Southern Illinois University School of Law; John R, Chair, Dept of Political Science @ Middle Tennessee State University; November, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 247 ln)<br />
Proposals for constitutional amendment inevitably… then considered beyond the realm of human action. 134<br />
<br />
<br />
Non-Article V alterations of the Constitution’s meaning makes us incapable of discussing constitutional issues<br />
<br />
Denning ’97 (Brannon P, Research Associate &amp; Senior Fellow, Yale Law School JD; 65 Tenn. L. Rev. 155 ln)<br />
Non-Article V change can produce the same sort… sustaining a national discussion on important constitutional issues.<br />
<br />
Amendment is key to solve all future instances of discrimination – 14th amendment and overturning Dred proves<br />
<br />
Denning &amp; Vile ’02 (Brannon P, Assistant Prof of Law, Southern Illinois University School of Law; John R, Chair, Dept of Political Science @ Middle Tennessee State University; November, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 247 ln)<br />
And what about the Fourteenth Amendment? Did… and at what cost would such an idea prevail?<br />
<br />
Even absent immediate enforcement – amendments serve as a rallying point for long-term enforcement<br />
<br />
Denning &amp; Vile ’02 (Brannon P, Assistant Prof of Law, Southern Illinois University School of Law; John R, Chair, Dept of Political Science @ Middle Tennessee State University; November, 77 Tul. L. Rev. 247 ln)<br />
Not only is formal change not a necessary condition for altering the small… perhaps impossible, to establish without them. 105<br />
<br />
Don’t evaluate their ridiculous claims about Amendments being bad. The CP is only ONE AMENDMENT and doesn’t change the way law is enforced – the plan risks similar abuses by the judicial branch.<br />
Vermeule ’04 (Adrian, Prof of Law @ The University of Chicago, “Constitutional Amendments and the Constitutional Common Law” September <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html</a>)<br />
In Part II, the core of the paper, I argue that the generic case against… that form it loses its distinctive force.<br />
<br />
<br />
Precise amendments solve – no loss of credibility and it can overrule<br />
<br />
Gonzalez ’02 (Jose Julian Alvarez, Prof of Law, University of Puerto Rico School of Law; 71 Rev. Jur. U.P.R. 1 ln)<br />
It also has been suggested that it is not wise to use… exercise greater caution in future interpretations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Specific interpretations of Constitutional law are inevitable – incorporating them into the Constitution is key to stable application in a complex world<br />
<br />
Vermeule ’04 (Adrian, Prof of Law @ The University of Chicago, “Constitutional Amendments and the Constitutional Common Law” September <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html</a>)<br />
Another idea is that amendments, at least detailed as opposed… amendment process to the adjudicative process.<br />
<br />
Not responsive – the alternative of judicial re-interpretation is WORSE for constitutional stability<br />
Vermeule ’04 (Adrian, Prof of Law @ The University of Chicago, “Constitutional Amendments and the Constitutional Common Law” September <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html</a>)<br />
This argument is the clearest statement of a view that I take to be widespread… institutional performance the generic case takes to be valuable.<br />
<br />
The CP is key to respect for the Constitution<br />
<br />
Denning ’97 (Brannon P, Research Associate &amp; Senior Fellow, Yale Law School JD; 65 Tenn. L. Rev. 155 ln)<br />
An obvious weakness of informal constitutional change… President every time he exercises power as commander-in-chief.<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan is worse – the constitution doesn’t say anything about judicial review. The Court’s stole it.<br />
<br />
Denning ’97 (Brannon P, Research Associate &amp; Senior Fellow, Yale Law School JD; 65 Tenn. L. Rev. 155 ln)<br />
Though change effected through custom and usage can be quite momentous… has no basis for the exercise of that power.<br />
<br />
No impact to politicizing the Constitution. It’s already politicized and frequent judicial interpretation falls trap to the same logic<br />
<br />
Vermeule ’04 (Adrian, Prof of Law @ The University of Chicago, “Constitutional Amendments and the Constitutional Common Law” September <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/academics/publiclaw/index.html</a>)<br />
An initial reaction is that any slogan of this sort is puzzling… against which the proposals have arisen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shame K<br />
<br />
The Affirmatives reliance on Supreme Court action as the primary means of solving the harms of the 1AC represents an abdication of personal responsibility in an effort to shift blame to the federal government, rather than acknowledging our own personal obligations. This clouds the understanding of our own role in violence, guaranteeing replication of the harms of the 1AC.<br />
<br />
Kappeler 1995 [ Susanne. Associate Professor at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Al-Akhawayn University The Will to Violence ] Pp. 10-11<br />
`We are the war' does not mean that the responsibility for a war is shared… there is no such thing as not acting or doing nothing.<br />
<br />
This lack of personal responsibility precludes the possibility of SHAME, which is essential to understanding and pursuing a sustainable relationship with the other, while sustaining the constitution of our own Being.<br />
<br />
Murphy 2004. [Ann is currently a New South Global Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Philosophy at the University of New South Wales. She received her PhD from the University of Memphis, where she wrote her dissertation on the relationship between ethics and politics in Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Foucault. “The Political Significance of Shame” Borderlands e-journal. Vol. 3 No. 1, 2004. www.borderlandsejournal.adelaide.edu]<br />
What emerges from the discussion of shame in Levinas is the ahistoricism of his account… rather that we cannot be responsible enough.<br />
<br />
Loss of Being obliterates the value of life and is a fate worse than nuclear annihilation<br />
<br />
Zimmerman 94 [ Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University Michael E., Contesting earth’s future, p. 119-120]<br />
<br />
Heidegger asserted that human self-assertion, combined with the eclipse… somehow lessened because they were never “disclosed” by humanity.
