The 1NC begins with a prayer to Allah, then proceeds to explain how the affirmative’s betrayal of the Qu’ran damns them to hellfire and how Allah will remove us from the earth and replace us with another people.<br />
Their advocacy is text: we will consult Allah.<br />

2NC:<br />
The 2NC reads links to an identity politics criticism from ideas such as realism and borders and claims that these ideas reinforce western objectives and reify the colonial frame that is the root cause of the affirmative.<br />
