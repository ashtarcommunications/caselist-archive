<strong><em>1AC Plan Text</em></strong> (transcribe exactly)<strong><em>:</em> The United States federal government should substantially reduce its agricultural support by eliminating domestic subsidies for cotton.</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong><em>1AC cites</em></strong> (if not already in the case list):<br />
Cotton subsidies are the root cause behind West African poverty (Gerson 2k7 “Cotton and Conscience” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/06/AR2007110601808_pf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/06/AR2007110601808_pf.html</a><br />
<br />
“Cotton provides an example…one of the clearest of those responsibilities”<br />
<br />
Qualified studies conclude—cutting cotton subsidies lifts West Africa out of poverty (Infozine 2k7 “Reform of US Cotton Subsidies Could Feed, Educate Millions in Poor West African Countries,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/23736" rel="nofollow">http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/23736</a><br />
<br />
“Substantial reform of American cotton subsidies…out of poverty through farming and fair trade.”<br />
<br />
Cotton trading is the key internal link. Absent the increasing exports that would result from a reduction in U.S. subsidies Africa will continue to be locked out of global markets<br />
Toure &amp; Compaore 2k3 (“Your Farm Subsidies are Strangling Us,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EFD8103DF932A25754C0A9659C8B63" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EFD8103DF932A25754C0A9659C8B63</a><br />
<br />
“After too many years of Africa’s…more valuable crops.”<br />
<br />
Increasing cotton exports is the best way to reduce Africa poverty especially in the short term<br />
International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development 2k3 (“Elimination of Cotton Subsidies: A Development Deliverable for Cancun,” #3, www.ictsd.org<br />
<br />
“In a low income economy where the majority…unequally divided within households.”<br />
<br />
U.S. Cotton subsidies fuel anti-American sentiment—this increases terrorist recruitment (Griswold et. Al 2k6, “Six Reasons to Kill Farm Subsidies and Trade Barriers” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/493" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/493</a>)<br />
(“The collective effect of American…exacerbate poverty in the developing world.”)<br />
<br />
<br />
Poverty makes terrorism more likely—increases recruitment<br />

“These various manifestations of terrorist violence…repressive internal security drives.”<br />
<br />
State failure leads to proliferation, terrorism, and rogue nations culminating in nuclear war<br />
The African Studies Centre et al 2k3 (“Failed and Collapsed States in the International System,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/sovereign/failed/2003/12failedcollapsedstates.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalpolicy.org/nations/sovereign/failed/2003/12failedcollapsedstates.pdf</a><br />
