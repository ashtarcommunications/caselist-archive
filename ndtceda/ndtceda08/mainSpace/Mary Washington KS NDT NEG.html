<br />
“At first glance...has little real value”<br />
<br />

Miller 7/15/02<br />
<br />
“With the right mix...defend against it”<br />
<br />
Colombia FTA Politics:<br />
A) Bush submitted Colombia-his gambit will pay off and it will pass now- but it will be close  and there's a small window<br />
Destler 3-24-08. latinbusinesschronicle.com/app/article.aspx?id=2202<br />

Burns 10-23-07<br />
<br />
“I have spoken...fully to the region”<br />
<br />
2) Latin American democracy is key to global democracy-failing in our own backyard would  signal democracy can't work anywhere<br />

A) The Navy LCS program was just barely approved- this is crucial to interdiction<br />
Peterson 3-10-08 Inside the Navy pg 3<br />
<br />
“The Pentagon remains...$460 million a piece.”<br />
<br />
B)<br />
1) LCS is key to military readiness- Navy will get the program now but its highly dependent on  global developments and geopolitical risk<br />
Mullen 3-28-7 “Hearing of the Defense Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee”<br />
Federal News Service, l/n<br />
<br />
“That plan...and our reset”<br />

<br />
Turn – high oil prices are key to the trade deficit<br />
<br />
AFP, 12/12/07 (“Record High oil prices, China widens US trade gap” l/n)<br />
<br />
The US trade deficit widened…of the widening gap in October.<br />
<br />
Reduction of the US deficit causes a global deflationary tailspin and econ collapse<br />
<br />
Michael Gordon, 2002 (“American trade deficits: good for the US”)<br />
<br />
More generally in IR terms…might lobby for trade protection.<br />
<br />
Deflation caused by rapid Chinese growth would cause a global depression<br />
<br />
Michael Roberts, 2002 (“Deflation and Depression” 10/23, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2002/10/2888.shtml%29" rel="nofollow">http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2002/10/2888.shtml)</a><br />

A2: Advantage 1 – Iran Strikes/Miscalc/War<br />
<br />
No war on Iran – recent events prove, multiple military checks – all warrants go neg<br />
<br />
William M Arkin, 3/1/08 (“Six signs the U.S. is not headed for war in Iran”)<br />
<br />
There are a couple of military adages…next president is likely to follow as well.<br />
<br />
Fallon is not key – other generals prevent a strike OR noone can prevent Bush from striking<br />
<br />
Fred Kaplan, 3/12/08 (“’Fox’ Fallon wasn’t hounded out” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2186456/%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2186456/)</a><br />
<br />
Fallon has publicly expressed…willing to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A2: Advantage 2 – Oil Investment<br />
<br />
Iran economy is doomed<br />
<br />
A. Macroeconomic challenges<br />
<br />
Elliot Hen-Toy, 2007 (“Understanding Iran’s New Authoritarianism” lexis)<br />
<br />
First, Iran faces…strains on economic progress.”<br />
<br />
B. Hydrocarbon economy – cannot sustain the economy and leads to corruption and dependence<br />
<br />
Elliot Hen-Toy, 2007 (“Understanding Iran’s New Authoritarianism” lexis)<br />
<br />
Second, the nature…lowered overall investment.<br />
<br />
C. Lack of political commitment<br />
<br />
Elliot Hen-Toy, 2007 (“Understanding Iran’s New Authoritarianism” lexis)<br />
<br />
Third, in addition…valuable know-how.<br />
<br />
Econ collapse is inevitable – cannot reverse trends<br />
<br />
Spengler, 5/30/07 (“Why Iran will fight, not compromise”)<br />
<br />
As a way of changing…not be able to stop them.<br />
<br />
US Sanctions have no impact on investment in Iran<br />
<br />
GAO, 1/16/08 (“Iran Sanctions: Impact in Furthering US Objectives is Unclear and Should be Reviewed”)<br />
<br />
Since 1987…sanctions began in December 2006.<br />
<br />
A2: Oil Shocks<br />
<br />
Oil shocks have no impact<br />
<br />
Gholz and Press, 4/5/07 (“Energy Alarmism: The Myths That Make Americans Worry about Oil”)<br />
<br />
In the five major oil…consumers to smooth risks”<br />
<br />
Oil is not key to the economy<br />
<br />
Taylor and Van Doren, 10/17/07 (“No need to fear oil shocks” l/n)<br />
<br />
Although oil prices hut…easily with oilprice shocks.<br />
<br />
Iran will keep prices high but not enough to cause shocks<br />
<br />
Washington Times, 5/10/06 (“Iran Standoff expected to drive up oil prices” l/n)<br />
<br />
“Iran knows sanctions…not spike to eye-popping levels”<br />
<br />
Oil not key to econ<br />
<br />
Michael Sivy, 10/19/07 (“$90 oil won’t kill the bull”<br />
<br />
For starters…support growth in this country.<br />
<br />
<br />
A2: Advantage 3 – Hegemony/SCO-Iran Balancing<br />
<br />
Heg decline doesn’t lead to war – today’s international order ensures peaceful incorporation of rivals – it’s easy to join and hard to overturn<br />
<br />
John Ikenberry, 2008 (Jan/Feb, “The rise of china and the future of the West” Foreign Affairs)<br />
<br />
But not all power transitions…authority over the global system.<br />
<br />
SCO balancing is impossible<br />
<br />
Stephen Brooks and William Wolfworth, 2005 (“hard times for soft balancing” International Security, lexis)<br />
<br />
A significant constraint…arms transfers to China.<br />
<br />
A2: US-Russia War<br />
<br />
N/U and No Impact – US-Russia war is inevitable – and we will trounce them before it escalates<br />
<br />
