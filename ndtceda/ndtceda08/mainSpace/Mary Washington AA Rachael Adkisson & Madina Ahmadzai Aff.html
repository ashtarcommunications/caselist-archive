Contention One—Food Security<br />
<br />
US biofuel subsidies are the key factor in creating a food security crisis – resulting in a protectionist backlash from civil unrest that will multiply the impacts of high food prices<br />

In the year since the publication of our article...stomachs and purses of the world's poor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Food insecurity will cause nearly 3 billion people to starve and massively entrench poverty<br />

The industry's growth has ...poverty and food security.<br />
<br />
<br />
This price spike guarantees famines resulting in starvation and death – even if the plan only slows down this price spike it solves and prevents massive social unrest<br />
Natsios, Former U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator, 5/14/2008<br />
[Andrew, &quot;Global Food Crisis,&quot; Lexis, Congressional Testimony]<br />
1. The locus of the potential...leads to starvation and death.<br />
<br />
<br />
No risk of a turn – High prices don’t help third world farmers – protectionist backlash checks the benefits of trade and it does nothing for the billions starving<br />

Third, higher grain prices are translating ...ethanol import tariff.<br />

<br />
Prioritize starvation impacts even if it leads to extinction<br />

Those who claim the relatively ...developmental alternative.<br />

<br />
This spike in food prices is sparking international unrest resulting in the worst violations of human dignity and a mass backlash sparking in international instability<br />

Around the world, rising...about 100 lives.<br />
<br />
<br />
Human dignity a priori outweighs – it’s a fate worse than death and is the root cause and justification for all modern evils<br />

Assuming we are able to predict ...powerful weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
This also makes disad impacts inevitable – international instability from food prices will trigger global conflict, disease spread, and economic, and political collapse<br />

As a result grain prices are the highest ...without historical precedent!<br />
<br />
<br />
Food shortages will escalate to trigger riots, starvation and even genocide<br />

The population-crash scenario...<br />
warming from the North Atlantic<br />
<br />
Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate all domestic subsidies for biofuels, eliminate the ethanol mandate, and eliminate the biofuel tariff<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two—Solvency <br />
<br />
US biofuels push is responsible for a 75% increase in food prices—diverts grain from food stocks, takes land out of food production, and sparks speculation <br />

President Bush has linked...<br />
driving prices up higher.<br />
<br />
Biofuels are the key lever – even if other factors are driving food prices, changing biofuel production is the only realistic policy that can change food prices<br />
Martin, NY Times staff writer, 5/15/2008<br />
[Andrew, &quot;Fuel Choices, Food Crises and Finger-Pointing,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/business/worldbusiness/15food.html?pagewanted=print</a>]<br />
Even if biofuels are ...pull the lever.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Ending subsidies will effectively turn this lever – cutting subsidies ends the ethanol craze<br />
