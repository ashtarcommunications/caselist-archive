Judge Tim O'Donnell<br />
Miami’s Negative<br />
<br />
T – Explicit<br />
A. Interpretation – Topical affirmatives have to specify the explicit overruling action in the plan<br />
Dunn, ’03 (Yale Law Journal)<br />
“This is not to confuse” and “prior case law suggests that it was.”<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Violation – the affirmative plan text fails to specify the explicit action and is thus an implicit overrule<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to vote negative.<br />
<br />
1. Education – our interpretation is crucial to prevent manipulation of the term overrule – only way to control the direction of the link to legal education<br />
Ogden, 85 Law Libr. J. 1<br />
“The correspondence between Greenleaf” and “accurate manner was a daunting task.”<br />
<br />
2. Ground – Without an explicity action the plan could be spun as inaction – unaffecting court legitimacy or precedent. Plus implicit overrules are negative ground, the only way to test if overrules should be explicit – this is our Dunn evidence above.<br />
<br />
3. Contextual Definitions – Bowers and Evans proves you have to explicitly overrule<br />
St. John’s Law Review, ’04 (Queer Eye for the Military Guy)<br />
“Two main cases from the background” and “this apparent inconsistency in his Evans dissent.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Schmitt K<br />
<br />
Politics is defineid by the friend/enemy distinction. The ability to make this distinction allows for times of peace and limitations of conflict while preserving the antagonism at the root of the human condition. The altnerative is perpetual war.<br />
Rasch, Theory, Culture, and Society, 17(6), 1-32<br />
Do we define ourselves by the enemies we make?<br />
“the apogee of civilization”<br />
<br />
You should frame others as enemies – the impact to our turn is the destruction of the political and unsurpassed violence on a global scale<br />
Rienhard, Towards a Political Theology<br />
“If the concept of the political is defined”<br />
“because the would be identifiable”<br />
<br />
Social norms do not exist separate from a declaration of sovereignty. Modern rationality’s calculation of means and ends is insufficient to give relative value to particular ends over others. The sovereign decision regarding the state of exception from outside the legal system is necessary to unify the populace behind a definitive norm and maintain political existence. The state provides a performative space from which to articulate these values<br />
Rasch, Theory Culture &amp; Society<br />
“consists of its ability to ‘determine the concrete situation”<br />
“we might go into previous states, we will never find in those states”<br />
<br />
The tension of potential death and war must be maintained to give value to political existence, unification behind a single sovereign is a precondition to the political which is integral to preserve values greater than life itself<br />
Vander Valk, Rockefeller College Review, 1, 2 “Decisions, Decisions: Carl Schmitt on Friends”<br />
“The possibility of death has a way of forcing individuals” and “forces us to adjudicate our values in light of the possibility of death.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The war on terror uniquely embodies Schmitt’s friend-enemy relations – the Patriot Act and Guantanamo Bay are the ultimate reflections of this<br />
Specter, “Perpetual War or Perpetual Peace?” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.politicaltheory.info/essays/specter.htm" rel="nofollow">www.politicaltheory.info/essays/specter.htm</a><br />
“The Bush administration” and “illegal detention of terrorist suspects”<br />
<br />
The discourse of the war on terror is key to enemy creation, it stands as one of the few remaining forums in our world<br />
Rienhard, ’04 (Towards a Political Theology) <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cjs.ucla.edu/Mellon/Towards_Theology.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.cjs.ucla.edu/Mellon/Towards_Theology.pdf</a><br />
“These lines, first published” and “to breathe life into the animus of the enemy”<br />
<br />
The clash of civilizations between Western Society and Islamic Fundamentalism is the greatest modern example of Schmitt’s friend-enemy dichotomy<br />
Manzoor, 04 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.algonet.se/~pmanzoor/CarlSchmitt.htm" rel="nofollow">www.algonet.se/~pmanzoor/CarlSchmitt.htm</a><br />

Against Quirin, we have read the same critique as MV (Enemy IdentificationGood), an Executive Order counterplan, and Presidential Powers Good(Hegemony, Soft Power)<br />
Foucault CritiqueGenerally, we argue that strategies of liberation through the court failbecause juridical power has been displaced with disciplinary power thatoperates in a bottom-up manner, not top-down.1NC Generic Cards1. Court production of knowledge has the power to impose and reproducesocial hierarchies in society.Brandwein, 1999 [Professor of Sociology and Government UT-Dallas,“Reconstructing Reconstruction: The Supreme Court and the Production ofHistorical Truth”, P. 196]2. Judges become the gatekeepers in the production of legitimate legalknowledge in this system.Campos, 1999 [Paul F., Professor University of Colorado School of Law,“Jurismana: The Madness of American Law, P ]3. Biopower -&gt; Extinction, Foucault from History in Sexuality Vol. 14. Alternative is to analyze the biopolitical fracture in Western liberalpolitics- Agamben 98’ from Homo Sacer in the intro pages.<br />
<br />
2NC Arguments1. Legal forums sacralize the victim of domestic violence in reproducingthe scenario which occurred, this process creates norms of “right” and“wrong”.Cobb, 1997 [Sara, Director of the Institute for Conflict Analysis andResolution (ICAR) at George Mason, “The Domestication of Violence inMediation”, Law &amp; Society Review Vol 31]<br />
2. Repressive power against sexuality does not lie within the law,juridical power has been displaced by biopower outside of legaljurisprudenceGammel, 1994 [Irene, professor of English and women's studies at theUniversity of Prince Edward Island , “Sexualizing Power in Naturalism:Theodore Dreiser and Frederick Philip Grove”, P. 34-35]<br />
GAY LIBERATION MOVEMENTS CANNOT RELY ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR RESISTANCE –SPECIFIC CRITIQUE IS NECESSARY.Halperin, 1997 [David M., professor of English language and literature atthe University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and honorary visiting professor inthe School of Sociology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney,St. Foucault,P24-25]<br />
IN-SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS OF MINORITY STUDENTS CREATE THEM AS BARE LIFE THATMUST BE POLICED DURING ITS VERY ‘INCLUSION’ IN THE LIBERAL EDUCATIONSYSTEM.Lewis, 2006 [Tyson, Doctoral Candidate at UCLA School of Education,Educational Theory Vol. 56]<br />
THEIR STRATEGY OF REFORMISM LEGITIMIZES THE CONDITIONS FOR SOCIALDOMINATION; ONLY SPECIFIC RESISTANCE TO POWER STRUCTURES CAN SOLVE.Halperin, 1997 [David M., professor of English language and literature atthe University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and honorary visiting professor inthe School of Sociology at the University of New South Wales in Sydney,St. Foucault, P. 55-56]<br />

Counterplan<br />
<br />
UNCONDITIONAL COUNTERPLAN, WHICH ALSO SERVES AS THE BASIS AS OUR ALTERNATIVE FOR OUR KRITIKS<br />
<br />
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE STATE ROLE IN SEGREGATION AND UPHOLD THE MILIKEN DECISION BY ESTABLISKING THE SOVEREIGNTY OF LOCAL CONTROL BASED ON ASSOCIATIONAL AND CULTURAL TIES, AND CLARIFYING THAT SUCH CONTROL IS NOT BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PRE-POLITICAL NATURE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.<br />
<br />
THE COURT SHALL ORDER ENORMOUS INCREASES IN REGIONAL AND FEDERAL FUNDING FOR LOCAL SCHOOLS BASED ON NEED, FULLY MEETING FUNDING REQUESTS FOR THOSE SCHOOLS.<br />
<br />
SOLVENCY<br />
THE CP USES THE SUPREME COURT SO WE CAPTURE THEIR CONCEPTUAL SPACE EXERCISING INSTITUTIONAL IMAGINATION – EVEN MORE THAN THEY DO AT THE COURT. WE CONCEDE THEIR SOLVENCY ARGUMENT BASED ON THEIR MCCANN EVIDENCE THAT THE COURT CREATES THE FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH THE REAL. WE FURTHER REJECT THE POLITICS OF PESSIMISM. ANY SOLVENCY ARGUMENTS THEY MAKE VS THE CP UNDERCUTS THEIR ENTIRE REPRESENTATION BY LINKING TO THEIR OWN INDICTMENT OF PESSIMISM.<br />
<br />
IN CONTRAST TO INTEGRATION – CULTURAL BASED DISTRICTS WOULD RADICALLY REJECT ASSIMILIST NOTIONS OF BECOMING A MEMBER OF AN IMPERIAL MASTER CULTURE, AND CULTURAL GENOCIDE.<br />
Richard Thompson Ford, Professor of Law, Stanford, Harvard Law Review 1994<br />
“But in this…genocide(of suicide)”<br />
<br />
WE LEGALLY NAME THE STAKES OF SEGREGATION AS WELL AS THEY DO. WE USE A VOCABULARY OF GOOD, HOPE, INFORMED BY THE FAILURE OF THE PAST INSTITUTIONAL FORMULATIONS. WE SOLVE THEIR WELCH EVIDENCE BETTER THAN THEY DO. WE’LL PROVE THAT INTEGRATED SCHOOLS – WHICH THEIR BOSTON GLOBE NARRATIVE IMPLICITLY CALLS FOR DO NOT SOLVE DISPOSABILITY OR ANTI – SUBORDINATION. THE AFFIRMATIVE DOES NOT LEARN FROM PAST INSTITUTIONAL FAILURES. THEY REPRODUCE FORCED SEGREGATION WITHIN SCHOOLS THROUGH CURRICULUM, TRACKING, DISCIPLINE AND NEGLECT OF CULTURE.<br />
NO PER SE VALUE TO INTEGRATION – WE SHOULD EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF POLICIES ON HELPING TO IMPROVE EDUCATION.<br />
Van Dempsey, Assistant Professor of Education, West Virginia University, Beyond Segregation, 1996 p 115-116<br />
“School desegregation was…at school desegregation.”<br />

Global governance is a new form of biopolitics – one that ensures endless killing must take place in the name of artificial security – Duffield 2004, no cite given<br />
“Biopolitics emerged with modernity…killing must operate”<br />
<br />
Impacts: Vote Neg – the 1AC is a self-fulfilling emergency based on global norms to justify biopolitics<br />

<strong>Morrison Kritik</strong><br />
Domestic Violence laws assume a battered women is white and upper class. The VAWA is a perfect example of constructing legal discourse around the social identity of the dominant class. Women of color are harmed by the inability to enter the dominant legal discourse and are trapped in victim-hood<br />

The alternative is to reconstruct domestic violence discourse into a multicultural view of battered women- this must turn away from the state view of domestic violence to allow localities to create the own community.<br />

K of Global Governance<br />
<br />
Global governance is a new form of biopolitics - one that ensures the endless killing must take place in the name of artificial security.<br />
<br />
Duffield ’04 “Danish Institute for International Studies”<br />
“Bio-politics emerged….now be examined.”<br />
<br />
Alternative: Vote negative – the 1ac is a self-fulfilling emergency based on global norms to justify global biopolitical interventions. The solvency and harms are repetitions of these errors and beliefs, instead you should endorese or alternative as a means of mediating these harms – reject global norms to permit localized resistance.<br />
<br />
C. Endorsing a framework that reveals and restrict the dissemination of disciplinary control through global governing structures effectively disrupts the growth of normalization<br />
