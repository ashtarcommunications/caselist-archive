The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States v. Morrison by holding that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights sufficiently amplifies Congressional authority to enact the civil rights remedy of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.<br />
<br />
First:<br />
US v. Morrison is the product of a logic of boundaries and jurisdiction – the institutional doctrines that justified the decision denied to victims of gendered violence recourse at the highest level – that of international law.<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon ‘2k Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135<br />
To the ear of violated … people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
This logic which condones and sanctions gendered violence extends through BOTH domestic AND international structures. The logic of the home as a private place is the same as the logic of state sovereignty as inviolable<br />
Catherine A. Mackinnon 2006, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School. [Are Women Human? And other international Dialogues p. 192-194]<br />
The denial of gender inequalities … committed against them.<br />
<br />
What’s more – the US refusal to incorporate international human rights law domestically is a POLITICAL CLAIM that supports and sanctions the logic of jurisdictional boundaries. Only interacting with and embracing the international human rights framing as it relates to gendered violence can provide an escape from this logic.<br />
Judith Resnik, Arthur Liman Professor of Law, Yale Law School. December, 2001<br />
Categorical federalism has appeal, … as this Essay was in press).<br />
<br />
<br />
There are three impacts:<br />
<br />
<h2 id="toc40"><a name="Morrison Aff-The first is domestic violence:"></a>The first is domestic violence:</h2>
The Morrison Decision did more than confine women to the home – it was a national decision which refused to recognize the nature of gendered violence – under the logic of the decision, domestic violence is not only tolerated, but SANCTIONED<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon ‘2k Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135<br />
The Morrison majority does not … problem and what does not.<br />
<br />
What’s more – responses on the state level by their very nature fail<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb ‘00 Associate Professor, Rutgers (102 W. Va L. Rev. 499)<br />
What was at stake … antidiscrimination standard.&quot; 315<br />
<br />
As a result of this logic, domestic violence is rampant in the United States – more than four people die a day. Countless more are battered and abused.<br />
National Organization of Women, 2006, Violence against Women in the United States, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.now.org/issues/violence/stats.html</a>, accessed 6-21-2006<br />
Murder. Every day four… a “pre-existing condition.”<br />
<br />
Descriptions of a “peaceful” status quo and impact comparisons prioritizing the harms of traditional “wars” ignore the ongoing war against women perpetuated by gendered violence – only the Aff’s acknowledgement of the public and political nature of supposedly private violence solves<br />
Amy Ray, US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 2-1997 American University Law Review<br />
Because, as currently constructed,…or in a concentration camp in a foreign country.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sacrificing human rights at the altar of economic and political concerns has fueled wars for a century – we need to stop letting politics trump rights if we are ever to have either justice or security<br />
Bassiouni ‘3 (M. Cherif, Spring, 35 Case W. Res. J. Int’l L. 191 p. 191-2)<br />
“At the end of the second world war…over more enduring human values”<br />
<br />
Additionally, the civil rights remedy in VAWA provides a CONCRETE and SUBSTANTIAL response to domestic violence.<br />
Caminker ‘2k, Law Prof. at U Michigan Law School, 2000 (Evan H., Private Remedies for Public Wrongs Under Section 5, 33 Loyola of Los Angeles Law Rev. 1351).<br />
With respect to prevention, … and remedy state wrongdoing.<br />
<br />
Don’t underestimate the impact of the remedy – a little more law goes a long way in combating domestic violence<br />
Robin West, Professor of Law, Georgetown, 2006 29 Harv. J.L. &amp; Gender 1<br />
If this is the sequence--from hurt… with a little more law.<br />
<br />
And the tort of the VAWA isn’t just compensatory – it’s part of an evolving tort tradition and is rather the social recognition of a problem<br />
Bender 98 (37 Washburn L.J. 249 p.251-4)<br />
“Many scholars during this last century….existing causes of action”<br />
Additionally -- overruling Morrison is necessary to achieve a national recognition of the right to be free of sexual violence, creating social change and substantive improvements in victim’s lives.<br />
<br />
Deborah M. Weissman, Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law, 9/01, 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081, p. 1157-9<br />
Any issue is considered …public values and concerns.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is an ethical obligation to support the plan: the courts must do everything within their power to stop gender violence<br />
Robin L. West, Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center, ’05, 17 Yale J.L. &amp; Feminism 385, lexis<br />
Here, then, is the heart of MacKinnon's …in practice, in the world of ideas and in our lives.<br />
The second impact is international human rights -<br />
<br />
The only real way the Morrison Court’s logic of arbitrary boundary construction can be challenged is by incorporating INTERNATIONAL human rights law domestically - The United States must recognize that international law enjoins on the federal government a positive obligation to combat gendered violence. Only this recognition can build an institutional and societal culture of human rights awareness and compliance that can solve global systemic violence and planetary extinction alike.<br />
Rhonda Copelon 99, Professor of Law and Director of the International Women's Human Rights Law Clinic at the City University of New York School of Law (3 N.Y. City L. Rev. 59) (brackets added)<br />
Although the UDHR [Universal Declaration … to bear on both domestic and foreign policy.<br />

The failure of the Morrison Court to view our international legal obligations as authorizing the VAWA damages the perception of the US and undercuts the effectiveness of US courts to act as a model for promoting rights<br />

The Supreme Court’s jurisprudence in Morrison will energize federalism challenges to the treaty power in the status quo – only the plan can set a clear precedent by which treaty implementing legislation like the VAWA supersedes the 10th amendment<br />

“The Rehnquist court’s federalism doctrine and…considerations of federalism theories”<br />

Relying on existing judicial precedent in this area is insufficient – absent Supreme Court authorization of Congressional implementation of the VAWA inevitable judicial intervention will micro-manage foreign policy and undermine international law<br />

“the argument for limitations would…framers put in place”<br />
<br />
The effects of this doctrinal confusion are not limited to the VAWA – the failure of the Supreme Court to reconcile Morrison’s contradiction with treaty power creates a chilling effect that supplies an ongoing impediment to adherence with international norms<br />

THE SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN US V. MORRISON GOES BEYOND SIMPLE LEGAL CATEGORIES TO ESTABLISHING A ZONE OUTSIDE THE LAW WHERE WOMEN CAN BE ABANDONED TO VIOLENCE. THIS DIVISION BETWEEN THE LOCAL AND NATIONAL REPRODUCES THE LINE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, AND CREATES INTERLOCKING SPHERES OF SOVEREIGN EXCEPTION THAT MAKES SUBJUGATION INEVITABLE. THE QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER THE CIVIL REMEDY IS GOOD OR BAD, BUT THE INSTITUTIONAL POWER RELATIONS THAT CAN DECLARE SUCH A LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL. THIS DECISION IS THE BASELINE FOR ALL POLITICAL STRUGGLES<br />

To the ear of violated women… half of its people by the other should survive.<br />
<br />
AND, THE MORRISON DECISION DID MORE THAN JUST CONFINE WOMEN TO THE HOME – IT WAS A NATIONAL DECISION WHICH REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE THE NATURE OF GENDERED VIOLENCE – UNDER THE LOGIC OF THE DECISION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS NOT ONLY TOLERATED, BUT SANCTIONED<br />

<br />
BUT THIS BLOODY LINE OF VIOLENCE IS NOT JUST DRAWN AROUND THE HOME, IT IS A LONG SUPER-BORDER THAT CUTS ITS WAY ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. THE LOGIC OF THE HOME AS A PRIVATE PLACE IS THE SAME AS THE LOGIC OF INVIOLABLE STATE SOVEREIGNTY<br />

OVERRULING MORRISON IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE A NATIONAL REJECTION OF THE COURT’S REFUSAL IN THE STATUS QUO TO RECOGNIZE CERTAIN SOCIAL SPHERES AND THE VIOLENCE THAT THEY PRODUCE.
