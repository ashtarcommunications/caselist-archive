Bombing Aff<br />
Current Plan Text:<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN<br />
A STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT THAT MANDATES A UNITED STATES POLICY OF ZERO<br />
INNOCENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN UNITED STATES MILITARY OPERATIONS IN<br />
AFGHANISTAN IN RETURN FOR TEMPORARY LEGAL PERMISSION TO OPERATE ON AFGHANI SOIL<br />
IN PURSUIT OF THE TALIBAN<br />
<strong>Russia Advantage</strong><br />
<br />
FIRST NOTE THAT RUSSIA IS ALREADY RESPONDING TO PERCEIVED ENCROACHMENTS ON ITS<br />
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE<br />

In August, Admiral Vladimir…Moscow calls its &quot;near abroad.&quot;<br />
<br />
A STATUS OF FORCE AGREEMENT TO ESTABLISH A MODEST NETWORK OF TEMPORARY BASING IN<br />
AFGHANISTAN IS CRITICAL TO U.S. POWER PROJECTION, DETERRENCE, AND CONTAINMENT<br />
STRATEGY<br />

Research)<br />
A similar logic applies …with friendly--and better yet, free--governments.<br />
<br />
AND, THE BRINK IS NOW- ABANDONING CENTRAL ASIA GREEN-LIGHTS RUSSIAN ADVENTURISM<br />
AND MAKES CONFLICT INEVITABLE<br />

It is deeply ironic that Russia can pursue… greater actual risk of terrorism.<br />
<br />
AND, RUSSIAN NEO-IMPERIALISM GUARANTEES NUCLEAR WAR- EVEN ABSENT IMPERIALISM,<br />
DEPENDENCE GUARANTEES ACCIDENTAL CONFLICT AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE<br />

Much is at stake in Eurasia for the…of influence in the southern CIS.<br />
ALSO NOTE THAT CENTRAL ASIA PRESENCE CRITICAL TO GLOBAL POWER PROJECTION<br />

But Central Asia is …China to the Middle East.<br />

GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR<br />

FINALLY, RELATIONS ARE SHOT NOW-MULTIPLE FACTORS<br />

U.S.-Russian relations have…norms in Russia more generally.<br />
GSU Pre-Tournament Disclosure<br />
<strong><u>CONTENTION ONE IS INHERENCY</u></strong><br />
<br />
FIRST, U.S. SPECIAL FORCES ARE RELYING ON HEAVY AIR FIRE AND BOMBING RAIDS IN TO CARRY OUT MISSIONS IN RESIDENTIAL CENTERS IN AFGHANISTAN, KILLING HUNDREDS OF AFGHANI CIVILIANS AND INFURIATING PRESIDENT KARZAI<br />
<strong>Faiez 2007</strong> (Rahim, June 24, &quot;Karzai fears backlash over civilian fatalities&quot;, The Star-Ledger, Lexis)<br />
<br />
AND, DESPITE REGULAR CALLS FROM KARZAI TO CEASE THE AIR RAIDS THE U.S. HAS CONTINUED TO UNITLATERALLY INCUR COLLATERAL DAMAGE<br />
<a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a> (May 2, &quot;Civilian casualties no longer acceptable, warns Karzai&quot;, Pajhwok Afghan News, Lexis)<br />
<strong><u>ADVANTAGE ONE IS KARZAI STABILITY</u></strong><br />
<br />
FIRST NOTE AFGHANISTAN IS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE-ONLY STRENGTHING THE KARZAI GOVERNMENT CAN SOLVE<br />
<strong>Los Angeles Times 2007</strong> (August 27, “Don’t fail Afghanistan”, Lexis)<br />
<br />
UNFORTUNATELY, U.S. LED AIR RAIDS ARE DEVASTATING TO KARZAI-PROTESTS AND CALLS FOR HIS RESIGNATION OVER CIVILIAN DEATHS ARE MOUNTING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY<br />
<strong>Hamdrad 2007</strong> (May 3, Special Correspondent, &quot;Karzai Says Civilian Toll Is No Longer Acceptable&quot;, The Washington Post, Lexis)<br />
<br />
AND, IT’S NOT JUST THE EXTREMISTS-ORDINARY CIVILIANS ARE STARTING TO PROTEST AGAINST U.S. AIR RAIDS, PROMPTING CALLS FOR KARZAI’S RESIGNATION DESTABILIZING HIS LEADERSHIP <strong>Kay 2007</strong> (May 5, member of the Institute for the Study of Society and Environment Steering Committee in the US&quot;US massacres of civilians spark protests in Afghanistan&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/may2007/afgh-m05.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/may2007/afgh-m05.shtml</a>)<br />
ADDITIONALLY, PARLIAMENT LEADERSHIP IS TURNING AGAINST KARZAI DUE INABIILTY TO STOP U.S. BOMBING RAIDS<br />
<strong>Inderfurth 2007</strong> (May 29, Prof @ the Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington and U.S. asst. secretary of state from 1997 to 2001, &quot;Losing the 'other war' in Afghanistan?&quot;, International Herald Tribune)<br />
<br />
AND, THE BRINK IS NOW-IF THE BOMBING CONTINUES MUCH LONGER ALL PRO-KARZAI SUPPORT WILL ERODE<br />
<strong>Achakzai 2007</strong> (May 4, &quot;More civilians killed in U.S.-led raid: Afghan official&quot;, Reuters, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0322060120070504?pageNumber=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0322060120070504?pageNumber=1</a>)<br />
<br />
KARZAI’S EVENTUAL LOSS OF LEADERSHIP OVER CIVILIAN DEATHS WILL SEND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY INTO COMPLETE COLLAPSE<br />
<strong>The Guardian 2002</strong> (February 19, &quot;Afghan staying power: Karzai needs friends he can count on&quot;, The Guardian Newspapers, Lexis)<br />
<br />
<br />
FINALLY, CENTRAL ASIAN INSTABILITY FROM AFGHANISTAN CREATES SECUIRTY COMPETITIONS THAT ESCALATE TO NUCLEAR WAR<br />
<strong>Starr</strong> <strong>2001</strong> (December 13, Chair of Central Asia-Caucasus Institute at John Hopkins University, “The War Against Terrorism and U.S. Bilateral Relations with the Nations of Central Asia,” Testimony before Senate Subcommittee on Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus)<br />
<br />
<strong><u>ADVANTAGE ­­TWO IS TALIBAN EXPANSION</u></strong><br />
<br />
FIRST NOTE, THE TALIBAN IS RESURGING NOW-THEIR CONTINUED GROWTH, FUELED BY ANTI-AMERICAN RECRUITMENT, DOOMS ANY CHANCE OF AFGHAN STABILITY<br />
<strong>Senlis Council 2006</strong> (Spring/Summer, International Global Policy Think-tank, &quot;Afghanistan Five Years Later: The Return of the Taliban&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/014_publication/documents/5y_chapter_01" rel="nofollow">http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/publications/014_publication/documents/5y_chapter_01</a>)<br />
<br />
AND, WE’LL ISOLATE FOUR INTERNAL LINKS<br />
<br />
FIRST IS COMMUNITY RELATIONS:<br />
THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES CAUSED BY U.S. AIR-STRIKES BENEFIT THE TALIBAN-IT IS THEIR BEST FORM OF PROPOGANDA, TURNING THE PUBLIC IN FAVOR OF RADICAL TALIBAN VIOLECNE<br />
<strong>Senlis Council 2006</strong> (December 14, &quot;The Taliban are winning the hearts and minds in Southern Afghanistan&quot;, The Senlis Council, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/media_centre/news_releases/76_news" rel="nofollow">http://www.senliscouncil.net/modules/media_centre/news_releases/76_news</a>)<br />
<br />
BOMBING RAIDS <em>FORCE</em> CIVILIANS TO SUPPORT THE TALIBAN IN ORDER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES<br />
<strong>Bayani 2007</strong> (August 9, &quot;Afghanistan: Reconstruction can help win war against Taliban&quot;, Killid Group Analyst, Inter Press News Service)<br />
<br />
SECOND IS RECRUITMENT: CIVILIAN DEATHS IN AIR STRIKES ARE GIVING ENTIRE REGIONS TO THE TALIBAN VIA BOOSTED RECRUITMENT <strong>Johnson 2007</strong> (Thomas H., Research Prof of the Dept. of National Security Affairs @ the Naval Postgraduate School, &quot;On the Edge of the Big Muddy: The Taliban Resurgence in Afghanistan&quot;, China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly, Vol 5 No. 2)<br />
AND, U.S. BOMBING IS THE TALIBAN’S MOST EFFECTIVE RECRUITING TOOL, FUELING THEIR RAPID EXPANSION <strong>Foxley 2007</strong> (June, analyst with the British Ministry of Defense, &quot;The Taliban's propaganda activities: how well is the Afghan insurgency communicating and what is it saying?&quot;, SIPRI project paper)<br />
THIRD IS PERMANENT BASE OF OPERATIONS:<br />
LOCAL RECRUITMENT IS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO FOR TALIBAN RESURGENCE VIA ESTABLISHING A PERMANENT BASE OF OPERATIONS<br />
<strong>Jones 2007</strong> (Seth Jones, phd, university of Chicago, political science 1/31, “Afghans local insurgency,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rand.org/commentary/013107IHT.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rand.org/commentary/013107IHT.html</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, ALLOWING THE TALIBAN TO ESTABLISH A PERMANENT BASE OF OPS IN AFGHANISTAN WOULD BE REALLY BAD-THEY’LL LAUNCH NEW ATTACKS IN THE REGION AND GLOBALLY<br />
<strong>Rubin 2007</strong> (Director of Studies and Senior Fellow at NYU Center on International Cooperation, January/February, &quot;Saving Afghanistan&quot;, Foreign Affairs, Online)<br />
<br />
FOUTH IS PARLIAMENTARY SUPPORT: AIR STRIKES ARE PUSHING THE AFGHANI PARLIAMENT TOWARDS THE TALIBAN, INSTITUTIONALIZING THEIR SUPPORT BASE <strong>Gall and Cloud 2007</strong> (May 10, &quot;Afghans Say U.S. Airstrikes Killed 21 Civilians&quot;, New York Times, Online)<br />
AND, THIS INSTABILITY FUELED BY THE TALIBANS GROWTH COUPLED WITH KARZAI’S UNPOPULARITY WILL SPILL OVER TO PAKISTAN ALLOWING RADICAL ELEMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO OVERTHROW MUSHARRAF<br />
<strong>The Nixon Center 2002</strong> (August 8, &quot;Afghanistan and Pakistan: Is the Glass Half Empty or Half Full?&quot;, The Nixon Center, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nixoncenter.org/Program%20Briefs/vol8no13Afghanistan.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nixoncenter.org/Program%20Briefs/vol8no13Afghanistan.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
AND, A MUSARRAF COUP WOULD PUT PAKISTAN’S NUCLEAR ARSENAL IN THE HANDS OF ISLAMIC RADICALS PROMPTING MULTIPLE SCENARIOS FOR INDIA LASH OUT AND NUCLEAR WAR<br />
<strong>Albright 2002</strong> (David, President and Founder of the Institute for Science and International Security, www.922investigations.net./IMG/pdf/doc-320.pdf)<br />
<br />
aDDITIONALLY, A musharraf coup would allow al queda to acquire wmd resulting in a nuclear attack<br />
<strong>Allison 2004</strong> (Graham, director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Prof of Government at Harvard, former assistance Sec. Of Defense for policy, <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>, p. 77-78)<br />
<br />
THAT IS REALLY BAD-THIS NUCLEAR ATTACK SPARKS FULL SCALE NUCLEAR RETALIATION AND WORLD WARS<br />
<strong>Speice 2006</strong> – 06 JD Candidate @ College of William and Mary [Patrick F. Speice, Jr., “NEGLIGENCE AND NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION: ELIMINATING THE CURRENT LIABILITY BARRIER TO BILATERAL U.S.-RUSSIAN NONPROLIFERATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS,” William &amp;amp; Mary Law Review, February 2006, 47 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 1427<br />
<br />
<strong><u>ADVANTAGE THREE IS NATO COHESION</u></strong><br />
FIRST, THE U.S. STRATEGY OF AIR RAIDS KILLING CIVILIANS IS STRAINING RELATIONS BETWEEN NATO PARTNERS AND UNDERMINING COOPERATION <strong>Associated Press 2007</strong> (May 24, &quot;NATO partner chide U.S. over civilian deaths&quot;, MSNBC Online)<br />
SPECIFICALLY, BRITAIN HAS SHARPLY CRITICIZED U.S. BOMBING TACTICS WHICH THREATEN TO UNDERMINE ALL NATO COOPERATION <strong>Gall 2007</strong> (August, &quot;British Criticize U.S. Air Attacks in Afghan Region&quot;, JUST International Movement for a Just World Newsletter, Online)<br />
AND, THIS INTERNAL DISAGREEMENT UNDERSCORES A WIDER LACK OF NATO COHESION CAUSED BY THE U.S. AIR RAIDS<br />
<strong>APS Diplomat Recorder 2007</strong> (May 26, &quot;Arab-US Relations-May 21-Bush Seeks More NATO Effort in Afghanistan&quot;)<br />
AND, AFGHANISTAN IS A LITMUS TEST FOR NATO-FAILURE DOOMS SHORT TERM COHESION AND LONG TERM EXISTENCE OF THE ALLIANCE <strong>Koenders 2006</strong> (Netherlands General Rapporteur, &quot;Afghanistan and the Future of the Alliance&quot;, NATO Parliamentary Assembly, 2006 Annual Session Publications)<br />
NATO COHESION IS KEY TO PREVENT MULTIPLE SCENARIOS FOR NUCLEAR WAR<br />
<strong>Duffield 1994 (</strong>John, Asst. Prof of Government and Foreign Affairs at @ the University of Virginia, Political Science Quarterly 109:5, p. 766-777)<br />
<br />
<strong><u>THUS THE PLAN:</u></strong><br />
<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN A STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT THAT MANDATES A UNITED STATES POLICY OF ZERO INNOCENT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN UNITED STATES MILITARY OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN<br />
<br />
<strong><u>CONTENTION TWO IS SOLVENCY</u></strong><br />
<br />
A PUBLICLY ISSUED STATUS OF FORCE AGREEMENT WITH AFGHANISTAN’S GOVERNMENT WOULD LIMIT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN AIR-STRIKES AND RESTORE PUBLIC FAITH IN KARZAI’S LEADERSHIP<br />
<strong>Inderfurth 2007</strong> (May 29, Prof @ the Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington and U.S. asst. secretary of state from 1997 to 2001, &quot;Losing the 'other war' in Afghanistan?&quot;, International Herald Tribune)<br />
<br />
THE U.S. MUST ISSUE A STATUS OF FORCES AGREEMENT WITH AFGHANISTAN TO STABILIZE KARZAI’S LEADERSTHIP AND LIMIT VIOLENCE<br />
<strong>Suhrke 2006</strong> (March 21-24, The Chr. Michelsen Institute, &quot;The Limits of Statebuilding: The Role of International Assistance in Afghanistan&quot;, Paper presented at the International Studies Association meeting March 21-24, ISA Paper)<br />
<br />
AND, ONLY A STATUS OF FORCE AGREEMENT WILL STOP FURTHER ANTI-KARZAI PROTESTS <strong>Rubin 2007</strong> (June 20, Barnet, acknowledged expert on the Afghanistan and speaker at IRIN about the challenges Afghanistan faces, &quot;Afghanistan: Interview with regional analyst Barnet Rubin&quot;, Relief Web Online)
