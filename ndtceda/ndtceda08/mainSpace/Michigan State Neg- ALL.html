Declaration Diplomacy CP<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government will issue a formal statement declaring its willingness to open diplomatic contact with Hamas if Hamas undertakes and enforces a full and complete cease-fire with Israel. In order to demonstrate their good faith, Hamas should release Gilad Shalit.<br />
<br />
The counterplan is competitive – it does not engage with the Palestinian authority, and it competes by net benefits – it doesn’t link to politics or appeasement.<br />

The problem, however …Hamas, not Washington.<br />
<br />
Hamas won’t make concessions and won’t implement any they do make – can’t control<br />
fringe factions or even more radical groups.<br />

(Daniel, “The Decision to begin talks with terrorists: Lessons for Policymakers,” Studies in Conflict and Terrorism,<br />
