Spending DA Vs. EU CP<br />
A. France is holding the line on spending to keep within pre set deficit limits, continued discipline is key to avoid massive inflation<br />
<br />
IHT, 9-14,7, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/14/business/EU-FIN-ECO-EU-Finance-Ministers-France.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/09/14/business/EU-FIN-ECO-EU-Finance-Ministers-France.php</a><br />
<br />
European Union finance chiefs on Friday applauded France for its economic reform plans but warned Paris it could not be lax about keeping its public finances in order.<br />
Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said the Euro Group of finance ministers, which he heads, commended French President Nicolas Sarkozy's structural reforms which cover &quot;a most impressive range of sectors&quot; and &quot;are moving in the right direction.&quot;<br />
However, he said the Euro Group reminded French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde that France has to be &quot;as disciplined as possible&quot; in lowering its budget deficit in tandem with its efforts to spark fresh growth through reforms.<br />
When it signed up to the euro, France promised along with other euro nations to keep its debt and deficit below a fixed limit. The pact was designed to stop euro nations running up deficits and triggering inflationary pressures.<br />
Sarkozy has said he will try to erase France's annual deficit by 2010 — a goal shared by the 13 nations that use the euro — but says he cannot guarantee it until 2012.<br />
B. France and Britain underwrite EU security operations, they would energetically fund the plan<br />
<br />
Breaking News, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://breakingnews.ie/2006/11/13/story284974.html" rel="nofollow">http://breakingnews.ie/2006/11/13/story284974.html</a><br />
Britain and France clashed today over the budget of the European armaments agency.<br />
<br />
London opted not to join a new EU defence research programme to develop high tech battlefield protection for European troops.<br />
<br />
The spat prevented an agreement on a three-year spending plan for the European Defence Agency. Instead, EU defence ministers were able only to adopt an annual budget for the body - €22.1m for 2007.<br />
<br />
Britain also decided to stay out of the agency's first major research project - a three-year plan to develop force protection technologies.<br />
<br />
Nineteen European nations signed up to the project today, agreeing to spend €54m on research in equipment such as body armour, sniper detection and secure communication.<br />
<br />
Britain argues it is already heavily engaged in research in such fields, using its experience in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
It fears joining the EU project would duplicate those efforts. However, the decision and its objections to higher longer-term spending for the armaments agency have triggered speculation that London's commitment to EU defence co-operation is waning.<br />
<br />
Such concerns were dismissed by Nick Witney, the head of the EU defence agency. &quot;I certainly do not interpret it as a general disenchantment,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
In a news conference, he hailed the agreement by the 18 EU members and Norway to pool research on force protection as a landmark for European defence efforts. France, Germany and Poland will be taking a lead in the three-year project.<br />
<br />
&quot;Europe needs to spend more and to spend more together,&quot; Witney said. &quot;This is a very substantial first step in that direction.&quot;<br />
<br />
He also announced that France, Sweden, Finland, Spain and Italy had agreed to invest up to €100m in research into new high-tech radios for the military.<br />
<br />
Britain and France are the European Union's biggest military powers and have taken a lead in pushing other members of the bloc to increase defence spending and boost cooperation to give the EU stronger forces.<br />
<br />
However, they have also frequently differed over the approach to Europe's defence, with Britain placing greater emphasis on Nato and ties with the United States, while France seeks to build up a more autonomous European military capacity.<br />
C. Deficits lead France to abandon the EU&quot;s stability and Growth Pact to evade sanctions, causing a break-down in fiscal discipline across Europe<br />
<br />
Euractiv, 10-9, 2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.euractiv.com/en/euro/french-refusal-cut-budget-deficit-new-blow-stability-growth-pact/article-113020" rel="nofollow">http://www.euractiv.com/en/euro/french-refusal-cut-budget-deficit-new-blow-stability-growth-pact/article-113020</a><br />
<br />
French Finance Minister Francis Mer rejected calls from his colleagues to cut the French budget deficit by 0.5 per cent in 2003 during the ECOFIN meeting of 8 October. The French refusal will bring new impetus to the debate whether a fundamental review of the Stability and Growth Pact is needed.<br />
he EU's finance ministers were faced on 8 October with a flat refusal by the French government to reduce its budget deficit by 0.5 per cent in 2003. Mr Mer, the French Finance Ministers, said that his country had other priorities such as boosting economic growth and raising military spending, and promised his colleagues that France will begin budget cuts only in 2004.<br />
<br />
The French refusal could lead to an early warning by the Commission and will result in new pressures to relax the budgetary discipline rules (the Stability and Growth pact) in the 12 eurozone countries. On 24 September, the Commission already took a first step to a loosening of the rules of the Stability and Growth pact when it decided that EU Member States will have an additional two years to balance their budgets (see<br />
EuropeaEun downturn causes nuclear war in Asia and Africa and guts CP solvency<br />
<br />
Brok, Chair of European Parlaiment Committee, of November 1999, Federal News Services<br />
A strong European Union, with its economic strength, its own currency, and a credible foreign policy backed up by genuine military capacities, will be a partner for U.S. needs. Our collective responsibilities are immense: we must help Russia to find a new equilibrium after the collapse of its empire; we must help the peace process in the Middle East; we must help overcome its tribal wars and tackle its problems of underdevelopment, finally we must make every endeavour to divert Asia from getting into a new arms race, above all when nuclear weapons are in play.<br />
<br />
Controlling European spending now and maintaing the SGP are key to preventing widespread European deficits collapsing the EU and the EURO<br />
Ubide, Angel Ubide is Director of Global Economics<br />
at Tudor Investment Corporation inEurope's world, 2006, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://europesworld.link.be/europesworld/PDFs/Issue3/EW3_2.2_Alphandery_Why_we_should_re-nationalise.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://europesworld.link.be/europesworld/PDFs/Issue3/EW3_2.2_Alphandery_Why_we_should_re-nationalise.pdf</a><br />
The stakes are even higher than they seem.<br />
A fully credible commitment to fiscal discipline<br />
would allow the ECB to adopt a looser<br />
monetary policy stance, and would provide the<br />
flexibility needed to offset the still high rigidity<br />
of European economies. Furthermore, if the<br />
next economic slowdown were to arrive before<br />
deficits have been drastically reduced in<br />
France, Germany and Italy, the SGP criteria<br />
would again be inadequate from a cyclical<br />
perspective, so any hope of serious fiscal<br />
discipline in Europe would finally vanish.<br />
With plenty of countries waiting in the EU<br />
sidelines, and being asked to adopt stringent<br />
convergence programmes, there is a high risk<br />
that some of these countries will weaken their<br />
discipline as well, putting the enlargement<br />
project in jeopardy, or that they will enter the<br />
euro and then follow the bad examples and<br />
abandon the disciplines altogether, further<br />
weakening the basis of the common currency.<br />
There are already doubts aplenty about<br />
Europe’s commitment to economic discipline,<br />
after the failures of the Lisbon Agenda and of<br />
the SGP. Now it is time for governments to<br />
take it seriously and put their legislation where<br />
their mouths are; their credibility reservoirs are<br />
empty.<br />
<br />
Deficits gut European growth<br />

Prodi, President of the European Commission, 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/04/388&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en" rel="nofollow">http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/04/388&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en</a><br />
<br />
The Economic and Monetary Union needs clear and effective rules to ensure<br />
stability and growth. The Stability and Growth Pact has been essential to bring EMU<br />
forward. It continues to be necessary for the stability of the euro and the health of<br />
the European economy.<br />
However, as I have stated on several occasions, the Union’s economic agenda has<br />
moved forward since the creation of the euro. Lisbon and the need to raise our<br />
growth potential are now at the centre of our economic policy considerations and<br />
this has to be clearly recognised in our coordination process. It is our duty to make<br />
sure that there is more coherence and coordination between the objectives we set in<br />
the Union for Lisbon and the objectives we set for stability. We have to make sure<br />
that both go hand in hand and that both deliver results.<br />
