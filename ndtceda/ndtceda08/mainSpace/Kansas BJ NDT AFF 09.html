Coaches and collective NOMO is a collective experience to challenge linguistic domination<br />
Culture as a resource to challenge dominant ideologies<br />
Agreement different then perform politics- this is the distinction between frameworks- not just methodology<br />
Language is a way in which to situate resistance<br />
Their arguments for intersectionality ignore agency and subjectivity<br />
Lauren Hill as an example<br />
Neg is a pre-req to any policy analysis- people need to engage in local resistance before global resistance<br />
Debaters should change their local spaces- this is what particular pedagogical practices within the activity should change<br />
They don’t make a root cause argument for white supremacy- the countries that they outline as being bad are majority white- this proves they are the normal power brokers. Patriarchy example<br />
People can self determine their own cultural identity and then create coalitions<br />
Fluidity of identity but recognizes it as a site of resistance.<br />
NOMO is an example of performance of humanity- culture and subjectivity<br />
Key to challenge these pedagogical practices in this way<br />
NOMO key to challenge </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PERMS- group them<br />
Incorporation of black bodies- this keeps the same antagonisms at bay<br />
