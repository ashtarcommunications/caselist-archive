The black/white paradigm erases Asian bodies from racial spectrum. This move by anti-racist liberals may seem to make the American Race debate less complicated, but the link of omission is a real exclusion that dismisses a history of discrimination to make an over simplified argument about American racial apartheid.<br />
Jean Shin, 2004 (Asian Law Journal, “The Asian American Closet”, May 1, Asian L.J lexis)<br />
<br />
For anti-racist liberals, the Asian. . .Asian Americans altogether<br />
<br />
Impacts<br />
1. Asian Americans are not less ethnic than other racial groups. This model minority stereotype treats Asian Americans as assimilated into white privilege effectively erasing the Asian body<br />
Jean Shin, 2004 (Asian Law Journal, “The Asian American Closet”, May 1, Asian L.J lexis)<br />
<br />
The perception of the excessive. . .into the white mainstream<br />
<br />
2. The model minority myth obscures the violent hate crimes and the very existence of racism against Asian Americans<br />
Jean Shin, 2004 (Asian Law Journal, “The Asian American Closet”, May 1, Asian L.J lexis)<br />
<br />
There are other problems. . .that they need<br />
<br />
3. Asian Americans are perpetually relegated to the foreign excluded from becoming full members of society<br />

<br />
In a context of differences. . .we miss life itself<br />
<br />
Alternative-Asian invasion<br />
Being expected to downplay or privatize Asian ethnicity is part of pushing Asians into the racial closet where concealing their identity is a condition for social acceptance<br />
Jean Shin, 2004 (Asian Law Journal, “The Asian American Closet”, May 1, Asian L.J lexis)<br />

In privatizing this ethnicity. . .usually associated with whites<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2NC-Went for the K proper (no additional cards read)<br />
Link Argument:<br />
1AC creates black-white dichotomy<br />
The 1AC excludes the narrative of Asian internment and ignores Asian oppression<br />
1AC does not speak from their particular social location-they speak for others-causes externalization of identity.<br />
<br />
Impact Argument:<br />
Closeting, 2 impacts<br />
1. Causes Asian Americans to be assimilated into white culture causing them to be “whited” out<br />
2. Turns the Rodriguez evidence<br />
<br />
Alternative: Asian invasion solves oppression by using social location for change and critical pedagogy.<br />
<br />
1NR- Framework and Perm<br />
<br />
A2: Perm<br />
1. Steals other peoples strategies like white supremacy<br />
2. Makes Asians complacent with a theory designed for African Americans<br />
3. They assume identity can be incorporated after the fact- this fail, white feminism proves<br />
