The RFS imposed by the …not reduce the mandate.101<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Oil Supply Investment<br />
First, oil supply investment is shattered—exporters have cancelled dozens of projects scheduled to start in 2009. <br />

And, cutting biofuel subsidies solves—biofuel subsidies make oil investment look risky, making it harder for oil to compete. Saudi Arabia’s investments specifically hinge on biofuel subsidies.<br />

<br />
Thus, the plan:<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate the following subsidies for biofuels: the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, subsidies for the research and development of cellulosic ethanol, and the Federal Small Producer Tax Credit.<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Cellulose<br />

Contention I: Inherency<br />
<br />
First, subsidies for corn ethanol stretch to every part of production and consumption and cost billions.<br />
Karetnikov, 8<br />

<br />
The largest subsidies are provided to …available from this subsidy (Koplow 2006).<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Links<br />
These subsidies hurt the alternative energy market in five ways:<br />
<br />
First, by acting as a subsidy for gasoline consumption.<br />
de Gorter and Just, 8<br />
<br />
(Harry and David, Associate Professors in the Department of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell; &quot;The Law of Unintended Consequences: How the US Biofuel Tax Credit with a Mandate Subsidizes Oil Consumption and Has no Impact on Ethanol Consumption,&quot; Department of Applied Economics and Management, Working Paper, February, SSRN) jaw<br />
<br />
The results so far are for a blend mandate. …$18 bil. a year in taxpayer monies alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, by ensuring more efficient alternative energy solutions don’t become commercially competitive.<br />
Koplow, 7<br />
(Doug, founded Earth Track in 1999 to more effectively integrate information on energy subsidies; has written extensively on natural resource subsidies for organizations such as the Global Subsidies Initiative, the National Commission on Energy Policy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Greenpeace, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the US Environmental Protection Agency; holds an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and a BA in economics from Wesleyan University.

<br />
One of the most important concerns about…without limit for each gallon produced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Third, by shaping the entire research and development process, stopping alternatives from even being realized.<br />
Pratt, 4<br />
(Ben, Senior Vice President, Market-Based Management Institute, Market Perspectives, &quot;Working Paper: Subsidies limit our future,&quot; January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://mbm.blogs.com/Subsidies%20Limit%20Our%20Future%20Working%20Paper%202.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://mbm.blogs.com/Subsidies%20Limit%20Our%20Future%20Working%20Paper%202.pdf</a>) jaw<br />
<br />
The point is this: whether or not ethanol is a “good”…more valuable to us individually.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fourth, corn ethanol is a negative energy-producer.<br />
Johnson and Runge, 7<br />
(Robbin, consultant and former senior vice president of corporate affairs at Cargill, Inc.; C. Ford, Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Applied Economics and Law and Director of the Center for International Food and Ag Policy at University of Minnesota; “Ethanol: Train Wreck Ahead?” Issues in Science and Technology, Winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.issues.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.issues.org/index.html</a>) jaw<br />
<br />
Apart from ethanol-specific subsidies, tax breaks, and mandates…comparable to those of conventional gasoline.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fifth, even if we massively increased corn acreage, corn ethanol still wouldn’t reduce oil consumption.<br />
Food and Water Watch, 07<br />
(Joint report of FWW, the Network for New Energy Choices, and the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, &quot;The Rush to Ethanol: Not all Biofuels are Created Equal,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://newenergychoices.net/uploads/RushToEthanol-rep.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://newenergychoices.net/uploads/RushToEthanol-rep.pdf</a>) jaw<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, the Congressional Research Service…appears to be limited by a crop area constraint.”107<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Impacts<br />
<br />
First, the most-accurate data from 1970 on proves that global oil production will peak in 2010 —these predictions have been remarkably consistent.<br />
Meng and Bentley, 8<br />
(Q.Y., State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resource and Prospecting; R.W., Department of Cybernetics, The University of Reading; “Global oil peaking: Responding to the case for ‘abundant supplies of oil’,” Energy,<br />
Volume 33, Issue 8, August, Pages 1179-1184, ScienceDirect)<br />
<br />
Maugeri's first argument is that since…around 2010, give-or-take about 5 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, peak oil will trigger increased nuclear proliferation, global economic collapse, resource wars, great power conflicts, and it will culminate in nuclear Armageddon.<br />
McKillop, 8<br />
(Andrew, energy economist and consultant, recently edited The Final Energy Crisis, first energy editor for The Ecologist journal, &quot;Get Ready for the Last Oil War,&quot; Energy Bulletin, July 17, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.energybulletin.net/node/45944" rel="nofollow">http://www.energybulletin.net/node/45944</a>)<br />
<br />
When we arrive at permanent undersupply…will have the world’s last remaining reserves of oil.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, the deadly combination of peak oil and Social Security crisis will demolish the US and world economies around 2010.<br />
Attarian, 2<br />

<br />
This collision will be painful. All economic activity…likely consequence of a persistent and worsening energy squeeze.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, that means extinction—bet you didn’t know the article was about oil.<br />
Bearden, 00<br />
<br />

Bearden, LTC, U.S. Army (Retired) CEO, CTEC (private R&amp;D corporation engaged in research on free energy devices and the mechanisms for interaction of electromagnetic fields and radiation with biological systems) Inc., the Director of the Association of Distinguished American Scientists (ADAS) and a Fellow Emeritus of the Alpha Foundation's Institute for Advanced Study (AIAS), &quot;The Unnecessary Energy Crisis: How to Solve It Quickly,&quot; 6-12-2000, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cheniere.org/techpapers/Unnecessary%20Energy%20Crisis.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheniere.org/techpapers/Unnecessary%20Energy%20Crisis.doc</a>]<br />
<br />
History bears out that desperate nations…of the world, and civilization itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan.<br />
The United States federal government should eliminate the following subsidies for corn ethanol: the Federal Renewable Fuels Standard, subsidized loans, loan guarantees, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, and the Federal Small Producer Tax credit. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
First, the plan is necessary to eliminating unfair advantages that corn ethanol has now—energy solutions should compete head-to-head.<br />
Koplow, 7<br />
(Doug, founded Earth Track in 1999 to more effectively integrate information on energy subsidies; has written extensively on natural resource subsidies for organizations such as the Global Subsidies Initiative, the National Commission on Energy Policy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Greenpeace, the Alliance to Save Energy, and the US Environmental Protection Agency; holds an MBA from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration and a BA in economics from Wesleyan University.

<br />
Biofuels should compete head-on …difference in ameliorating this trend.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, eliminating subsidies allows one-on-one competition of biofuels, increasing efficiency.<br />
Rotman, 8<br />
(David, Technology Review's executive editor, &quot;The Mess of Mandated Markets,&quot; MIT Technology Review, March/April, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=20226&amp;channel=biztech&amp;section=" rel="nofollow">http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=20226&amp;channel=biztech&amp;section=</a>) jaw<br />
<br />
Mandated consumption levels break …replace corn with prairie grass?&quot;<br />

Development of alternative energy is key to staving off peak oil<br />
Linden, 7<br />
(Eugene, author of The Winds of Change: Climate, Weather, and the Destruction of Civilizations and environmental journalist, “From Peak Oil to Dark Age?” Business Week, lexis)<br />
<br />
With global oil production virtually…scramble to maintain existing import levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, other countries will follow suit.<br />
Wirth, 3<br />
(Timothy, President of the United Nations Foundation and the Better World Fund, “The Future of Energy Policy,” Foreign Affairs, July-August 2003, lexis)<br />
<br />
Energy is a common thread weaving…and far into the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, even with corn ethanol subsidies, ethanol from algae will be in production by the end of 2009, but it won’t be commercially competitive until 2012, after the peak.<br />
Reuters, 8<br />
(&quot;Algenol trains algae to turn carbon into ethanol,&quot; Reuters, June 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/articlePrint?articleId=USN1032368520080611" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/articlePrint?articleId=USN1032368520080611</a>) jaw<br />
<br />
Private U.S. company Algenol plans…received about $70 million in funding from investors.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, algae fuel will be able to replace petroleum, yield hundreds of times more fuel than current biofuels, and preserve food security—it all depends on how economic it can become.<br />
Popular Mechanics, 7<br />

Given the right conditions, algae can…until you’ve actually built the thing.”<br />
