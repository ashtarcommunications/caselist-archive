 Plan text: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering the government of Afghanistan a binding guarantee it will substantially increase its foreign assistance by stopping its participation in poppy eradication projects in Afghanistan, providing infrastructural assistance for medical opium production, and expanding the US “80-20” preferential opium trade agreement to include Afghanistan, if the government of Afghanistan establishes a licensing program for legal medical poppy cultivation.<br />

No risk of corruption or diversion – 3 reasons<br />

 Impact Turned Capitalism [Cites from a previous WFU round on the Wiki], aka Gift Economy Good<br />

VAUGHAN, DIRECTOR – FOUNDATION FOR COMPASSIONATE SOCIETY – SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION, 98 [GENEVIEVE, &quot;JACOB WRESTLES WITH THE ANGEL&quot;, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gift-economy.com/articlesAndEssays/jacobWrestles.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.gift-economy.com /articlesAndEssays/jacobWrestle s.html__</a><br />
If we adjust our perspective to validate giftgiving and invalidate exchange some things which have been both ubiquitous and invisible are illuminated. For example women's free labor in the home can be validated as gift labor. It is now widely known that if women's free labor were counted monetarily more than forty percent would have to be added to the GNP in the US- even more in many other countries. Thus we can say that a gift of more than forty percent of the GNP is being given to the economy as a whole by those who work for free in the home. If we look at profit as coming from surplus value -Marx's term for the extra amount of work that the worker puts into the product over and above the amount of his or her salary (the going price for that labor on the market)- we can see that 'extra' as a gift from the worker to the capitalist. In fact once we have stopped validating exchange we can begin to see gifts everywhere. Profit is a gift, an extra portion of nurturing given from each of those below to those above.  <u>The gift of profit motivates the whole system of capitalism</u>. In fact exchange itself floats upon a sea of gifts. And so does human life itself. I started by talking about the various levels of gift giving and creative receiving, from the beating of our hearts to language, from the uses of light to the movement of the wind, from physiological processes to the embracing of the 'givens' of our experience. Co-muni-cation at the material and the linguistic levels depends not only on our ability to give to needs but on the capacity to receive that comes from having had a mother or caregiver. Because they must be nurtured at length as children humans develop a receptivity towards all of the things that satisfy their needs as if they came from the mother. Thus when we say &quot;Mother Earth&quot; we recognize the great giver as the source because we have been children. If we have needs that the varieties of our experience can satisfy, it is because we have evolved to creatively receive what is available as given.<br />
