OBSERVATION TWO – FRAMEWORK AND OUR METHODOLOGY<br />
<br />
A. OUR ASSUMPTIONS<br />
<br />
1. LANGAUGE STRUCTURES REALITY –Language shapes and is shaped by reality in a symbiotic relationship, where our understandings of the world are created by the language used to describe it. This communicative co-production of reality gives meaning to our surroundings thru the nature of our research and the context of the debate. As Burke explains, language directs our attention to see some things and to ignore others, such that many of our observations are but implications of the terms we use.<br />
<br />
2. DEBATE AS CRITICISM AND CRITICISM AS ARGUMENT –<br />
<br />
a. debate is inherently rhetorical - Debate is a language game and the words we use to justify our strategic choices matter.<br />
<br />
Little 1. The plan is not the exclusive focus. The community’s validation of discourse criticisms prove the ways we justify policies have become as important as the policies themselves. For example. Birth control policy justified by racist eugenics arguments, but would accept that very same policy if it was justified with women’s rights.<br />
<br />
Little 2. Rhetorical effects outweigh the myth of policy fiat – debate is not a game of competing truths, rather it is a means to evaluate probabilities ground in communicative choices. Policy only carries meaning insofar as rhetoric structures it.<br />
<br />
Little 3. the power of being resolved - The word resolved justifies this conception of debate. The federal government is not the entity that must stand resolved. Rather, we as individual agents reach a conclusion regarding the resolution. We “make a firm decision about” or “ cause [a person] to reach a decision” (American heritage dictionary)<br />
<br />
b. Rhetorical Criticism is Argument – we do not abandon the dialectical core of debate – argumentation, refutation and deliberation. Instead, we offer an alternate way to practice the skills of debate. Good criticism is inherently argumentative.<br />
<br />
&lt;insert card from brockried? Qjs article “criticisms as argument” – jake has copy or cate can get you it&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
3. LAW IS INHERENTLY RHETORICAL – However, law’s rhetorical function and its rhetorical foundations have become marginalized by the hegemony of analytic / positivist / formalist traditions of jurisprudence<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;KLINGER CARD&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
B. ROLES PLAYED IN ROUND – who are we?<br />
<br />
1. THE ARGUER AS CRITIC – We are rhetorical critics, and the 1AC is a rhetorical criticism. Given on our interpretation of debate and law this is both a natural and necessary role for debaters to play. Rhetorical criticism advances an argument about how we frame and are framed by discourse. Rhetorical criticism constructs an argument by providing a description, analysis and evaluation of a rhetorical artifact. The artifact we evaluate is the Supreme Court decision ex parte Quirin and the way that its shaped the policies governing and perceptions of Germans during World War Two, and how its present day use shapes policies and perceptions of the administrations war on terror<br />
<br />
2. THE OTHER TEAM – as critical respondent or reviewer, as in every debate, the job of the negative is to answer the affirmative advocacy. Our framework does provide argumentative ground. A text can produce multiple criticisms. As Karlyn Campbell, Forbes Hill and Robert Newman’s opposing criticism of Nixon’s Vietnamization speech prove. And if you have ever submitted a criticism for publication, you know that reviews offer many reasons to reject the article and many answers to your argument.<br />
<br />
3. THE JUDGE AND BALLOT –We do not force the judge into any particular role, two non-mutually exclusive judge/ballot roles emerge from our framework.<br />
<br />
a. The judge as critic of argument, If you think our arguments are better than theirs negatives, we win—the ballot says that “the better debating was done by.” Debate can occur about many things, not just policy. So the judge decides who does the better criticism / debating about the text.<br />
<br />
b. The judge as journal editor You can act as a journal even given the reviews, who is assessing the feedback from your reviewers. If even given the reviews, in our rhetorical criticism passes… it would get published meaning we win<br />
<br />
<br />
C. APPLICATION TO THE TOPIC – OUR INTERPRETATION HAS A TEXTUAL BASIS AND IS PREDICTABLE<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;HASAIN CARD&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
D. REASONS TO PREFER / OUR INTERPRETATION<br />
<br />
1. Topic Specific education. By recentering the rhetorical nature of jurisprudence we educate about the discursive basis of the law, the rhetorical basis of Supreme Court and the argumentative core of criticism.<br />
<br />
2. Debate relevant decision making- Debate’s tradition is rooted in communication studies, and our framework recenters communication scholarly literature into debate practice.<br />
<br />
3. Trumpets argumentative responsibility<br />
<br />
a. Language responsibility paramount. A rhetorical criticism of Quirin highlights the importance of language and holds the government accountable how it labels persons in GITMO. Under our interpretation teams wouldn’t be able to sever offensive discourse.<br />
b. Power – language choices directly affect power relations and the words that we use to describe persons determine the way that we interact with them<br />
<br />
4. Agency – our interpretation focuses attention on actions that we each can control – language – and not on actions we have no real agency over – like supreme court decisions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION THREE – HARMS—CRITICAL POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS<br />
<br />
<br />
A. THE ADMINISTRATIONS’ AND THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS’ RHETORICAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN “LAWFUL” AND “UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS” HAVE SEVERAL IMPACTS, INCLUDING:<br />
<br />
1. --THE LEGITIMATION OF STATE VIOLENCE AGAINST THE STATELESS<br />
2. --NAMING ALL NON-STATE VIOLENCE “TERRORISM”<br />
3. –MANDATING THE WAR ON TERROR AS A RESPONSE<br />
AND 4.—IT ALSO DENIES THE VERY HUMANITY OF THOSE DEEMED “UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS” AND PREVENTS US FROM EXPANDING OUR OWN CONCEPTION OF HUMANITY.<br />
<br />
B. THE DISTINCTION ALSO DEMANDS THE TOTAL ERADICATION OF “UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION FOUR – SOLVENCY—EVALUATIVE CRITICISM, THE WAY FORWARD<br />
<br />
A. THE AFFIRMATIVE’S RHETORICAL CRITICISM OF THE “LAWFUL/ UNLAWFUL COMBATANT” DISTINCTION IN QUIRIN IS A POLITICAL MOVE THAT QUESTIONS THE CURRENT HEGEMONIC CONSENSUS.<br />

B. THE AFFIRMATIVE ALLOWS US TO EXPAND OUR NOTION OF HUMANITY MAKING HUMAN RIGHTS TRULY UNIVERSAL<br />

AFF<br />
Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
In Planned parenthood v. Casey, the supreme court struck down a spousal notification provision of pennsylvnia law, but upheld the constitutionality of a 24 our waiting period, the decision was essentialist because it failed to see the impact waitingperiods has on poor, young, rural women of color.<br />
<br />
Colker 1994 (Ruth, Pregnant Men: Practice, Theory and the law. P. 94-5)<br />
<br />
In planned Parenthood of Southeastern Penn……equality interests sufficiently.<br />
<br />
The casey decision resulted in 24 statates having mandatory waiting periods, requiring 2 separate trips to an abortion provider<br />
<br />
Guttmacher Institute 2006 (“Mandatory Counseling and Waiting Periods of Abortion.” August 1)<br />
<br />
Background: Most state require……trips to be the facility.<br />
<br />
Plan: In order to address the inequalities created by this decision, we believe:<br />
<br />
In deciding Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood, ET AL (05-1381), The United States Supreme court should overrule planned parenthood v. casey 505 U.S. 833 (1992) Holding that “A waiting period between the provision of the information demed necessary to informed consent and the performance of an abortion” is constitutional. The Court’s previous holding invalidating a state’s 24 hour mandatory waiting period should be followed. The overrule should be made on the grounds that a strict scrutiny analyis of equal protection informed by intersectional and consent analysis dictates the court declare shuch provisions an unconstitutional infringement of diverse women’s due process liberty interests.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Intersectionality<br />
<br />
An intersectional approach enables individuals to break down dominant institutions of power – intersectionality recognizes identity is not additive, but multiplicative – one is not male, and sian, and heterosexual instead, how one is a sex informed by race, how one is a seduality is informed by nationality. Only this approach can expose mechanisms of power.<br />
<br />
Collins 1998 (Patricia Hill. “Some groups Matters: Intersectionlity, situated standpoints, and Black Feminist Thought: Fighting words: Black Women and the Search for Justice.)<br />
<br />
Under race only or gender only conceptual framewors, it is fairly……changing power relations.<br />
<br />
Intersectional jurisprudence is necessary for justice, anti-essentialism provides a constructive approach to read court decisions and to develop legal protections for the most disadvantaged in society<br />
<br />
Colker 1994 (Ruth. Pregnant Man. P. 90)<br />
<br />
Essentialism can occur on three different levels…..Barneds v. Moore.<br />
<br />
An intersectional approach decenters white women as a norm a norm upheld by the casey decision and exposes the impact of the casey ruling<br />
<br />
Collins 1990 (Patricial Hill. “The Social Construction of black Feminists Thought” Black Feminists Thought: Knowledge ,Conscioussness, and the Politics of Empowerment. 1990)<br />
<br />
The vast majority…behalf of all women. P. 68<br />
<br />
We must reject racism in every instance<br />
<br />
Barndt<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Sex Justice<br />
<br />
First, reproductive rights are critical to sex justice – reproduction is a primary location of women’s inequality<br />
<br />
Abrams Summer 1995 ( Paula, “The Tradition of Reproduction.” Arizona Law Reviewu. Review # 87. p. 435 1995)<br />
<br />
The traditios examined in this article make it clear….as a group in society.<br />
<br />
<br />
The 24 hour waiting period denies women reproductive autonomy<br />
<br />
Abrams (Paula, “The tradition of reproduction. → Above)<br />
<br />
Neither law nor society has been able to reconcile…..which is its legal.<br />
<br />
Women’s inequality is the root of war<br />
<br />
Betty a Reardon 1993 (Women and Peace: Feminist Visions of Global security p. 30-2<br />
<br />
In an article entitled…rifts in world politics.<br />
<br />
Negative arguments are biased – arguments against women’s choice are embedded in patriarchial traditions<br />
<br />
<br />
Abrams 1995 (Paula. Arizona Law Review)<br />
<br />
Clear patterns merge from this examination…..alocated to the woman.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
Only intersectional approaches can break down dominant institutioans of power<br />
<br />
Collins 1998 (“some groups matter → above) p. 228<br />
<br />
Developing Black feminist……to be seen.<br />
<br />
The decisions by the ninth and fifth circuit courts in lam and jefferery prove that the courts will apply intersectionality in a litigation context in the future.<br />
<br />
Wei 1996 (Virginia “Asian women and the employment discrimination: Using intersectionality theory to address title VII claims based on combined factors of race, gender and national origin,” 37 B.C. L. Rev 771. Boston College Law Review. Lexis Nexis.<br />
<br />
Clearly, intersectional claims will not succeed unless…..Asian women’s identities.<br />
<br />
The supreme court should overrule casey – the 24 hr waiting period implies that women cant make informed decisions on their won, efecively controlling and subjugation women<br />
<br />
Frerich 1998 (Zoe. “State Assembly Bill 24: An Affront to Women,” 19 Women’s Rights L. Rep 305 Women’s Rights L. Rep 305 Lexis)<br />
<br />
Ideally, the Supreme court should revist Casey and adjudge Bill…..women are inferior.
