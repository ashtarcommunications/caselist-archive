<u><strong>Observation One is Inherency –</strong></u> <br />
<br />
North Korea is cooperating with Syria in building nuclear technology, but the US has refused to recognize the relationship<br />

More than a year has passed since North Korea's nuclear test. … the squeeze on North Korea.<br />
<br />
Absent engagement, Syria will continue to pursue nuclear cooperation with North Korea<br />

But today, Syria is on the … to Iran and North Korea.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:<br />
The United States Federal Government should guarantee to the government of Syria that the United States will not attempt to forcibly replace the administration of Bashar al-Assad on the condition that the Syrian government discloses the details of all nuclear cooperation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.<br />
<br />
We’ll clarify<br />

Last week, Syria and Israel … willing to sit with me.<br />

Thus the plan:<br />

The United States Federal Government should guarantee to the government of Syria that the United States will cooperate in restoring the Golan Heights to Syrian control and will not attempt to forcibly replace the administration of Bashar al-Assad on the condition that the Syrian government engages in peace negotiations with the United States and Israel and ends its support for Hezbollah.<br />

The United States Federal Government should guarantee to the government of Syria that the United States will cooperate in restoring the Golan Heights to Syrian control and will not attempt to forcibly replace the administration of Bashar al-Assad on the condition that the Syrian government agrees to engage in peace negotiations with the United States and Israel, end its support for Hezbollah, and sever ties with the government of Iran.<br />
<br />
We’ll clarify<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 is Israel-Syria Peace – First, both Israel and Syria want to engage in negotiations, but are unable to make progress without US involvement<br />
