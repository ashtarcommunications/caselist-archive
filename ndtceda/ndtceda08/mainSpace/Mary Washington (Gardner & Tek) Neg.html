<u>Gambill, Middle East Intelligence Bulletin editor</u>, April <u>03</u><br />
[Gary C., &quot;The American-Syrian Crisis and the End of Constructive Engagement,&quot; The Middle East Intelligence Bulletin, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.meib.org/articles/0304_s1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.meib.org/articles/0304_s1.htm</a>]<br />
Until last month, the parameters<br />
and historical reasons.<br />
<br />
<strong>B. Violation</strong>- the plan isn’t a quid pro quo- the engagement isn’t conditioned on a change in the targeted state’s behavior<br />
<br />
<strong>C. Reasons to vote neg-</strong><br />
1. Stable ground- foreign assistance allows the aff to fund or assist any program in the Middle East- its too broad for the negative to ever be prepared without common ground- requiring a quid pro quo ensures the neg has disad links, case arguments, and kritiks based on attaching strings.<br />
2. Education- debating quid pro quos allows plans with more nuance than just increasing US contact or interaction- it better reflects the proposals in the literature like a grand bargain with Iran or offers to Syria regarding Israel and the Golan<br />
3. Their interpretation moots security guarantees- there’s no advocates for unconditional security guarantees- especially with nations that we have no relations with like Iran and Syria.<br />

<strong>Lebanese Independence DA</strong><br />
<strong>The cedar revolution is still alive and well in Lebanon—it’s a beacon for democracy</strong><br />

<strong>Iran Politics DA</strong><br />
<strong>A. Uniqueness and impact- hardliner incompetence is fueling a public backlash- this is the only scenario for democratic transition- this is key to a democratic and stable Middle East</strong><br />
Takeyh, 06<br />

THE WAY AHEAD Despite the…traditions of the Middle East.<br />
<br />
B. Engagement prevents democratic transition- it props up the regime, derails reformers and alienates the Iranian people<br />
