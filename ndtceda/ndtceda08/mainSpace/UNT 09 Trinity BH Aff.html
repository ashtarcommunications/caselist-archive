Finally, to refuse human dignity is to place your own ethnic and national stories in the place of God and to regard all others as excess to be eliminated. Holy communities are founded on self-transcendence which is only possible when we allow our relationship with others to transform ourselves. This is an affirmation of particularity and difference which refuses Sacred Orders in the name of the possibility of a positive reading of interdependence. <br />
