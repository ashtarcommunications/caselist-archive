NEOLIBERALISM BAD CRITIQUE<br />
<br />
Cutting US agricultural subsidies is a “liberal scientific fantasy.” Their demand that the powerful make the world trade system “fair” is just like calling “time-out!” in a war-zone.<br />

I/THOU PIC<br />
<br />
The relationship with the world is one based on an objective understanding. The I-it relationship established by the plan creates a false dichotomy between the subject and the object rendering a mutual and non-totalized relation to the world impossible<br />

Colin Purcell-Lee, counseling research and training group, 1999<br />
[Science, Discourse, and Mind, November]<br />
<br />
According to Buber… establish the realm of It.<br />
<br />
The impact is ethics- an I-it relationship strips the affirmative of the transformative potential and results in a dehumanized existence<br />

PRIMITIVISM 1NC:<br />
<br />
A) The Affirmative is a band-aid on a bullet wound, reforming an agricultural system that is fundamentally broken. Agriculture is the greatest mistake humanity ever made, and it demands both radical critique and people brave enough to stand up to make a call for primitivism. A vote against primitivism is a vote for extinction. It’s try or die for us.<br />
<br />
Zerzan 2007<br />
(John, primitivist, interview with Arthur Versluis from Michigan State, Journal for the Study of Radicalism available at <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/jsr/pdf/Zerzan%20Interview%20155-168.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://msupress.msu.edu/journals/jsr/pdf/Zerzan%20Interview%20155-168.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
<br />
B) The alternative is to reject the affirmative and their defense of agriculture and civilization. We must endorse an alternative ideology that recognizes that we can escape the traps of cultivation. The 2AC will say “perm,” but attempts to work within the system of civilization not only fails, but will suck our vision into a system of totality where the universal can compensate. This ensures extinction. We must have a whole-scale rejection and abandonment of the modern world.<br />

<br />
<br />
C) The move to agriculture and civilization is the root cause of all the problems we currently face. We must embrace primitivism and deny the “inevitability” of civilization to save ourselves from extinction.<br />

TOPICALITY: NET DECREASE<br />
<br />
A. INTERP<br />
<br />
TO “SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT” OR “ELIMINATE DOMESTIC SUBSIDIES” REQUIRES A NET DECREASE IN AGGREGATE SUPPORT – THE AFF MUST ESTABLISH A CAP<br />

<br />
<br />
B. VIOLATION<br />
<br />
THE AFF DOESN’T ESTABLISH A CAP ON AGRIGULTURAL SUPPORT BECAUSE A CAP REQUIRES PERMANENT REDUCTIONS IN SUPPORT MEASURED YEARLY THROUGH WTO NOTIFICATION REPORTS<br />

[Randy Specialist in Agricultural Policy Resources, Science, and Industry Division &quot;Agriculture in the WTO: Policy Commitments Made Under the Agreement on Agriculture&quot; CRS Report for Congress May 12, 2005]<br />
<br />
<br />
C. REASONS TO PREFER<br />
<br />
1. LIMITS – REQUIRING A CAP CENTERS DEBATES AROUND AGGREGATE REDUCTIONS BECAUSE PICS WILL SOLVE EVERYTHING BUT THE CAP – THIS REDUCES THE TOPIC TO A COUPLE AFFS PER COMMODITY AND A FEW OUTLIERS AT MAX CREATING A MANAGEABLE RESEARCH BURDEN<br />
<br />
2. GROUND –AGGREGATE REDUCTIONS AND ACTUAL COMMITMENTS BY THE US TO REDUCE SUBSIDIES MAKE UP THE HEART OF THE TOPIC LITERATURE AND THE STABLE GENERIC DISAD OF THE TOPIC IS “SUBSIDY REDUCTIONS” BAD. NO CAP ENCOURAGES AFFS TO SHIFT SUBSIDIES TO BETTER PRACTICES SKIRTING THIS.<br />

The alternative is to “walk away from capitalism.” By refusing our participation, we drains global capitalism of its of power and meaning, hollowing it from the inside out.<br />

POVERTY DISCOURSE K:<br />
<br />
A. WHILE THE AFF SEEMS LIKE A GENUINE SHIFT TO CONCERN FOR THE PLIGHT OF THOSE IN POVERTY, INSTEAD, THEIR DISCOURSE OF EMPATHY FOR THE POOR FUNCTIONS AS IDEOLOGICAL COVER FOR THE CONTINUATION OF NEO-LIBERAL AGENDAS<br />
<br />
Pitthouse, Center for Civil Society @ University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, ’03 (Richard “Producing the poor: The World Bank’s new discourse of domination”, African Sociological Review, 7-2-2003, www.codesria.org/Links/Publications/asr7_2_full/pithouse.pdf)<br />
<br />
<br />
B. – THEIR DISCOURSE ASSIGNS AGENCY TO GLOBAL CAPITAL, AS IF IT WERE SOME KIND OF WILLING, ORGANIC ENTITY<br />
THROUGH THEIR REPRESENTATIONS, THE POOR EMERGE AS ‘THE POOR’ – DE-INDIVIDUALIZED AND OTHERED – THIS AMOUNTS TO A KIND OF ‘DISCURSIVE SADISM’ –<br />
WE CAN HIGHLIGHT A FEW SPECIFIC IMPACTS - 1. THIS IS UNETHICAL, AND ULTIMATELY ‘INTERNAL LINK TURNS’ THE AFF’S ADVANTAGE - 2. THEIR DISCOURSE FUNCTIONS AS A FORM OF MISANTHROPY TOWARDS ALL OF US – EVEN THE INDUSTRIALIZED NORTH ARE UNDERMINED AS THE SUPPOSED AGENTS OF THE STORY<br />

<br />
<br />
C. ALTERNATIVE - A POLITICS OF REFUSAL IS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE – 1. THE AFF PARTICIPATES IN THE CREATION OF A ‘FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS’ THAT SEEKS TO PACIFY AND DE-RADICALIZE – OUR REFUSAL RESISTS THEIR DISCOURSE AND IS A GENERATIVE ACT – EACH ACT OF RESISTANCE TO CO-OPTATION IS KEY –2. WE DON’T NEED AN ALTERNATIVE ANYWAY - IT IS A MISTAKE TO ACCEPT THE LOGIC OF THE ‘NO ALTERNATIVE’ ARGUMENT – THIS EVIDENCE ALSO FUNCTIONS TO PROVE THAT THE IMPACT OF COMPLICITY WITH ‘FALSE CONSCIOUSNESS’ OUTWEIGHS THE AFF’S CLAIM OF EMPATHY<br />

<br />
(--) The Affirmative is an attempt to import a new text to find stasis in the collapse of reality. They claim to push boundaries and ask us to think differently, but it’s nothing more than a new metaphor for the same tired lies. It’s nothing short than the balkanization of epistemology. We have to recognize the fractures that exist all around us and re-claim the Dream. The hyperdimensional shift is coming and how prepared we are for it will determine our success or failure.<br />
