 This is the story of Howard Biel. An ordinary news anchor that un-problematically reported the news. Every fay the same- he didn't have anything to live for. Much like most interpretations of the status qyo that see the politics of Palestine only in terms of the monolithis party stryctures Hamas and Fatah- there is something more going on, that is being underreported, misinterpreted, and left out. What is missing in the everyday journalism is the debate ad dissent of the street.<br />

I don't know…who or what Palestins is.<br />

We ask you to open up a space in the resolution for demonstration that uses public spece to interrogate structures of power. The resolution is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>a structure of power in that it assumes hegemonic understandings of the sovereignty and nation states. We believe there is another way to affirm the resolution that explores power structures inherent in language. Our affirmation of the resolkution is militant and insurrectional, our dissent is not a standard affirmation but a way to activate the lack in the ballot and judging space in order to affirm a fidelity to the resolution that engages in something more than just base existence. The ballot is an affirmation that the 1AC project presents an opportunity to assert subjectivity through a politics of we against the squ. The 1AC is a fidelity to a poetic process that legitimates a violent linguistic break from the squo.<br />

Badiou 2K7 (The Century pg. 106-8)<br />
This century was the century of the demonstration….what does not demonstrate is not<br />
<br />
Down here in the streets reports are coming in that ppl have started to sing. The st/ as demonstration is a site of performative contradiction that assers rights were thereare none in a zone where it is illegal to demonstrate. The idea that it is illegal to sing the national anthem in another language as mandated by George Bush reveals the linguistic power structures of nationalism. It is through the injection of aesthetics of the 1AC that we embody<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>a perf. Con. That is a subversion of dominant language practices and power structures.<br />

In the spring of 2006…regard it in any other way.<br />

That the United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of the Palestinian Authority and it should include offering them a security guarantee and/or a substantial increase in foreign assistance.
