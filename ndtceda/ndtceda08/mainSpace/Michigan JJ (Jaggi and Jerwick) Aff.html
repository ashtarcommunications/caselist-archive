<strong>Thus the plan:<br />
The United States federal government should engage the Government of Afghanistan, including a security guarantee to maintain the United States military presence as long as the democratically elected government requires, assuming the government of Afghanistan recognizes the Durand Line. The United States federal government should also increase foreign assistance to the government of Afghanistan by implementing a program in coordination with the Government of Afghanistan to distribute corms of the Crocus Sativus Linneaus plant to Afghan farmers.

Advantage One is Instability<br />
First, instability is inevitable under current US strategy which alienates the Afghan people<br />

Meanwhile, <u>the sense of urgency is palpable in Washington somehow to seek a political settlement of the war in Afghanistan .</u><br />
<br />
Scenario One is Democracy Promotion<br />
First, Afghanistan is the litmus test for democracy in the region-its success spurs mass democratization, its failure guarantees fundamentalism<br />
Jeffrey D. <strong>Rhinefield</strong> 200<strong>6</strong> (Lieutenant, United States Navy B.S., Jacksonville University; IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIETAL FRAGMENTATION FOR STATE FORMATION: CAN DEMOCRACY SUCCEED IN AFGHANISTAN?; MASTER OF ARTS IN NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS; NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL ;<br />

Scenario Two is China<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>First, Afghan instability threatens Chinese access to energy</strong><br />

<strong><u>The effects of oil shortages and industrial stagnation would be less lurid, but economic collapse would endanger China 's political stability whether that collapse came with a bang or a whimper</u></strong> .<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario Three is Musharraf<br />
<br />
First, Musharraf's political situation is highly unstable and getting worse because of the unresolved border with Afghanistan<br />
<strong><u>Forbes</u></strong> 9/12/200<strong><u>7</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>Sharif's removal could deepen Musharraf's unpopularity and reinforce impressions that he is an authoritarian</u></strong> leader.<br />
<br />
He needs a victory to show opposition forces so that he can maintain credibility- the plan does that<br />
<strong><u>Pakistan</u></strong> <strong><u>Christian Post</u></strong> 9/16/200<strong><u>7</u></strong><br />
The second component of mimicking what Bush has been doing for the past six plus years is: <strong><u>When in trouble, create a diversion</u></strong> .<br />
<br />
Pakistan can't commit to a resolution now because of the possibility that US troops will leave-plan solves that<br />
<br />

Afghan officials have their own views of Pakistani motivations, which include Pakistan 's willingness to pressure Afghanistan for the recognition of the Durand Line and Pakistan 's historical paranoia.<br />

<strong><u>Getting hold of a nuclear weapon or successful acquisition of nuclear material and detonation of an IND by terrorists could turn a modern civilization into a smoking ruin</u></strong> .<br />
<br />
Scenario Four is Indo-Pak<br />
<br />
A US-stabilized Afghanistan is critical to solve Central Asian and Indo-Pak conflict<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Millan</u></strong> , 0<strong><u>3</u></strong><br />
(Colonel G. Joseph, US Army, &quot;Poppy Cultivation in Afghanistan: A Global, Strategic Nemesis,&quot; Army War College, 7-04, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A414543&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A414543&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf </a>)<br />

(December 17, L/N)<br />
<br />
And the greatest casus belli for warring between the two South Asian rivals is <strong><u>Kashmir</u></strong> , which <strong><u>has already sparked two</u></strong> such <strong><u>clashes.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Scenario Five is Iran</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Afghan instability spill over into Iran</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Jeffrey D. Rhinefield 2006 (Lieutenant, United States Navy B.S., Jacksonville University ; IMPLICATIONS OF SOCIETAL FRAGMENTATION FOR STATE FORMATION: CAN DEMOCRACY SUCCEED IN AFGHANISTAN?; MASTER OF ARTS IN NATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS; NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A445561&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf%29" rel="nofollow">http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=A445561&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf)</a></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>In addition, Iran's key interest in Afghanistan is to exert its own influence over the western part of that nation and to protect the Shia minority groups that live within the central region of Afghanistan.241</u></strong><br />

<strong>Solvency</strong><br />
<strong>A security guarantee is necessary for stability- the Taliban only survives because of uncertainty of US commitment</strong><br />
<strong>Serchuk</strong> <strong>1/16/06</strong> <strong>(Vance, research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Weekly Standard, lexis)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>The Bush administration furiously denies that NATO expansion should be seen as an American exit strategy, but this denial would seem more credible if the Pentagon</u></strong><br />
<br />

<br />

<strong>And its US presence that is critical – NATO forces are perceived by the Taliban as less credible and more likely to leave in the face of casualties</strong><br />

<strong><u>NATO-led ISAF is now in charge of all military operations in Afghanistan , although assumption of command in the east in October 2006 largely involved re-badging U.S . forces already in place.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>And a formal security guarantee from the US is necessary to the credibility of US presence and prevents border conflict</strong><br />

<strong><u>At least in Kabul , the myth of disengagement is dead, and that in itself is no small accomplishment.</u></strong> <u>The security situation in Afghanistan is going to require a long-term presence</u><br />

<br />
<strong><u>The Taliban pose a different type of threat. They can lose every firefight with superior NATO , U.S. and Afghan National Army</u></strong><br />
