 Ralph and I have not debated together this year. At GSU, my partner and I ran a combination of Ks and Policy strategies. At UK, we read straight-up Policy args.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of things:<br />
<br />
<strong>Doha DA</strong><br />
1. Doha is dead – it’s time to let it go.<br />
Financial Times 7/30 (“Multilateralism not dead as a Doha”)<br />
Like Wimbledon fortnight but without… regrettably, time to let it go<br />
<br />
Letting Doha die is key to a new culture for the WTO – the plan closes the window by reasserting old models and priorities<br />
Debra P. Steger ‘7 Professor and Director, Emerging Dynamic Global Economies (EDGE) Network, Faculty of Law, University of Ottawa (Journal of International Economic Law 10:3 “The Culture of the WTO: Why it Needs to Change”)<br />
We live in an interdependent, globalized… developing countries seriously.<br />
<br />
Subsidy reductions revive the false hope that negotiations will succeed – prevents the move beyond Doha<br />
Razeen Sally ‘8 is co-Director of the European Centre for International Political Economy (Trade Policy, New Century: The WTO, FTAs and Asia Rising p. 108-109)<br />
A serious Doha Round… WTO on its legs again?<br />
<br />
The Impacts<br />
1. Collapse of Doha in the short term is key to trade.<br />
IHT ‘8 (“The next step for international trade” lexis)<br />
The collapse of the seven-year… greenhouse gases under its rules.<br />
<br />
2. China<br />
a. US-China relations are fine because disputes are settled bilaterally and will be done so after the failure at Geneva. Collapse of bilateral dialogue tanks the relationship.<br />
Inside US-China Trade 8/13 “Paulson Makes Case For Continuing Strategic Dialogue With China” Lexis<br />
According to Paulson, the chief… through enduring differences.&quot;<br />
<br />
b. Resumed Doha talks derail the relationship – the US would start bashing China<br />
Charles Freeman ‘8, former ustr for china affairs (FNS, July 30, “CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES (CSIS) PRESS BRIEFING” Lexis)<br />
So the question about what economic… will be put on the sidelines<br />
<br />
c. Relations are key to stop nuclear war<br />
John Desperes, Fellow, RAND Corporation, 2001<br />
(China, the United States, and the Global Economy, Shuxun Chen &amp; Charles Wolf, p. 227-8)<br />
Nevertheless, America's main interests…and currently endangered specie<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Land Prices DA</strong><br />
<br />
Subsidies are capitalized into land values now – government policy is a key driver of land prices<br />
Offutt ‘3 [Susan, USDA Economic Research Service. Government Policy and Farmland Markets, ed. Charles Moss and Andrew Schmitz, p. xv.]<br />
It is not necessary to be a farmer, or even an… to be of key interest<br />
<br />
Elimination of agricultural subsidies would cause land prices to plummet, resulting in a further credit crisis<br />
Anderlik et al. ‘5 [John Anderlik – CFA Regional Manager, Stephen Kiser – Regional Economist, Jeffrey Walser – Regional Economist, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/regional/ro20053q/na/2005fall_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/regional/ro20053q/na/2005fall_04.html</a>]<br />
In a related development, reductions… percent hike in farmland loans.<br />
<br />
The resulting wave of foreclosures and bank failures would tank the agricultural sector<br />
Pitt and Jackson ‘8 [York Dispatch [AP], 4/21]<br />
DES MOINES, Iowa -- At a time of record… for a rough turnaround.&quot;<br />
<br />
That would collapse the banking industry and the economy – recent crises have shredded its resiliency<br />
McGinnis ‘8 [3/4, Agriculture Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.landsofamerica.com/resources/articles.cfm/News/Iowa/Bankers-worry-about-high-farmland-values/" rel="nofollow">http://www.landsofamerica.com/resources/articles.cfm/News/Iowa/Bankers-worry-about-high-farmland-values/</a>]<br />
Iowa Superintendent of Banking… asset-backed securities.<br />
<br />
Extinction<br />
Bearden ‘00, Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Army, 2000 (Tom, June 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3aaf97f22e23.htm</a>)<br />

<br />
<strong>Enclosure K</strong><br />
<br />
The Thesis: the modern site for the expansion of capital is NEOLIBERAL ENCLOSURE.<br />
The new enclosures are different from the violent bloody expropriation of the English countryside. The regime of neoliberal capital works by enclosing the last vestiges of public commons and embedding them within new markets.<br />
A Haroon Akram-Lodhi ‘7 Department of International Development Studies, Trent University (Third World Quarterly Vol. 28, No. 8, 2007, pp 1437 – 1456)<br />
The continuous character of enclosures...underwent neoliberal agrarian restructuring.<br />
<br />
The Link:<br />
The plan’s rollback of subsidies is an act of enclosure – it forces reliance on the market and inserts the market as a mediator between the producer and means of livelihood.<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 “’Opposing Fetishism by Reclaiming our Powers’. The Social Forum Movement, Capitalist Markets and the Politics of Alternatives” International Social Science Journal, N. 1882 (December 2004).<br />
There is not the space here to...spontaneously emerging system of freedom (De Angelis, 2002).<br />
<br />
The Impact: the process of enclosure in the North is part of the same process that colonized the South – the expansion of neoliberal enclosure creates global violence and global death zones of humanity – perpetual suffering and violence is inevitable.<br />
Balibar ‘4, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at The University of Paris-X, 2004 [Etienne, also Distinguished Professor of Humanities at University of California at Irvine, We, The People Of Europe?: Reflections On Transnational Citizenship, p. 115-116, 126-129]<br />
With this pretentious title, I want to continue ... citizenship are perceived as a threat for &quot;civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Alternative: produce commons, not enclosures.<br />
The production of commons is a struggle against enclosures – this is struggle is most important in the commodification of land and food.<br />
The direction of the plan in relation to markets is the problem, even if it seems that flawed subsidies are the problem. The alternative is the opposite – its in favor of commons, against enclosures.<br />
Massimo De Angelis ‘4 Lecturer, University of East London, Historical Materialism, volume 12:2 (57–87) “Separating the Doing and the Deed”<br />
In the context of contemporary ... various degrees of protection from the market.<br />
