<br />
<br />
<strong>Cap K</strong><br />
Reducing domestic support for commodity crops is only part of a capitalist strategy to increase the exportation of more specialized crops to force the third world into globalization<br />
Maitra, ‘97<br />
[Priyatosh Maitra, Economics Department, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand, “Globalization of capitalism, agriculture and the negation of nation states,” International Journal of Social Economics, 24.1-3, 1997, Emerald]<br />
<br />
The current phase of internationalization...kind of industrial capitalist production in these economies.<br />
<br />
Capitalism extinction – we must embrace the alternative now<br />
Foster, ‘5<br />
[John Bellamy Foster, Prof @ U of Oregon Dept of Sociology, “Naked Imperialism,” The Monthly Review, Volume 57, Number 4, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/0905jbf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.monthlyreview.org/0905jbf.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
From the longer view offered...movement against the new naked imperialism.<br />
<br />
Our Alternative is to not do the aff- capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected<br />
Herod, ‘4<br />
[James Herod, “Getting Free, 4th Edition A sketch of an association of democratic, autonomous neighborhoods and how to create it,” January 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/4thEd/4-index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/4thEd/4-index.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
It is time to try to...which I will enumerate shortly.<br />
<br />
<strong>Australia CP</strong><br />
Text: &lt;&lt;The plan&gt;&gt; on the condition that the government of Australia repeals the travel warnings and travel advisories against Indonesia.<br />
<br />
<br />
The net benefit is Indonesia-Australia relations -<br />
<br />
First, Australia wants to use its alliance with the US to work out a deal to decrease subsidies – prefer our evidence it quotes the Agriculture Minister<br />
Phillips, ‘2<br />
[Juanita Phillips, is an Australian newsreader and currently presenter of ABC Sydney's 7:00pm news bulletin ABC News, “Australia and US clash over farm bill,” 14/6/2002, TV PROGRAM TRANSCRIPT where Warren Truss, Agriculture Minister, was interviewed, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s581314.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s581314.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
JUANITA PHILLIPS: There's a complicating...towards freer and fairer trade.<br />
<br />
And, the Australian imposed travel warning against Indonesia kills trade, investment, relations, and tourism in Indonesia<br />
Sydney Morning Herald, ‘8<br />
[The Sydney Morning Herald, “Calls to drop Indonesia travel warning,” May 27, 2008, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/news/calls-to-drop-indonesia-travel-warning/2008/05/27/1211653990472.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/news/news/calls-to-drop-indonesia-travel-warning/2008/05/27/1211653990472.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Australia's travel warning ... and consider the progress that has happened in Indonesia.&quot;<br />
<br />
Australian Indonesian relations are key to South East Asian and Asian Pacific Stability<br />
Downer, ‘99<br />
[Hon Alexander Downer MP, Minister for Foreign Affairs, “Australia-Indonesia Relations - New Directions,” Asialink @ The University of Melbourne, June 25th 1999, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.asialink.unimelb.edu.au/about_asialink/opportunities/events/past/past_events_public/australia-indonesia_relations_-_new_directions" rel="nofollow">http://www.asialink.unimelb.edu.au/about_asialink/opportunities/events/past/past_events_public/australia-indonesia_relations_-_new_directions</a>]<br />
<br />
If I was to be asked why...has played its hand very well.<br />
<br />
Instability leads to nuclear war<br />
Landy, ‘00<br />
[Jonathon, National Security and International Correspondent, Knight Ridder, March 10, p. Lexis]<br />
<br />
Few if any experts think China...shaky international nonproliferation regime.<br />

<br />
<strong>China and Sudan CP-</strong><br />
<br />
Text: &lt;insert plan&gt; on the condition that China halts military support to Sudan.<br />
<br />
It solves- China should quietly be offered a QPQ of ag subsidy decreases for Sudan coop- it works<br />
Lange 08 (Mark, “the only way to alter China’s hand in Darfur,” Apr 30) “since china wields veto power… break lever on mass slaughter.”<br />
<br />
Sudan instability destabilizes the continent<br />
Kudzia 06 (David, Apr 20, writer for the Times Herald) “once again, darfur has popped back… out of stagnation and decline”<br />
<br />
Nuke War- Duetsch<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Elections Da</strong><br />
McCain is up in the polls now- Silva 9-15, McCain’s electoral edge: Rove’s maps, “the survey that showed republican john mccain eroding” “lead in several red states”<br />
<br />
Subsidies are popular in farm states- Mccain gets the blame<br />
Register-guard 08 (“editorials: farm business as usual; congress perpetuates a wasteful subsidy system” may 23)<br />
<br />
Red state support is key to McCain victory<br />
Halperin 9-10 (mark, “cnn election center”) “brown: so we just told you…. that’s a big advantage for McCain.”<br />
<br />
Key to US-India Relations- Obama<br />
Aiyar 08 (Swaminathan, “India nees McCain as US president”) “in this regard McCain beats Clinton and Obama hollow” “personal likeability is irrelevant”<br />
<br />
Key to avoid India-Pakistan war that escalates to extinction<br />
Dugger 02 (Celia, “wider military ties with India offer U.S. Diplomatic Leverage”) “military cooperation between India and the United States” “could lead to a nuclear holocaust”<br />
<br />
Turns the aff- McCain would remove subsidies<br />
Burns 8-19 (Douglas, Harkin: McCain is hostile to farm country) “mccain opposes virtually all farm subsidies”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>GMO DA</strong><br />
Biotech strong now- Globe and Mail 6/28 “they have ever so quietly” “the two have been called the next Microsoft”<br />
<br />
Subsidy system is key to the entire GMO industry Allen 04 (Will, “the war on bugs”, jan) “billions of dollars in corporate welfare” “a serious and fatal blow”<br />
<br />
Biofuels are key- demand is key to convincing the pubic that GM crops are safe Marrero 08 (Carmelo Ruiz, “biotech bets on Agrofuels”) “biotechnology companies have become some of the main movers”<br />
<br />
Public support of GMOs is key to the survival of the industry Helgren et al 00 (Karin, “genetically modified foods: consumer views and regulations around the world”) “the security of knowing that Biotech is safe”<br />
<br />
GMOs are our buffer from annihilation from a super volcano that would cause extinction Trewavas 00 (Anthony, “GM is the best option we have”) “in 535 A.D. a volcano near the present Krakatoa” “the only buffer between us and annihilation”
