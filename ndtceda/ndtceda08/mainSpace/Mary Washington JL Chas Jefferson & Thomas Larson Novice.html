Contention One is Food Security<br />
<br />
US biofuel subsidies are the key factor in creating a food security crisis – this is resulting in a protectionist backlash from civil unrest that will multiply the impacts of high food prices<br />

In the year since the publication ...purses of the world's poor.<br />
<br />
Biofuels are the key lever – even if other factors are driving food prices, changing biofuel production is the only realistic policy that can change food prices<br />
Martin, NY Times staff writer, 5/15/2008<br />

Ending subsidies will effectively turn this lever – cutting subsidies ends the ethanol craze<br />

<br />
The industry's growth has meant that a larger ... global poverty and food security.<br />
<br />
This price spike guarantees famines resulting in starvation and death – even if the plan only slows down this price spike it solves and prevents massive social unrest<br />
Natsios, Former U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator, 5/14/2008<br />
[Andrew, &quot;Global Food Crisis,&quot; Lexis, Congressional Testimony]<br />
<br />
The locus of the potential crisis points... frequently leads to starvation and death.<br />
<br />
No risk of a turn – High prices don’t help third world farmers – protectionist backlash checks the benefits of trade and it does nothing for the billions starving<br />

This spike in food prices is sparking international unrest resulting in the worst violations of human dignity and a mass backlash sparking in international instability<br />

<br />
Around the world, rising food prices ... violence has already claimed about 100 lives.<br />
<br />
Human dignity a priori outweighs – it’s a fate worse than death and is the root cause and justification for all modern evils<br />
David Berube, Associate Director for Nanoscience and Technology Studies at USCarolina, 93, www.cla.sc.edu/ENGL/faculty/berube/prolong.htm<br />
<br />
Assuming we are able to predict ... dehumanization is evil's most powerful weapon.<br />
<br />
This also makes disad impacts inevitable – international instability from food prices will trigger global conflict, disease spread, and economic, and political collapse<br />

Subsidy Cut Solvency<br />

US subsidy policy is the core reason for status quo ethanol production and prices<br />

<br />
One root of the problem is ... damaging repercussions for consumers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Subsidy Cut Solvency<br />
<br />
Quick fixes won’t do – a fundamental shift in US biofuel subsidies is key to providing long-term food security – the alternative is escalating unrest and instability in third world nations<br />
