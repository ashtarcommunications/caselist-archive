To vote affirmative is to bring into being an entire ensemble of concepts and images deployed to harness entire populations in the name of controlling a disordered, outside. The question of the round is not “what is to be done?” but “what is it that we are producing?” What kind of thinker are they asking you to be?</li></ol>Campbell, professor of international politics at the university of Newcastle, 1998 [David, Writing security, p. 199-202]<br />

The outcome of any interaction between states is <u>determined by the assumptions</u> each side brings to the table- a context emerges because of how each side interprets the rules. Rational choice approaches which assume non-cooperation and divergent interests will create conflict; instrumental rational requires states to treat each other as enemies. The most important question is how certain assumptions of the plan generate <u>conflictual interaction</u> out of which a certain context is guaranteed to emerge.<br />
Alexander Wendt 1999 (social theory of international politics p.331-332)<br />

The plan’s mechanism of diplomacy relies on the assumption that the intl arena is constituted by actors with divergent interests who naturally do no want to cooperate. This is a construction that ensures conflict between states, even to the point where nuclear conflict becomes thinkable.<br />
KM Fierke 1998 Lecturer School of Politics Queen’s University (Changing Games, Changing Strategies p. 135-138)<br />
“Taylor (in Dallmayr…would be dismantled.”<br />
Nuclear coop is impossible through diplomacy. The specter of betrayal and barbarity overdetermines the outcome provoking distrust and preemptive attack. Friendship requires the silence of trust and love, not the stifling rigidity of ilaw and treates. Ethical action should not be a bargaining chip to improve “American” interests, but instead should function as a precondition to being itself.<br />

Impact- Aff’s reduction of Iran to an object of study is reflective of a technological mode of being that can only view Iran in terms of the stores of energy that America can extract from the Iran geo-space.

The aff's critique of the current administration's policy is grounded in the epistemological truth of the realist mindset--theyre not crazy! They are a rational self-interested actor just like the rest of the international system! The certitude with which the 1ac posites the &quot;benefits&quot; that would exist in the world of the plan presupposes an understanding of IR that sanctions war against a country determined antithetical to America's strategic position.<br />

<strong>A) Interpretation –<br />
<br />
1. Constructive engagement means an offer of positive incentives in exchange for explicitly defined policy change in the target country<br />
<u>Crocker '89</u> (Chester, Fall, Foreign Affairs, p. 144, Southern Africa: Eight Years Later)<br />
&quot;Regarding South Africa, constructive engagement ...absence of fundamental internal change.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Offer implies explicit conditionality requirement and the ability to accept or reject<br />

<br />
B. Violation – Aff does not demand a specific change in the target government’s policy as an explicit condition<br />
<br />
C. Standards<br />
<br />
1. Predictability and grammar - Their interpretation moots out the words constructive and the government-to-government requirements of the resolution; only our interpretation gives definitional precision that makes the terms meaningful<br />
Richard N.</strong> <u>Haas</u><strong>, VP of Brookings Institute,</strong> <u>and</u> <strong>Meghan</strong> <u>O’Sullivan</u><strong>, Fellow at Brookings,</strong> <u>2000</u>** [“Terms of Engagement,” Survival 42.2]<br />
&quot;The term 'engagement' was popularised in the ...forces that will eventually facilitate cooperation.&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Limits – there are an unlimited number of minor modifications to existing U.S. aid policy, much more limited number of solvency advocates for particular quid pro quos<br />
3. Ground – they deny us core-of-the-topic ground from internal reactions DAs to change in Iran’s policies and disadvantages to conditional bargaining<br />

And, more evidence – Constructive engagement requires clearly defined conditions <u>Suffolk</u> <u>Transnational Law Review</u>, Summer <u>2002</u> [“Reassessing US Policy Toward Iran,” 25 Suffolk Transnat'l L. Rev. 535]<br />
&quot;See Hufbauer, supra note 80... new social order in South Africa).&quot;<br />

Constructive engagement is definitionally conditional, prefer our Crocker evidence since he INVENTED the term<br />

&quot;I think, just to bring this back to ...having been coined by Chester Crocker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their interpretation is self-serving – it’s an arbitrary, politically motivated reappropriation of the term constructive engagement that divorces it from original intent<br />
Crocker, 1990 - Former Assistant Secretary for African Affairs at the Department of State, and the person who coined the term &quot;constructive engagement&quot; (Chester, Fletcher Forum on World Affairs, &quot;Interview with Chester Crocker&quot;, Hein Online)<br />
