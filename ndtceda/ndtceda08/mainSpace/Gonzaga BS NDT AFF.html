<strong><em>Round # 2</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Vs. Team: Georgetown FM</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Judge: Bowman, Steele, Stevenson</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>Plan Text: The USFG should offer the government of Syria all government to government assistance necessary to allow the government of Syria to open the Syria-Iraq border to persons displaced from Iraq, provide services to individuals displaced from Iraq, and facilitate the resettlement of those individuals displaced from Iraq to Syria wishing to resettle in the US, and should request that the government of Syria enter into dialogue over this policy.</em></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><em>1ac w/ cites</em></strong><br />
<u>Contention 1</u><br />
<ol><li>Foreign assistance is vastly increasing across the board.</li></ol><strong>Lobe 07</strong><br />
B) Recent assistance to the DRC<br />
<strong>AllAfrica 08</strong><br />
There’’s more to this description of the status quo than a Uniqueness takeout- given all the ways foreign assistance is increasing, it’s crucial to investigate the policy of who the US decides to aid and who it doesn’t.<br />
In the wake of the Iraqi invasion, millions of displaced people fled to Syria and while Syria initially opened its border to Iraqis, our refusal to provide direct bilateral assistance to this ‘state sponsor of terrorism’ has forced them to slam their doors shut on Iraqis.<br />
<strong>Frelick 07</strong><br />
American lack of concern for the lives of Iraqi refugees reflects a cold, malicious calculus- debate on Iraq has focused solely on the consequences for us, with near total blindness to the consequences for Iraqis- this refusal to foreground what a disaster the war has been for Iraq is calculated strategy to keep reality from introducing into our belief in the benevolence of our mission to ‘liberate’ Iraq.<br />
<strong>Falk 07</strong><br />
As long as we refuse to acknowledge the refugee crisis- America will continue to proclaim we fulfilled our responsibility by ‘liberating’ Iraq- the belief this American made war and the human consequences are synonymous with ‘freedom’ treats the lives of Iraqi’s are disposable byproducts of a Middle East remade in our vision of freedom and democracy.<br />
<strong>Peteet 07</strong><br />
It is a limitless war left unchecked, the exceptionalist belief in America’s global manifest destiny and our immunity from the consequences of our actions will move from Iraq today to ever-new and escalating wars tomorrow.<br />
<strong>Burke 05</strong><br />
We must take collective responsibility for wars fought in our name; interventions in countries like Iran only go on because we refuse to take responsibility for them. Our acquiescence to status quo politics makes us complicit with the displacement of Iraqi refugees and with the destruction of their country.<br />
<strong>Hayden 07</strong><br />
Only including the perspective of those who bear the costs of our political decisions can challenge the ideological beliefs that justify the invasion of sovereign countries. Only by refusing to ignore Iraqi refugees can we take responsibility for the global political system we’ve created, preventing it from laying waste to the globe.<br />
<strong>Hayden 07</strong><br />
<strong>This is where the other scouts info on contention 2 goes</strong><br />
<br />
Asad just called for the plan, calling Iraqi refugees an America responsibility and demanding assistance and resettlement from the US to deal with the influx.<br />
<strong>International Rescue Committee 08</strong><br />
A substantial increase in the US assistance for refugee resettlement is key- opening our doors to Iraqi refugees would cause a wide-scale shift in US political culture, away from violence and militarism towards empathy and compassion.<br />
<strong>Pruce 07</strong><br />
The plan reframes the debate on Iraq towards a consideration of the consequences felt by refugees - anti-war activists have a responsibility to advocate a substantial, immediate increase in US aid to Syria - the plan, and our framing of the ballot, are critical to this growing movement of peace.<br />
<strong>Merall 07</strong><br />
Acknowledging the ways that the World is implicated in the crisises, turns a blind eye towards it, and provokes critical self-reflexivity, enabling the international community to accept responsibility for its violence and more towards a more ethical system of politics.<br />
<strong>Gurd 06</strong><br />
Until now we have refused direct dialogue with Syria due to Western essentialists stereotypes that have Syria as a homogeneous zone of Islamic irrationality - these representations are the cultural precondition for war on Syria - ONLY a commitment to cross - cultural engagement solves the case.<br />
<strong>Golson 05</strong><br />
Dialogue with Syria over Iraqi refugees affirms an ethic of engagement and hospitality - the plan re-centers our imaginative geographies around displaced peoples and others who operate at the margins of security and the War on Terror.<br />
<strong>Gregory 04</strong><br />
In the aftermath of Iraq, we must be open to new conceptions of freedom and security. Engaging Syria refugees refuses the legitimacy of violent foreign policy in the Middle East and interrogates America’s most recent imperial adventure. Only dialogue with Syria can challenge our preconceived notions of the world.<br />
<strong>Burke 05</strong><br />
The affirmative ballot is a decision to take responsibility for US government policy - the calculus you use to arrive to your decision must first and foremost consider the ongoing violence against Iraqis - otherwise our response to violent American foreign policy will bottleneck into established ways of thinking and doing policy, with renewed militarism as the result. Only a steadfast commitment to questioning the imperatives of security policy can pave the way for a truly inclusive and peaceful global politics.<br />
<strong>Burke 07</strong><br />
You should prioritize systematic violence against Iraqi refugees by offering them all available choices. Picking and choosing what to give the displaced emphasizes abstract security claims above human dignity, devaluing life. Reactive, security based responses to refugees transform the state into a prison - it’s our collective responsibility to foreground their experience when calculating impacts.<br />
