<br />
Counterplan:<br />
<br />
Text: The United States federal government will decrease the existing Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit based on the price of crude oil so that blenders receive a 0 cent credit if the price of crude oil is $65 per barrel or greater, and up to 45 cents credit on an increasing, incremental basis when the price of oil is between $65 and $0.<br />
<br />
The plan's withdrawal of government support devastates the transition to advanced biofuels. The counterplan is a signal that the government has their back and guarantees continued investment that will enable transition from ethanol.<br />
