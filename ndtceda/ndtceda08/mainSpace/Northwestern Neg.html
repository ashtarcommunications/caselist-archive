<br />
1NC Symbol K<br />
The symbolic power of the Supreme Court was from the beginning a fantasy. Invoking a timeless quaint performance of “the law” – robes and all – the aff buys into this dream in the most dangerous way. The aff’s claim that the law is symbolic creates the authority that sustains mass indoctrination and the collapse of critical engagement<br />
Lerner, The Yale Law Journal, 1937, v. 46, no. 8, jstor<br />
That is why men always find themselves… turned toward the past.<br />
<br />
This regulative, prohibitive symbol of thou shalt not provides the framework for pathological evil – the aff creates a framework where individuals can act according to the letter of the law while being relieved of the burden for moral decisionmaking<br />
Schroeder and Carlson, California Law Review, March 2000<br />
Man cannot sustain diabolical evil… functioning of the symbolic order.<br />
<br />
Public law’s obscene underbelly is the superego – its non exhaustive character require unwritten supplements – this takes the form of lynching parties, night pogroms, and structural dependence on male domination<br />
Zizek, The Metastases of Enjoyment, 1994, p. 55-7<br />
The proper way… the national Thing?<br />
<br />
Implications – link between power and its invisible threat – the regulative authority of symbol – requires an externalization of violence – this is what maintains nuclear terror<br />
Zizek, The Parallax View, 2006, p. 273-5<br />
So Bush was wrong… liberal-democratic model?<br />
<br />
“Suspending” symbolization is the only way that the terms of law can be altered – hope, freedom and agency are only possible by rejecting the fear driven interpassive, mindless political activity which waffles between choosing the bad and the worse<br />
Kay, Zizek, p. 153-4<br />
Of course, Grigg’s critique… could be transformed.<br />

<br />
The figure represents for some, stands for other; single normative judgment (Coke, scholar on colonization); know very little; is a screen upon which Mexicans find their identity; canonization is misplaced—the affirmative admits to a supreme, unquestioned good; reading the intersection through the lens of canonization is dangerous; her sacrifice glorifies abortion; this leaves out the moral ambiguity behind the issue (as Naomi wolf explains); canonization’s total erasure erases mourning for the sacrificed baby as well—not saving other women (for one moment, the woman thinks she is liberating others)—wolf; the fetus has values as well; Fullerton posits a zero-sum relationship between guilt and abortion—to use a term sin, it may signify a negative; but sin can be positive; an individual’s understanding of sin is personal—this leads to cooption by the religious right; instead of canonizing, we should treat her as a morally ambiguous figure—don’t glorify the act of sacrificing itself (another Mexican theorist); depictions of la lerona as a mythical figure who transcends gender, race, etc. are fallacious; best way to approach the practice of abortion—admit the death is a tragic death, and recognize that it must be evaluated in certain circumstances; canonization precludes this; strips the act of its moral ambiguity<br />
<br />
c/x: your wolf evidence assumes that we look at the fetus as not a person and something that is disposable –when do we say that in the 1ac?<br />
--When do we posit canonization as the ultimate good?<br />
--How does treating La Melenche as an ambiguous figure solve for guilt?<br />
<br />
<br />
2NC:<br />
Moral ambiguity is inherent in the story; both her and her child’s story is ambiguous; everything we know is based on second-hand accounts; canonization is the highest form of obedience—there is no room for blurry lines in canonization; calls all Catholics to aspire to her life and live as she did—leaves no room for ambiguity; can’t just transform the process of canonization because she would lie at the same level as disciples and below Jesus; canonization in abortion is dangerous because second-wave feminists would take over and say that canonization establishes abortion as an a priori good; this is the problem with some feminist movements in the way that they understand abortion—as an absolute, it is the strain of feminism that they would cause—it is impossible to alleviate all guilt; it is a morally ambiguous issue; the mother has to make a decision both for her and the life; we should recognize the ambiguity; feminists should recognize that this is a difficult decision; by saying the woman’s decision is not guilty or not problematic is bad because it treats abortion as not guilty at all and morally good; the people that feel as though the fetus is a life are isolated by abortion movements because they don’t fall on one end of the spectrum; wolf: alienate a big faction of the abortion movement because some are not sure where they fall; canonization makes ethical views impossible—we find that we draw this line too narrowly; humans have been incapable of recognizing who is and who is not human; this turns their argument about personal experience—the aff eliminates the ability to feel empathy for such people; ambivalent; “tool of empowerment for women”<br />

“this is not to confuse when the act of overruling actually” … “no matter how strongly prior case law suggests that it was”<br />

<br />
Roberts Disad<br />
Roberts set the tone for a legal process court that is separate from politics by narrowing opinions and avoiding controversial issues. Roger Citron, slate.com 7-7-6 “first term can be seen as a disappointment to conservatives because the court”<br />
<br />
Overruling a case just after a major shift in Court membership would annihilate Roberts’ attempt to isolate the court from politics. Neil Siegel, California Law Review, July 2k1, “In announcing the judgment of the Court in Planned…implications for the future.”<br />
<br />
If legal process loses out conservative fundamentalists will roll back progressive measures. Cass Sunstein, 7-6-5, Chicago Tribune, “Ever since the election of President Ronald…look pitifully timid.”<br />
<br />
Conservative constitutionalism would limit environmental protections like ESA. Glenn Scherer, Grist Magazine, 1-20-5, grist.org, “But as troubling as this initial erosion”<br />
<br />
Broad ESA key to bio d. David Scopp, U of San Francisco Law Review, 2k5, “Protecting an individual species is essential”<br />
<br />
Extinction. Diner 1994.<br />
<br />
Housing CP<br />
Limiting Milliken to its facts and remedying housing discrimination creates more clarity and prevents the unforeseeable explosion of court remedies. Steven Lock, Hofstra Law Review, 1992, “Even overruling Milliken I, in whole or in part is unnecessary”<br />
<br />
Providing assistance for housing desegregation efforts allows for interdistrict remedies without overruling Milliken. Meredith Lee Bryant, Harvard BlackLetter Law Journal, 1997, “the courts fashioned a remedy that was intended”<br />
<br />
Housing counseling and subsidized loans solve residential and school segregation. Gary Orfield, “Toward an Integrated Future,” p 357 “School districts should…ending busing there.”<br />
<br />
Residential integration solves political opposition to the plan, white flight and resource gaps between urban and suburban school districts. Molly McUsic, Harvard Law Review, 2k4 “The remedy of economic integration could require redrawing”<br />
<br />
Case<br />
Only the courts are sufficiently insulated from political pressure to pass busing remedies. Connolly 2k, <em>The Temple of Karnak</em>, online “It’s probably worth pointing out….media helps with the cover up.”<br />
<br />
Voluntary incentives are already available under current law – overruling Milliken forces coercive busing, not soft-line measures. Paul Gewirtz, Columbia Law Review, May 1986 “ordering an interdistrict transfer plan simply”<br />
<br />
The constitutional obligation fo the plan will overhwhelm the political opposition to busing. Charles Zelden, 1999 Akron Law Rev. “No matter what particular views of the judge”<br />
<br />
Political opposition to busing does not impact lower court decisions – lawyers and judges routinely love ordering it. James Fishman and Lawrence Strauss, Howard Law Journal, 1989 “The four member majority of the school board”<br />
<br />
Fear of political backlash will not prevent Court busing orders – desegregation will be interpreted as forcing busing. Joel L. Selig, U of Ill. Law Rev., 1985 “The Court emphasized that the applicable remedial standard”<br />
<br />
Busing is the primary tool for educational integration – political opposition derives from a deference to local control, which the plan fiats away. Wendy Brown-Scott, Ariz. St. Law Journal, 1994 “the Court deferred to the plea for local”<br />
<br />
Plenty of support for busing.<br />
<ol><li>recent resurgence of cultural nationalism guarantees groundswell of support. Wendy Brown-Scott, Ariz. St. Law Journal, 1994 “Parties seeking to improve education”</li><li>the plan will reshape political opposition to busing. Neal Devins, Calif Law Rev. “on the issue of busing, it may be that”</li></ol><br />
Declining academic achievement ensures permanent segregation – the case cannot solve without boosting educational quality. Diane Ravitch, Case Western Res. Winter 2k, “unless firm steps were taken to improve”<br />
<br />
The impact turns every level of the case – ensures massive public backlash and resegregation. Jennifer E. Spreng, Arkansas Little Rock Law Journal, Spring 1997, “in Virginia districts where more alternatives were available”<br />
<br />
Busing devastates academic achievement and reinforces segregation – most credible studies prove. Jeanie Oakes, Oct. 2k2 UCLA Institute of Democracy online “research indicates that forced busing unrelated to other educational”<br />
<br />
Federal courts are politically attached to busing as a desegregation remedy – it’s forced imposition poisons every level of the education system and erodes black communities exercise of self-control. Genevieve Mitchell, “The busing nightmare continues” online “under the aegis of the failed social experiment of mandatory busing”<br />
<br />
<br />
Busing systematically disadvantages minority students---reduced parental involvement and loweing academic achievement---empirically proven by districts that have embraced mandatory busing Jeannie Oakes, UCLA Inst. Of Democracy, October 2002 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.idea.gseis.ucla.edu/publications/williams/reports/pdfs/wws12-oakes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.idea.gseis.ucla.edu/publications/williams/reports/pdfs/wws12-oakes.pdf</a>)<br />

Counterplan<br />
<u>THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD RULE THAT CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT INCLUDES THE AUTHRITY TO ENACT THE CIVIL REMEDY OF THE VIOLENCE AGANST WOMEN ACT.<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should find that the District of Columbia Circuit Court’s decision in Rancho Viejo v. Norton (344 F.ed) establishes a broad reading of the commerce clause holding in United States v. Morrison.<br />
<br />
The CP avoids our disadvantages – it establishes a clear standard consistent Morrison’s economic activity rationale. Mathews 2k4 Yale Law Journal, “Viejo is equal to the task”<br />
<br />
The broad reading of the commercial activities rationale solves the case – enables sweeping congressional regulation. Mank 2k4 Brooklyn Law Review, “Morrison’s essential reasoning that congressional regulation under the Commerce Clause”<br />
<br />
The Viejo decision empirically upholds civil rights legislation. Mank 2k4 Brooklyn Law Review, “Viejo court relied most heavily on Heart of Atlanta”<br />
<br />
The incentives created by the CP encourage broad and expansive congressional regulation – makes it easier to determine constitutionality. Adler 2k5 Iowa Law Review “Rancho Viejo is that it focuses on the economic”<br />
<br />
The CP eviscerates the precedential value of Morrison – the only distinction between the plan and CP is the civil rights remedy. Mank 2k4 Brooklyn Law Review “breadth weakens the federalist underpinnings”<br />
<br />
Prefer our evidence – specific to the Morrison decision – the CP would contradict its central holdings. Mank 2k4 Brooklyn Law Review, “a broad reading of the commercial activities rationale would”<br />
<br />
The clarity of the CP avoids lower court confusion – addresses any confusion created by Morrison. Mank 2k4 Brooklyn Law Review, “In his Morrison dissent, Justice Souter argued that the majority”</u><br />
<br />
Kritik__<br />
Morrison codifies the refusal to adopt disparate rape standards – this is critical to mobilizing broader opposition against these myths. Motley and Wells 2k1 Boston University Law Review, “The enormous amount of attention devoted to rapes committed by such men”<br />
<br />
Maintaining Morrison on the books is the refusal to sanction the myth that some rape is not as real – this enables politics to achieve a broader understanding of rape and its prosecution. Motley and Wells 2k1 Boston University Law Review, “recognizes the invidious power of the myth”<br />
<br />
Failure to contest these myths eviscerates the transformative potential of the aff – perpetuates the root causes of gender violence. Jarusinsky 2k Fordham Urban Law Journal, “traditional notions of violence against women”<br />
<br />
The CP infuses debate with a more accurate and nuanced understanding of Morrison. Picart 2k3, Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs, 6.1, “civil rights remedy, still mime popular and mainstream”<br />
