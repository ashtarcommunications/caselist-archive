The Supreme Court’s holdings in Milliken v. Bradley attempted to address the problem of segregation within our nation’s schools. Nevertheless, the court’s failure to address discriminatory intent in Milliken allows for “de facto” segregation. Robert Pratt, professor of history at University of Georgia notes:<br />
“Brown v Board of Education Revisited,” Reviews in American History 30.1 p141-148<br />
The Court [then] would also… than full circle since 1954<br />
<br />
While African Americans have been denied opportunities throughout history, other minority groups have been granted access to an education that reinforces White western culture. Post-Doctoral at University of Alberta Rita Dhamoon argues that approaches to racial inclusion must balance integration with assimilation. She argues that<br />
“Beyond Inclusion Politics: Reconstituting the Political Order” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2005/Dhamoon.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2005/Dhamoon.pdf</a> June<br />
Inclusionary goals, in… on integrating into the core<br />
<br />
<br />
Any discussion of Asian American racial identities have led to a pervasive stereotype of Asians as the “Model Minority.” Nazli Kibria, professor of Sociology at Boston University explains that this stereotype essentializes Asian-Americans as well as the nonassimilated minority to further racial hierarchy of minorities that fail to assimilate. She states,<br />
“The contested meanings of 'Asian American': racial dilemmas in the contemporary US”, Ethnic and Racial Studies, Volume 21, Number 5 / September 1, 1998, p 939 – 958<br />
The model minority stereotype… Jewish American experiences.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though Asian Americans are painted as the success story of minorities, Kibria again explains that Asian Americans are stereotyped as a method of marginalizing in how the model minorities’ success are explained by stereotypes of inhuman robots, unlike the “normal” whiteness.<br />
“The contested meanings of 'Asian American': racial dilemmas in the contemporary US”, Ethnic and Racial Studies, Volume 21, Number 5 / September 1, 1998, p 939 – 958<br />
The ‘model minority’ becomes… the dominant US society.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professor of Wisconsin, Stacy Lee documents a narrative of an Asian American student detailing the regimented effects of the assimilatory stereotypes.<br />
Lee, Stacey (1994) &quot;Behind the Model-Minority Stereotype: Voices of High- and Low-Achieving asian American Students&quot; Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly 25(4):413-429.<br />
I used to go into classes, and… awkward if you don't fit the stereotype<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus we present the following metaphor:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v. Bradley on the grounds that intent is indeterminable without a critical understanding of assimilation.<br />
<br />
Our metaphor operates on two levels. The first is the critical engagement of how U.S. policy making in the realm of race relations creates racial tension/infighting and essentializes identities to facilitate the process.<br />
<br />
The second level of our metaphor functions as a discussion of the debate community. While the assimilatory practices outlined by the authors above may not appear prevalent on face within our community, there are real and implicit harms occurring every day. Those who are disconnected from their identities are not merely Asian-Americans, but debaters who have had to leave their social locations and cultural identities behind in the promise of access to educational means necessary to succeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We then talk about how the current college debate community is assimilatory in how people have to give up their culture and identity of their community adopt a predominant culture of the debate community.<br />
<br />
Richard Ford, Professor of Law at Stanford, points out that the race relations today is dealt with by both integrationism/assimilationism and separatism/isolationism, where those that are isolated and left behind are invisible to the political space, and a remedy to both assimilation and isolationism of minorities requires a view focused on the geography of the minorities.<br />
“The Boundaries of Race: Political Geography in Legal Analysis” 107 Harv. L. Rev. June 1994<br />
The tacit understanding of… racially identified political space.<br />

Paulo Freire, a famous educational theorist in 1972 describes that liberation education requires the teacher figure to consciously recognize that the formulation of subject taught is the object needed of receiving where instead the teacher can learn alongside with the student<br />
Pedagogy of the Oppressed p. 66-67<br />
Those truly committed… are “owned” by the teacher<br />
<br />
<br />
The IWK has done immense work for its local community in affecting their basic and unique needs and revolutionary education against oppression for empowerment which Fred Ho, participant of IWK and other Asian American movements in 2000 describes<br />
Chinese American baritone saxophonist and composer, first Asian American to receive the Duke Ellington Distinguished Artist Lifetime Achievement Award from the 17th annual Black Musicians Conference at age 30. Legacy to Liberation: politics and culture of revolutionary asian pacific America, p5-7<br />
<br />
<br />
What we can ultimately strive for is what Richard Ford explains as the concept of cultural desegregation which is distinct from racial desegregation in that integrated individuals do not have to give up their distinct culture from their communities. Once an educational movement occurs that can change the structures in place communities’ boundaries could be permeable and interaction between different communities would strengthen. Ford says,<br />
“The Boundaries of Race: Political Geography in Legal Analysis” 107 Harv. L. Rev. June<br />
Thus, cultural desegregation… they happen to reside<br />

<br />
Observation 1: Inherency<br />
An estimated 12,000 American indigenous women have been forcibly sterilized and are denied reproductive autonomy. This is a white assault on indigenous family systems and is genocide.<br />
Udel 01. (Lisa, &quot;Revision and Resistance: The Politics of Native Women's Motherwork&quot; Frontiers 22.2 projectmuse 10/06)<br />
Observation 2: Harms<br />
1. Reproductive justice for indigenous women cannot be addressed through traditional politics. These paradigms reify colonialst and patriarchal structures by denying indigenous place in reproductive self-determination.<br />
Smith 05. (Andrea &quot;Beyond Pro-Choice versus Pro-Life: Women of Color and Reproductive Justice&quot; NWSA Journal 17.1 pg 119-140 projectmuse 09/2006)<br />
2. Sterilization and western sexual politics subjugate indigenous women's bodies and exert genociddal and symbolic control over the population and maintain colonialist occupation of land.<br />
Waters 03. (Anne, &quot;Introduction: Indigenous Women in the Americas&quot; Hypatia 18.2 projectmuse 10/2006)<br />
3. A decolonialization agenda must interrogate the relationship between indigenous women's bodies and the land. Capitalist occupation of indigenous lands will lead to total environmental destruction.<br />
Grande 04. (Sandy, Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought)<br />
Advantage 1: Solvency<br />
1. Feminism must come to terms with our economic and colonialist occupation of the land. Our demands for individual rights, especially reproductive rights, ensure that the bodily endangerment of indigenous women and their economic subordination. As white feminists, we first recognize and then reject our reproductive privilege and refuse to be complicit in the occupation of indigenous land.<br />
Grande 04. (Sandy, Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought)<br />
2. Adopting a politics of red pedagogy decenters whitestream feminism and relates knowledge both historically and critically. Traditionalist knowledge within the context of social justice will bring about intellectual solidarity.<br />
Grande 04. (Sandy, Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought)<br />
3. Red pedagogy adopts a stance of critical resistance that broadens critical theory to make inigenous issues our primary task and holds these in tension to allow us to make decolonization the polticaly question at hand.<br />
Grande, 00. (Sandy &quot;American Indian Geographies of Identity and Power: At the Crossroads of Inigena and Mestizaje&quot; Harvard Educational Review vol 70 winter, proquest 10/2006)<br />
4. A rejection of patriarchal colonialism and adoption of red pedagogy is critical to ensure indigenous women's health and confront global imperialism.<br />
Waters 03. (Anne, &quot;Introduction: Indigenous Women in the Americas&quot; Hypatia 18.2 projectmuse 10/2006)<br />
Advantage 2: Imperialism<br />
1. Colonialism is inetricably bound to transnational imperialist aspirations. The project of &quot;nation building&quot; is violent and destructive to indigenous people and culture.<br />
Waters 03. (Anne, &quot;Introduction: Indigenous Women in the Americas&quot; Hypatia 18.2 projectmuse 10/2006)<br />
2. The United States is currently exporting colonialism to Iraq, perpetrating the displacement and eradication of difference in order to gain economically.<br />
Grande 04. (Sandy, Red Pedagogy: Native American Social and Political Thought)<br />
3. Decolonialization is an act of resistence and a rejection of the state's agenda-from sterilzation of indigenous women to nation building. To secure justice, we must adopt a mindset of red pedagogy.<br />
