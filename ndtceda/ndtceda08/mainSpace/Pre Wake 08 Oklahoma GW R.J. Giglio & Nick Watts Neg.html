Strategy A: 1AC as a k of the God Kritik<br />
Strategy B: Permutation as an example of how the God K is not a good k of the 1AC<br />
<br />
1.Extend Dylan &amp; McCor: We must question our knowledge before assuming to know God.<br />
2. They try to create categorizes. Our argument that time is circular. They make it linear time. We transcend time itself. They make it into a dichotomy.<br />
3. We think that time is constantly revealing itself to us.<br />
4. Revealing proves the necessity of the Permutation.<br />
<br />
<ol><li>They concede that if their alt is competitive with our alternative, then they are a will to power. Extends the will to power impact. Dylan evidence.</li><li>Their relationship to the past in terms of Christianity – but it’s circular, impossible to prove or disprove.</li><li>Alt is being towards animals. That very logic is standing reserve disads.</li><li>Their McCArthy evidence – there is no sovereignty, only being.</li><li>We should not reveal the topic to you. Their existence is a process of revealing. Intellectual though makes us deaf to hearing the animals in CAFO’s.</li><li>Their evidence doesn’t makes sense – the world alters itself. Christ is not determined our faith. Other potentialisities only our alternative allows for the openness. We should not foreclose potentialities!</li><li>No linke – we don’t say death is the end. nothing forecloses the divine essence. Carroll evidence.</li></ol><br />

 Strategy A: 1AC as a k of the God Kritik. Dyland and McQuarder become the framework that judge should view round. Alternative links because it reads into history what it wants to see based on assumptions that go unquestioned. Any determined knowledge in the world conceals other knowledge in the world, such as the Dali Lami. The permutation becomes critical to reveal what they conceal. It’s not about whether the permutation is correct, it is a way of seeing the world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Strategy B: Permutation as an example of how the God K is not a good k of the 1AC<br />
Double bind: either Christ constantly reveals Himself to us, which means that the alternative is non-competitive with the aff. Also means that the permutation is the only way to allow Christ to constantly reveal himself to us.<br />
OR<br />
the alternative is competitive, which the aff is open to.<br />
