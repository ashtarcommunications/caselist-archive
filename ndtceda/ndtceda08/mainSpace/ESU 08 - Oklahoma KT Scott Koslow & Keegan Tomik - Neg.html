Round 4 vs. Wichita CR - Hatab K<br />
<br />
The affirmative would separate peace and the good from destruction and evil. We believe we all swim in the stream of becoming, our life nothing but a fleeting moment in the ongoing change. we believe the war becomes peace becomes war, and that life is death and death is life we believe that we will all die and from our death new life will spring.<br />
Hatab 78 Nietzsche and Eternal Recurrence: The redemption of Time and Becoming pg. 18-20<br />
&quot;wisdom is one.....as &quot;myself&quot; as individual&quot;<br />
<br />
The affirmative's insistence on preserving this life and these values springs from a shallowness of perspective. When we move beyon our own private perspective we can realize that all things participate in the flow of becoming, that war, death and suffering are part of and constitute life, peace, and happiness. The affirmative's attempt to eliminate this flux can only result in devaluation of the whole instead we must affirm all life<br />
Hatab 78 p. 21-24<br />
&quot;but since human experience is initially....having to devalue its very ground&quot;<br />
<br />
The alternative is the view time as play. Rather than try to separate out past present and future to reshape time as a teleological force towards peace and stability, we relinquish the desire for knowledge and permanence and affirm life.<br />
Hatab 78, pg. 25-26<br />
&quot;if we grasp the thought of Hercleitus....a generated world in totality&quot;<br />
<br />
They fail to understand that the values they seek to preserve were created in the flux and struggle of creation. They negate conflict, and so deny the condition for the creation of the virtues<br />
Hatab 78 pg. 64-65<br />
&quot;from the &quot;darkness&quot; of becoming....by both form and formlessness&quot;<br />

<strong><u>MIND THE GAP</u></strong> </span><br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE’S APPEAL TO NEUTRALITY AND UNIVERSAL ANIMALITY IS A FIG LEAF TO COVER MORE SOPHISTICATED MODES OF EXCLUSION. THE AFF’S ATTEMPT TO “CLOSE THE GAP” BETWEEN HUMANS AND NON-HUMANS WILL INEVITABLY MAINTAIN AN EXTERNAL ENEMY—ENABLING ENDLESS VIOLENCE, TURNING THE CASE<br />
<br />
Rasch 2003. “Human rights as Geopolitics.”<br />
Yes, this passage asserts .... benefits of the liberal order.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE REPRODUCTION OF AN EXTERNAL, IDEOLOGICAL ENEMY ENABLES ABSOLUTE ANNIHILATION. THE AFF’S POLITICS STRIPS THE ANIMAL OTHER <em>OF ITS OTHERNESS</em> AND GUARANTEES TOTAL WAR—AND THIS VIOLENCE OUTWEIGHS THEIR TURNS<br />
<br />
Odysseos 2004. “Carl Schmitt and Martin Heidegger on the Limits of Cosmopolitanism and the war on terror.”<br />
The second criticism has ...humanity and cosmopolitanism.<br />
<br />
THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO AFFIRM THE HUMAN/NON-HUMAN DISTINCTION. THIS AFFIRMATION RENDERS POWER VISIBLE AND ENABLES AN AGONISTIC RELATIONSHIP GROUNDED IN RECIPROCAL VIOLENCE THAT LIMITS THE <u>NATURE</u> AND <u>SCOPE</u> OF VIOLENCE. DIFFERENCE IS INEVITABLE. THE LIBERAL ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE IT RENDERS EXCLUSIONS INVISIBLE MAKING VIOLENCE UNLIMITED.<br />
<br />
Rasch 2005. “Lines in the Sand: Emnity as a structuring Principle.”<br />
Schmitt, then, starts ... nightmare of political exclusion.
