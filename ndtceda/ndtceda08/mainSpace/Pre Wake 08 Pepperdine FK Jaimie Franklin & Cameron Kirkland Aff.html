Observation One: Inherency</strong><br />
<br />
<u>Rice is one of the most heavily subsidized commodities in the US. These rice subsidies perpetuate poverty throughout the world.<br />
Griswold in 6</u> (Daniel, Director of Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, “Grain Drain: the Hidden Cost of U.S. Rice Subsidies.” Executive Summary. Trade Briefing Paper #25. November 16, 2006. &lt; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/539" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/539</a>&gt;)<br />
<br />
“Rice is the world's most important… challenges in the World Trade Organization.”<br />
<br />
<u>The US works in a double standard, the US taxpayer pays 2/3 the price of production for rice so that the subsidized company can dump the product at less than its market price.<br />
Mortished in 5</u> (Carl, International Business Editor. “Oxfam hits out at US Rice Subsidies.” Times Online. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article379756.ece" rel="nofollow">http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article379756.ece</a>&gt;)<br />
<br />
“According to Oxfam, American rice… defend themselves from dumping.”<br />
<br />
<u>Massive dumping by US corporations has globalized agriculture, destroying the livelihoods of millions of small farmers.<br />
Shiva 2005</u> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 36)<br />
<br />
“Another myth is that…destroys livelihoods and incomes.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Two: Impacts</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>First is the destruction of women:</strong><br />
<br />
<u>Destruction of the rice industry in Ghana has forced womyn into the city where they are raped.<br />
Moore in 5</u> (Charlotte, “Ghana pays the price for west’s rice subsidies,” The Guardian. April 11, 2005. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/11/hearafrica05.development" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/11/hearafrica05.development</a>&gt;)<br />
<br />
“Many people come to Accra looking… These are deeply unfair,&quot; he added.”<br />
<br />
<u>Globalized agriculture has rendered women as disposable commodities that are bought and sold on the international market.<br />
Shiva 2005</u> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 130)<br />
“Globalization as a project of …especially in Asia and Eastern Europe.”<br />
<br />
<u>As opportunities in the marketplace increase through globalization, violence against women increases proportionally. The destruction of agricultural sustenance and the growth of commodification have allowed for women’s destruction through female feticide.<br />
Shiva 2005</u> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 137-8)<br />
<br />
“Dehli, India’s capital region … the dispensability of women.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Second is the Empire:</strong><br />
<br />
<u>Corporate globalization of agriculture has deliberately driven 30,000 Indian farmers to suicide. Small farmers today face extinction as agriculture is transformed into a negative economy.<br />
Shiva 2005</u> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 120-121)<br />
<br />
“One of the worst genocides … liberalization and corporate globalization.”<br />
<br />
<u>Mass suicides by farmers in the developing world are driven by US rice subsidies that uphold Empire.<br />
Redmon in 3</u> (David, “Privatization is Suicide.” Consumers, Commodities, &amp; Consumption. Vol. 5 No. 1 December 2003. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/dtcook/www/CCCnewsletter/5-1/Redmon.htm" rel="nofollow">https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/dtcook/www/CCCnewsletter/5-1/Redmon.htm</a>&gt;)<br />
<br />
“Neoliberal policies pushed… whether it's olive trees, corn, or rice.”<br />
<br />
<u>Empire has replaced colonialism with worse forms of oppression.<br />
Hardt and Negri 2001</u>, (Michael and Antonio, Hardt is a professor of literature at Duke University. Negri is an independent researcher and former lecturere in Political Science at the University of Paris. Empire. Harvard University Press. London, 2001. pg. 43.)<br />
<br />
“Saying that Empire is good…but instead increased exponentially.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Third is the monoculture of the mind:</strong><br />
<br />
<u>Rice is life: in many parts of the world, rice is a major part of life and is the foundation of culture and civilization.<br />
Gomez 2001,</u> (Dr. Kwanchai A., Board Member and Secretary of the Thai Rice Foundation, at the Siam Society Lecture Series, The Siam Society, Bangkok, Thailand, 20 September. “Rice, the Grain of Culture.” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.thairice.org/html/article/pdf_files/Rice_thegrain_of_Culture.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.thairice.org/html/article/pdf_files/Rice_thegrain_of_Culture.pdf</a>.)<br />
<br />
“For more than half… nothing left to preserve.”<br />
<br />
<u>Under agricultural globalization, positive indigenous cultures based upon rice are replaced with artificially constructed currencies dominated by capital and the welfare of corporations. A monoculture of the mind is constructed in which exclusion and genocide dominates pluralism and connectedness.<br />
Shiva 2005</u> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 112)<br />
<br />
“When reality os replaced…our food, and our dress.”<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus, Jaimie and I stand resolved that the United States Federal Government should eliminate all agricultural support and domestic subsidies for rice.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Three: Solvency</strong><br />
<br />
<u>Ending U.S. rice subsidies would end slavery in Ghana and Haiti.<br />
Bales in 7</u> (Kevin, Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Roehampton University, London, England. Ending Slavery: How We End Today’s Slaves. University of California Press. 2007. Pg. 168-169)<br />
<br />
“The issue of subsidies… their concerns about subsidies.”<br />
<br />
<u>The globalized agricultural system is a gendered institution that is formed upon patriarchy. Gender analysis provides a greater understanding of gender relations at the global level and the underlying structures that form society.<br />
Shiva 2005</u> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 131-2)<br />
<br />
“Within this period of globalization …proposing and implementing solutions.”<br />
<br />
<u>The global food crisis that is driving thousands of farmers to suicide is created by subsidies and lack of rural infrastructure. The only way to solve is to end discriminatory subsidies in the United States.<br />
Wehrfritz and Theil 2008</u> (George &amp; Stefan, “It’s the Stupid Politics,” Newsweek, Vol. 151 No. 20, retrieved from lexis)<br />
<br />
“The story illustrates… not to feed people.”<br />
<br />
<u>The US rice subsidy program is a national liability. Its elimination would bolster our economic wellbeing and create goodwill among developing nations.<br />
Griswold in 6</u> (Daniel, Director of Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, “Grain Drain: the Hidden Cost of U.S. Rice Subsidies.” Executive Summary. Trade Briefing Paper #25. November 16, 2006. &lt; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/539" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/539</a>&gt;)<br />
<br />
“Congress should also reject… leader in the world economy.”<br />
<br />
<u>The elimination of exploitative agricultural subsidies opens alternatives to corporate dictatorship and food fascism, encouraging a culture of life which deepens democracy and challenges the monoculture of the mind.<br />
Shiva 2005</u> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 68)<br />

<strong>Rice is one of the most heavily subsidized commodities in the United States and is concentrated among a small number of large producers. These subsidies artificially lower rice prices around the world, forcing millions of rice farmers into poverty.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Advantage One: Cultural Erasure</strong><br />
<br />
In most parts of the world, rice permeates all aspects of life and culture: from the food people eat to the gods they worship. Rice is the foundation of culture and civilization. Its hijacking by US corporations ensures its destruction.<br />

Globalized agriculture replaces living cultures founded upon rice with cultures of death centered on the welfare and greed of corporations. Capital has become the culture of our food, banishing the multiplicities of nature and culture and reducing the world to a monoculture that justifies exclusion, ecocide and genocide.<br />

<br />
When reality is replaced…and our dress.<br />
<br />
Without subsidies, corporate agribusiness cannot compete in the world food market. Alternatives to the global system of oppression exist at the local level, creating vibrant food economies, democracy and culture. Food is the foundation of world culture, providing spaces that transform food fascism and corporate dictatorship.<br />
<span class="CITEChar"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Shiva 2005</span></span> <span class="NotunderlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10pt">(Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 68)</span></span><br />
<br />
Creating the living…fair and healthy.<br />
<br />
<strong>Advantage Two: Violence against Women</strong><br />
<br />
Unemployment in sustenance markets as a result of US rice subsidies has driven women out of the fields and into the cities, where they are forced into poverty and often raped and abused in dangerous environments that lack infrastructure.<br />
<strong>Moore</strong> <strong>in 5</strong> (Charlotte, “Ghana pays the price for west’s rice subsidies,” The Guardian. April 11, 2005. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/11/hearafrica05.development" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/apr/11/hearafrica05.development</a>&gt;)<br />
<br />
Many people come… deeply unfair,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
Agricultural globalization has rendered women refugees in the food economy. As developing countries are forced to compete with global corporations in the world market, women are driven out of productive roles in society, and sex trafficking is often the only survival option left for millions who are displaced. The female body is a commodity on the international market.<br />
<strong>Shiva 2005</strong> <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Shiva, Vandana. <u>Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace</u>. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 130)</span><br />
<br />
Globalization as a project…Asia and Eastern Europe<br />
<br />
As globalization increases, violence against women increases proportionally. As productive work options dwindle, sustenance economies are destroyed, and consumerism dominates, women are denied the right to life through female feticide that has left a deficit of 60 million women in the world today.<br />
<span class="CITEChar"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Shiva 2005</span></span> (Shiva, Vandana. Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace. South End Press, Cambridge. p. 137-8)<br />

<br />
<span class="NotunderlinedChar">Global agribusiness is a gendered institution, controlled by a specific gender, race and class of humans.

Second, gender analysis…and implementing solutions<br />
<br />
<strong>Advantage Three: Death by Debt</strong><br />
<br />
US rice subsidies have driven thousands of famers around the world to suicide by enabling corporations to dump rice on developing markets and drive local farmers into severe debt and out of business. Death has become the only way to escape the vicious control of corporate food, as famers have no way to compete with the Empire.<br />
<br />
Redmon in 3 <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal">(David, “Privatization is Suicide.” Consumers, Commodities, &amp; Consumption.

<span class="NotunderlinedChar"><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></span><br />
Indebtedness due to the rising costs of production and the falling prices of food has led to tens of thousands of famer suicides in India alone over the past ten years. Corporate globalization constitutes the worst genocide of our time, driving two-thirds of the world’s population to a crisis of extinction.<br />

Lee Kyund Hae martyred…and corporate globalization<br />
<br />
<strong>Food is the weapon of mass destruction used by the Empire of corporate agriculture. Global agribusiness rivals the normative power of States, subverts democracy, and destroys individuals. In the current system, war is no longer an isolated event waged by government. War is permanent and is organized by corporations on the basis of food scarcity.</strong><br />
