PLAN: The United States federal government should decrease its agricultural support for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations by decreasing nearly all direct subsidies for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE 1- DISEASE<br />
SCENARIO 1 IS BIRD FLU<br />
<br />
Subsidized CAFOs make new outbreaks of bird flu more likely.<br />
Leahy ‘7 (Stephen, Feb. 20.  Inter Press Service. “Health: Factory Farms Blamed for Bird Flu and Greenhouse Gas” Lexis, accessed 7-22)<br />
Already surpassing emissions… market in Moscow<br />
<br />
And, Bird Flu is two mutations away from human to human transmission, greatly increasing the risk of transmission.<br />
News Target 07 (“Deadly is two mutations away from sreading among human”, February 19th 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newstarget.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newstarget.com</a> /021622.html)<br />
New research of the H5N1….   different main protein structure. <br />
<br />
Bird Flu is the single greatest threat to the entire population.<br />
ABC NEWS 05 (“Avian flu: Is the government Ready for an epidemic?”, September 15th 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime</a> /Investigation/Story?id �2�1130392&amp;page�3�1)<br />
It could kill a billion…. affecting human beings.<br />
<br />
A bird flu outbreak would create a perfect storm for every impact imaginable.<br />
The Guardian 06 (Larry Elliot, “Bird Flu could be 21st century Black Death”, January 27th, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk</a> /birdflu/story/0,,1696021,00 .html)<br />
Avian flu has the….<br />
...relations in Europe.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, it’s more probable than a terror attack and outweighs all conflicts.<br />
Zakaria, 05 (Fareed, Newsweek International &quot;A threat worse than terror,&quot; Newsweek, Oct. 31, 2005, pg. 46)<br />
Oct. 31, 2005 issue –<br />
A flu pandemic is…..  today’s deadliest threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, the plan is key-eliminating CAFOs significantly reduces the risk for bird flu.<br />
Greger ‘7 (Michael, February 28.  “Misconceptions about bird flu and pandemic influenza” International Vegetarian Union. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ivu.org/articles/net/bird-flu-misconceptions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ivu.org/articles/net/bird-flu-misconceptions.html</a>) <br />
The number of outbreaks…. like H5N1 could mutate.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 2 is antibiotic resistance.<br />
CAFOs are a factory for antibiotic resistant pathogens-multiple reasons.<br />
Doug Gurian-Sherman, (senior scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program), April, 2008, “CAFOs Uncovered: The Untold Cost of Confined Animal Feeding Operations,” Union of Concerned Scientists, Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/sustainable_food/cafos-uncovered.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/sustainable_food/cafos-uncovered.html</a>, accessed 7/7/08.<br />
An important disease risk… few effective antibiotics may remain.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, these diseases become airborne pathogens-turning humans into reservoirs for drug-resistant bacteria.<br />
Rule, Gibson, Buckley ‘4 (A Rule, K Gibson, TJ Buckley.  December 3.  “Multidrug Resistant Bacteria Found to be Airborne in Concentrated Swine Operation”  Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:YO6H9wuVcEQJ:www.farmweb.org/Antibiotic%2520Resistance%2520and%2520CAFO%27s%2520July%252011,%25202005.doc+cafos+antibiotic+resistance+disease&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=97&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari" rel="nofollow">http://64.233.167.104/search?q=cache:YO6H9wuVcEQJ:www.farmweb.org/Antibiotic%2520Resistance%2520and%2520CAFO%27s%2520July%252011,%25202005.doc+cafos+antibiotic+resistance+disease&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=97&amp;gl=us&amp;client=safari</a>)  <br />
The researchers believe… bacteria in humans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resistant diseases will exterminate everyone.<br />
Powell ’00 (Corey S., October.  Discover Magazine “Twenty ways the world could end suddenly” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1511/is_10_21/ai_65368918/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1" rel="nofollow">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1511/is_10_21/ai_65368918/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1</a>) <br />
If Earth doesn’t….. into the New World.<br />
<br />
And, now is key. Diseases will spread at an uncontrollable rate if something isn’t done.<br />
AssA-Irada ‘7 (“Spread of Disease Threatens Public Health- WHO” Financial Times Limited, Asia-Africa Intelligence Wire.  Lexis, accessed 8-19-08<br />
New diseases are emerging…  nuclear accidents, WHO said. <br />
<br />
And, the plan is key- pharmaceutical solutions will not be able to solve resistant pathogens.<br />
Pallone ‘8 (Rep. Frank Jr. on June 5.  FDA Advisory Committee Meeting.  “House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Health Holds a Hearing on Animal Drug Legislation” Lexis, accessed 8-18-08)<br />
Absent from the administration’s…. on the market working.<br />
<br />
AD 2 is Lagoons<br />
EQIP covers the cost of waste management- leading to the creation of lagoons that kill water quality<br />
Martin 08 [Andrew, NY Times, “In The Farm Bill, A Creature From The Black Lagoon?” 1/13, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13feed.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/business/13feed.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin</a>]<br />
Another change: large-scale…. said in a statement.<br />
<br />
40 times every year lagoons fail because of heavy rains and hurricanes.  Every failure releases  25 million gallons of feces and urine into the water supply.<br />
Goodwin &amp; Hallstrom 04 [Barry, Professor of Economics at NC State and Daniel, Assistant Professor of Agriculture and  Resource Economics at NC State, “Modeling catastrophic weather events and the risks of animal waste spills in the coastal plain of north Carolina” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20241/1/sp04ga10.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20241/1/sp04ga10.pdf</a>]<br />
One of the most serious… prevent lagoon failures<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And, severe weather is increasing in frequency and intensity meaning more failures are inevitable.<br />
Williams 05 [Amber, Writer for The Hilltop, “Scientists say hurricanes, global warming relate” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2005/10/03/NationWorld/Scientists.Say.Hurricanes.Global.Warming.Relate-1006777.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://media.www.thehilltoponline.com/media/storage/paper590/news/2005/10/03/NationWorld/Scientists.Say.Hurricanes.Global.Warming.Relate-1006777.shtml</a>]<br />
Scientists have concluded… because of global warming.<br />
<br />
CAFOs create major dead zones in Gulf and other coastal areas<br />
Gurian-Sherman 08 [Doug, Senior Scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program, “CAFOs Uncovered” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/food_and_agriculture/cafos-uncovered.pdf</a>]<br />
As indicated above,…. underestimate that contribution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dead zones create fish kills- change the sex, kill reproductivity<br />
American Chemical Society 06 [the world’s largest scientific society, it is a nonprofit organization chartered by the U.S. Congress and a global leader in providing access to chemistry-related research through its multiple databases, peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences. “Ocean 'dead zones' trigger sex changes in fish, posing extinction threat” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/acs-oz032906.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-03/acs-oz032906.php</a>]<br />
Oxygen depletion in the…. and industrial wastewaters.<br />
<br />
Impact is extinction<br />
David Diner, 1994<br />
<br />
<br />
Now is the time to combat dead zones- they are an ecological time bomb<br />
Science Daily 08 [“Record-setting Dead Zones Predicted For Gulf Of Mexico, Chesapeake Bay” 7/16, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080714160000.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/07/080714160000.htm</a>]<br />
Given recent massive flooding… flowing into these water basins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Solvency<br />
Eliminating EQIP subsidies is key to destroying the competitive advantage CAFOs have over alternative farming methods. <br />
Doug Gurian-Sherman, (senior scientist in the Union of Concerned Scientists Food and Environment Program), April, 2008, “CAFOs Uncovered: The Untold Cost of Confined Animal Feeding Operations,” Union of Concerned Scientists, Online, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/sustainable_food/cafos-uncovered.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/sustainable_food/cafos-uncovered.html</a>, accessed 7/7/08.<br />
In addition to the indirect… therefore remain unfunded.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eqip has ensured the exclusion of small farms- plan solves<br />
Same cite- gurian-sherman<br />
EQIP changed in 2002… operation size and type<br />
<br />
Subsidies for cafos create the illusion of efficiency- the plan is key to the success of alternative methods<br />
Same cite- gurian-sherman<br />
To assess the efficency… illusion of CAFO efficiency.
