<br />
The affirmative attempt to rationalize and stabilize a choatic world - in its prevention of chaos and suffering, the aff goes on a constant searh for what is inherently true in the world, id the will to truth<br />
saurett 96 J of internationla studies v25n1<br />
&quot;according to nietzsche&quot; &quot;philisophical principle of modernity&quot;<br />
<br />
the will to control the world inevitably leads to violence of all those cast as evil due to falling outside the known and risks falling into the tyranny of the herd destroying the things that make life worth living<br />
der derian 98 on security p36-41<br />
&quot;nietzxche transvalues&quot; &quot;not also diminished&quot;<br />
<br />
all is dark and the time of selection has come - only that which affirms and is affirmed will see the dawn, all else will remain in the abyss of the night<br />
deleuze 62 nietzsche and philosophy<br />
&quot;we know what transmutation or transvaluation&quot; &quot;danger of dangers&quot;<br />
<br />
life is contingent, death is inevitable. what happnes in that life can not be predicted, what ends that life can not be predicted. the search for a true and painless world only serves to create more suffering. Vote neg to transform life into an aesthetic experience<br />

&quot;for nietzsche existence is justifiable&quot; &quot;for the matter itself&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Nihilism is a yes/no question - we can either affirm or negate life - there is no in between<br />
taylor 96 &quot;embracing rather than negating life&quot; &quot;must be overcome&quot;<br />
<br />
utilitarian calculus demotes the individual to the status of equal and wrongly presumes the eradicating of suffering promotes good - suffering is an intrinsic part of humyn existence<br />
