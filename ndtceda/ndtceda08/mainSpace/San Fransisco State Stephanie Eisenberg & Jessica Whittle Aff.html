SLATER 06 (David, &quot;Imperial Powers and Democratic Imaginations&quot;, Third World Quarterly, 27:8, 1369-1386, January 06)<br />
<br />
D - Imperialist objectives are justified through democracy rhetoric - increases abuse of military power with an end goal of global domination.<br />
COULTER 03 (Colin, &quot;The New World Order of Things&quot;, Capital &amp; Class, no.80, p.5-14, summer 03)<br />

<br />
PLAN: Therefore, we are resolved that the United States Federal Government should constructively engage with the government of the Palestinian Authority through offering a security guarantee that respects the Palestinian election results and recognizes Hamas in their democratically elected positions.<br />
<br />
CONT 4 - Solvency<br />
<br />
A - US respecting results reverses trend of hypocritical democracy - ensures durable peace.<br />
FALK 06 (Richard, &quot;Respect Democracy? Engage Hamas&quot;, Topeka Capital Journal, 3/11/06, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ww.merip.org/newspaper_opeds/oped031106.html%29" rel="nofollow">http://ww.merip.org/newspaper_opeds/oped031106.html)</a><br />

<strong>TERRORISM AFF</strong>:<br />
<br />
We start with a performance of a narration and display of a terrorist and affirm constructive engagement with the terrorists of the five topic countries. We use Joseph Tuman's definition of terrorism, a means to create anxiety and spark conversation, to set up a non-traditional dialogical framework for the debate. Using Julia Kristeva's description of revolution as a paradigm of always questioning and Mark Edelman Boren's discussion of the important role of student revolutions, we say revolution should be activated in places like the classroom, and that our 1ac is the ignition of an educational revolution.<br />
<br />
Here's a few of the books we've read and used to formulate some of our arguments:<br />
Tuman, Joseph <u>Communicating Terror: The Rhetorical Dimensions of Terrorism</u>, Sage Publications Inc, 2003<br />
Kristeva, Julia <u>Revolt, She Said</u> Semiotext(e), June 1, 2002<br />
Baudrilliard, Jean <u>The Spirit of Terrorism</u> Verso; Rev Ed edition,October 2003<br />
Edelman Boren, Mark <u>Student Resistance: A History of the Unruly Subject</u> Routledge, 2001<br />
Asad, Talal <u>On Suicide Bombing</u> Columbia University Press, 2007<br />
Butler, Judith <u>Precarious Life: The Power of Mourning and Violence</u> Verso, 2006
