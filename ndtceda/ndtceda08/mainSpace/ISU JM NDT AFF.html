<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2AC Trick<br />
They used some of their arguments about Locality and Idaho to answer the kritiks. They didn’t really read cards in this debate.<br />
2AR<br />
Resentement is violent- creativity is important and individualism is the source of all violence and oppression (in this debate it was capitalism)<br />
All of their arguments are a justification for the permutation<br />
Competition is inevitable- will to power over the neg- don’t deserve ground, it’s a form of capitalism</span><br />

Kate Fleisher wrote a book on the Bear River Massacre and Rape when she lived in Pocatello we live only sicty miles away from one of the most terrible atrocities that happened in the creation of the American west<br />
Fleisher 2004 (<u>The Bear River Massacre and the Making of History</u>, p3-5)<br />
This 1AC was written under a tree, three trees to be exact. 1AC was conceived in the expanse between SLC and Pocatello, mountains rising and peaking all around amidst subtle barricades of rock and water, often frozne, two hours luike a body we know too well spines and opemning spokem first in Pocatello taking place hjere is Austin once anciently described as the land of fire….<br />
Laura Woodworth-Nye a Pocatllo resident , wrote this winter about Kate Fleisher’s recent work<br />
“Why, Kass Fleisher asks…the twin relics of barbarism”<br />
Globalization is myth that must be debunked, Pocatello resist assimiolation, there is not one homogenous world to come, the internet is not in control<br />
Austin seems to be more in step with the new industrial economies, historically Austin’s population doubles every twenty years, this stand starkly against Pocatello’s steadily declinging growth.<br />
…More stuff about POctello<br />
Appadurai writes…<br />
“The role of the backdrop in locating the photograph is more complex. Although it often locates the photographic subject in a certain sort of context, iot also locates the photograph in a certain sort of public discourse… Alll backdrops this direct the viewers attention outwards from the foregrounded subject of the photograph to a location represented in it and to the discourse in which the photographi is located, to which it is the potential contributor.”<br />
We carry Pocatello with us here and everywhere, it is not the middle of nowhere, the construction of nowhere places must be confronted, a dialogue must occur between world pictures, differences and similarities.<br />
