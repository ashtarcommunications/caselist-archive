 The United States Federal Government should substantially increase its constructive <br />

Contention Three: Solvency  <br />
<br />
The only reason Iran is arming itself is out of a security threat, but we won’t offer them a security guarantee; a perception that America is no longer a security risk would remove the nuclear threat. <br />

Despite claims to the contrary, the United States has received offers from Iran about doing everything we demand, a security guarantee would bring Iran to the table. <br />
