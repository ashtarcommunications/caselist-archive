THUS THE PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN BY INIATING GOOD FAITH DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS AND MOVING TOWARDS A NEW REGIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS, THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER A SECURITY GUARUNTEE TO NORMALIZE DIPLOMATIC AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, RECOGNIZE IRAN’S INTERESTS IN IRAQ, AND TAKE ALL PREVENTATIVE MILITARY OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE.<br />
IN EXCHANGE, THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN SHOULD HALT ANY RESEARCH INTO THE WEAPONIZATION OF THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM AS PER THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY.<br />
