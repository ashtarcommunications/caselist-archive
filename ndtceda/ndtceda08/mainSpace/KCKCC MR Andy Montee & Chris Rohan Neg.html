The aff's focus on relations between nation-states reflects a desire for coherent, unified national identity. This is impossible because every social body is filled with a multitude of perspectives. A focus on interstate relations is a mask for the violence that allowed the nation-state to exist in the first place. The inability of the United States to ever become a truly unified identity is translated into the creation of threats and dangers that we measure ourselves against.<br />

&quot;The complicity of…media personality.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Depicting the Middle East as a location of violence organizes the West to repress any movements toward self-determination, by representing any struggle against the nation-state as a threat to our collective identity constant violence is assured<br />

&quot;Collective security…redefining community.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This view of politics makes life unlivable and ontologizes the very dangers it attempts to control – Serial policy failure always already prevents the plan from solving<br />
Dillon and Reid 2000 [Michael, Professor of Politics at the University of Lancaster, and Julian, the Emergency Man. &quot;Global Governance, Liberal Peace, and Complex Emergency,&quot; in Alternatives: Social Transformation &amp; Humane Governance, Vol. 25, Issue 1, p. 117-1451]<br />

<br />
Our solution lies in the acceptance of the other. We can overcome our fears by looking beyond arbitrary ideas of national identity. We must move away from labeling and binaries and instead embrace a polititcs of the individual.<br />
<br />
Der Derian 95 &quot;On Security&quot; p26<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative is constant criticism of community – all identity is performatively created through the stories we tell. Rejecting their representations of national unity helps break down violent exclusion. This process is the only ethical approach to international relations<br />

T - Quid Pro Quo<br />
<br />
A. Our Interpretation. Constructive engagement is a process of reaching agreement by engaging in dialogue and arranging a quid pro quo, not an unconditional action.<br />

<br />
Offering means to present on the condition of acceptance<br />
<br />

<br />
2. More generally: tender or presentation for acceptance, sale, etc.; the act of making something available; an instance of this.<br />
<br />
B. Their Interpretation. They see constructive engagement and an offer of a security guarantee or increased assistance as a done deal. They don’t wait to see what the other government does in the plan text.<br />
<br />
C. Our Interpretation is Better.<br />
<br />
1. Limits for preparation. There are hundreds of possible security guarantees or small aid programs that could be given. We cannot be expected to predict and have relevant arguments prepared for each one. Defending for a process of constructive engagement gives affs good options that are specified in the literature.<br />
<br />
2. Ground for clash. Our counterplan ground and disad links depend on the reaction of the other government to the US offer. Their interpretation tries to avoid this clash by being unconditional. This destroys clash.<br />
<br />
3. Bright line standard for evaluation. The plan text should state some conditions for the offer. They talk about effects of their unconditional decision, and you end up making an arbitrary decision about whether they lead to constructive engagement to be topical, which is unfair.<br />
<br />
D. Voting Issue. For reasons of education and fairness
