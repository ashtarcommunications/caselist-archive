We begin with our first observation: Sowing The Seeds of Ignorance <br />
<br />
Rather than plant seeds for peace, US foreign policy in the Middle <br />
East is hampered by short-termism, ignorance and a cycle of political <br />
expediency. <br />

<br />
Finally, Iraq was invaded in 2003….. badly thought-out interventions. <br />
<br />
<br />
An endless commitment to guns and butter driven by political <br />
expediency and fear threatens our survival. Regardless of the motives <br />
of the acts, a failure to examine the consequences dooms the best <br />
intentions resulting in quick decisions and countless failures. The <br />
examples of us acting when there was neither an impetus to act nor <br />
sufficient evidence to support the action is a stark reminder that the <br />
ability to deeply examine the evidence will be the determining factor <br />
of our ultimate success <br />

<br />
Observation Two: The Burning Bush <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Bush administration has mostly turned a blind eye to the <br />
humanitarian crisis resulting from the war. The situation is <br />
equivalent to a Katrna-level displacement every two months. Embracing <br />
the struggle of those neighbors by taking a lesson from Syria is the <br />
only chance for real peace. <br />

<br />
The near-blind eye the United States… crisis emerging from Iraq that <br />
can be mitigated and controlled. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the refugee issue, the US Government has every indication that it <br />
has inadequate information and needs better information to assess the <br />
needs. Despite this, their plan is to rush in and act now, as the <br />
highest ranking US official on refugee matters, Assist Secretary <br />
Sauerbrey confirms in 07 <br />

<br />
Although we lack firm figures……. Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly our approaches to debate are equally culpable. By training <br />
individuals in this shallow form of analysis without regard to <br />
qualification, we execute policies in a cavalier manner that ensures <br />
that these problems will repeat in the next generation Branson in 07 <br />

<br />
Observation Three: The Tree of Wisdom <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The idea that the US as a nation should or would step aside and not <br />
engage other countries is laughable. From the United Nations, to <br />
secret Track II talks to regional multilateral groups, the idea that <br />
we do not engage these countries is a lie the debate community <br />
constructs to facilitate easier debate conversations instead of the <br />
more complex ones. Engagement is inevitable and ongoing, especially, <br />
on issues like refugees where we use the UNHCR as our intermediary for <br />
ongoing engagement with countries we claim to despise.. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
&gt;From The Economist print edition <br />
<br />
Foreign-policy &quot;realists&quot; celebrated…… forums such as the UN. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The vital question then becomes whether or not that engagement should <br />
be constructive? We answer that resolutional question with a Yes. We <br />
should do so constructively because why in the world would there be <br />
advantages to doing so destructively? The nature of our yes is <br />
manifested in our PLAN: <br />
<br />
That the United States Federal Government should increase its <br />
constructive engagement with the government of Syria by offering them <br />
a substantial increase in foreign assistance to aid in refugee <br />
resettlement in exchange for the elimination of entry restrictions. <br />
The plan will be funded, enacted and enforced via by normal means. We <br />
reserve the right to clarify intent. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our conceptualization of how to do that is to be led not by political <br />
expediency reflected in ideologies or but by the evidence, experience <br />
and work of those who are most familiar with the region both here and <br />
abroad. Our constructive engagement begins with the ability to share <br />
and use information productively and assist in the interpretation and <br />
understanding of said scholarship rather than the ongoing ignorance <br />
that classifies the conversation now. Refugees are a wildcard <br />
requiring complex analysis of interrelationships and dynamics to <br />
enhance US policy. We must acknowledge the importance of saying yes <br />
to the notion of engagement through commitments to refugee protection <br />

<br />
Conversely, ignoring this perspective… poses its own dangers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Success depends on avoiding miscalculations through acknowledgement of <br />
the complexity of the region rather than relying on faith, wishful <br />
thinking, partisan politics and unjustifiable expectations. Current <br />
methods will inevitably lead us from one global disaster to the next <br />

<br />
Transatlantic consultations, and in particular those between the <br />
European Union and the United States, started to materialize only <br />
after substantial damage had already been done. Until very recently, <br />
these consultations were largely limited to the activities of a <br />
working group on the subject of how to deal with rogue states. In this <br />
working group, the United States and the Union reached an early <br />
stalemate, with neither side showing any willingness to alter its <br />
