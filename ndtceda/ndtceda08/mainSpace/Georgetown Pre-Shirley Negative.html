Ethanol Sustainability Conditioning CP<br />
<br />
Sample Text: The United States Federal Government should eliminate the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit for conventional biofuel. The United States Federal Government should no longer require compliance with mandates that can be met with conventional biofuel.  The United States Federal Government should continue the Ethanol Import Tariff if and only if exporting countries refuse to comply with ethanol sustainability requirements modeled on Swedish sustainable ethanol requirements.  Tariff exemption requirements will be made on a country by country basis, and be granted under the Generalized System of Preferences.<br />

The term “concentrated animal feeding operations” is a nefarious use of doublespeak—a vague and indirect euphemism designed to mislead the public and promote inhumane operations. Images of mistreated animals are pushed out of our minds and animals become nonliving commodities.<br />
Mike Stammer, Staff Columnist, Variety, Thursday, April 27, 2006 - Volume 18, Issue 24, University of Miinesota, Morris<br />
Knowledge is power. …on in your own life.<br />
<br />
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS ROUTINIZED INVOCATION OF EUPHEMISM MARKS THE END OF ETHICS AND THE BREAKDOWN OF HUMANE GOVERNANCE. A LANGUAGE DEBASED BY EUPHEMISM LOSES ALL CAPACITY TO IMPOSE ETHICAL RESTRAINT. HISTORICALLY, THE GRAVEST GENOCIDAL ATROCITIES HAVE RESULTED FROM THIS SLIPPAGE. <br />

The malaise, unfortunately,…such things are done?<br />

this also turns the case—the use of doublespeak in the farming industry stifles animal welfare movements and perpetuates support for harmful corporate strategies by masking the factory farms.<br />

The evidence is overwhelming… words and phrases.<br />

the counterplan is key—Issues of language and rhetorical construction define our relationship with animals and the way policies are carried out—our refusal to use this euphemism is directly connected to the fate of animals.<br />
Arran Stibbe, Senior Lecturer, University of Goucestershire, “Language, Power and the Social Construction of Animals,” Society and Animals, 2001<br />
One of the main reasons …oppression of animals.<br />
