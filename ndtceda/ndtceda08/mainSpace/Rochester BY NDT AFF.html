 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>AT: Framework</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We meet – CA Zizek card that says we need action, and we take that action so you get yoru links </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Should” in resolution means we can be topical by using the plantext to meet a moral obligation. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Extra T is good – increases education, increases ground, PICS solve. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We should look not just to the USFG but to what our moral obligation should be which we believe to be to reject capitalism. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>AT: Cap K</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Conditionality is bad</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Cross apply our Zizek solvency – you must have a political action in order to be able to break down capitalism, change must come within the system. The K doesn’t take action so they do not solve.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Zizek’s thought…the political itself.” </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>At: Robinson card – Robinson’s ideology in a tautology of its own – their demand for rational morality succumbs to systems of domination they do not criticize.</strong> </span><br />

Cond bad.<br />
2AC stuffs<br />
Derridean deconstructionist ethics of hospitality only allow corporations to function outside the “law” and legitimate market exploitation<br />
DeFazio 2k3<br />
“According to this logic…determination by material conditions.”<br />
Taking an ethical stance over a particular instance of oppression or violence only obscures the systematic nature of the problem—even if the affirmative can solve for one instance of oppression, they justify its continuance elsewhere, and shut down the possibility for any radical political act.<br />
Zizek 2k2<br />
“Today we can already discern…of its own truth.”<br />
The ethical act is one that doesn’t merely try to solve partial problems within the existing coordinates, but which redefines what is considered poddible, therby creating the conditions for its own possibility. When confronted by opponents claims that we are just the old welfare state, or even risk losing our closest and most precious objects, we respond, “Yes, that is precisely what I am doing!” Only this act to strike ourselves so that we have the free space to act radically.<br />
Zizek 2k<br />
“Precisily because of this…idea that with universal healthcare,”<br />
Totalizing Critique is key to prevent the divide a conquer strategy employed by capitalism<br />

Plan &amp; 1AC is the same as on the wiki<br />
2AC:<br />
To PIC<br />
1. No link – doesn’t say “it” – just essentializing people bad<br />
2. No impact to this vis-à-vis capitalism<br />
3. No moral imperative, cap comes first<br />
4. Perm: Do both<br />
5. Focusing on language bad<br />

Thomassen 04 [Lasse, British Journal of Politics &amp; International Relations, V6 I4, p. 558]<br />
Robinson believes that, since Lacan did not … political theory.<br />
Robinson misreads the role of violence in Zizek<br />
Thomassen 04<br />
According to Robinson, Lacanian political … transcendental yardstick.<br />
Robinson groups 6 contradictory authors into one – can’t trust conclusions<br />
Thomassen 04<br />
In the may 2004 issue of this … post-structuralist perspective<br />
Cant take rationality for granted<br />
Daly 04 [Glyn, “Slavoj Zizek: Risking the Impossible.]<br />
Zizek is concerned to confront this alibi head on and .. passing to the act.<br />
And Robinson is tautological<br />
