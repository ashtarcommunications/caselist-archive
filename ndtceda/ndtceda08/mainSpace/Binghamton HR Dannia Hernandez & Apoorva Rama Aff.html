We stand resolved that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its support, for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations by eliminating all subsidies that sustain its existence<br />
<strong>Observation One is about the chickens and turkeys</strong><br />
<br />
CAFOs put over eight billion chickens through these practice each year Alone<br />

<br />
These actions are unnecessary and intolerable both for the consumer and<br />
the consumed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Two is about the cows where they can be the first to speak for themselves</strong><br />
<br />
This sort of treatment must be deemed intolerable<br />

Among the factors that make … exploitation of farm animals.<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Three is about the pigs, where the squeeling alone is proof enough of their suffering and pain</strong><br />
However, by simply publicizing these realities of nonhumn exploitation can change the situation<br />
