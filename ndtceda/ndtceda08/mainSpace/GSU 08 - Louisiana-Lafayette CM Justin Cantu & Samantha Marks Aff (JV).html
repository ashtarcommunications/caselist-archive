<strong>The Beast 1AC</strong><br />
<strong>Observation 1. Inherency. Beastiality is legal in many agrarian areas of the United States, there is no federal law preventing it and the support for the Agricultural lobby prevents passage of anti-beastiality legislation.</strong><br />
<br />
1. <strong>No National norm exists.</strong> <strong><em>Gieri Bolliger and Antoine F. Goetschel; 2006</em></strong> <em>[</em> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zootube365.com/dog-sex/girl-kissing-black-dog/16338/" rel="nofollow">Sexual relations with animals (zoophilia): An unrecognized problem in animal welfare legislation; Dr. Antoine F. Goetschel, Foundation for the Animal in the Law,</a>]<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">The North American legislation is influenced in many parts by British law </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">(Miletski 2002). However, in the US there is no national norm about the </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">admissibility of sexual acts with animals in force,</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"> so that its regulation is<br />
the responsibility of each state.</span><br />

<strong><em>2.</em> Lack of prohibition encourages the breeding and selling of animals for sex. Gieri Bolliger and Antoine F. Goetschel; 2006</strong> <em>[</em>Sexual relations with animals (zoophilia): An unrecognized problem in animal welfare legislation; Dr. Antoine F. Goetschel, Foundation for the Animal in the Law,]<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"><br />
Because zoophilia is basically exempt from punishment, the conscious supplying, lending or selling of animals for such purposes is not prohibited. Therefore, it is also legal to train and accustom animals to sexually targeted deeds.<br />

3. Big Agriculture moves to block any attempts to make beastiality illegal in the United States. Florida Animal law, February, 2008:<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"> </span><br />
<u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Senator Aronberg has pushed to get a beastiality law </span></u><span style="font-size: 10pt;">in the state<u>, and he's been shot down</u>. He'll support a new attempt this year by Senator Nan Rich out of Sunrise. Aronberg expects that legislation will also fail. He says <u>even though the crime is shocking, what's more shocking is that the state isn't doing anything about it. &quot;You're dealing with a lot of legislators from rural North Florida who are worried that the language in this well-intended statute could impinge on their farming</u> or rodeos or other things <u>done in rural areas.&quot;<span style="color: rgb(204, 255, 68);"> </span></u></span><br />

<br />
<strong><u>The animals who people have access to are the animals who will be sexually used</u></strong>: cats, dogs<u>, <strong>sheep, cows, hens, rabbits, goats, ducks, horses, bulls, fishes.</strong></u> Proximity allows for sexual access. This is the primary reason gorillas, chimpanzees, and others are not prevalent sex objects: they are not animals to whom humans have regular access. Many forms of sexual contact between humans and animals are physically destructive to the animals. <strong><u>Few vaginas, especially those of young animals, are large enough to accommodate the penis of a male Homo sapiens. Furthermore, small animals often experience torn rectums and internal bleeding after being sexually assaulted; chickens and rabbits are often killed by the act itself. Sadistic sexual behavior against animals also occurs. Chickens are frequently decapitated because this intensifies the convulsions of the sphincter, thereby increasing the sexual pleasure of the man. Even when it does not involve sadism, bestiality is animal abuse because it is forced sex.</u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">occasionally leads to acts of destruction, for which mechanical instruments </span></u></strong><br />

 <span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">(Weidner 1972). <strong><u>If it is sexually stimulating or even satisfactory for a person to inflict pain to an animal, to mutilate or even kill it,</u></strong> it is called “zoosadism” (Weidner 1972), of which again several types are known (von Hentig 1962; Masters 1965). <strong><u>For example, there is the type called “cattle stabber.” This is a person who kills cows, horses, sheep and goats in the context of his sexual deeds</u></strong> (Rosenbauer 1997). <strong><u>Other offenders strangle chickens, geese and ducks during the sexual encounter, or cut their throats, in order to stimulate themselves by watching the dying animal twitch</u></strong> (Dekkers 1996; Hoffmann 2003). <strong><u>In many places, specialized prostitutes</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">allow their clients to involve animals in intimate acts to torture and kill </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">the client or they are made available. A further form of zoosadism involves </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">setting sexually excited animals on girls or women</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"> (Masters 1965; Hunold<br />
1970). However, it remains to be said that not every slaying of an animal<br />
after a zoophilic act necessarily springs from a sadistic drive. <strong><u>Some animals</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">die as a result of unwanted “accidents” or are killed in the aftermath </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">of the deed by the perpetrator, arguably because of their disgust about their </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u>The principle of equal consideration of interests requires we count the interests of any individual equally with the like interests of any other. The racist violates this rule by giving greater weight to the interests of members of her own race. The sexist violates this rule by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own sex. Similarly, the speciesist violates this rule by giving greater weight to the interests of members of his own species. If an animal is sentient and if sentience is a sufficient condition for having interests, then we should consider that animal’s interests equal to our own when making ethical decisions.</u></strong> The essays in this book by James Mason and Mary Finelli, by Richard Ryder, and by Miyun Park show that we fall far short. Animals are used in a wide range of human activities, including agriculture, product testing, medical and scientific research, entertainment, hunting and fishing, the manufacture of clothing, and as our pets. In most of these activities, <strong><u>we treat animals in ways that do not show proper regard for their interests and thereby are unethical.</u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>One cannot talk very long about sex with animals without noticing the gender issues: Men are more likely to do it. Women are more likely to be depicted—or to be forced into—doing it. This type of bestiality, domineering sex, has long been used by batterers to degrade their partners. Battered women's shelters around the country receive reports from women who were forced to have sex with animals. One woman reported that her husband would tie her up and force her to have intercourse with their family dog. Then he would try to have intercourse with the dog while he forced the dog inside his wife. Forced sex with trained dogs was a form of torturing Jewish women in Nazi Germany; it was recently used against female political prisoners in Chile.</u></strong> Bestiality involving women occupies an entire genre in pornography.<br />

<span style="color: black;"> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="color: black;">Animal sexual abuse </span></u></strong><span style="color: black;">(also referred to as zoophilia, bestiality, zooerasty or sodomy) <strong><u>is the sexual molestation of an animal by a human, or the coercion of another to do the same.</u></strong> This kind of animal abuse includes a wide range of behaviors such as vaginal, anal, or oral penetration; fondling; oral-genital contact; penetration using an object; and killing or injuring an animal for sexual gratification. Animal sexual abuse may or may not include physical violence other than the sexual violation, and may or may not result in physical injury to the animal. <strong><u>Animal sexual abuse, like rape, is the eroticisation of violence, control, and exploitation. The sexual abuse of animals is often linked to the sexual abuse of women and children (Kowal, 1998).</u></strong></span><br />

Bears, snakes, dogs, and insects—to name just a few species of animals—have been photographed or videotaped in a variety of sexual and sexualized positions with women. <strong><u>sex &quot;clubs&quot; around the globe offer live scenes of sex between women and animals. Some towns along the U.S./Mexican border feature shows &quot;starring&quot; women and donkeys. Women of color are often depicted with animals as a way of enforcing the racist notion that women of color are insatiable.</u></strong> Through pornography, dogs, snakes, and other animals, help a man picture himself in the scene. What the pornography consumer claims to be fantasy, we must regard as documentation of harm: a real woman must have a real snake inside her for a photograph of a snake inside her to exist, a real woman must give oral sex to a real bear in order for a photograph of a woman giving oral sex to a bear to exist. <strong><u>In addition to being used as a means of degrading women, bestiality figures in racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and of course, attitudes toward animals. The imputation of bestiality has been used to portray a specific group of people as &quot;others,&quot; to distance them from those making the charges. Sometimes miscegenation</u></strong> (the mixing of races) <strong><u>is referred to as bestiality. One group of American white supremacists believes that Jews are descended from Cain, himself the offspring of Eve's coupling with the snake, while Christians are descended from Abel, the child of Eve and Adam. European colonizers and American slave owners believed that African women enjoyed intercourse with apes.</u></strong><br />

(Churchill, 1997, 35-36). Furthermore, Churchill argues in his Forward to Terrorists or Freedom Fighters: Reflections on the Liberation of Animals: “<strong><u>Given that the key to the ‘genocidal mentality’ resides</u></strong>, as virtually all commentators agree, <strong><u>in the perpetrators’ conscious ‘dehumanization of the Other</u></strong>’ they have set themselves to exterminating, <strong><u>it follows that removal of the self-assigned license enjoyed by humans to do as they will to/with nonhumans can only serve to better the lot of humans targeted for dehumanization</u></strong>/subjugation/eradication” (Churchill 2004, 2-3).<br />

In the 1950s, the Kinsey research showed that the frequency of sexual acts<br />
with animals was at a high level and that such actions would occur more frequently<br />
if the conditions to commit them were more convenient (Kinsey et al.<br />
1955). This is exactly what has happened: today, with the exception of a few<br />
Anglo-American countries, most states only prosecute such deeds if substantial<br />
and proven injury or pain is inflicted on an animal. <strong><u>Zoophilia represents a</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">problem in animal welfare </span></u></strong><strong><em><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Italic;">in general</span></u></em></strong><strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">, regardless of how widespread it is and </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">towards sexual abuse of animals by mankind obviously does not sufficiently </span></u></strong><br />
restrain zoophilia, the problem has to be solved by national legislators.<br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">Modern animal welfare legislations are based on the tenet that animals </span></u></strong><br />

<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">concepts, which in law has led to animals being seen as more than mere </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">objects or things. This idea transcends mere prevention of suffering, pain, </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">injury and fear, and denotes a general respect for the physical and mental </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">integrity of every individual animal. This includes, for example, protection from humiliation, excessive exploitation and interference with an animal’s </span></u></strong><br />

<br />
<strong><u>The term bestiality actually tells us much more about cultural attitudes toward animals than it does about sex with animals. Concern about bestiality generally focuses on human beings; thus experts tell us it is usually harmless</u></strong> while debating its frequency. <strong><u>If we call it forced sex with animals, we reclaim the animal's perspective as a central concern.</u></strong> It is more prevalent than we can measure and is not harmless; it is always animal abuse.<br />

<strong>9. Defining beastiality as sexual abuse deserving legal protections breaks down the Cartesian separation of man from animal, advancing ethics beyond anthropocentric concerns. <em>Gieri Bolliger and Antoine F. Goetschel; 2006</em></strong> <em>[</em>Sexual relations with animals (zoophilia): An unrecognized problem in animal welfare legislation; Dr. Antoine F. Goetschel, Foundation for the Animal in the Law,]<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"><br />
</span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">Offenses could be entitled “sexual acts with animals” for example, and </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">the wording could follow the proscriptions of human sexual acts with children </span></u></strong><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">(Bolliger 2000; Goetschel 2002). Despite that the doctrine still rejects<br />
such a comparison by the majority (Schwaibold and Meng 2003), <strong><u>the</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">unquestionable fact that animals can feel physical and psychological pain</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"><br />
(Luy 2003<strong><u>) surely means they should be afforded a similarly restrictive legal</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">protection of sexual exploitation, as are children and other people</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">. (Luy<br />
2003). <strong><u>It is generally recognized that the sexual freedom of an individual</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">ends where the right for self-determination of another begins. People who </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">cannot assert their legal positions on their own, (such as children and people </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">with disabilities), are rightfully protected by modern laws through restrictive </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">acts. Sexual contacts with these persons are prohibited because of their basic </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">need for protection, and it is irrelevant whether they possibly participated </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">voluntarily in such acts or were physically injured by them. To put animals </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">into this category with people, in respect of their being worthy of protection </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">from sexual exploitation, is only a consistent development both ethically and </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">legally, and does not constitute an improper humanization of animals.</span></u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>10. Legal recognition of the right not to be raped opens up spaces for a new relationship with animals based on cooperation. Gieri Bolliger and Antoine F. Goetschel; 2006</strong> <em>[</em>Sexual relations with animals (zoophilia): An unrecognized problem in animal welfare legislation; Dr. Antoine F. Goetschel, Foundation for the Animal in the Law,]<br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"><br />
But, above all, it remains a problem of animal welfare. <strong><u>In recognizing</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">animals as our sentient fellow creatures, we should afford them the </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">same respect for life, dignity and physical integrity as we would humans. This </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">can only be achieved effectively through the law.</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"> The general model for ethical<br />
animal welfare has substantially changed since the time of the abolition of<br />
the general national bans on zoophilia, such that the reintroduction of these<br />
laws is now conceivable. <strong><u>Only by doing so can this issue, which is traditionally</u></strong> </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">clouded by a certain “fog of repulsion, outrage and sensation”</span></u></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;"> (Merki 1948), </span><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">be effectively conceived, and the exploitation of animals for sexual purposes </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">can be brought to an end. This would lead, ultimately, to an intensification of </span></u></strong><br />
<strong><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">relationships with animals, based on actual partnership and not on exploitation. </span></u></strong><br />

<strong>11. Forging new ethical relationships with Nature is critical to ecological holism. Zimmerman, 1998</strong><br />
Michael E., Deep Ecology, Ecoactivism, and Human Evolution, Spring, ReVision, Vol. 8, No.2<br />
<br />
<strong><u>In view of the destruction wrought by this domineering, activist attitude toward nature, deep ecologists maintain that humankind must learn to “let things be</u>.”</strong> The practice of deep ecology involves fostering a nondualistic, nondomineering, appreciative, and respectful attitude toward the complex and internally related whole of the ecosphere. <strong><u>While modernity’s activist stance plunges humankind into the frenzy of the constantly expanding cycle of production and consumption and discloses nonhuman beings solely in instrumental terms, the deep ecological stance encourages compassion and benevolence toward all beings, conceives of humankind as an integral member of the ecological community</u></strong>, calls on people to forego mindless consumerism and instead to satisfy only their vital material needs. By emphasizing the need for such transformation, deep ecologists warn against merely treating the symptoms of our ecological problems instead of getting to their source. Addressing the symptoms amounts to an effort to reform the practice of anthropocentric humanism so as to avoid outright species suicide while maintaining a high material living standard for humankind (or at least for wealthy people in First World countries!). <strong><u>While acknowledging the need for reformism in the short run, deep ecologists maintain that in the long run, major ecological problems will be resolved only if humankind abandons the anthropocentric humanism that spawns those problems.</u></strong> An ecocentric humankind would spontaneously, though gradually, adopt practices that are consistent with longterm enhancement of all life on the <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">plane</span>t. People necessarily would continue to intervene in and to take the lives of nonhuman beings, but they would do so with discrimination and not for trivial reasons. Ecocentrism recognizes the fact that living things maintain themselves at the expense of other living things. <strong><u>Learning to “let things be,” then, would include letting humanity be. Authentic Self-realization, however, as we have seen, would be consistent with practices that would encourage the selfrealization of all life on Earth.</u></strong><br />

12. Failure to repair our relations with non-humans results in ontological damnation, outweighing all other impacts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Zimmerman, 1997</strong><br />
Michael, “Contesting the Earth’s Future: Radical Ecology and Postmodernity”, p. 19-20<br />
<br />
Heidegger asserted that <strong><u>human self-assertion, combined with the eclipse of being, threatens the relation between being and human</u></strong> Dasein. <strong><u>Loss of this relation would be even more dangerous than a nuclear war that might &quot;bring about the complete annihilation of humanity and the destruction of the earth.&quot;</u></strong> This controversial claim is comparable to the Christian teaching that it is better to forfeit the world than to lose one's soul by losing one's relation to God. Heidegger apparently though along these lines: <strong><u>it is possible that after a nuclear war, life might once again emerge, but it is far less likely that there will ever again occur an ontological clearing through which such life could manifest itself</u></strong>, Further<u>. <strong>since modernity's one-dimensional disclosure of entities virtually denies them any 'being&quot; at all, the loss of humanity's openness for being is already occurring. Modernity's background mood is horror in the face of nihilism, which is consistent with the aim of providing material &quot;happiness&quot; for everyone by. reducing nature to pure energy.</strong></u> The unleashing of vast quantities of energy in nuclear war would be equivalent to modernity's slow-motion destruction of nature; unbounded destruction would equal limitless consumption<u>. <strong>If humanity avoided nuclear war only to survive as contented clever animals</strong></u>. Heidegger -believed <strong>we <u>would exist in a state of ontological damnation: hell on earth, masquerading as material paradise.</u></strong>
