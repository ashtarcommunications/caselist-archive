The Status Quo:<br />
There is an &quot;overclass&quot; in America that holds a prejudice against rural Americans and their &quot;flyover&quot; regions of the country - Yet these same people are quick to jump on the economic benefits of investing in the Midwest...<br />
Schwarz 96<br />
<br />
The heartland is changing: land is being cleared for corn ethanol production, and the growth of corporate farms has been marked with cutthroat competition, loss of community, and nearly 2/3 of the farmers that used to work the land<br />
'Davey 2008'<br />
<br />
Ethanol is driving down the quality of life in the American Midwest. COmmunities are seeking to stop the growing ethanol industry. The industry is raising encironmental concerns, the cost of feed for livestock producers, and the price of land for locals<br />
'Davey 2007'<br />
<br />
Inequality plauges the Midwest - Corporate superfarms accound for 5% of landowners and own 75% of land. THey, like ADM, are the beneficiaries of the government payouts. Not only has this led to extreme pverty in rural counties, but it has also led to the loss of the Jeffersonian vision in community and family values in rural America 'Scwharz 96'<br />
<br />
ASM, the major producer of ethanol chooses gropus that enable most profitable and encompassing growth possibilities: this represents the epitome of neo-imperialism as they choose rural America as an opportunity to exploit for economic gain<br />
'Herr 96'<br />
<br />
All this, and the Federal government still provides massive subsidies to the ethanol industry at all levels of ethanol production and consumption<br />
'Koplow 07'<br />
<br />
In our present political climate, rural areas are regarded as the location of agriculture and farm subsidies are cast as the deferal government's attempt to sput economic growth in such areas. However, when the very subsidies aimed at helping rural areas actually function to the detriment of rural residents those people are stigmatized as backward and rendered politically invisible<br />
'Bassett 2003'<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this is all a product of the prevailing system of neoliberal capitlaism. The neo-liberal development project fails o sevceral levels. First, it is practically impossible to cause meanigful development in those places that do not fit into the neo-liebral framework. Second, the normative aspects of neo-liebral development reinforce cultural elitism and neocolonial imperalism.<br />
'Brohman 1995'<br />
<br />
Finally, the logic of neoliberalism collapses in sacrificial destruction and genocide<br />
'Santos 2003'<br />
<br />
Plan text: Therefore we offer for your consideration the following plan: Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support of biofuels by removing all of tis domestinc subsidies for hte production of ethanol.<br />
<br />
And the plan is a critical first step. While no singular piece of legislation can end the neoliberal practice of rural marginalizaiton policy-makers must begin with the recognition that the problematic practices of ruralism exist<br />
'Bassett 2003'<br />
<br />
Cutting subsidies will set a precedent of opposing capitalism link by link - Conceiving totality as a frame within which hegemonic practices operate is inappropriate; the frame itself has to be constituted through hegemonic practices. Therefore, we must challenge the universality of capitlaism by attacking it from the inside out<br />
