JUDICIAL CAPITAL:<br />
We’ve run two scenarios, EPA v. MA and EPA v. Defenders of the Wildlife<br />
<br />
<br />
Judicial Capital 1NC – EPA V. MA<br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness<br />
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear Massachusetts v. EPA. A decision in favor of the states is key to federal emissions regulations. The court is currently favoring the states<br />
<br />
Washington Post 2006 (June 27, “High Court to Hear Greenhouse Gas Case; States, Groups Push for Regulation,” L/N) <em>Pitt- MF</em><br />
<br />
<em>The Supreme Court agreed yesterday… not a matter of if, but when.&quot;</em><br />
<br />
<em>B. Links</em><br />
<em>1. The Supreme Court recognizes controversial decisions – they’ll hold back from successive controversial decisions in order to preserve capital</em><br />

<br />
</em>To the degree that a justice cares… decision from the Framers’ intentions.<em><br />
<br />
</em>2. Massachusetts v. EPA would be a controversial decision- it involves an issue that is at the heart of the biggest environmental debate and the stakes of the decision are huge<em><br />
<br />
</em>Clean Air Report 2006 (June 29, “High Court Wetlands Ruling Could Shape Arguments in CO2 Suit,” L/N)<em> Pitt-<br />
MF<br />
<br />
&quot;The Supreme Court took the case… affect every sector of the U.S. economy.&quot;<br />
<br />
C. Impacts<br />
1. A ruling in favor of the states is key to solve global warming- it will classify CO2 as a pollutant, sending a signal to state and international governments<br />
<br />
New York Times 2006 (July 8, “Global Warming and the Courts,” L/N) </em>Pitt - MF<em><br />
<br />
</em>In a move that has caused both delight… hide behind a legal fiction.<em><br />
<br />
</em>2. CO2 concentrations from US emissions cause biodiversity loss and species extinction<em><br />
<br />
</em>Diener 2006 (Shari L., JD Candidate at William and Mary College of Law, “Ratification of Kyoto Aside: How International Law and Market Uncertainty Obviate the Current US Approach to Climate Change Emissions,” 47 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 2089, L/N)<em> Pitt- MF<br />

</em>Currently, more than 10,000 species… Africa and South America.<em><br />
<br />
JUDICIAL CAPITAL 1NC- EPA V. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE<br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness-<br />
1. Court is hearing EPA v. Defenders of Wildlife, court capital needed to vote against EPA<br />
Los Angeles Daily Journal 2007 (Feb 1, “EPA Flops with Legal Flip,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.defenders.org/publications/sections/epa-v-defenders-daily-journal-oped.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenders.org/publications/sections/epa-v-defenders-daily-journal-oped.pdf</a>, accessed 21 Feb 2007) </em> pitt-mf<br />
Did Congress mean what… endangered or threatened species.<br />
<br />
2. EPA will lose in status quo<br />
Los Angeles Daily Journal 2007 (Feb 1, “EPA Flops with Legal Flip,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.defenders.org/publications/sections/epa-v-defenders-daily-journal-oped.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenders.org/publications/sections/epa-v-defenders-daily-journal-oped.pdf</a>, accessed 21 Feb 2007) <em> pitt-mf<br />
That was then. In a complete reversal… decisions and administrative practice.<br />

<br />
1. Overruling costs court capital<br />

<br />
Second, following Radin (1925) and Posner (2003, 2005),… we revisit this issue.<br />
<br />
2. Justices perceive capital as finite- they’ll hold back from successive controversial decisions to preserve capital<br />
Peretti 1999 (Terri J., In Defense of a Political Court, p. 153, accessed via ebrary, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/pitt/Doc?id=10002097&amp;ppg=163" rel="nofollow">http://site.ebrary.com/lib/pitt/Doc?id=10002097&amp;ppg=163</a>)<em> Pitt- MF<br />

<br />
1. Defenders of the Wildlife case will determine the strength and primacy of the Endangered Species Act<br />
<br />
Marten Law Group 2007 (“Supreme Court to Decide Whether ESA Has Supremacy Over Other Environmental Laws,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.martenlaw.com/news/?20070110-esa-supremacy-case" rel="nofollow">http://www.martenlaw.com/news/?20070110-esa-supremacy-case</a>, accessed 16 Feb 2007) </em> pitt-mf<br />

3. Protection of species key to prevent extinction<br />

<br />
Many of the decisions that have been criticized… strong reactions that occurred during the New Deal.<br />
<br />
MINIMALISM-<br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness-<br />
Roberts is setting the tone for minimalism. A perception of genuine adherence to minimalism is key to prevent a swing into conservative fundamentalism<br />
<br />
Citron 2006 (Rodger, assistant professor of law at Touro Law Center, “John Roberts’ Marked, and Positive, Influence on the Supreme Court,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2145159/" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/id/2145159/</a>, accessed 31 Jan 2007) <em> pitt-mf<br />
<br />
Every year, immediately after the Supreme Court… distancing the court from the political fray.<br />
<br />
<br />
B. Links -<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Respect for precedent is at the core of minimalism. The plan is a severe departure, falling trap to fundamentalism<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunstein 2005 (Cass, professor of law at UChicago, Radicals in Robes, p. 27-8) </em> pitt-mf<br />
<br />
Minimalists believe that a free society… undoing the fabric of existing law.<br />
<br />
2. <strong>A swing into fundamentalism embodies the worst form of originalism. The court will rob Congress of authority and eradicate affirmative action</strong><br />
<strong>Sunstein 2005 (Cass, professor of law at University of Chicago, “Why We Must Strive for Balance,”</strong>  <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/sunsteincourtbalance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.uchicago.edu/news/sunsteincourtbalance.html</a>, accessed 31 Jan 2007) // pitt-mf<br />

<br />
The ability of American businesses to thrive… problem-solving from multiple perspectives.<br />

2. US economic slowdown has far-reaching effects and results in a major worldwide depression<br />

History bears out that desperate… at least for many decades.<br />
<br />
2NC:<br />
Minimalism is key to democracy- leaves issues open for deliberation<br />
<br />
Sunstein 1999 (Cass, professor of law at UChicago, One Case at a Time, p. 4) <em> pitt-mf<br />
There is a relationship between judicial minimalism… unthinking hatred or contempt.<br />
<br />
Minimalism demands adherence to the passive virtues of narrow decisions and avoiding controversies<br />
<br />
Bateup 2006 (Christine, JSD Candidate at NYU School of Law, “The Dialogic Promise Assessing the Normative Potential of Theories of Constitutional Dialogue,” 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 1109, p. lexis) </em> pitt-mf<br />

<br />
Media/academic commentary is exaggerated- court’s overrules this term will not be controversial- overrules will only occur when precedent has already been weakened<br />
Sedler 2006 (Robert A., professor of law at Wayne State University, “The Supreme Court Will Not Overrule Roe v. Wade,” 34 Hofstra L. Rev. 1207, p. lexis) <em> pitt-mf<br />
The most important component in Supreme Court… been on the Court at the time of the decision.<br />
<br />
Roberts will lead the court to decided PBA case on narrow grounds<br />
<br />
Rosen 2006 (Jeffrey, professor of law at GWU, Dec. 11, The New Republic, “Partial Solution,” p. lexis) </em> pitt-mf<br />
<br />
In his questions on November 8, Roberts seemed… Roberts embraced in his confirmation hearings.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUIRIN CONGRESS CP:<br />
Case-by-case nature of Supreme Court rulings means they can’t provide an overarching and specific policy for Guantanamo and as such do not send a signal that the US is complying with international law. Congressional legislation provides the best blueprint for protections afforded to detainees and sends a strong international signal<br />
<br />
Rooney 2006 (Heather L., JD Candidate at Drake University Law School, “PARLAYING PRISONER PROTECTIONS: A LOOK AT THE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SUPREME COURT DECISIONS THAT SHOULD BE GOVERNING OUR TREATMENT OF GUANTANAMO DETAINEES,” 54 Drake L. Rev. 679, L/N)<em>pitt-mf<br />

<br />
Will this question of whether the status… cooperation both at home and abroad.<br />
<br />
<br />
MORRISON 13TH AMDT CP:<br />
<br />
13th amendment counterplan solves the public/private divide, frames domestic violence as a human rights abuse, and cannot be struck down under Morrison’s Commerce Clause and 14th amendment holdings<br />
<br />
<br />
Tsesi 2004 (Alexander, visiting professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, “Furthering American Freedom: Civil Rights &amp; the Thirteenth Amendment,” 45 B.C. L. Rev. 307, p. lexis) </em> pitt-mf<br />

<br />
Re-enacting VAWA through the 13th will not be struck down- Morrison precedent does not threaten the CP<br />
<br />
Perone 2006 (Angie, JD Candidate at UC Hastings, “Unchain My Heart: Slavery as a Defense to the Dismantle of the Violence Against Women Act,” 17 Hastings Women’s L.J. 115, p. lexis) <em> pitt-mf<br />
<br />
Finally, the civil rights remedy encountered… the Violence Against Women Act.<br />
<br />
MILLIKEN BAN CARS CP:<br />
Text: The United States Congress should pass legislation that bans the use of personal automotive transportation use in all urban and suburban areas of the United States. All federal funds used to subsidize automotive manufacturing and urban transportation infrastructure should be reallocated to develop heavy rail metro services or other comparable public transportation systems. Enforcement guaranteed. Future speeches will clarify.<br />

Solvency:<br />

1) Freedom of movement offered by the automobile is the root cause of the need to push school integration as a partial remedy. Our counterplan solves the entire impact of your case AND the reason that school desegregation needs to happen<br />
<br />
Rae – 2001 (Douglas W., “VIACRATIC AMERICA: Plessy on Foot v. Brown on Wheels,” </em>Annual Review of Political Science<em> 4, June, p. 417-38)<br />
At the twenty-first century's dawning, <u>the very limited efficacy… perpetuation of advantage.</u><br />

CASEY PRO-LIFE ABROGATE STARE DECISIS CP:<br />
THE NECESSARY AND PROPER CLAUSE GIVES CONGRESS THE POWER TO ABROGATE THE STARE DECISIS EFFECT OF CASEY—YIELDING THE SAME RESULTS AS OVERRULING THE CASE<br />
<br />
Paulsen, University of Minnesota law prof, 00 [Michael Stokes, “Abrogating Stare Decisis by Statute: May Congress Remove the Precedential Effect of Roe and Casey”, Yale Law Journal, May, lexis nexis</em>wpdu cw]<br />
<br />
By virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause… rationale of the earlier precedent.<br />
<br />
<br />
CASEY PRO-CHOICE STATES CP:<br />
After Casey, the best strategy for protecting reproductive rights is in state courts- not federal constitutional protection<br />
<br />
O’Neill [law prof @ Cleveland-Marshall] 1993<br />
(Kevin Francis, also the State Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, “The Road Not Taken: State Constitutions As an Alternative Source of Protection for Reproductive Rights,” <em>New York Law School Journal of Human Rights</em>, Fall, page Lexis) /Pitt-MPB.<br />
<br />
Lawyers seeking constitutional protection… that may be applicable to abortion regulations. n11<br />
<br />
“THE GIFT” K:<br />
A) Link: The plan’s extension of rights to the disempowered is a ruse. Laws intended to empower minorities are narcissistic gifts.<br />
<br />
BRUCE A. ARRIGO and CHRISTOPHER R. WILLIAMS 2000 “The (Im)Possibility of Democratic Justice and the 'Gift' of the Majority” <em>Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice,</em> Vol. 16 No. 3, August 2000 321-343<em>wpdu-jmm<br />
<br />
Derrida’s explication of the gift provides an insightful metaphor… furtherance of a cultural politics of difference and recognition.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Impact: ONE – This inauthentic gift of rights engages in an economy of calculation that makes true justice impossible<br />
<br />
BRUCE A. ARRIGO and CHRISTOPHER R. WILLIAMS 2000 “The (Im)Possibility of Democratic Justice and the 'Gift' of the Majority” </em>Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice,<em> Vol. 16 No. 3, August 2000 321-343</em>wpdu-jmm<br />
This is the relationship between the gift and justice… . have anything up my sleeve” (p. 149).<br />
<br />
TWO – the economy of calculation is the zero-point of the holocaust<br />
<br />
Michael Dillon [Univ. Lancaster] 1999 “Another Justice” <em>Political Theory</em> 27.2 (April) pg 155-175 <em>wpdu.jmm<br />
<br />
Economies of evaluation necessarily… bringing an end to the requirement for decision.<br />
<br />
C) Alternative: “ Reject the narcissistic gift of rights and embrace a cultural politics of difference rooted in contingency.”<br />
<br />
BRUCE A. ARRIGO and CHRISTOPHER R. WILLIAMS 2000 “The (Im)Possibility of Democratic Justice and the 'Gift' of the Majority” </em>Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice,<em> Vol. 16 No. 3, August 2000 321-343</em>wpdu-jmm<br />
This re-presentation of equality, this justice… forever deferred, displaced, fractured, and always to come (Derrida, 1997).<br />

Judicial Capital 1NC<br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness<br />
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear Massachusetts v. EPA. A decision in favor of the states is key to federal emissions regulations. The court is currently favoring the states<br />
<br />
Washington Post 2006 (June 27, “High Court to Hear Greenhouse Gas Case; States, Groups Push for Regulation,” L/N) <em>Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court agreed yesterday… not a matter of if, but when.&quot;<br />
<br />
B. Links<br />
1. The Supreme Court recognizes controversial decisions – they’ll hold back from successive controversial decisions in order to preserve capital<br />
<br />
Peretti 1999 (Terri J., In Defense of a Political Court, p. 153, accessed via ebrary, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.ebrary.com/lib/pitt/Doc?id=10002097&amp;ppg=163%29//" rel="nofollow">http://site.ebrary.com/lib/pitt/Doc?id=10002097&amp;ppg=163)//</a> Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
To the degree that a justice cares… decision from the Framers’ intentions.<br />
<br />
2. Massachusetts v. EPA would be a controversial decision- it involves an issue that is at the heart of the biggest environmental debate and the stakes of the decision are huge<br />
<br />
Clean Air Report 2006 (June 29, “High Court Wetlands Ruling Could Shape Arguments in CO2 Suit,” L/N)</em> Pitt-<br />
MF<br />
<br />
&quot;The Supreme Court took the case… affect every sector of the U.S. economy.&quot;<br />
<br />
C. Impacts<br />
1. A ruling in favor of the states is key to solve global warming- it will classify CO2 as a pollutant, sending a signal to state and international governments<br />
<br />
New York Times 2006 (July 8, “Global Warming and the Courts,” L/N) <em>Pitt - MF<br />
<br />
In a move that has caused both delight… hide behind a legal fiction.<br />
<br />
2. CO2 concentrations from US emissions cause biodiversity loss and species extinction<br />
<br />
Diener 2006 (Shari L., JD Candidate at William and Mary College of Law, “Ratification of Kyoto Aside: How International Law and Market Uncertainty Obviate the Current US Approach to Climate Change Emissions,” 47 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 2089, L/N)</em> Pitt- MF<br />
<br />
A study on climatic warming in the Arctic… global carbon dioxide emissions.<br />
<br />
3. Human extinction will result<br />
California Academy of Sciences 2004 (last modified 8/21/04, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.calacademy.org/research/library/biodiv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.calacademy.org/research/library/biodiv.htm</a>, accessed 17 Sept 2006) <em>Pitt- MF<br />
Currently, more than 10,000 species… Africa and South America.<br />

Legitimacy 1NC<br />
A. Uniqueness- court focused on building legitimacy<br />
Cole ’06 (David, professor at Georgetown University Law Center, Georgetown Law Journal, June, p LN)<br />
So what should we make of Bush v. Gore… appearance of partisan division.<br />
<br />
B. link- overruling destroys court legitimacy<br />
New York Times, ’92 (“Mr. Specters Deserved Discomfort, Section A, Page 16, Column 1, Spet. 1, p <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/" rel="nofollow">http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/</a><br />
index.html?offset=40&amp;query=PENNSYLVANIA&amp;field=geo&amp;match=exact)<br />
In two circumstances, however, the Court… frequency of its vacillation.<br />
<br />
C. Internal link- court legitimacy is key to democracy<br />
Stack '96 (Kevin, Yale Law Journal, June, 105 Yale L.J. 2235)<br />
This limitation also applies to the guiding… decisions through a deliberative process.<br />
<br />
D. Impact- extinction (Diamond evidence)<br />

<br />
<br />
Case-by-case nature of Supreme Court rulings means they can’t provide an overarching and specific policy for Guantanamo and as such do not send a signal that the US is complying with international law. Congressional legislation provides the best blueprint for protections afforded to detainees and sends a strong international signal<br />
Rooney 2006 (Heather L., JD Candidate at Drake University Law School, “PARLAYING PRISONER PROTECTIONS: A LOOK AT THE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SUPREME COURT DECISIONS THAT SHOULD BE GOVERNING OUR TREATMENT OF GUANTANAMO DETAINEES,” 54 Drake L. Rev. 679, L/N)<em>pitt-mf<br />
