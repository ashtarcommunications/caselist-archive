In the beginning there was the word and the word was god.<br />
The human consciousness originally perceived the universe as indivisible. Through language we were able to give form and shape to reality. The process of naming separates human subjectivity from everything else with sings and symbols and thus creates and constructs the diverse world around it. The story of the status quo and the resolution is the story of names, like the biblical adam in the garden of eden, asserting domination over life through the naming of the birds and the ebasts. Reality begins with logos, the word: that is our mastery over the universe. We name corn ethanol for fuel, we name fish stocks as food prices, we name gifts of the earth as commodities in order to be used for human conscumtion. We reduce all human experience to observation and empirical science. From here, we build distinctions: Eaerth and Sky, human and non-human, thought and desire, being and becoming. The world around us wills policies into being without a prior understanding of the mutually constitutive and symbolic relationship between will and nature. It sets itself in opposition to nature and thereby assimilates and conquers nature. Such dissolution separates reality from its divine origins and fragments humanity's experience of the beauty of nature.<br />

“In my tradition...or something else.” P89-90<br />
<br />
This type of separation from the Divine, or the holiness and supernatural, which terminates the belief that we can never achieve paradise on Earth. Even if you are not religious, this thought is built into most cultures. This attitude is the principle caus of environmental abuse and degradation. The pending doom of the status quo is indicative of this type of thinking: the coral reef is dying because we want coastal communities. Animals on the verge of ceasing to exist because we heard them into factory farms, and we treat cows as production machines to add to our morning serving of CoCoa Puffs. When divinity is objectified, nature becomes just another commodity. This industrial cosmology contributes to the destruction of our planet and the extinction of our souls.<br />

“There's a terrible wound...we are destroying divinity” p 175-6<br />
<br />
We then read a story. It involves Eve taking back the names of animals, nature, etc. after Adam names them.<br />
It's written by Ursula Le Guin in 1985 and is called “She Unnames Them”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the story, Eve takes back the names of the animals because they were either wrong to begin with or created harmful relationships between people and beings. The removal of the names deconstructs the logocentric walls that divide humans from the rest of the world. We must think through our feelings of vulnerability and begin to perceive the world as full of new possibilities of experience.<br />
Le Guin and White 95<br />
“She Unnames Them” is really...therefore its sacredness”<br />

<strong>Thus andy and I affirm that we should engage in a pagan process of unnaming the words and labels of the resolution.</strong><br />
<br />
Our alternative to the current system relies an understanding paganism. This refuses the names of the labels imposed by the resolution. By doing so we can expose the substance, truth and the being of nature. If I point outside the window to the green mouths and bodies of brown, you would say “I know that's a tree.” but do you really know? The naming process creates artificial difference and distinctions betweeen and within the self and nature. This is not some form of Deep Ecology because even environmental movements still rely on names and labels. Our pagan process allows for every “object” to be a conductor of Divinity. It doesn't matter if it's as small as the weed in your garden or as big as the Pacific Ocean, the unnaming process opens the human consciousness to experiencess the interconnectedness of life.
