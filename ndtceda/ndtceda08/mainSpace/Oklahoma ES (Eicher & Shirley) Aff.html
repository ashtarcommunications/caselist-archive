Observation 1: Inaction is action. <br />
The decision to maintain United States’ agricultural subsidies is not neutral. It is a political decision that affects the daily lives of millions. Inaction is action.<br />
The Independent, 8. <br />
(“A missed opportunity to feed the world”; LEADING ARTICLE; UN SUMMIT June 6, L/N)<br />
“The UN secretary… the rich world.”<br />
<br />
Observation 2: <br />
First, the future is unknowable and undecidable. <br />
Hägglund, 4.  <br />
(Martin Hägglund is a PhD candidate in Comparative Literature at Cornell University. The Necessity of Discrimination Disjoining Derrida and Levinas. diacritics 34.1 (2004) 40-71 Project Muse) <br />
“A key term… and so on.”<br />
<br />
Second, every action is inherently violent. Thus, we cannot seek peace- only a lesser violence. <br />
Hagglund continues…<br />
“There is no opposition… to possible contestation.”<br />
<br />
Third,  Truth isn’t objective. The philosophical and academic pursuit of perfection is unachievable. Perfecting truth is like eradicating uncertainty or preventing natural disasters. The drive for fixed meanings reinforces rigid hierarchies and limits education. Revealing the subjectivity in truths evades binary distinctions that rigidify thought and alienate diversity<br />
Hutchinson, 5.<br />
(“If Derrida had played football” German Law Journal No. 1 (1 January 2005) Allan, Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, Toronto. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=537" rel="nofollow">http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=537</a>)<br />
“Everyone needs a… play the game.”<br />
<br />
Fourth, This Binary logic creates rigid hierarchies that reproduce domination and exploitation. <br />

“Binary oppositions and… in a field.”<br />
<br />
Thus, our advocacy<br />
<br />
Resolved:  that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.<br />
<br />
Observation 3: <br />
We have no reason to support the resolution except that we have decided. Rationalizing decisions is a recipe for violence, like Bush’s unending resort to “WMD”, then “genocide”, then “terrorism”, then “democracy” as a justification for invading Iraq. Justification evades responsibility replacing it with logic and reason. <br />
Wells, 8.<br />
(Charles, York University, Acts of Freedom: Revolution and Responsibility” Vol 2.1, Int Journal of Zizek Studies. )<br />
“In contrast to… revelation and exposure.”<br />
<br />
Responsibility makes life meaningful<br />

“The loss of… ethics of responsibility&quot;.”<br />
<br />
Deconstruction is necessary to unmask the conflation of law and justice.  Equating law with ethics hides the agency underlying violence, making atrocities inevitable. Individuals, not institutions, are at the center of violence. <br />
