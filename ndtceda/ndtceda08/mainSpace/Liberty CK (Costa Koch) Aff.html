Answers To Off Case Args<br />
T – w/m: overrule first holding; c/i: remove decision of authority – Black’s Law ‘6; w/m c/i; c/s: most predictable – it’s Liberty running abortion bad (lol); best for ground – we link to everything; best limits – aff loses more, we deserve moderately larger limits; they overlimit – only a few cases; reasonability best<br />
Mass v. EPA – ethics f/w; no i/l: no capital spillover; non-uq: EPA will win in squo – states are backing out; non-uq: action will be taken regardless of decision; turn – warming good, ice age<br />
Abortion Good DA – ethics f/w; no impact; aff o/w<br />
Congress CP – condo bad, perm: do both, perm solves best, will be struck down by courts, solvency deficit – doesn’t remove court’s moral culpability, stare decisis bad add-on (above)<br />
Cap K – perm do both; must work w/in; individual solutions fail; abortion = gateway to calc; rejecting cap fails; cap is best system evar<br />

1AC<br />
Casey reaffirmed Roe’s holding that personhood did not apply to fetuses<br />
Life Begins at conception<br />
Embryologists are most qualified and they say life begins at conception<br />
Precautionary Principle means that we should default to not killing fetuses<br />
Casey affirms a genocide in the United States that is larger than any other genocide<br />
Abortion must be rejected at any risk - voting negative kills a fetus<br />
Intentional killing is a negation of all ethics<br />
Plan - The United States supreme court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey holding that the United States constitution protects the right to personhood<br />
Overruling Casey is key to challenge tyranny<br />
Law is pedagogical that made abortion acceptable<br />
Abortion down plays women’s role in decision making<br />
Ethics precidies ontology<br />
Supreme Court has a moral imperative<br />
2AC<br />
1 - Framework - intentional killing outweighs and is the ultimate value to life<br />
2 - The Aff is an ethic of liberation<br />
3 - Life Begins at conception<br />
4 - Aff is a pre-condition to the K - natality leads to violence<br />
5 - Permute do the alt in all instances but the aff - Cook<br />
6 - Alternative is bad and abandons the political sphere - Cook<br />
7 - War is programmed in our human nature - the alternative cannot solve<br />
8 - Aff embraces individual action<br />
9 - Life is important - therefore their ethic is flawed<br />
10 - Abortion is not liberation<br />
11 - Abortion is eugenics<br />
12 - Men uses women - abortion allows them to just use them for sex<br />
13 - Law is good<br />
14 - Hitler determined his own morality and then killed people<br />

Using a relevant test case the united states supreme court should overrule its decision in planned parenthood v. casey (505 u.s. 833) that the united states constitution protects a right to abortion by holding that that fetuses possess a fundamental right to life as persons under the 14th amendment.<br />

OB I: INHERENCY<br />

ARMSTRONG, 2K6 (“a bad birthday: planned parenthood v. casey”)<br />

OB II: LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION<br />
MEDICAL AND LEGAL DEFINITIONS OF DEATH PROVE THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION – THE EMBRYO IS MORE THAN A COLLECTIONS OF LIVING CELLS IT IS A COMPLETE LIVING ORGANISM<br />

PROBABILITY MATTERS – ABSURD SCENARIOS W/ LOW PROBABILITY SHOULD BE REJECTED<br />
RESCHER 83 (Risk)<br />
“a probability is a…a realistic prospect”<br />
OB IV: ETHICS<br />
LIKE SLAVERY, GENOCIDE AND TORTURE ABORTION IS A N EVIL THAT MUT BE REJECTD IN EVERY INSTANCE. IF WE WIN THAT LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION THE ACT OF VOTING NEGATIVE IS THE MORAL EQUIVALENT OF STATE SANCTIONED MURDER. JUST LIKE YOU WONDT VOTE HARVEST THE ORGANS OF ONE POOR PERSON TO SAVE THE LIVES OF 1,000 RICH PEOPLE YOU SHOULDN’T VOTE TO KILL 1 MILLION UNBORN HUMANS TO SAVE 1 BILLION OTHER PEOPLE<br />
THE VIOLABILITY OF PERSONS MEANS THAT KILLING A FETUS IS STATE SANCTIONED MURDER<br />
JOURNAL OF LAW AND FAMILY STUDIES, 2K2 (4 j. l. fam. Stud. 349)<br />

GEWIRTH, 82 (Human Rights, p. 224-230)<br />
“we must now…another right which, according”<br />
OB V SOLVENCY<br />

PAULSEN, 2K3 (78 notre dame, l. rev. 995)<br />
“nor is it…gone the other way”<br />
THIS METHODOLOGY IS EVIL AND DENIES THE INVIOLABILITY OF PERSONS. ADHERING TO PRECEDENT IN FULL KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PREVIOUS DECISION WAS IMMORALLY DECIDED ELEVATES JUDICIAL POWER ABOVE THE VALUE OF PERSONS, INTENIONALLY SACRIFICING HUMAN LIFE ON THE ALTAR OF JUDICIAL LEGITIMACY. BYOND THIS THE COURT HELD THAT IS HAD A POSITIVE OBLIGATION TO UPHOLD WRONG PRECEDENTS BECAUSE OF THE RULE OF LAW. WE MUST DENY THE BASE MOTIVE OF CONSERVING JUDICIAL CAPITAL<br />
