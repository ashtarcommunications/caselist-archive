Both louis and Brenda read excerpt from brother’s Karamazov:<br />
“Story about Christ-like love<br />
Turks who took in pleasure in killing babies<br />
Story of general who made child run away and then attacked by his dogs<br />
Refuses understanding, because it is based on falsity<br />
People cannot understand why the world is arranged as it is”<br />
Debate should be about liberation of people who are processed<br />
Includes issues of accessibility, speed, technicality, and line by line flow<br />
What kind of methodology embraces accessibility.<br />
Link: Afiirmative acts like father zosima. That actions are based on ethical choices.<br />
Link: Representations of suffering of the fetus. Not that suffering does not exist, but that the means of it something.<br />
Institutions themselves are not static entities. Institutions are made up by people who legitimize their practices.<br />
Subjectivity is destroyed in an attempt to create objectivity<br />
Losing subjectivity makes us subhuman… humans without the capacity to choose.<br />
Abortion exists because of women’s social conditions. Asks judge: Annul the affirmative in the face of human cloning. Affirm radical contingency. Freedom and liberation can only be found in contingency. Vote negative for the localized possibility of freedom.<br />
<h3 id="toc8"><a name="Round the 7th-Fullerton MM Neg-Block Strategy:"></a><strong><em>Block Strategy:</em></strong></h3>
<br />
Alt is an ethical alignment with an unconditional return to subjectivity. We annul the entirety of their ethical conditioning. Alternative places radical contingency at the forefront. In the face of fetal inhumanity and abortion, human condition is only as destructive as we allow it to be. Reactions of these mechanisms of violence is a consequence of a will to power. Contingency allows us to defer our agency. Worst form of mediation is to penalize those who commit acts against morality. Morality, when it is scripted in the law, continues violence. Representing the casey decision as one of suffering is self laceration in the face of suffering, like ivan’s description in father zosima. We become agents that live in a world of being with e lower case b. Transcendence is not created by human institutions but by the human psyche. Absolutes are bad. Ontology is beyond the simplistic view of reproductive rights. Levinas’ ethics are wrong, do not understand the human condition. We should not construct universals in a way that is imperatively described on others. Bouvoire is not conditional existintialism. Sartre was an asshole because he did not focus on solidarity building that is inter-subjectivity. Bouvau indicates there is some kind of intervention.<br />
Debate should be about the liberation of the oppressed. Otherwise, it leads to complicity with the status quo. Becomes about describing solutions rather than the oppressed creating solutions for their own salvation. Framework creates a hierarchy of politics, because it defines politics as governmental. Excludes people who don’t have access or agency. Enforces assimilation. Debate should be accessible. Its about how use speed and technicality in combination to purposely exclude. Permutation is ideologically impossible. Affirmative misunderstands agency. Imposes consciousness on others. Predictability constructs humans as objects.<br />

Debate should be about liberation of those oppressed and relation to the other. This is necessary to subjectivity and being able to embrace the other.<br />
The aff blames the state when the reality is that relations and people are who create violence. Freedom cannot be found in the representation of political demands.<br />

Begins with Performance—personal poetry<br />
<br />
Debate should be about creating strategies and methodologies for liberation of peoples that are oppressed. We believe that the combination of speed, techne, line by line flowing, and technicalities create an alienated system where the privileged access an insular education devoid of dialogical relations with the oppressed. This activity can open up a space of genuine engagement and emancipation for the people that need debate and liberation from oppressive structures where the privileged can challenge their social location and engage in praxis.<br />
<br />
As stated formerly, sexuality has become repressed in my culture, our community, our world. Sexuality has become a perverse act, contained within boundaries and overlooked in discussions of oppression. This dislocation with sexuality, has led to the body to become disposable and exploited. Unlike other forms of oppression, sexuality is a unique character within particular cultural contexts that must be unmasked to dismantle injustice and oppression. All other forms of oppression are a result of a disrespectful management and alienation of the body. Therefore, sexuality must be at the core of intersectional and structural analysis.<br />
Ellison 1996 (Marvin M., Bass Professor of Christian Ethics, Bangor Theological Seminary, in the Chapter “Facing the Moral Problem: The Eroticizing of Power and Control,” Erotic Justice: A Liberating Ethic of Sexuality.)<br />
“Examining how racism, sexism, and heterosexism … protected by responsible caregivers.”<br />
<br />
And, the harms of the 1AC are only there because of an eroticization of oppressive structures—THEY HAVE MISSED THE POINT—despite the long history of exploitation within our legal and cultural practices, the affirmative keeps endorsing these structures. As a result, all social oppressions [racism, sexism, homophobia, etc] stem from this misguided sexuality. As long as there is this attachment to the phallic system, you will never solve.<br />
Ellison 1996 (Marvin M., Bass Professor of Christian Ethics, Bangor Theological Seminary, in the Chapter “Locating Resources for a Liberating Ethic,” Erotic Justice: A Liberating Ethic of Sexuality.)<br />
“The moral problematic about sexuality in this culture…are respectful of all people.”<br />
<br />
And, the legal recognition you seek, especially under the current justice system, is merely a way to uphold Christian values that violently destroy difference. This is at the core of destroying the ‘sexual agent’, which destroys all value to life.<br />
Lipari 2K2 (Lisbeth, Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Denison University, “Queering the Public Sphere: Liberalism and the Rhetoric of Rights,” Argumentation and Advocacy, pgs. 169+, Questia.)<br />
“Despite differences between the two cases, … categories through which others see us and broaden the horizons within which we are able to view ourselves’.”<br />
<br />
This is why we are in solidarity with the affirmative, but call into question their focus on oppression. Where they seek to dismantle the death penalty, we seek to place sexuality at the forefront, which is at the root of their problem. They can’t merely include sexuality within their project since they have missed and misallocated their energy within their 1ac.<br />
A holistic sexual ethic for liberation means that we embrace life, difference, and the body, which is the necessary approach to a dismantling of oppression. We believe this is the best approach for a liberatory movement in which we dismantle fear and suffering and enter a genuine revolution within dialogical relations with the oppressed.<br />
Ellison 1996 (Marvin M., Bass Professor of Christian Ethics, Bangor Theological Seminary, in the Chapter “Locating Resources for a Liberating Ethic,” Erotic Justice: A Liberating Ethic of Sexuality.)<br />
“The renewal of Christian sexual ethics … because of our willingness to tolerate abuse and oppression.”
