PLEASE ADD TWO MINUTES TO MY SPEECH TIME FROM MY PREP TIME.<br />
WARNING:<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT WHAT YOUR ABOUT HEAR IS REAL, RAW AND UNCENSORED.<br />
IN THE TRADITION OF LOUISVILLE, USING OUR SOCIAL LOCATION AND PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, AND WEST GEORGIA, MOCKING DEBATE AND HAVING FUN, WE, DEVERICK AND ADAM, ARE GOING TO MIMIC, RIDICULE, AND BREAK DOWN MAJOR NORMS IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY IN THIS ROUND.<br />
ALSO, ALL THE AUTHORS, EVIDENCE, MOCKERY AND IMPERSONATIONS ARE PARODIES OF THE PRACTICES IN THE DEBATE COMMUNITY.<br />
AS WE TOLD OUR OPPONENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE ROUND, ALL OF THE DEBATE MATERIAL WE READ HERE TODAY IS ALSO AVAILIBLE ON OUR WIKISPACE AT:<br />

ONTO THE SCUFFLE TEXT…<br />
<br />
SCUFFLE TEXT<br />
BUT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP DEBATE THE SAME WAY, WE CAN DO THIS INSTEAD…<br />
We will systemically eliminate George W. Bush, Richard Bruce Cheney, and Robert Carlyle Byrd until Nancy Pelossi is President and Condoleeza Rice is Vice President of the United States.<br />
The assassinations will occur as follows:<br />
George W. Bush – To be eaten by German-Sheppard’s who fart gunpowder.<br />
Dick Cheney – Will be administered a vile of “Richard Bruce Syndrome”.<br />
Robert Carlyle Byrd – Firing squad by a fuzzy, bloody, bunny rabbit who shoots pretzels.<br />
It will be a coordinated military operation, just like September 11th. Since both women have extremely difficult names to spell, it will confuse the terrorists, and they will SAVE US ALL.<br />
P.S. End of patriarchy and racism too BOI!!!<br />
ONTO THE ARGUMENTS…<br />
Part I. THAT WINDOW’S FROZEN.<br />
Subsection 1. DEBATE IS TOO SERIOUS TO EDUCATE<br />
Argument A. “SLOW DOWN FOR ME, YOU MOVIN’ TOO FAST” - Juvenile<br />
THE SPEWING OF CARDS IN POLICY DEBATE IS NOT ONLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE ACTIVITY BUT, WASTES VALUABLE LEARNING TIME.<br />
Professor-Guy, Bachelor of Tongue Twisting, Random-Ass University, DUMB-BOOK-HE-WROTE, Pg. 999, 2007<br />
Note to DEVERICK: Mock the 1NC’s speed reading technique, if they don’t speed, read this card in the AWW BOI! voice by default.<br />
As history as shown, people who read cards fast lose feeling in their tongue and their lips turn white. Once that happens they both fall off and intrinsically lead to nuclear destruction. The only thing that can keep this from happening is George Bush and his pretzel wand of death. Fuzzy bunny rabbits are cute and comfortable, until you rip the fur off and its all bloody, and then you just have a bloody, half-dead rabbit. Since I like to talk fast, why not auction off my brain.<br />
Note to DEVERICK: Ramble on the rest of this card as an auctioneer, ending with “Sold to the judge with the pen in his hand”. You can change it up if he’s using a laptop, or if there’s an audience in the room.<br />
<br />
Argument B. RAINBOW DEBATE LEADS TO NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST AND MASSIVE SLAVERY. (I.E. CLUSTER-FUCK)<br />
DEBATE IS NOT FUN TO US WHEN WE ENGAGE INIT THIS WAY, IT FORCES US TO TALK ABOUT POLICIES THAT ARE NOT IMPORTANT, AND THAT WE CANNOT AFFECT IN THE ROUND<br />
Dr. Dickwad, Chairman, Salinas Magistrate for Exemplary Gamma Magnification Association (SMEGMA), “WHEN LIFE GETS HARD, FUCK IT”, Pg 69, 1984<br />
Holy smokes Batman! Tomorrow the world is going to end if we don’t solve for this problem. I should know…I graduated from a college with a $225,000 piece of paper that says “doctorate”. Anyway, Al scared the shit out of me yesterday with that movie…What’s it called... “A Convenient Lie: The Big Freeze”? Hmmm…or maybe it was that Moore guy with “Celsius: 488”. Whatever movie it was scared me, so you should be scared…based on what I say, not on scientific evidence, who has time for that? Just make sure when you tell whoever you’re talking to about it, you scream, yell and talk down to them, so they can get nice and pissed off and don’t want to do shit about the “problem”.<br />
<br />
Argument C. “AS WE KNOW, THERE ARE KNOWN KNOWNS, THERE ARE THINGS WE KNOW WE KNOW. WE ALSO KNOW THERE ARE KNOWN UNKNOWNS, THAT IS TO SAY WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE DO NOT KNOW. BUT THERE ARE ALSO UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS, THE ONES WE DON'T KNOW WE DON'T KNOW.” – Donald “Let’s Rumble” Rumsfeld<br />
PREDICTABILITY DESTROYS THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF DEBATE, THE TEACHING OF CRITICAL THINKING AND LISTENING SKILLS. THOSE THINGS TEACH HOW TO DEAL THINGS WE’RE NOT USED TO IN THE REAL WORLD<br />
Donavan Clothes-Off, Professor of Professing, HardHead University, “CFL – THE TRUE TRIALS OF ORIGINAL DEBATERS”, Pg 23, 2007<br />
The following is a narrative of a collection of stories from Clothes-Off’s book about the CFL and the hard times that have fell upon its traditional debaters.<br />
From Billy “B-Rad Tom Tom” Thompson – 11th grade<br />
“I be remembering back when we aint have no topicality son. Man shoot, we aint even flow. I knew what he could say, and I knew what could say. It was all about pullin’ the right card at the right time. It was like Pokemon`, like Politics DA I CHOOSE YOU!, Give em’ the impact attack Hollow Hope. I had to watch CNN everyday back 2000, just tryin’ to see who was goin’ to be the next prez (WHAT UP GWB, BIG BUSH BABY! MY “R” SET, REPUBLICANS ALL DAY). Its just extra crazy now man, people playing music, putting their life into it, shit’s getting out of hand and real scary. That’s why I quit and bout’ to go to that school in Lynch-A-Man, Vagina at Slavery University.&quot;<br />
Part II. TIME TO MAKE IT SWEAT<br />
Section B. You can’t debate like that<br />
Subsection 1: WHY CAN’T WE PICK THE TOPIC?<br />
Argument A. “HERE THE BREAKDOWN, PASS THE DOJA, .45 IN THE HOLSTER, HOLLOW TIPS’LL FOLD 'EM, THEM DEBATERS (NIGGAS) THEY TOY SOLDIERS” – THE GAME<br />
THE COMMITTEE WHO SELECTS THE TOPIC ARE EXTREMELY POWERFUL, BECAUSE THEY DICTATE THE EDUCATIONAL CURVE FOR THE ENTIRE DEBATE SEASON FOR THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS<br />
Leven Scooper, I’m Oppressed University (IOU), “OPPRESSION, OPPRESSION, OPPRESSION”, Pg. All-the-damn-book, The-rest-of-his-natural-life<br />
OPTIONAL NOTE TO ADAM/DEVERICK: Play (insert song here) really fast. Then about half way through, Deverick says “Hold on roll that back, I don’t think they got it”. Then play a completely different song with no relation to what you’re talking about.<br />
The racist, prejudiced, repressive/oppressive/compressive/depressive, white supremacist, privileged, imposition, misogynist/sodomist, capitalist debate community/impunity reinforces/coerces/makes verses/disperses the decisive/inditive fungous that manipulates/denigrates/tribulates/regulates the eurocentric/intrinsic system that keeps us cold/freezing/frozen in a Haagen Do`zen in a refrigerator that needs/that needs/that needs/that needs to be opened/disclosed from within. One mic, ten pianos, peace, love, soul, happiness, and bleeding butt-hairs.<br />
<br />
Argument B. “SOME PEOPLE SAY ‘OOH I CAN’T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY’RE SAYING AND ‘THEY MAKE NO SENSE’…RIGHT!...THAT DEBATE IS NOT BEING HELD FOR THEM…” – ALFRED “BIG BAD TUNA” SNIDER<br />
SHUTTING OUT DEBATERS LIKE US MAKES THE PROCESS COMPLETELY ROBOTIC, AND KEEPS ALTERNATIVE DEBATERS FROM PROSPERING IN THIS ACADEMIC PARADISE<br />
Cock DeathRage, Doctorate of Arguing, “DON’T ASK ARGUE”, Pg. Anticipate-and-know, Yr. 25-reseaching-mofos-at-the-NDT<br />
NOTE TO DEVERICK/ADAM: Play the Deatherage section of the 2004 NDT where’s he singing. Skip it if you cant find the clip.<br />
Part III. IS THAT SHIT THAWED SON?...NOPE!<br />
Section C. Hand me some “Fix-A-Flat” and let’s get to work!<br />
Subsection 1. THE CHANGE STARTS WITH US<br />
Argument A.: QUIT BEING SO LAZY<br />
IT ALL STARTS WITH US TRYING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IT’S NOT BENEFICIARY TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY ACTIVITY WHOSE NORMS WE DON’T AGREE WITH<br />
Talib Kweli, Proffesor of Being Deep, Deep University (DU), “I’m so damn deep”, Pg. Too deep for you, Yr. Deep Blue Tree<br />
IF YOU AIN'T GOT IT, THEN REPLICATE IT<br />
OR JOIN THE GROWING RANKS OF THE ILL-FATED<br />
SLATED TO BE PUBLICLY HUMILIATED<br />
IF YOU AIN'T THE PROBLEM, THEN THE SOLUTION YOU HAVE TO BE<br />
WE'LL START A HOODLUM INTELLIGENCE AGENCY LIKE TRAGEDY<br />
WE MAJESTY, STAY FOCUSED WITH THOUGHT AND MEDITATION<br />
DEVILING THIS BABYLON WITH STRENGTH AND DEDICATION<br />
<br />
Argument B. NO ONE IN THIS ROOM CAN DO JACK ABOUT IRAN, SYRIA, THE PALESTINEAN AUTHORITY AND LEBANON'S POLICY<br />
WE NEED TO QUIT FOOLING OURSELVES, WE ARE NEVER, EVER GOING TO CHANGE THE GOVERNMENT FROM ONE SINGLE, ORDINARY DEBATE ROUND, EVER, IT’S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN<br />
Cap'n Bethea Skinnier, Association of American Gangster Racist Hypocrites (AARGH),“Doin’ my Pirate Shit on the White Oyster”, Pg. On-the-deck-below, 1694<br />
According to my library of medical studies and tests that I have conducted, there is a disturbing correlation between debaters and several mental disorders. This general term I use for this condition is Post Policy-Debate Disorder or PPDD. PPDD consists of four major stages that have a major effect of the mental state on about 90% of all “traditional” debaters.<br />
Stage 1: Paranoia – Excessive anxieties about teams being unpredictable and running new affirmatives because of their coaching staff. Also there are distorted beliefs in the unrealistic impacts of the arguments made in the round (i.e. nuclear war).<br />
Stage 2: Xenophobia – After the initial stage, there is an increased fear of new arguments and strategies used in debates. Most of the time, these debaters will reference something called “fiat”, that they say “wishes their plan into existence” to avoid reality and facts.<br />
Stage 3: Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) – Most debaters and/or the judges will finally reach the stage where they believe they are, what the debate community calls, “policy makers” and pretend as if they are apart of the United States Federal Government that can change the “policy” in their “plan text”.<br />
Stage 4: Complete Psychosis – The debater then becomes clinically insane, and becomes so entrenched in their ideas, that they force judges to vote for their ridiculous ideas, thusly destroying debate.<br />
There is no clear way to cure a traditional debater of PPDD is they continue to debate the same way. Pas studies have shown that in order for it to be possible, the debater must embrace these 3 major concepts:<br />
The world is unpredictable – The debater must realize that, in any given situation that it’s ridiculous to think that you’ll be able to “predict” what going to happen.<br />
You must think – He must also come to terms with the idea that policy debate is supposed to be about critical thinking, writing and reading and NOT about reading 500 words-per-minute.<br />
Use your voice of dissent – Lastly, he must always object to the norm in order to make the status quo better. No where in history has mankind been content with the standard, and hence we have always upgraded ourselves and our way of life.
