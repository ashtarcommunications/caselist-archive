Our affirmative is a rupturing and re-articulation of a policy affirmative. Through poesis, we experiment with our own subjectivity within the world while telling our stories about debate and The Real World. We advocate self-reflexive change and personal accountability in debate and out; we believe that this will lead to increased minority and female participation, activism, and awareness of ism and schism.<br />
<br />
We examine our place in the context of the resolution by questioning our location of social experience in relation to the black farmer of the delta, by telling stories of the politics of Ethiopian grain (teff) and Nicodemus Kansas, where it's grown locally.<br />
We read two cards: the first is from bell hooks, quoted from page 170 of &quot;Teaching to Transgress.&quot; &quot;an unbroken connection exists...standard English.&quot; it allows us to capture the energy and power behind words and translate them into agents of effectuating change.the second talks about how performance allows a structured doing and re-doing that makes individuals truly responsible for their actions and beings.<br />
