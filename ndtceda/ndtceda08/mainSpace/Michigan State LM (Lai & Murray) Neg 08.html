Liberal tolerance is futile against the backdrop of global capitalism and is violently reappropriated in the form of aggressive fundamentalism--we advocate a universal opposition to capitalism which breaks the trned of particularity and can undermine capitalist globalization.<br />

Text – The United States Federal Government should offer Russia substantial economic aid for its manufacturing and telecommunications sectors in exchange for ceasing all help in construction of Iran centrifuge and heavy water reactors. The United States should inform Iraq that they will remove their forces if Iraq continues any cooperation with Iran. After completing negotiations with Iraq and Russia, the United States should offer to allow Iran to continue building light water reactors for the purpose of generating electricity, provide fuel for the reactors and return the spent fuel to the host country, support Iran’s bid for membership to the World Trade Organization, provide additional economic aid and reestablish and maintain a diplomatic dialogue, in exchange for a verifiable agreement by Iran to limit their nuclear facilities to civilian use. The Executive Branch of the United States federal government should make a classified, internal decision not to attack Iran. We’ll clarify.<br />
