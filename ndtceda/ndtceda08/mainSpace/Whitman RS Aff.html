Nuclear war is inevitable – human rights web<br />
Bok says nuclear war is a pre-requisite<br />
Not claiming that HR is a pre-requisite – history shows absence of HR leads to genocide<br />
“Toos”<br />

Churchill, struggle for the land, 1993, p.4-5<br />
“today, a lot of people question the necessity and utility…environment to universal human rights.”<br />
Perm solve s- Churchill doesn’t advocate giving all the land back – he advocates giving back land that Indians never signed away in treaties – which is 30% of the country<br />

“Despite the rhetorical triumph of human rights during the last…uphold corporate interests over human rights and dignity.”<br />

Sil 2K [“Against Epistemological Absolutism: Toward a ‘Pragmatic’ Center’,” p. 160-161]<br />
“An even stronger case…extreme epistemological positions.”<br />
Alternative will be used to justify domestic and international repression &amp; support of exploitative transnational corporations<br />
Arat, 2K6 [“Forging A Global Culture of Human Rights: Origins and Prospects of the International Bill of Rights,” Human Rights Quarterly 28 (2), p. 436-7]<br />
“Despite the rhetorical triumph...over human rights and dignity.”<br />

“I thought that this…human suffering is not.”<br />
Postponing action until debates over epistemology/modernity/etc have been resolved assumes a static notion of the participants and makes activism and building coalitions impossible<br />
Butler, 2K4 [Precarious Life, p. 47]<br />
“A feminist opposition to militarism…as that which we have yet to know.”<br />
Relying on individual level strategies fails and guarantees global politics is dominated by violence<br />

“The quest for global solutions…conditions it requires for its survival.”<br />
We don’t have to win immediate solvency. We can deconstruct internal link to impact.<br />

International legal protections for human rights empower the subjugated: they can be used in unpredictable ways to shme the state.<br />
Raskin, 99 [“Re framing international law for the 21st century: The International Law of Reconstruction,” Transnat’l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 513]<br />
