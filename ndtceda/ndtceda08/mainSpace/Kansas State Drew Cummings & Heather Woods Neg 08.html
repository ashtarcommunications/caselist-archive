Geopower is at the heart of the imperial nation state is simply an arbitrary cartographic inscription – an arbitrary area of land set aside for conquest – in the same regard all genocides, war, and other forms of violence are the inevitable result of violent cartography<br />

The War K<br />
<br />
1) The construction and identification of an enemy in wars makes all war a self fulfilling prophesy and allows the justification of mass killing<br />
Edelman 1988 (Murray, The Political Spectacle, pg. 88)<br />
“The construction of enemies… not a tool for describing a situation.”<br />
<br />
2) Their construction of militarism is part of a larger theme of social values that indicates that militarism is glorified, reject this mindset is the only way to escape a cycle of violence<br />
Cuomo, 1996 (Chris J., “War is not just an event: Reflections on the significant of everyday violence” Hypatia Vol. 11, No. 4, pg. 30)<br />
“Moving away from the crisis-driven… state-funded militaristic campaigns<br />
<br />
3) Their purposeful denial of the omniprescience of militarism ignores the everyday violence of the world beyond the affirmative/negative where we see violence done upon countless others<br />
Cuomo, 1996 (Chris J., “War is not just an event: Reflections on the significant of everyday violence” Hypatia Vol. 11, No. 4, pg. 30)<br />
“Was is not just an event… agents of the state”<br />
<br />
4) Their images of destruction and saving the world come at the price of human dignity, this is the root of violence<br />
Calahan 1973 (Daniel, Tyranny of Survival, pg. 94)<br />
“To put it more strongly… man or outright extinction”<br />
<br />
5) Spectacle and crisis based policies lead to the worst tyranny in human history<br />
Agamben, 2000 (Giorgio, Means without ends, pg. 86-88)<br />
