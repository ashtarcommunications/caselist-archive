Terrorist discourse is used by the affirmative to show a need for action, this use of discourse blurs the line between fiction and reality, this increases the chance of the harms<br />

Thriller writers, who are ever searching…seemingly unquestionable “reality.”<br />
Capitalism inevitably creates a class of poor people<br />

“The” Word PIC counterplan<br />
Definite Articles like “the” are often used in front of a country’s name. This action forces the identity of the country to the center of the reader’s and writers’ shared univers. These phrases prop up statehood and homeland – making to empower nationalism<br />
Billig in 1995, “Flagging the Homeland Daily” p. 107-109<br />
The definite article can be used…as the morality of national duty and honour.<br />
The notion of nationalism creates state based violence and conflict. History proves that this banal nationalism is ideologically built into our social understanding. The use of “the” in plan codifies into law inevitable and justified violence<br />

The oppressive framework of the international system must be transcended to preserve all life on earth. Maintaining this dysfunctional structure allows violence in all forms to be inevitable.<br />
Cady Warren, 1996, “Bringing Peace Home: Feminism, Violence and Nature”<br />
Patriarchal conceptual frameworks…regional, national, and global contexts.<br />
The alternative is a precursor to the affirmative. Insecurity is inevitable in a world of gender hierarchies<br />
J. Ann Tickner “Gender in International Relations,” 1992<br />
In a previous chapters I have argued that traditional notions…must be reformulated.<br />
Alternative: Reject the affirmative’s hegemonic and masculine epistemology through an examination of power and knowledge in the patriarchal structures of international relations<br />
Examining the intersections of power and knowledge through a feminist epistemology creates a dualism of what is and what ought to be. This use of mobile subjectivities creates political change as well as develops social alliances.<br />
Annick T.R. Wibben, “Feminist International Relations: Old Debates and New Directions,” Online pdf<br />
Feminists can teach IR…’we’ and ‘them’ shift and slide.<br />
Framework<br />
The negative’s interp of the round is that the debate should be evaluated on the consequences of the affirmative plan and justifications – this means we analyze disads as well as discourse and methodology<br />
A. This ensures negative ground: We are allows a host of arguments and have necessarily generic arguments to check a limitless topic.<br />
B. Key to education: the education they would learn within their realm of debate is tainted by the flawed epistemology. This means that our framework would challenge those ideas and increase critical thinking by forcing teams to defend and rethink certain policy actions.<br />
C. Key to ground: negative’s should only have the burden to disprove the efficacy of a plan action, the same as a disad.<br />
D. We solve their offense: all arguments about how topic specific education is critical are subsumed by our interpretation. Teams must defend a plan on the aff and the neg must necessarily disprove the worth of the aff advocacy.<br />
E. Even if you win your argument, we can still evaluate the links to the plan: if they win that mean that only links to the plan matter.<br />
