RESOLVED: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD CONSTRUCTIVELY ENGAGE HAMAS BY RECOGNIZING THEM AS A LEGITIMATE POLITICAL ENTITY AND PROVIDING A SECURITY GUARANTEE TO END ALL U.S. AID TO ISRAELI MILITARY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST PALESTINE WHILE DEMANDING THAT HAMAS RESPECT ISRAEL WITHIN ITS 1967 BORDERS. <br />
<br />
CURRENT UNITED STATES POLICY ISOLATES HAMAS AND THE GAZA STRIP, WEAKENING THE REGION. ALTERING POLICY CAN BROKER CHANGE.<br />

Since Hamas's election...the same?<br />
<br />
UNITED STATES POLICIES CREATE CONFLICT BETWEEN HAMAS AND FATAH IN ORDER TO PUSH AN AGENDA ERADICATING POPULAR RESITANCE TO HAMAS’ POLICIES AND DEEPENING THE RIFT IN PALESTINE.<br />

ISRAELI ACTIONS ARE FAR FROM ACCIDENTAL – HOME BULLDOZERING AND THE EXPLICIT HERDING OF ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE INTO A SMALL URBAN AREA IS A PLANNED MILITARY STRATEGY.<br />

POLICIES TOWARDS THE GAZA STRIP SET THE STAGE FOR ETHNIC CLEANSING OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLES. CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE COMPARABLE TO CONDITIONS IN THE NAZI DEATH CAMPS OF WWII – THIS IS GENOCIDAL.<br />

HAMAS PROVIDES THE NECESSARY STRUCTURES TO BRING CHANGE TO THE URBAN SLUM AND END URBICIDE IN PALESTINE. ENGAGING HAMAS AND RECOGNIZING THEIR POWER AS AN ACTOR CAN BREAK DOWN CURRENT GEOPOLITICAL FRAMEWORKS THROUGH DISCUSSION AND THE OPENING OF POLITICAL SPACE.<br />

CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT AS IT IMPLICITLY REMOVES THE LABEL OF “TERRORIST” THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH HAMAS. THAT LABEL CREATES A BINARY OF GOOD VS. EVIL THAT LEADS TO POLICIES OF ERADICATION, IMPERIALISM AND COLONIZATION.<br />
