 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Poverty advantage (same as on the wiki).<br />
New trade advantage:<br />
First, US non-compliance with WTO rulings sets a precedent for other countries to violate multilateral trade standards<br />
Ruso &amp; Benicchio 2007 [Laura and Roman, “Oxfam says US must reform illegal cotton subsidies or lose credibility, following wto panel ruling,” Oxfam Press Release, October 16, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfam.org.uk/applications/blogs/pressoffice/?p=989" rel="nofollow">__http://www.oxfam.org.uk/ applications/blogs/ pressoffice/?p=989__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">]<br />
According to a recent . . . with these international rules.”</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Furthermore, countries are opting to impose protectionist measures and pull out the global trade system<br />
China Daily 2009 [March 24, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.truthabouttrade.org/content/view/13582/54/lang,en/" rel="nofollow">__http://www.truthabouttrade. org/content/view/13582/54/ lang,en/__</a><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The nation will be flexible . . .in London on April 2. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Cotton must be the first step – only full compliance to eliminate subsidies would second the crucial signal of US commitment to multilateralism<br />
Gallagher 2008 [Kevin P., “New messenger, same mandate,” Reuters, December 23, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogs/reuters.com/great-debate/2008/12/23/new-messenger-same-mandate" rel="nofollow">__http://blogs/reuters.com/ great-debate/2008/12/23/new- messenger-same-mandate__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">]<br />
The immediate first step . . . not as we do”. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Doha has already proven the balance of power is shifting. US international engagement can’t succeed if it is going to exclude China, India, and Brazil<br />
Bigman 2006 [David, “Beyond the Doha Round: Time to Reform the WTO,” Stanford Center for International Development working paper no. 294, October, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://scid.stanford.edu/pdf/SCID294.pdf" rel="nofollow">__http://scid.stanford.edu/pdf/ SCID294.pdf__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">]<br />
The deadlock in the Doha . . . decisive influence on the agreements.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">US action must be timely if it wants to maintain leadership – After the collapse of Doha, the issue of subsidies has emerged as the sole factor pitting China and India against the United States<br />
Einhorn and Srivastava 2008 [Bruce and Mehul, “WTO: Why India and China Said No to U.S.,” Business Week, July 30, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jul2008/gb2008030_027680.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_global+business" rel="nofollow">__http://www.businessweek.com/ globalbiz/content/jul2008/ gb2008030_027680.htm?chan=top+ news_top+news+index_global+ business__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">]<br />
It’s not often that . . . the U.S. and other countries. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is cotton that will be the harbinger of the shift to multipolarity and will determine how countries and international institutions perceive and orient themselves to the shift<br />
Cross 2006 [Karen Halverson, “King Cotton, Developing Countries and the ‘Peace Clause’: The WTO’s US Cotton Subsidies Decision,” Journal of International Economic Law, volume 9 number 1, January 30]<br />
Yet predictions of future economic . . . emerging market player in the WTO.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Crucially, the transition to multipolarity is inevitable -- the only question is whether it will be peaceful or not. US concessions and willingness to adhere to the DSM is a critical first step to a smooth transition.<br />
Yeo 2003 [George, “Doha and the Future of the WTO,” pApril 29, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,1883" rel="nofollow">__http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_ content.asp?View,1883__</a><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4. A necessary but not . . . no practical alternative in sight. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Make no mistake, the implications of a US failure to transition to trade multipolarity will spill over to all dimensions of US foreign policy<br />
Bergsten 2001 [Fred, Foreign Affairs, March/April]<br />
This international leadership vacuum . . . disintegration of global economic links.<br />
This would kill American leadership and set the stage for global power wars<br />
Kupchan 2002 [Charles A., The End of the American Era, p. 247-8]<br />
The United States and should . . . relevance of Europe’s national borders. </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Independently, the collapse of WTO credibility means nuclear war<br />
Copley News Service, 1999 [December 1, ln]<br />
For decades, many children . . . They should be celebrating it.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Multilateral liberalization itself could prevent global conflict. Increased Interdependence and integration can be an answer to rising protectionism and conflict<br />
Lee 2009 [Jong-Wha, “Globalisation promotes peace,” Vox EU, March 31]<br />
In contrast to their findings . . . international relations at greater risk.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">DSM<br />
Cotton is a crucial litmus test for the credibility of the DSM – noncompliance calls into question the relevance and fairness of the WTO<br />
Cross 2006 [Karen Halverson, “King Cotton, Developing Countries and the ‘Peace Clause’: The WTO’s US Cotton Subsidies Decision,” Journal of International Economic Law, 2006, 9(1): 149-195<br />

Although the discussion thus far . . . a sign of a working democracy. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Small farms (read on a CP).<br />
Subsidies hurt rural farmers the most – makes it hard to compete<br />
Stossel and Brosseau 2008 [John and Catherine, correspondent for ABC news, “John Stossel: Do Government Farming Subsidies Hurt American Farmers?”, ABC News, October 17, p. </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=6050559&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">__http://abcnews.go.com/ Politics/Vote2008/story?id= 6050559&amp;page=1__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">]<br />

Round 1 NDT AFF vs Baylor CM<br />
Scouted by: Cassandra Mia Bonitto, Wichita State<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Aff USC DH vs Neg Baylor CM All full sites were on the wiki- here are a few notes about the round I found relevant<br />
Cotton straight up1AC advs<br />
poverty- I/L west Africa, china, India<br />
privatization- structural violence worse than nuke war<br />
AIDS- I/L of poverty- no answer to how they solve AIDS b/c poor farmers couldn’t afford to solve it even with the aff<br />
Solvency- organic shift b/c of the energy crunch<br />
Grass roots case by case- claim that aff is a starting point to fighting African racism from subsidies<br />
1NC<br />
Framework- epistemology and ontology are good, dehumanization impacts,<br />
Framework spec- must read a 1AC framework<br />
Fear of death- claim that there is not an alternative but an “alternative way of framing” of being existential when judging<br />
Davis, swazo, park<br />
Barelife- discourse Key alternative of refusing the soverign<br />
Include a health link from AIDS- Bell,<br />
Santag, Agamben, Caldwell<br />
USH double turns both in the 2AC and 1AR making claims to solve the impacts while also impact turning, no real tricks, 1AR functionally drops theory args on fwrk spec, 2NR takes advantage of this while shallowly extending the FOD K and framework, 2AR focuses on the organic shift claims, basic extention of perms</span>
