C1: Brave New World<br />
<br />
Doctors, geneticists and abortion providers have joined a genocidal alliance aimed at the complete erradication of disabled people and the genetic recreation of humanity into a single docile herd--millions will be destroyed in the next decade<br />
<br />
An Annonymous Austistic Author 2006 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://autisticbfh.tripod.com/eugenics.html" rel="nofollow">http://autisticbfh.tripod.com/eugenics.html</a> last modified August 22)<br />
<br />
&quot;The above title comes from...that will be the face of normality forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prenatal autism screening will come on line in the near future- these tests will be used to completely destroy the autistic population. it doesn't matter whether abortion is generally good or bad--this is eugenics in its darkest form<br />
<br />
Ventura 2006 (Bonnie, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ventura33.com/clock/" rel="nofollow">http://ventura33.com/clock/</a> last mod August 22)<br />
<br />
&quot;Autism researchers are...voluntary choice by the woman&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C2: Purity and Hate<br />
<br />
The United States is moving towards a new eugenics aimed at eradicatting difference and evterminating the unfit. this is open hostility and violence against people with disabilityies and discourages treatment research<br />
<br />
Reist 2006 (Melinda Tankard, author, Defiant Birth: Women Who Resist Medical Eugenics, p. 286-290)<br />
<br />
&quot;With the 'old' style eugenics employed...solution for all.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This hostility to difference precludes an ethic of dignity and co-existence. Welcoming difference and diversity is the only hope for a utopian transcendence capable of overcoming genocide and nuclear annihiliation<br />
<br />
Fasching 1993 (Darrell, The Ethical Challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima: Apocalypse or Utopia?, Net Library)<br />
<br />
&quot;The story of Babel...of a nuclear apocalypse that such a path risks.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The right to abortion spills over into other policies hostile to human life and supports genetic enhancement of some people into a new superior species.<br />
<br />
Smith 2006 (Wesley, AUthor of a book about euthanasia, Weekly Standard, July 3-10)<br />
<br />
&quot;Abortion is legal not because...a &quot;post-human&quot; race of superbeings&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The result is holy war and genocide<br />
<br />
Annas 2000 (George, Edward R. Utley Professor and Chair, Health Law Department, Boston Univ. School of Public Health, and Professor, Boston Univ. School of Medicine and Boston Univ. School of Law, Summer, 49, Emory L.J. 753)<br />
<br />
&quot;The second millunnium opened with holy wars...through genetic engineering.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PLAN:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court Should use an appropriate test case to rule that abortions based solely on the genetic characteristics of an embryo or fetus violate the Americans with disabilities act. Will Clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C3: NeuroDiversity<br />
<br />
Prohibiting eugenic abortions on the grounds of discrimination is necessary to increas societal acceptance of people with disabilities and improve medical treatments<br />
<br />
Field 1993 (Martha, Prof. of Law, Harvard Law School, 16 Harv. Women's L.J. 79)<br />
<br />
&quot;But applying discriination principles...just as similar gender-based discrimination distinctions and race-based distinctions would.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our refusal of Eugenic abortion and acceptance of people with disabilities can reshape th world for caring and understanding instead of genocide<br />
<br />
Darke 1997 (Marie Claire, working on postgraduate qualification in social work, Swimming Against the Tide: Feminist Dissent on the Issue of Abortion, p. 68-70)<br />
<br />
&quot;The indirect social pressure...being in a wheel-chair was non-problematic&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Current Laws allows abortions for disability even when other abortions are banned the plan solves this without ending all abortion<br />
<br />
Field 1993 (Martha, Prof. of Law, Harvard Law School, 16 Harv. Women's L.J. 79)<br />
<br />
&quot;we saw earlier that the nonexistance...abortion for handicap is allowed, there is discrimination&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The plan overturns planned Parenthood v. casey's &quot;Undue Burden&quot; Test<br />
<br />
McChesney 2006 (Chris, Law student at American University Washington College of Law and Managing Editor of Modern American, Modern American, Spring)<br />
<br />
&quot;The choice of whether or not to have a child...undue burden to place on a woman's right to choose.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

The court considers now appeal upon “the abysses” of the constitution. Appellant asserts that empty space in constitution represents language of justice.<br />
<br />
Justices Fairchild and Thompson, speaking for the court:<br />
<br />
We face an abyss. What has law become? Why has law attained a supposed monopoly on legitimate violence?<br />
<br />
The language of our law clearly cannot speak answers to these questions. Were it possible to do so, we would already attain such a law and have done with violence. Recognizing this impossibility, we return to the language of the law to concern ourselves with the rhythm of its speech, and the refrains that it establishes in its articulations.<br />
<br />
The rule of law has long been extended as the basis for social authority. On the other hand, the rule of violence has always threatened this authority, and remained theoretically opposed to the law. So how is it that violence continually seems to re-enter the spaces of our legal orders? The court has long held deference to the principle that violence is sometimes necessary in order to conserve the authority of society. There are times when individuals emerge that threaten the social fabric, bringing harm to the multitude. This concept too easily transforms into another, much more insidious witch hunt, as the law attempts to identify all possible sources of violence to society from within. Law has long aspired to a monopoly on violence, with the dream that it could one day become static, a utopian institution that could sustain “peace”.<br />
<br />
Too much law has brought foremost Robespierre’s Terror. Now President Bush evokes the Nietzschean concept of Will to Power, a concept once before heard on the lips of another equally terrifying man. Modern law has begun to replenish its energy by sacrificing on a global altar the life it is supposed to sustain.<br />
<br />
Law has entered a trajectory toward “beautitude”, or the perfection of representation. Law has begun to circulate around identities, which have to be organized, opposed to each other, and arranged hierarchically. This quickly turns into massive outbreaks of violence.<br />
The result is that law becomes emptied of its meaning, able to speak the words of society but unable to give society justice.<br />
<br />
I will allow Professor Sherwin to elaborate:<br />
<br />
Richard K. <strong><u>Sherwin</u></strong>, Professor of Law, New York Law School, <strong><u>2003</u></strong><br />
[24 Cardozo L. Rev. 683]<br />
My subject is law's legitimacy. In the aftermath of September 11th, the issues before us are not simply academic. How could they be when, in a climate of violence, one of the questions pressing upon us is <strong><u>how the rule of law is different from the rule of violence?</u></strong><br />
Once the question of law's legitimacy is raised, the reality of violence cannot be avoided. Walter Benjamin understood this. As he noted, <strong><u>law has an &quot;interest in a monopoly of violence.&quot;</u></strong> n1 <strong><u>In violence law originates, and in violence it conserves its ruling authority. Violence marks the origin of the state, and its demise.</u></strong><br />
We can go further. In violence the messianic moment breaks forth into the continuum of history. n2 The claim of justice explodes law's temporal deceits. n3<br />
[*684] But what do we know (what can we know) of such claims? <strong><u>Is it Robespierre's terror, or some other terror, closer to home, a terror authorized by a metaphysical or theological claim that dares to link human violence and infinite justice?</u></strong> n4<br />
Little did I imagine when I began this meditation on law's legitimacy that I would need to grapple with words uttered by the president of the United States. <strong><u>Who would have thought that an American president might implicate Nietzsche's pivotal idea, the will to power? But that is precisely what happened when President Bush addressed the nation following the terrorist attacks upon the World Trade Center in New York City.</u></strong> Here are the words the president used to describe the perpetrators of those terrible acts: &quot;By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions - by abandoning every value except the will to power - they follow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism.&quot; n5<br />
I believe that <strong><u>this linkage between terrorist violence and the will to power is mistaken, but not accidental.</u></strong> It is mistaken, as I shall presently explain in more detail, because Nietzsche's thinking about the will to power, properly understood, is precisely the opposite of metaphysical violence. This mistake may not be accidental to the extent that it reflects the speaker's adoption of metaphysical ideas. n6<br />
My objective here is an urgent one. I seek not only to [*685] extricate Nietzsche's highest thought from confusion, but also to rescue law's legitimacy from the grip of metaphysical beatitude. If law finds legitimacy in beatitude, and I shall contend that it does, then we must learn to distinguish between the joyous excess and life affirmation that characterize Nietzsche's beatitude from the pathology of denial, nihilism, and resentment that characterize metaphysical beatitude. The difference is a matter of life and death.<br />
Metaphysical beatitude begins in denial. It signals a rebellion against life. Franz Rosenzweig wrote about this experience in 1921. He described it as the paralysis of &quot;sick reason.&quot; n7 It is what happens when one catches the disease of metaphysics - that pathological obsession with essences. &quot;Common sense is crippled by a stroke.&quot; n8<br />
Within a year after Rosenzweig penned those words, Franz Kafka conjured a world of sick reason in a parable of alienation and disenchantment. In his novel The Castle, n9 only the necessity of authority remains; its significance has been lost. n10 <strong><u>In the midst of Kafka's bureaucratic labyrinth, law retains validity but lacks meaning.</u></strong> The source of law's legitimacy is no longer apparent. We have been cut off. n11<br />
The same year, 1921, Walter Benjamin wrote: &quot;In the exercise of violence over life and death, more than in any other legal act, the law reaffirms itself. But in this very violence [*686] something rotten in law is revealed.&quot; n12 &quot;What manifests itself,&quot; as Eric Santner astutely observes:<br />
Is the fact that <strong><u>the rule of law is</u></strong>, in the final analysis, without ultimate justification or legitimation, that the very space of juridical reason within which the rule of law obtains is <strong><u>established and sustained by a dimension of force and violence that,</u></strong> as it were, <strong><u>holds the place of those missing foundations</u></strong>. n13<br />
In this view, the &quot;mystical foundation of authority,&quot; to cite Jacques Derrida's gloss on Montaigne's phrase, n14 remains a mystery, or worse, a repressed trauma of unjustifiable violence. n15<br />
... Continues ...<br />
In the grip of metaphysical beatitude, sick reason is haunted by <strong><u>an insatiable phantom</u></strong> - a Dybuk, <strong><u>the soul's dark double, product of repressed forces. Dead, yet living, the phantom cries out to us,</u></strong> like Lucy in Bram Stoker's Dracula, <u><strong>&quot;come to me ... . My arms are hungry for you.&quot;</strong> n21 <strong>But upon hearing her voice, our blood turns cold. There is &quot;something of the tingling of glass when struck&quot; in her diabolically sweet tones. It is the sweetness of eros captured by death. To yield to the call of the undead is to embrace death itself.</strong></u><br />
This retreat from life, this capture of the soul in the night of the Nought, lies at the heart of what Nietzsche described as the spirit of decadence, and what Freud diagnosed as the pathology of death anxiety. It is not the will to power, but rather the will to destruction. <strong><u>As Nietzsche wrote, &quot;man would rather will nothingness than not will.&quot;</u></strong> n22<br />
[*688] The fanatic exhibits a similarly decadent will. Here, too, we encounter the will to metaphysical beatitude. Rather than enter into the midst of life, the fanatic, like the nihilist, like the patient caught in denial, seeks to annihilate suffering for the sake of a world to come. <strong><u>The will to annihilation would rather will nothingness than not to will at all. Thus, the fanatic says &quot;No&quot; to life that is corrupt, stained with suffering and injustice.</u></strong> n23<br />
... Continues ...<br />
We may recognize this nihilist revolt as the impulse behind the terrorist violence of which President Bush spoke, mistakenly identifying it with the will to power. We must not make that mistake. <strong><u>What the president referred to as the will to power is in reality the will to power in reverse.</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>The violent fantasies</u></strong> fueled by metaphysical beatitude - including the promise of metaphysical beatitude in the form of a final reckoning between eternal foes - <strong><u>take us down an inhuman path. We may fight to defend our way of life, but we cannot fight to root out fear and suffering.</u></strong> n28 As Franz Rosenzweig observed, &quot;all that is mortal lives in [the] fear of death; every new birth augments the fear by one new reason, for it augments what is mortal.&quot; n29<br />
... Continues ...<br />
<strong><u>The contingency of law's beatitude is the price we pay for law's legitimacy. The hope of attaining and perhaps of &quot;naturalizing&quot;</u></strong> n83 <u><strong>an attitude of attentive respect (or mindfulness)</strong>,</u> [*700] <u><strong>while also working through our defenses (and fantasies) regarding surplus (unassimilated) pleasure, may be the only assurance to which we may legitimately aspire. Law-preserving law, law endlessly ramified, not only will not suffice, but it also risks the perfect security (and alienation) of imprisonment within Kafka's bureaucracy</strong>.</u><br />
<br />
What has been lost is the concept of justice that has always been at play within the law. Although nowhere explicitly stated, the will to justice, like the expectation of privacy, as demonstrated time and again, has always been present, the defining central aspect that ostensibly orients the law. The clash over what counts as justice is what makes law possible. We return to this present justice which has always remained elusive and seemingly out of grasp. Justice cuts across law at any moment b/c it is what is right as opposed to what is expected. We must account for both the potential breakdown of the law, and also the potential excess of law that requires justice in order to balance its expression.<br />

<br />
<strong><u>Derrida's conception of justice as irreducibly tied to</u></strong> difference has important affinities at many levels with peculiarly <strong><u>American ways of dealing with law and justice</u></strong> from the 1960s through the 1980s. For one thing, there were actual <strong><u>clashes among different conceptions of justice played out in the American political arena during the relevant period - for example, the African-American conception of racial justice and equality, the feminist conception of gender-based justice and equality, and white male conceptions of justice and equality as applied to issues of race or gender</u></strong>. Furthermore, <u><strong>both the African-American and the feminist struggles for justice projected a complex and differentiated approach to justice and equality that combined reliance on equality-as-identity and equality-as-difference</strong></u> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">**18**</a> <u><strong>in ways that do not make for tidy unification or harmonization</strong></u>. For example, a claim for equal pay for equal work regardless of race or gender is a claim for equal treatment, equality-as-identity, and universal justice. On the other hand, demands for affirmative action on the basis of race or gender to rectify past injustices or to remedy current disadvantages due to past or present discriminatory treatment are consistent with equality-as-difference and with equitable exceptions to universal justice. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">19</a><br />
<br />
One can imagine that for one pondering these dilemmas confronting justice in America, Derrida's deconstruction of justice would have special resonance. Conversely, one can surmise (though there is no factual proof that I know of for this) that if Derrida's focus on justice had been inspired by contemplation of the American dilemma, he would have inevitably been drawn to the ethical turn. In other words, deconstruction of <strong><u>the</u></strong> above-mentioned <strong><u>American</u></strong> <a name="bookmark"></a> <strong><u>dilemmas of justice would quickly make it apparent that all interpretive issues that it raises are imbued with fundamental ethical implications.</u></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><u>The affinities between Derrida and American approaches to law and justice go even deeper.</u></strong> Indeed, <strong><u>Derrida's conception of justice as difference comports better with the piecemeal nature of America's common law approach, characterized by its attempts to reconcile the singularity of every individual case with broader trends over time</u></strong>, than with the deductive model of adjudication prevalent in the civil law systems of continental Europe. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">20</a> <strong><u>Furthermore, Derrida's deconstruction of justice meshes well with important trends in American legal theory such as the Critical Legal Studies Movement (CLS) and pragmatism.</u></strong> For example, CLS emphasizes the dichotomy between law and justice and underscores the arbitrary nature of the distinction between the general rule and its exceptions in American Legal doctrine. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">21</a> CLS, through its critiques of American legal doctrine, shares a negative function with Derrida's deconstructive approach. But the latter exceeds and in a sense surpasses CLS precisely because of its ethical dimension. For both CLS and Derrida justice is impossible, though for CLS it is impossible due to prevailing power relations whereas for Derrida justice is impossible for ontological reasons regarding the irreducibility of self to other. But only for Derrida is the unbending duty to pursue justice as if it were possible also necessary. Finally, Derrida's deconstruction of justice has affinities with American pragmatism, experimentalism, and openness to change and revaluation of tradition in as much as all of these unfold in a world that appears untidy, constantly in flux, and hence per force theoretically under-constructed.<br />

The court has long maintained a division between legal and extra-legal grounds. The distinction between legal violence and illegal violence comes from this division. Ex Parte Quirin represents the most extreme case of this limit of legal violence in its historical impact on case law, where the eradication of the other can be justified legally and treated not as an excess, but as a part of the law. In Ex Parte Quirin, the division between legal and illegal violence becomes fundamental to the operation of law, which becomes militarized. As voiced by popular mythical figure Commander Adama, the military exists to confront those who assert themselves as enemies, the police exist to protect the people, but when the two functions become blurred then the people become the enemies, as the violence force of the law is directed inward. Ex Parte Quirin neglected to consider the function of justice and its relation to distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate force, and for this reason its consequences on the whole of case law must be rethought in light of justice.<br />

<br />
Re-conceptualizing law through a return to justice establishes a horizon of the law, in terms of justice, where the law and the violence which sustains it can situate themselves in ethical terms. This means orienting ourselves constantly toward an ethical horizon that is projected only through the way we comport ourselves politically.<br />
<br />
The law emerges not as a single text but as a horizon that orients collective action, the collective set of beliefs held by a society. Legal texts are merely condensations of these beliefs that impress themselves upon individuals and ask individuals to consider the world in one way or another.<br />
<br />
The law functions thus, we must recognize, as an act of faith, a master signifier that holds society together because we submit ourselves to it, as it is an expression of society defining itself from the center. The function of a law, by definition, is to provide this horizon, which although impossible is nevertheless of utmost importance.<br />
<br />
We conclude our opinion with a detailed explication by Professor Menke of the theoretical abysses of the texts of law that we are asked to consider.<br />

According to their first reading, the aporias describe a conflict: a conflict in the normative content of the concept (or idea) of justice; and, as an immediate consequence of this, a conflict in the acts and performances that make justice possible. To be just means, then, something double, conflictual, and justice thus demands of us that we do two things at the same time - two things which cannot, however, be done at the same time. On this first reading, the aporia that deconstruction draws attention to is a practical conflict. The features that outline such a practical conflict can be found in Derrida's description of all three aporias. This is clearest with regard to the first aporia. This aporia consists in the fact that, in order for it to be just, a decision must &quot;be both regulated and without regulation.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">14</a> The second aporia is similarly expressed. It makes a conflictual demand on our behavior by telling us that justice can only be achieved if we make a conclusive decision and if we suspend this decision. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">15</a> The third aporia, which relates to the temporality of justice, obeys least of all this reading as practical conflict. This reading here runs up against its limits, and this suggests an aspect of the aporia of justice that Derrida draws attention to that can no longer be understood as a practical conflict - as a conflict in the practical requirements of a just decision. Derrida understands this aspect as the tension between the always &quot;precipitate&quot; act of decision, which wants justice to occur here and now, and the countermovement of a postponement that &quot;irreducibly&quot; leaves justice to-come. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">16</a><br />

[*601] The third aporia runs up against the limits of the first model of interpretation - the model of practical conflict - because the two sides of this aporia do not occupy the same level or are not of the same kind. As a practical conflict, the aporia is made up of two normative claims that only constitute the idea of justice when taken together. These claims lead to two requirements of our performances, of our mode of decision, that cannot be fulfilled at the same time. In Derrida's third aporia, however, one of its sides is no longer determined by a mode of just behavior, for one side of this aporia no longer formulates any requirement or form of the conduct of a subject. <strong><u>The being-to-come of justice</u></strong>, which according to the third aporia opposes the always &quot;precipitate&quot; act of decision, <strong><u>relates</u></strong> rather <strong><u>to the curve of movement in which the prevalence</u></strong> (Walten) <strong><u>of justice becomes independent with regard to the subjective enforcement</u></strong> (Vollzug) <strong><u>of justice</u></strong>. This divergence from the model of practical conflict does not only reveal, however, the exceptionality of the third of Derrida's aporias - that which distinguishes it from the other two. It indicates, at the same time, the possibility of another reading of all three aporias. This second reading, in contrast to the first, emphasizes the fundamental asymmetry of the sides aporetically opposed to one another. Accordingly, <strong><u>what is articulated</u></strong> in Derrida's aporias <strong><u>is</u></strong> not a practical conflict, but a conflict of the practical, that is, not a conflict in the practice of just decision - the conflict in that which we must do in the attempt to decide justly - but the conflict with practice - <strong><u>the conflict with the attempt to bring about justice through our own conduct</u></strong>, a conflict to which just decision, like all normative acts, is exposed.<br />
<br />
The asymmetry that - according to the second reading outlined here - obtains in the aporias that Derrida draws attention to consists in the fact that these aporias do not refer to the practical difference between normative orientations but rather to the functional difference between that which makes possible and that which is made possible. The aporias that Derrida exposes between <strong><u>law and justice follow from the claim that the one is the condition of possibility of the other</u></strong>. For <strong><u>neither can law</u></strong> - that is, a decision that grounds itself in the law, that follows or applies the law - <strong><u>bring about justice</u></strong>; <strong><u>nor can justice</u></strong> - that is, a decision that grounds itself in the experience of justice, that is moved and motivated by the evidence (force) of justice - <strong><u>bring about law</u></strong>. From whichever side you enter the relation (or, as it might seem, the &quot;circle&quot;) between justice and law, <strong><u>neither can be the ground of the other; neither can bring about, can guarantee the existence</u></strong> (reality) <strong><u>of the other</u></strong>. By drawing attention to the aporias between law and justice, [*602] deconstruction thus puts in question the very relation of making possible that a philosophical investigation, according to its program outlined at the beginning, must endeavor to discover between law and justice. The work of deconstruction consists in showing that that which makes possible cannot, at the same time, make possible, that is, in showing a simultaneous making possible and making impossible. It is this that constitutes the aporia in the relation between law and justice.<br />
<br />
The aporetic simultaneity of making possible and making impossible applies to the relation between law and justice in two different ways. This means, to begin with, that both sides of this relation must be understood as claiming to make possible the other: the law claims to make possible justice and justice claims to make possible law. In both cases, however, &quot;making possible&quot; means something different. They therefore also run into an aporia in different ways. <strong><u>The difference between the two relations of making possible is insufficiently comprehended</u></strong>, then, when we merely distinguish &quot;the undeconstructibility of justice from the deconstructibility of droit.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">17</a> For the object of deconstruction is not &quot;the law,&quot; but the law as (that is, in the functional position of) the making possible of justice. What is deconstructed is the law's capacity to make possible. To this extent, however, that is, in this same function of making possible, justice is also deconstructible - even if the deconstruction of justice means something different than the deconstruction of law, just as the claim to make possible means something different with regard to justice and law. Let us now consider this double movement of deconstruction more closely.<br />
<br />
The first of the two relations of making possible that Derrida deconstructs is the making possible of justice by means of the law. <strong><u>The law is there to make possible justice</u></strong>. This means that, in order to do justice to the other, this &quot;singularity that is always other,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">18</a> <strong><u>we must behave in &quot;conformity with the law,&quot; in accordance with the form of legal decision.</u></strong> That <strong><u>this is not an arbitrary claim</u></strong> follows from the connection between justice and justification. Derrida refers to <strong><u>the law</u></strong> as that which <strong><u>makes justice possible because</u></strong> (or insofar as) <strong><u>the decision that conforms with the law can serve as the paradigm of a well-grounded decision</u></strong>. The premise of this combination of justice and law - namely, that a just decision must be a well-grounded decision - results from the consideration that a just decision is defined by the fact that it is not arbitrary. A just decision cannot be governed by the caprice or partiality of the subject who decides, but only by objective, &quot;relevant&quot; aspects. These, however, are reasons. Law is supposed to make justice possible insofar as <strong><u>law can</u></strong> (at least in some respects) <strong><u>be understood as a publicly binding order of reasons</u></strong>, by means of which [*603] the justice of a decision can be guaranteed.<br />
<br />
However, precisely this argument for considering law as that which can make justice possible is, at the same time, an argument to the contrary. Law cannot make justice possible. Indeed, the law makes justice impossible because it ignores that the justice of a decision is, as Derrida reiterates, &quot;the impossible.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">19</a> In accordance with the practical meaning of &quot;possibility,&quot; this thesis does not state that there is no justice. That justice is impossible does not mean that justice is (in principle, for ever) &quot;unreal&quot; or an &quot;ideal,&quot; but, rather, that justice cannot be made, that it cannot be made possible by means of something else. Or, more precisely, as regards the reason for grounding justice in law mentioned before: the justice of a decision cannot be made possible or guaranteed by means of the reasons that are cited for it. To the extent that the law attempts to do exactly this, that is, believes that it can make possible that which cannot be made possible, it is itself responsible for the impossibility of justice. It is precisely this aporia of making justice possible through the law that deconstruction draws attention to. On the one hand, the law is that which makes justice possible, because - according to the suggested interpretation - only a decision that safeguards itself with reasons, that is, that follows from or is deducible from reasons, can be just. <strong><u>The justice of a decision cannot,</u></strong> however, <strong><u>be deduced from the reasons for the decision; no reason can enforce or guarantee justice. It is for this reason that the attempt to make justice possible through the law - or the trust in this possibility - in fact makes justice impossible.</u></strong><br />
<br />
Another way of putting this argument against the claim of deducing justice from legal reasons, or of securing justice by the orientation in legal reasons, is Derrida's discussion of what he calls the &quot;presumption of a determinant certitude of a present justice.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">20</a> &quot;Certitude&quot; means here the epistemic status or claim concerning the fact of justice - of someone having performed an act of justice - that is grounded in criteria. <strong><u>We</u></strong> thus <strong><u>can</u></strong> (in this sense) <strong><u>only be &quot;certain&quot; about an act of justice when there are criteria that can establish its reality or existence. Law, as that which can make justice possible, is supposed to provide such criteria.</u></strong> Now, it is this relation between reason and consequence or criteria and fact, which Derrida calls a &quot;presumption&quot; - which according to Derrida is just a presumption. A &quot;presumption&quot; (according to the Petit Robert: &quot;opinion fondee seulement sur des signes de vraisemblance&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">21</a>) is an inference in the midst of a lacking body of evidence; an inference that exceeds that which can be deduced or [*604] proved in the strong sense and thereby claimed as certain. The term presomption thus combines, as Alexander Garcia Duttmann has said, &quot;the conceit of assumption ... and the conjecture of supposition.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">22</a> A presumption thus is an act of faith whose &quot;ghostliness deconstructs from within any assurance of presence, any certitude or any supposed criteriology that would assure us of the justice of a decision, in truth of the very event of a decision.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">23</a> <strong><u>Since we cannot guarantee the justice of a decision by means of its relation to a (legal) order of reasons; or, since we cannot deduce the justice of a decision from the way in which it was made or from the reasons by which it was attained, we can also never be certain that we brought about justice; we can only presume; i.e., assume and suppose it upon the basis of the modes and reasons of the decision</u></strong>.<br />
<br />
This epistemic de(con)struction (Abbau) of the certainty of justice into a mere presumption (an act of de(con)struction which cannot be taken to mean a simple dissolution) has direct consequences for the practical relation of the making possible of justice by means of a decision that conforms to the law. For the <strong><u>faith in the connection of criteria (the legal form of the decision) and normative content or validity (the justice of the decision) is itself a practical faith, a faith in practice. It is the faith that the justification of a decision leads to justice</u></strong>. More precisely, <strong><u>it is the faith that we can bring about the justice of a decision by means of its justification, that is, that the justice of a decision is something that we can guarantee by means of the mode of our behavior.</u></strong> However, as deconstruction shows, not only can we not do this, rather, to believe that justice can be made possible in such a way actually means to make justice impossible. Because the justice of a decision cannot be guaranteed by means of its good reasons, <strong><u>a decision or mode of decision that thinks itself capable of this will precisely make justice impossible.</u></strong> It reduces the justice of a decision to something that can be deduced from its mode or form. However, as Derrida writes, only a decision that has gone &quot;through the ordeal of the undecidable&quot; can be just, and this ordeal (of the undecidable) can never become &quot;past or passed, it is not a surmounted or sublated (aufgehoben) moment in the decision.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">24</a><br />
<br />
In the second reading reconstructed here, the deconstructive demonstration of aporias relates to the relation of making possible. According to this reading, the relation of making possible is aporetic because that which makes possible or, more precisely, its claim to make possible, at the same time makes impossible. In the case of the making possible of justice through law, this aporia assumes - as we have seen - [*605] the following form: <strong><u>the fact that the law makes justice possible has to be understood in the sense of practical faith</u></strong> (a faith in and during practice), <strong><u>namely the faith in it being possible for us to bring about justice by behaving in a particular way, by making our decisions in conformity with the law or oriented toward universally binding reasons.</u></strong> The &quot;faith&quot; that obtains here ties together practical ability, that is, the ability to make decisions in this mode or form, and normative success. <strong><u>This faith is constitutive</u></strong> of the orientation toward justice, for without it there would be no practice of justice. <strong><u>If we did not believe that we could bring about justice by means of something that we are capable of, we would give up our participation in practice. We would</u></strong> (as Derrida writes) <strong><u>&quot;simply be spectators&quot;</u></strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">25</a> <strong><u>and thereby abandon the idea of justice itself.</u></strong> Conversely, however, and this leads here to the aporia, <strong><u>it is precisely this faith in practice that makes justice impossible. Justice is (the) impossible - this means that it is impossible for us to bring about justice.</u></strong> Justice is not something that we are capable of ensuring or guaranteeing by means of (the form of) our practice. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">26</a> <strong><u>Only a practice of decision that knows this and incorporates it into its form by becoming conscious of the connection between justice and undecidability can be just.</u></strong> The aporia consists, then, in the fact that <strong><u>we must simultaneously possess and relinquish faith in our practices.</u></strong><br />
<br />
Let us now also take a quick look at the other relation of making possible that, according to Derrida's deconstructive demonstration, obtains between justice and law. The first relation of making possible - the one we have been considering up to now - consists in the fact that, in order to achieve justice, we must behave in conformity with the law (in the sense explained); so we can furthermore say that <strong><u>to be capable of behaving in conformity with the law is the condition of possibility of justice</u></strong>. The other, converse relation of making possible runs as follows: in order to establish a legal order we must behave justly; so we can also say that to be able to behave justly is the condition of possibility of law. This thesis is directed against the &quot;conventionalist&quot; and, consequently, &quot;nihilistic&quot; picture that both Montaigne's theory of obedience to the law and Stanley Fish's legal-theoretical pragmatism submit to on their &quot;surface.&quot; According to this picture - as Derrida says quoting Montaigne - <strong><u>laws enjoy &quot;good standing, not because they are just, but because they are laws.&quot;</u></strong> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">27</a> In [*606] contrast to this justification of law(s) in themselves, in their mere existence or functioning, the question as to that which makes them possible leads, according to Derrida, to a form of conduct that makes itself answerable to the normative claim to justice. The observation that justice makes law possible relates precisely to this: <strong><u>only an action that is oriented toward the normative opposition of &quot;just&quot; and &quot;unjust&quot; makes possible the establishment of a legal order. There is law only for beings who (can) orient themselves toward the normative opposition of &quot;just&quot; and &quot;unjust.&quot;</u></strong><br />
<br />
The point of Derrida's highly &quot;active interpretation&quot; of both Montaigne's formulation and Fish's concept of force consists, then, in the following thesis: also this tracing back of the law to an action that orients itself toward the normative distinction between &quot;just&quot; and &quot;unjust&quot; can not be understood only in the sense of the practical relation of making possible - or, even more, of grounding or foundation. If laws are not comprehended as just because, as Montaigne would have it, they have credit at their disposal as laws; but if, conversely, against Montaigne, laws have credit at their disposal and function as laws because they are held to be just, precisely then the continuation of Montaigne's formulation applies according to which laws are based upon a &quot;mystical foundation [or ground] of authority.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">28</a> According to Derrida, a ground or reason can be called &quot;mystical&quot; when it eludes discursive understanding. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">29</a> Insofar, however, as a ground or reason consists precisely in its discursive place or role, a mystical ground or reason is no ground or reason at all. A mystical reason is a &quot;violence without ground.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">30</a> This is the aporia that Derrida maintains regarding the relation of making possible between justice and law: <strong><u>just behavior makes a legal order possible by forming its foundation; and, at the same time, as a violence without ground, just behavior makes such an order impossible.</u></strong><br />
<br />
We can, once again, understand this aporia in the sense of the first reading outlined before, that is, as a practical conflict. The aporia would then state that <u><strong>just behavior comprises a normative orientation toward a &quot;singularity that is always other.&quot;</strong></u> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">**31**</a> <u><strong>This normative orientation towards singularity must lie at the basis of every legal order, but no legal order can satisfy it so that it always again is set off against the prevailing legal order</strong></u>. However, in Derrida's explanation of the aporia of making law possible through justice, this conflict between universal and particular, between equality and singularity, is not the decisive [*607] argument. For Derrida grounds the aporia not by means of the content of the normative orientation toward justice (the orientation toward the &quot;singularity that is always other,&quot; which stands in conflict with the legal idea of equal treatment). He grounds it, rather, by means of its form or, more precisely, its force. Derrida formulates this thus:<br />
<strong><u>The very emergence of justice and law</u></strong>, the founding and justifying moment that institutes law implies a performative force, which <strong><u>is always an interpretative force</u></strong>: this time not in the sense of law in the service of force, its docile instrument, servile and thus exterior to the dominant power, but rather in the sense of law that would maintain a more internal, more complex relation with what one calls force, power or violence.<br />
The way of behavior that founds the law and is normatively oriented toward justice is determined by its &quot;relation with what one calls force, power or violence&quot; - a relation which is not an exterior taking into service, but rather affects the inner constitution of this behavior. The aporia of making law possible through justice must, then, according to Derrida, be understood as the expression of an aporia of force. This follows from the fact that justice as a normative ground is itself force. Justice can only be the ground of law, or make law possible, by being force. Through such grounding, however, justice as force makes that which is made possible by it, namely law, impossible. For <strong><u>the law that is set into play by the force of justice is always again interrupted by it.</u></strong><br />
... Continues ...<br />
It is therefore reasonable to look for another explanation. This explanation should understand the surplus force of justice not as the force of its in principle unfulfillable claim, but, on the contrary, as the force of the experience of the fulfillment and reality of justice. <strong><u>Justice has force (or is force) insofar as we experience it here and now, in a particular situation and at a particular time, as real or reigning.</u></strong> I want to suggest that this be described as the evidence or experience of justice: the evidence of the experience that a particular action was just; the evidence, that is, not that justice was brought about by an action, but that justice in fact prevailed in a situation. As the first aporia of making justice possible through law showed, this evidence of (the experience of) justice cannot be a certainty based on reasons. The evidence of (the experience of) justice is not guaranteed by an action or judgment that fulfils particular conditions. It is precisely because of this, however, that the evidence of (the experience of) justice can provide no secure foundation for our actions and their normative structure. The evidence that justice reigns here and now tells us nothing about how we can reiterate justice at a further place and time. <strong><u>The evidence of (the experience of) justice is, then, simultaneously force and foundation: as force it drives us ever onward; as foundation it is directed toward the order that it sets into play.</u></strong> If the practice of justice must be understood as rooted in the evidence of (the experience of) justice, then this practice is, at the same time, <strong><u>an expressive act of the realization of a force and an intentional act of the foundation of an order</u></strong>. This is the aporia that Derrida outlines in the relation of making possible between justice and law: as a productive foundation the evidence of justice makes law possible; as an expressive force the evidence of justice makes law impossible. <strong><u>Only an action that is grounded in the evidence of justice can bring about a legal order, but since the evidence of justice itself is not groundable it also cannot ground an action capable of bringing about a legal order.</u></strong><br />
III.<br />
&quot;Faith&quot; and &quot;Axiomatics&quot;<br />
Although the two aporias of making possible to which Derrida draws attention are different, they also have something, that is, one side, in common. They are both aporias that relate to the understanding of normative practice as productive (or production: poiesis). The aporia of making justice possible through law relates to the idea that an action can guarantee justice when it is safeguarded by generally shared reasons. Justice is, rather, always to-come - not because it lies in the future, but because it eludes the present certainty that it has been produced by [*609] oneself. The aporia of making law possible through justice relates to the idea that action can found or institute a legal order when it is grounded in the evidence of justice. <strong><u>The evidence of justice is, rather, an always surplus force that cannot provide a secure foundation for the result that it produces</u></strong>. Both aporias thus relate critically to a conception of normative practice that Derrida describes as being governed by the &quot;[subjectal] axiomatic of responsibility, of conscience, of intentionality, of property.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">33</a> It is the aporia of this (&quot;subjectal&quot;) conception of normative practice that Derrida exposes in Force of Law.<br />
... Continues ...<br />
The &quot;de(con)struction&quot; (Abbau) of axiomatic certainty into a presumed faith, however, does not only affect its validity. When the certainty that we can guarantee our normative claims and certainties by means of actions and reasons turns out to be a faith, then the content of what we believed to be certain also changes. <strong><u>Not only are certainty and faith not the same attitude, they also do not have the same content</u></strong>. If talking of &quot;faith&quot; here includes a consciousness of not being able to know, then this also implies - as a consciousness of not being able to know that we are able to guarantee success - a consciousness of not being able to bring about (to secure success). To believe, that is, not to know, that we can bring something about by means of our own conduct also means, then, to understand our own bringing about differently. <u><strong>Faith and knowledge thereby lose their simple opposition and begin to change places. To claim to know that we can bring something about means to believe that its success can be guaranteed through action. However, to believe that we can bring something about means to know that its success essentially depends upon something - &quot;circumstances&quot; - that we are not ourselves capable of bringing about. The faith in being able to bring something about is, then, paradoxically, as faith, always also a faith in an effect that is not our own doing.</strong></u> <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.apple.com/" rel="nofollow">**37**</a> <u><strong>This faith is not, however, a foundation or presupposition. It has to be understood as a structural characteristic of a normative practice, that is, of a practice that is oriented toward the idea of its success.</strong></u><br />
<br />
<br />
It is the opinion of the court that the abysses of the law do, in fact, permeate the constitution and all other legal texts that sustain our legal order. In these abysses, we find the concept of justice everywhere present.<br />
<br />
Thus we hold in the case <em>224 UNT vs. United States 2. 07</em> that all claims are reversed, the considerations having failed to take into account the legal concept of justice.<br />
