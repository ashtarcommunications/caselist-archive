Contention One – Rollback of Roe<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, coupled with numerous Congressional and<br />
state statutes has effectively ended abortion access for low-income<br />
women – the shift of Court review standard from strict scrutiny to undue<br />
burden has led to a virtual reversal of Roe v. Wade, especially for<br />
women living in poverty<br />

Contention Two – the Myth of the Welfare Queen<br />
<br />
Casey’s elimination of strict scrutiny and strengthening of the state’s<br />
interest has streamlines the creation financial obstacles such as<br />
waiting periods which impose huge structural barriers to poor women. The<br />
court aligned reproductive freedom with white, middle-class wives while<br />
excluding “welfare moms” from the institutionalized discourse of<br />
privacy. These poor women are both constructed as “bad mothers” and<br />
“poor deciders” making it seem less morally reprehensible and the proper<br />
political choice to sterilize them. The lack of safeguards for<br />
reproductive rights for the “welfare mother” makes racist sterilization<br />
and eugenics inevitable<br />

And poor, single, “lazy”, “stupid”, “promiscuous”, Black, “welfare<br />

popular sympathy and legality of sterilization mean poor Black women are<br />
powerless to stop eugenic encroachments<br />

<br />
The Supreme Court’s reluctance to exercise heightened judicial scrutiny<br />
by preferring a rational basis review in issues that disproportionately<br />
impact the poor signals broad deference to the legislative branches of<br />
government. The lack of judicial review of welfare restrictions has<br />
resulted in a virtual free fire zone on the rights of poor people<br />
leading to scapegoating and stigmatization<br />

The United States Supreme Court should overrule the undue burden test<br />
articulated in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey<br />
[505 U.S. 833 (1992)] by ruling that strict scrutiny must be applied to<br />
any government burden placed on an individual’s fundamental right to<br />
privacy in seeking an abortion.<br />
<br />
Contention Four is Solvency<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court should strike down the undue burden standard in Casey<br />
and return to the strict scrutiny standard in Roe – strict scrutiny<br />
prevents manipulation by the state which violates<br />
constitutionally-protected abortion rights. Only a return to this<br />
framework can protect abortion rights for poor and minority women.<br />

Hurricane Katrina 1AC<br />
[During the 1AC we play on a projector 9 minutes of images of New Orleans and the people of New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina]<br />
Emmett Till's body arrived home in …site and space &quot;where democracy has lost its claims&quot; (2005, 122, 124).<br />
As Henry Giroux points out the images of the living dead in New Orleans marks a form of racism distinct from that of the age of Emmett Till. No longer does white supremacy reveal itself in vengeance killings or terrorizing attacks by the KKK but rather is now a less overt from of white racism. The bodies of the Katrina victims illuminated a new kind of racism that has originated not based on intentional racism but rather on the alleged unintentional racism that has come with the withering of democracy and a politics willing to render segments of its population disposable.<br />
This shift in the way structural racism originates can be attributed to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Milliken v. Bradley ­ the Supreme Court has used the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation to limit the scope of desegregation remedies. The Supreme Court held in Milliken that desegregation remedies could only occur if there was intentional discrimination ­ this functionally withdrew all Supreme Court involvement in the desegregation process and doomed cities which were rapidly segregating despite non-intentional influences<br />
Preston Cary Green III elaborates in 1999 [University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Spring 99, 68 Journal of Negro Education 2, JSTOR nick]<br />
Since the Keyes decision, the Supreme Court … proper use of the federal judiciary’s remedial power.<br />
The intent standard expressed in Milliken creates a colorblind criterion within racial justice ­ it has led to the projection of an imagery of fairness which has largely rendered invisible the current enduring reality of race within the United States. The intent requirement effectively has become the modern grandchild of Plessy ­ it denies, evades and disengages race and the remedies for it ­ Donald Lively and Stephen Plass explain in 1991<br />

Modern formulations of discriminatory … is distinguished from its analytical past more by rhetoric than actual result.<br />
The rendering invisible of the poor, elderly, infirm, and criminalized populations removed from the suburbs hides the decaying schools and rundown neighborhoods of the contemporary inner city since Milliken ­ these people have become the waste product of the American dream ­ they are the living dead in a social state that does not care about them ­ it is the commitment to colorblind ideology that reinforces this invisibility<br />
Katrina, however, momentarily illuminated the disposability of populations within the inner city ­ once visible these images became unbearable for the nation’s elite. In response the Bush Administration and neoliberalism created an anti-spectacle ­ they bombarded us with images of everything but race and the destruction of Katrina ­ Bush appears on TV telling Brownie he’s doing a good job while simultaneously restricting the media from going on rescue boats. Ironically the response to Katrina was to end all images an initiate, through colorblindness, a national blackout ­ only continuing the racist nature of the current configuration of democracy and easing the disposal or sacrifice of portions of the population deemed dangerous or irrelevant ­ Giroux writes,<br />

Contention 1: Martial Law<br />
<br />
Initially note that the Supreme Court has expanded Quirin to serve as precent for the expansion of the president’s power to detain citizens<br />
<strong>Gruber 06</strong> (U. Kansas Law Review January; 54 Kan. L. Rev. 307; l/n)<br />
“A bigger problem… disingenuous at worst.”<br />
<br />
And specifically in Padilla the Supreme Court’s decision to turn suspected terrorists who are citizens of the United States and attempt to commit crimes on sovereign US territory over to the military fails to maintain the civilian/military distinction and sets a dangerous precedent that opens the floodgates to military use against US civilian populations<br />
<strong>Krause 02</strong> (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/6/22/0622/92456" rel="nofollow">http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/6/22/0622/92456</a>)<br />
“With this in mind… foreign enemies”<br />
<br />
Military detention of US citizens captures in the United States clurs the line between internal enforcement powers and external affairs – it justifies the militarization of internal matters and the possible repal of legal doctrine established in the Posse Comitatus Act<br />
<strong>Baker 05</strong> (Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics &amp; Public Policy)<br />
“In previous wars… destroys liberty.”<br />
<br />
Erosion of the Posse Comitatus Act increased role of the military in civilian governance suspends civil liberties and makes militarism pervasive through society<br />
<strong>Davis 98</strong> (Valparaiso University Law Review)<br />
“Nowhere are… different today”<br />
<br />
Militarism causes dehumanization by enforcing strict hierarchical relationships among people – it creates racism, sexism, homophobia and other forms of dehumanization – it fuels wars and is the root cause of global and domestic problems today<br />
<strong>Committee Opposed to Militarism and the Draft 01</strong> (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.comdsd.org/militarism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.comdsd.org/militarism.htm</a>)<br />
“Militarism is… establishment itself.”<br />
<br />
Dehumanization is the root cause of genocide and war. This is the impact of all impacts.<br />
<strong>Berube 97</strong> (Nanotechnology Magazine, Vol. 3, Iss. 5)<br />
“This means-ends… powerful weapon.”<br />
<br />
Acceptance of militarism causes error replication – making wars more likely to occur<br />
<strong>Fogarty 2K</strong> (<u>War, Peace, and the Social Order</u>; pg 10-11)<br />
“In the end… humanity”<br />
<br />
Militarism threatens human survival<br />
<strong>Elde and Thee 80</strong> (<u>Problems with Contemporary Militarism</u>; pg 10)<br />
“Furthermore, the process of decolonization… the survival of humanity.”<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
Supreme Court should strike down the President’s indefinite detention of US citizens without charge on the grounds that it violates the Posse Comitatus Act – its key to acvert martial law and preserve an independent judiciary<br />
<strong>Brief of the Respondent 04</strong> (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jenner.com/" rel="nofollow">www.jenner.com</a>)<br />

Judicial review is critical to protect individual rights and prevent genocide<br />

<strong>Gross 03</strong> (March, 112, Yale L.J. 1011, l/n)<br />
“Accommodation… political system.”<br />
<br />
Court action leads to social change by providing cover for sparking national debate on issues and challenging assumptions<br />
<strong>Schultz and Gotlieb 96</strong> (“Legal Functionalism and Social Change: A Reassessment of Rosenberg’s The Hollow Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change?”; Journal of Law and Policy; 12 J.L &amp; Pol’y 63; l/n)<br />
“The Supreme Court acts not only within the separate powers scheme… role in our political system.”<br />
<br />
Court action is critical – Congress will cater to the executive, undermining enforcement<br />
<strong>Wittes 05</strong> (“Check, Balances, and Wartime Detainees”; Policy Review; April/May, #130)<br />
“The simple truth… nearly absolute.”<br />
<br />
Contention 3: Framework<br />
<br />
Risk assessment irrationally exaggerates low probability impacts – vote aff to hold the lin eon risk evaluation<br />
<strong>Teuber 90</strong> (“Justifying Risk”, Daedalus, Volume 119 – Number 4, Fall)<br />
“But as workable… pay cash.”<br />
<br />
Decision calculus within the Court should not weigh the largest impact – its this sort of risk theory that’s led to broad deference to the military<br />
<strong>Rehmann-Sutter 98</strong> (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.piercelaw.edu/risk/vol9/spring/Rehman.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.piercelaw.edu/risk/vol9/spring/Rehman.pdf</a>)<br />

<strong><u>QUIRIN</u></strong><br />
<br />
Contention One – Bare Life<br />
<br />
The 1942 decision in Quirin serves as the primary precedent for the designation of citizens as enemy combatants – its led to a judicial deferral almost entirely to the unilateral determination<br />
Cruz ‘4 [Tania (William S. Richardson School of Law, University of Hawaii); “CIVIL LIBERTIES POST-SEPTEMBER 11: Judicial Scrutiny of National Security: Executive Restrictions of Civil Liberties When &quot;Fears and Prejudices Are Aroused&quot;”; Seattle Journal for Social Justice; Fall; 2 Seattle J. Soc. Just. 129; l/n nick]<br />
<br />
And the Court’s recent ruling in Hamdan, while a crushing blow to the administration’s claims of presidential power and a large narrowing of the Quirin decision, it does nothing to restrict authority to indefinitely detain “enemy combatants” so long as they do not go to trial - the decision literally takes combatants out of the frying pan and throws them into the fire<br />
Dorf ‘6 [Michael C. (Michael I Sovern Professor of Law at Columbia University); “The Hidden--and Obvious--Lessons in the Supreme Court's Divided Ruling Invalidating Military Commissions”; June 30; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20060630.html" rel="nofollow">http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20060630.html</a><em> nick]<br />
<br />
And it is the remaining legal precedent in Quirin that codifies the lawful versus unlawful combatant status used to detain enemy combatants<br />
The Record of The Association of The Bar of the City of New York ’04 [“The Indefinite Detention Of &quot;Enemy Combatants&quot;: Balancing Due Process And National Security In The Context Of The War On Terror”; 59 The Record 41; l/n </em>nick]<br />
<br />
And the rhetoric of “enemy combatant” creates a particular legal content which leads to an increase in the power of the system by allowing it to both create law and circumvent the existing law – it creates a mode in which it is impossible for any other body to create change<br />
Bond ‘5 [Jennifer; “The Language of War: A Battle of Words at Guantanamo Bay”; Appeal: Review of Current Law and Law Reform; 10 Appeal 70; l/n<em> nick]<br />
<br />
And the category of “unlawful combatant” allows war against identity, the enemy combatant, that constitutes the anti-state, anti-national, or anti-political – such non-citizens are stripped of all rights and suspended in an indeterminate status – they are neither alive nor dead – indefinite detention renders them objects of power over life and death<br />
Houen ‘6 [Alex (Lecturer in Modern Literature and American Studies in the Department of English Literature at the University of Sheffield, UK); “Sovereignty, Biopolitics, and the Use of Literature: Michel Foucault and Kathy Acker”; Theory and Event; Vol. 9, No. 1; ProjectMuse </em>nick]<br />
<br />
This culminates in the ability to exercise power at the level of life – populations are mobilized in the name of wholesale slaughter, genocide becomes vital to the system’s workings – such relations of violence threaten the existence of life itself<br />
Duffield ‘4 [Mark (Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Lancaster); “Carry on Killing: Global Governance, Humanitarianism and Terror”; April; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.bond.org.uk/emailings/art/Humanitarianism_Life.doc" rel="nofollow">http://www.bond.org.uk/emailings/art/Humanitarianism_Life.doc</a><em> nick]<br />
<br />
Plan:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should grant cert to the next available text case and overrule Ex parte Quirin [317 U.S. 1 (1942)] on the grounds that there is no distinction between enemy combatants and United States Citizens.<br />
<br />
Contention Two – The Whatever Ballot<br />
<br />
An effective challenge to sovereign violence can only come out of a refusal of sovereign distinctions – or the refusal of the distinction between “enemy combatants”, bare life, and United States’ citizens, the supposed Good Life – such a challenge entails a displacement of sovereign power and a return to a properly political power – only such a challenge can create a new politics not founded on bare life<br />
Edkins and Pin-Fat ‘5 [Jenny (Professor of International Politics at the University of Wales Aberystwyth) and Véronique (Lecturer in International Relations in the Centre for International Politics at the University of Manchester); “Through the Wire: Relations of Power and Relations of Violence”; Millennium: Journal of International Studies; Vol. 34, No. 1</em> nick]<br />
<br />
And our action through sovereignty is critical – the existence of the sovereign system is inevitable – given the choice of acting within sovereignty to limit or deciding not act we must create new precedents to torque sovereignty in a reversal to work against itself – the sovereign act in the context of Guantanamo is critical to interrogate itself<br />
Michaelsen and Shershow ‘4 [Scott (associate professor of English at Michigan State University) and Scott Cutler (professor of English at the University of California, Davis); “The Guantánamo &quot;Black Hole&quot;: The Law of War and the Sovereign Exception”; Middle East Report Online; January 11; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.merip.org/mero/mero011104.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.merip.org/mero/mero011104.html</a><em> nick]<br />
<br />
And we have an obligation to critically interrogate the representations used to justify detention. It is only through this process of public interrogation and critique that we can create an empty universal or community in which the global state of emergency can be prevented from establishing permanent global violence<br />
Pease ‘3 [Donald E. (Avalon Foundation Chair of the Humanities at Dartmouth College); “The Global Homeland State: Bush’s Biopolitical Settlement”; boundary 2; 30.3; ProjectMuse </em>nick]<br />
<br />
And a collapse of this discourse will result in a significant loss of power for sovereignty – empirically the executive branch has proven this in its reaction to other court rulings – despite the fact that the government uses discourse to wield power we can also reclaim that discourse to dismantle relations of violence within power<br />
Bond ‘5 [Jennifer; “The Language of War: A Battle of Words at Guantanamo Bay”; Appeal: Review of Current Law and Law Reform; 10 Appeal 70; l/n<em> nick]<br />
<br />
And this play within the law does not restore the law to force but rather allows a life born after it – this liberation allows us to create a world no longer founded on juridical power<br />
Agamben ‘5 [Giorgio (Professor of Aesthetics at the University of Verona); State of Exception; p. 64 </em>nick]<br />
<br />
And given the context of the paradigm of security in which sovereignty turns terroristic and engulfs all existence in a worldwide civil war – democracy demands not that we cease to defend ourselves but that in order to defend democracy demands to change the political paradigm must be made<br />
Agamben ‘2 [Giorgio (Professor of philosophy at the Collège International de Philosophie in Paris and at the University of Verona in Italy); “Security and Terror”; Theory and Event; Vol. 5, Issue 4; ProjectMuse<em> nick]<br />
<br />
Finally, the politicization of bare life radically transformed classical thought – attempts by the left, right, and opposition movements at change will fail – we must solve on the biopolitical terrain on which these problems have been formed – only interrogating the link between bare life and politics can effectively bring the political out of concealment<br />

Hurricane Katrina 1AC<br />
[During the 1AC we play on a projector 9 minutes of images of New Orleans and the people of New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina]<br />
Emmett Till's body arrived home in …site and space &quot;where democracy has lost its claims&quot; (2005, 122, 124).<br />
As Henry Giroux points out the images of the living dead in New Orleans marks a form of racism distinct from that of the age of Emmett Till. No longer does white supremacy reveal itself in vengeance killings or terrorizing attacks by the KKK but rather is now a less overt from of white racism. The bodies of the Katrina victims illuminated a new kind of racism that has originated not based on intentional racism but rather on the alleged unintentional racism that has come with the withering of democracy and a politics willing to render segments of its population disposable.<br />
This shift in the way structural racism originates can be attributed to the Supreme Court’s ruling in Milliken v. Bradley ­ the Supreme Court has used the distinction between de jure and de facto segregation to limit the scope of desegregation remedies. The Supreme Court held in Milliken that desegregation remedies could only occur if there was intentional discrimination ­ this functionally withdrew all Supreme Court involvement in the desegregation process and doomed cities which were rapidly segregating despite non-intentional influences<br />
Preston Cary Green III elaborates in 1999 [University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Spring 99, 68 Journal of Negro Education 2, JSTOR nick]<br />
Since the Keyes decision, the Supreme Court … proper use of the federal judiciary’s remedial power.<br />
The intent standard expressed in Milliken creates a colorblind criterion within racial justice ­ it has led to the projection of an imagery of fairness which has largely rendered invisible the current enduring reality of race within the United States. The intent requirement effectively has become the modern grandchild of Plessy ­ it denies, evades and disengages race and the remedies for it ­ Donald Lively and Stephen Plass explain in 1991<br />
[Donald, (Professor, College of Law, University of Toledo; J.D., University of California, Los Angeles; M.S., Northwestern University; A.B., University of California, Berkeley), Stephen, (Assistant Professor, School of Law, St. Thomas University; LL.M., Georgetown University; J.D. Howard University; B.A., Fairleigh Dickinson University.), ARTICLE: EQUAL PROTECTION: THE JURISPRUDENCE OF DENIAL AND EVASION, 40 Am. U.L. Rev. 1307lnhitch]<br />
Modern formulations of discriminatory … is distinguished from its analytical past more by rhetoric than actual result.<br />
The rendering invisible of the poor, elderly, infirm, and criminalized populations removed from the suburbs hides the decaying schools and rundown neighborhoods of the contemporary inner city since Milliken ­ these people have become the waste product of the American dream ­ they are the living dead in a social state that does not care about them ­ it is the commitment to colorblind ideology that reinforces this invisibility<br />
Katrina, however, momentarily illuminated the disposability of populations within the inner city ­ once visible these images became unbearable for the nation’s elite. In response the Bush Administration and neoliberalism created an anti-spectacle ­ they bombarded us with images of everything but race and the destruction of Katrina ­ Bush appears on TV telling Brownie he’s doing a good job while simultaneously restricting the media from going on rescue boats. Ironically the response to Katrina was to end all images an initiate, through colorblindness, a national blackout ­ only continuing the racist nature of the current configuration of democracy and easing the disposal or sacrifice of portions of the population deemed dangerous or irrelevant ­ Giroux writes,<br />

If a new affirmative is read or you hear a new advantage, you should get complete cites. Otherwise, just list the advantages that the affirmative claims.<br />
<br />
This is a performance 1ac that talks about rape and how we value the women’s body. They say we should play with the law like a toy. To do this they have prepared a little skit for the 1ac. They also talk about reclaiming “living labor” which has something to do with getting joy from the change we create in debate. They also reject debate norms like speed and card cutting.<br />

Minors must use bypass hearings to avoid parental notification, bridges ’06, khiara, m. “an antrhopolitical meditation on ex parte anonymous – a judicial bypass procedure for an adolescent’s abortion” 2006 california law review<br />
<br />
bypass hearings = inquisitional trial. Judge mediates women’s voice by placing sexuality on display and forcing her voice into legal code, bridges ’06, “judicial bypass hearings are… echo of the inquisitors questions.”<br />
<br />
engages in particular truth game in which minors sexual identity is constructed by the law, bridges ’06, “I have suggested… discourse more generally.”<br />
<br />
truth game determines sex acts as a technology of confession – this is a false feeling of salvation for the minor of trial – she’s normalized through a system of disciplinary power. “jaff ’95, “the rdp and me; paper presented at the 1st annual qualitative methods conference: a spanner in the works of the factory of truth” 20 oct 1995<br />
<br />
confessional must end – confession truth constitutes a regulatory truth about the identity of the larger group of people in the same situation establishing new norms from which exclusion can flow – brown ’96, “constitutions and survivor stores: in the folds of our own discourse, the pleasures and freedoms of silence” u of Chicago<br />
<br />
judicial bypass places sexuality and sex where it can be both judges and administered – this allows for the regulation of population – Foucault ’78 – the history of sexuality, vol 1 pg. 23 – 25<br />
<br />
disciplinary power in judicial bypass = slaughter of populations in the name of safety, eventually causing extinction – Foucault ’78, pg. 136-137<br />
<br />
text: The United States Supreme Court should grant cert to the next available test case and overrule the parental notification and consent holdings of Planned Parenthood v. Casey 112 S CT. 2791, 2804 (1992) on fourteenth amendment equal protection grounds.<br />
<br />
Bypass can no longer be justified. The only rational behind the hearings is to safeguard a vestiage of power – in order to rectify these harms the supreme court should overrule the parental notification and consent statues in casey – berman ’94, “supreme neglect for unemancipated minors’ abortion rights” 37 harvard lj 577<br />
<br />
our orientation, our objective is to deactivate the privilege of law as a regulator of life. Our criticism takes 2 pathes:<br />
<br />
1. local focus – an analysis of the localized applications of power becomes a starting pt for oppositional strats – Foucault ’90 – hist of sexuality, vol 1 pg. 100-102<br />
<br />
2. the plan never happens – reason to vote aff. Appropriating law into the realm of study keeps it inactive in adjudicating life. The very game we play with the law divorces it from sovereign power. – agamben ’05 – state of exception pg. 63-4<br />

<br />
Observation 1<br />
<br />
Inherency—The courts decision in Planned Parenthod v. Casey rearticulated the tight to abortion—while it applied to adult women the question of whether it applied to minor women was still undecided—the Casey court decided against minor abortions giving parents veto over the minors abortion rights—the only avenue in which a minor should avoid such a veto was through a court judicial bypasss hearing<br />

<br />
Observation 2—the inquisition<br />
<br />
And the judicial bypass hearing represents the inquisitional trial—the judge is able to mediate the women’s voice by placing her sexuality on display and forcing her voice in to code legalistic code<br />

<br />
Through her confession and rehearsed dialog her confession in front of the court becomes a monolog of the judges<br />

<br />
The meditated function of the bypass proceeding engages in a particular truth game in which the minors sexual identity is constructed as truth by the law<br />

<br />
Through this identity construction—her speech becomes normalized through the technology of confession—the feeling of liberation simultaneously places the individual within the network of power<br />
Jaff ’95 [Nicole, Professor of psychology at University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, “The RDP and ME,”Paper presented at the 1st Annual Qualitative Methods Conference: &quot;A spanner in the works of the factory of truth&quot; 20 October 1995,]<br />
<br />
Throughout her confessional dialog—truths are both assembled and deploys as “knowledge” about gender and sex<br />

<br />
This places sexuality and sex where it can both be judged and administered—allowing for the regulation of a population<br />

<br />
Observation 3—solvency<br />
<br />
Bypass proceedings can no longer be justified—the only rational behind the hearings is to safeguard a vestige of power—in order to rectify these harms the Supreme Court should overrule the parental notification and consent statutes in Casey<br />

<br />
Observation 4—our framework<br />
Our objective is to deactivate the privilege of law as the regulator of life our criticism will take two paths<br />
<br />
First—local focus—we should analyze the localized application of power as a starting point for oppositional strategies<br />
Foucault 90, The history of Sexuality volume 1, pg. 100-102<br />
<br />
Second—the aff is the first step in breaking down the confessional—appropriating the law into the realm of study—only then can we deactivate the laws ability to adjudicate life—only then can we divorce the law from sovereign power<br />
Agamben 5, [Giorgio, prof of aesthetics at the U of Verona, State of Exception, pg. 63-64
