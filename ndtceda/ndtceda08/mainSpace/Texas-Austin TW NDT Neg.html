Texas TW Neg<br />
<br />
Round # 7<br />
<br />
Vs Team: Baylor LT<br />
<br />
Judge: Richie, Steele, Tews<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
<br />
Lots of cards indicting Baudrillard - his theories fail, are totalizing, apply to himself.<br />
<br />
Baudrillards theories deny suffering in all its different facats - his philosophy can’t even account for the status quo, we know that there is some objectivity within each of our own subjective interpretations of reality. Kellner and Best 91<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
1 Off: Data K<br />
<br />
The aff is an explicit refusal to analyze strategies through data to interact. In the end - the aff teaches you tricks of genius that ultimately make you stupider Louter 04<br />
<br />
They are nowhere close to any rigorous analysis of data and ebate - their totalizing claims should be presumed not effect until proven otherwise. Zellner 07<br />
<br />
Explicit citation of sample size, other empirical dats is critical - causes flawed methodology. Talia 02<br />
<br />
Impacts - Their 1AC fails the reality test ignoring reality in favor of blank Baudrillard that guarantees the inability to interact with the world in any meaningful way. Cloud 06<br />
<br />
Zero impacts to the aff - presumption - and its offense because their non-falsifiable claims are exactly how good produces evil in the first place, this is specific to development. Short 99<br />
<br />
Better statistics unlock the international system - debate is not perfect, data is the only way to escape<br />
<br />
Alt - Vote neg to demand data in debate - explained above.<br />
<br />
Refusing to collect data bad Loury 00<br />
<br />
The impacts outweigh abstract individualism Loury 02<br />
<br />
Block Strategy:<br />
<br />
2NC went for the Data K<br />
<br />
Links -<br />
<br />
1 - fatalism about debate fails<br />
<br />
2 - need to inform an ethical position and politics to solve.<br />
<br />
3 - they make everything reversible, our arg is that reality is not reversible, we need data rather than metaphor to do anything<br />

We are not on the outside of neoliberalism looking in, given that our scholarly discourse contributes to these practices of death. We have no policy recommendations for the American empire, but instead chooseexile from US foreign policy advocacy.<br />
