Contention One --- Oil:<br />
<br />
US hardline stance prevents the building of a pipeline through Iran, which is key to transporting Caspian oil. <br />
Karagiannis, Assistant Professor at Kazakhstan Institute of Management Economics and Strategic Research, June/September 2003 (Central Asian Survey)<br />

<br />
&lt;Since 1993… resources of the Caspian. &gt;<br />
<br />
Iran is the best route for the pipeline geographically – it’s the shortest and avoids conflict ridden areas that could endanger the supply.<br />

<br />
&lt;In the coming …total success or annihilation.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two --- Japan:<br />
<br />
Japan is closely watching American interaction with Iran as an indicator of United States leadership, peruse<br />
Roger Howard, Freelance journalist covering security and international affairs, contributor to The New Statesman and Spectator magazines, Middle East International and Jane's Intelligence Review, Iran Oil: Petrodiplomacy and the Challenge to America, January 9th, 2007, pg. 1-5<br />
&lt;From the …and growing up fast.&gt;<br />
<br />
The US must assert itself vis-a-vis Russian expansion in order to reassure Japan and prevent it from re-arming.<br />
Stratfor, 12/21/07<br />
Japanese Defense …of self-defense.&gt;<br />
<br />
Japan on the brink of re-armament – warship refueling debate shows they are close to abandoning the US security umbrella.<br />
Stratfor, 10/31/07<br />
U.S. Defense Secretary …new world order.<br />
<br />
Japanese re-arm results in East Asian arms races which culminate in global war.<br />
Khalilzad 1995 &lt;Zalmay, Washington Quarterly, Spring, “Losing the Moment? The United States and the World After the Cold War,” lexis&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;The same …than the last.&gt;<br />
<br />
These arms races will go nuclear and reignite conflicts in India and Pakistan, Korea, and Taiwan leading to extinction.<br />

<br />
&lt;The blocks …weapon since 1945.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three – Kosovo:<br />
<br />
Unilateral Kosovar Independence inevitable – election results and coalition building between rivals prove.<br />
Stratfor, 11/19/07<br />
&lt;Serbia's secessionist province …to discuss the issue.&gt;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Iran key to undermining Russian energy supremacy.<br />

<br />
&lt;This is not as …observes Mr Pamir.&gt;<br />
<br />
Undercutting the Russian natural gas monopoly is the key to garnering EU support for Kosovar independence.<br />
George Friedman, Direktor of Stratfor, 6/26/07 (“A Return to Kosovo”)<br />
&lt;By visiting …Putin is on Kosovo.<br />
<br />
European backing for Kosovar independence is the only way to avoid an inevitable renewal of  destabilizing conflict in the Balkans.<br />
Nik Steinberg, Masters Student at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and worked in Kosovo in 2003, “FREE KOSOVO – WITHOUT A FIGHT,” 11/21/07, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1121/p09s01-coop.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1121/p09s01-coop.html</a><br />
<br />
&lt; Ethnic Albanians have a …recognition it so desperately needs.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Balkans instability leads to WWIII.<br />
Paris ’02 (Roland, Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at University of Colorado, Political Science Quarterly, “Kosovo and the metaphor war”, Volume 117, Issue 3, Fall, Proquest)<br />
<br />
&lt;At this early stage …before it is too late. <br />
<br />
<br />
Global nuclear war.<br />
Charles Glaser, Expert on International defense and Security Policy, “Why NATO is Still Best: Future Security Arrangements for Europe,” International Security, Vol. 18, No. 1, Summer 1993, pp. 8-9, JSTOR, Accessed: Dartmouth College<br />
<br />
&lt;However, although …unconcerned about Europe’s future.&gt;<br />
<br />
No risk of renewing other frozen conflicts – Kosovo won’t be modeled because they know there will be no international support.<br />
Paul Mitchell, “US and Russia at loggerheads over Kosovo independence,” World Socialist Web Site,  7/23/2007,  <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/jul2007/koso-j23.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/jul2007/koso-j23.shtml</a><br />
<br />
&lt;To overcome calls … many African countries.”&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should allow United States companies to participate in Iranian pipeline projects that transport petroleum from Azerbaijan to Iran. The United States federal government should offer the government of Iran Export-Import Bank guarantees to finance an Iranian pipeline that transports petroleum from Azerbaijan. <br />
<br />
Negative claims that Iran will exploit American concessions assume status quo hostility – removing barriers to Iranian access to Caspian energy resources will create major psychological differences in the approach of the Iranian regime<br />
Karagiannis, Assistant Professor at Kazakhstan Institute of Management Economics and Strategic Research, June/September 2003 (Central Asian Survey)<br />
<br />
&lt;From the Iranian …Persian Gulf. &gt;<br />
<br />
Our alteration to the fundamental structure of dialogue between the US and Iran stops the process of mutual otherization whereby both countries seek to destroy the other to purify the world.<br />

Iran is not free of its … nations held of each other.<br />
<br />
Removing traditional stumbling blocks to communication allows for successful talks. <br />
William O. Beeman, Professor of Anthropology and Director of Middle East Studies at Brown University, President of the Middle East Section of the American Anthropological Association, 2005 (“The ‘Great Satan’ vs. the ‘Mad Mullahs’,” p. 8-9)<br />

Topicality quid pro quo 2AC<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement – de-links issues – it can’t be quid pro quo<br />
Nathan A. Adams, 2000, 33 Cornell Int’l L. J. 1<br />
“constructive engagement” primarily involves delinking…economic and political undertaking.”<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement begins with de-linking, eliminates conditioning<br />
Hutchinson, July 16, 1997, 143 Cong Rec S 7544<br />
Today we will have that opportunity with this sense…we started this policy of constructive engagement.<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement on MFN de-linked<br />
Feingold, 5/22/1997, Federal News Service<br />
In fact, I have objected to the president’s policy…better influence Chinese behavior<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement is reducing pressure and relying on dialogue – that’s what the plan does<br />
Forcese, 2002, 5 Yale H.R. &amp; Dev. L.J. 1<br />
Like many terms expressing a highly politicized concept…accelerated economic integration<br />
<br />
Eliminating pressure sets a good limit – existing pressure is finite and knowable. The negative has good ground and can prepare<br />
<br />
Quid pro quo is a bad limit – there are a huge number of things that could be offered as the quid – all the different aid programs, trade preferences, military options etc – and there is no limit on what could be asked for in the quo<br />
<br />
Quid pro quo make topic bi-dreictional – no stable negative ground<br />
<br />
Conditionality increases pressure. They could claim coercion and decreased relations<br />
Peerenboom, Summer, 2006, 7 Chi. J. Int’l L. 17<br />
The Bush Administration’s messianic promotion of democracy…government on the unwilling.”<br />
<br />
Quid pro quo make the plan text a moving target – the affirmative doesn’t have to commit to doing anything. They can shift around on whether the other country will say yes. Negative solvency and DA arguments do not add up because of the either/or nature of a quid pro quo<br />

Iran 1ac<br />
Contention one ­ Iraq and the Coming War with Iran:<br />
<br />
Iran is exploiting its relationships with Shi'a militias to destabilize Iraq in an attempt to discredit and weaken a Bush administration that Iran fears is on the verge of attacking them. Although Iran has interests in the long-term stability of Iraq, it will inadvertently prompt full-scale civil war absent a security guarantee from the US. This conflict escalates into a regional and sectarian battle for control of Iraq.<br />
Vali Nasr, Professor @ Naval Postgraduate School, Adjunct Senior Fellow @ CFR, Jul/Aug<br />
'06, Foreign Affairs, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://squirrel.wfu.edu/webmail/horde/util/go.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foreignaffairs.org%2F20060701faessay85405%2Fvali-nasr%2Fwhen-the-Shi%27ites-rise.html&amp;Horde=e16458bbdd66737fde4e0020c537ee32" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060701faessay85405/vali-nasr/when-the-Shi'ites-rise.html</a><br />
&lt;So far, Tehran has favored a policy...a sectarian conflict between Shiites and Sunnis.&gt;<br />
<br />
Even if Iran doesn't defeat the US in Iraq right away, its high threshold for casualties would guarantee it victory in the long-term. With the US out of the picture, Iran would dominate Iraq and march down to Saudi Arabia, seizing their oil fields and gaining complete control over the global energy supply.<br />
Stratfor, 8/27/07 (&quot;Endgame: American Options in Iraq&quot;)<br />
