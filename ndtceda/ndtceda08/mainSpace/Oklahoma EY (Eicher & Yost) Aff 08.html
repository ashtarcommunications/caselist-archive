<strong>Observation 1: You’re Either With Us, or Against Us</strong> <br />
<br />
The attacks of September 11 challenged America’s sense of ontological security. The war on terrorism and its subsequent military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are not realist reactions to restore the balance of power or liberal proclamations to liberate nations with democracy. Rather they are a rhetorical attempt to deny our vulnerability and reestablish an American identity through the destruction of the “evil other.”<br />
Epstein, 7. <br />
(Noa Epstein is a Master’s Candidate in the Department of International Relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “explaining the war on terror from an ontological-security perspective” spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.mit.edu/mitir/2007/spring/perspective.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.mit.edu/mitir/2007/spring/perspective.html</a>)<br />
<strong>Bush’s declaration that “you are either or with us or against” is a haunting reminder of the war in Vietnam. In that war, like Afghanistan, it was difficult to separate our enemies from the civilians we were charged with protecting. But America would not lose its resolve. Armed with our belief in the higher cause we took our war to the people and their rice culture. Our defoliation of the environment and our slaughter of Vietnamese people was justified by the sense that were saving the Vietnamese people from themselves.</strong>  <br />

<strong>Observation 2: Killing Them to Save Them</strong>  <br />
<br />
The U.S. Response to 9/11 is not new. The Extermination of Native Americans, the War in Vietnam and the War in Afghanistan are all part of the same imperial drive to save the world. The narrative of American Exceptionalism has an ontological chokehold on truth. Under the guise of “Expert” opinions and “objective” reporting, America has exterminated untold numerous numbers of people, cultures and environments in the name of saving them.<br />
