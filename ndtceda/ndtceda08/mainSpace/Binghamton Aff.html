<br />
<strong>Observation One</strong> is The Verdict:<br />
<br />
First, the Milliken decision has essentially made desegregation impossible as a result of its evidentiary standard of discriminatory intent as opposed to impact<br />
<br />
<strong>Chemerinsky</strong> May 20<strong>03</strong> (Erwin [Sydney M. Irmas Professor of Public Interest Law, Legal Ethics and Political Science, University of Southern California] “WHAT ROLE SHOULD COURTS PLAY IN INFLUENCING EDUCATIONAL POLICY?: THE SEGREGATION AND RESEGREGATION OF AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION: THE COURTS' ROLE,” 81 N.C.L. Rev. 1597, d/l: lexis-nexis)<br />
<br />
In 1974, the Supreme Court started to take a different turn....found it impossible to prove the government's responsibility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we should shift the burden back onto the state in terms of discriminatory proof, overturning Milliken<br />
<br />
<strong>Randall</strong> Summer 20<strong>03</strong> (Anne [J.D., Georgetown University Law Center] “Reclaiming Brown's Vision: A New Constitutional Framework for Mandating School Integration,” 10 Geo. J. Poverty Law &amp; Pol'y 363, d/l: lexis-nexis)<br />
<br />
A principle in the early school desegregation decisions, especially Swann and Keyes....discriminatory exclusionary zoning, or state created inner-city ghettos.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Therefore, we propose the following plan</strong> <strong>that</strong> The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Milliken v. Bradley (418 U.S. 717), in the next relevant test case, on the grounds that proof of discriminatory intent places an undue burden on the plaintiffs, requiring proof of discriminatory impact instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Two</strong> is Innocence:<br />
<br />
First, Milliken’s requirement of discriminatory intent rests on the notion of white suburban innocence, overlooking how seemingly race-neutral housing issues result in segregation<br />
<br />
<strong>Orfield</strong> 19<strong>96</strong> (Gary [Professor of Education and Social Policy at Harvard] <em>Dismantling Desegregation</em>, The New Press) p. 292-294<br />
<br />
During the past two decades....Many effects of that discrimination continue today.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is unfortunate since notions of white innocence fosters both conscious and unconscious forms of racism<br />
<br />
<strong>Ross</strong> 19<strong>94</strong> (Thomas [Professor of Law at the University of Pittsburgh] <em>Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror</em>; edited by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic; Temple University Press, Philadelphia) p. 31<br />
<br />
The two parts of the rhetoric of innocence connect to and trigger...unconscious racism that surrounds those words.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alas, we need concrete material action, not just abstract theories, to redress the problems of white innocence.<br />
<br />
<strong>Harvey</strong> 20<strong>04</strong> (Karin A. [Ph.D. in Christian Social Ethics from Union Theological Seminary] <em>Disrupting White Supremacy From Within: White People On What We Need To Do;</em> ed. Jennifer Harvey, Karin A. Case, and Robin Hawley Gorsline; The Pilgrim Press, Cleveland) p. 112<br />
<br />
To the extent that such unjust material realities...to unjust enrichments of myriad kinds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Further, Milliken upholds racial instincts toward segregation as natural by overlooking why housing segregation happens and its impact on people of color<br />
<br />
<strong>Orfield</strong> 19<strong>96</strong> ([Professor of Education and Social Policy at Harvard] <em>Dismantling Desegregation</em>, The New Press) p. 295-297<br />
<br />
What the Supreme Court recognized in Swann and Keyes....that produce residential segregation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, desegregation cannot occur without Supreme Court action<br />
<br />
<strong>Chemerinsky,</strong> 20<strong>05</strong> (Erwin Chemerinsky [Alston &amp; Bird Professor of Law and Professor of Political Science at Duke Law] “The Segregation and Resegregation of American Public Education” <em>School Resegregation, Must the South Turn Back?</em>, Ed. John Charles Boger and Gary Orfield, The University of North Carolina Press) p. 30-31<br />
<br />
The federal government and, for that matter....would have limited resegregation of southern schools.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, this belief in the naturalness of racial instincts furthers white supremacy, resulting in genocide and other social atrocities<br />
<br />
<strong>Harvey</strong><strong>, Case, and Gorsline</strong> 20<strong>04</strong> (Jennifer [Ph.D. in Christian Social Ethics from Union Theological Seminary] Karin A. [Ph.D. in Christian Social Ethics from Union Theological Seminary] Robin Hawley [Ph.D. in Systematic Theology from Union Theological Seminary in New York and M.Div. from Episcopal Divinity School] <em>Disrupting White Supremacy From Within: White People On What We Need To Do;</em> The Pilgrim Press, Cleveland) p. 15-16<br />
<br />
Rather than assuming that race is something natural.....has led to all kinds of social atrocities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, racial prejudice within white America creates an Us/Them mentality that results in war<br />
<br />
<strong>Scales-Trent</strong> 19<strong>94</strong> (Judy [Professor of Law at the State University of New York, Buffalo] (<em>Critical White Studies: Looking Behind the Mirror</em>; edited by Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic; Temple University Press, Philadelphia) p. 480-481<br />
<br />
In both instances, we are talking about an exercise in drawing lines.......We have taken more land. This much is ours.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, there is a moral imperative to take a stance against white supremacy since failure to do so puts the collective life of America and our very souls at risk<br />
<br />
<strong>Case</strong> 20<strong>04</strong> (Karin A. [Ph.D. in Christian Social Ethics from Union Theological Seminary] <em>Disrupting White Supremacy From Within: White People On What We Need To Do;</em> ed. Jennifer Harvey, Karin A. Case, and Robin Hawley Gorsline; The Pilgrim Press, Cleveland) p. 65-66<br />
<br />
I cannot state strongly enough that.....It is so destructive as to be morally intolerable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
White supremacy is responsible for the greatest amount of destruction and dehumanization of the world’s peoples; unless we challenge and reconstruct this paradigm we face global extinction<br />
<br />
<strong>Henderson</strong> 19<strong>95</strong> (Errol Anthony [Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida, where he teaches International Relations] Excerpted from the book <em>Afrocentrism and World Politics: Towards a New Paradigm,</em> Praeger Publishers, New York, NY<br />
<br />
In sum, considering the history of white supremacism in the United States.......discourse before taking it up in greater detail in a later chapter<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation Three</strong> is Judgment of Peace:<br />
<br />
First, our unequal system of education undermines our ability to spread true democracy abroad and at home<br />
<br />
Eric <strong>Lerum</strong>, Sheila <strong>Moreira</strong>, <strong>and</strong> Rena <strong>Scheinkman</strong> Spring 20<strong>05</strong> [graduated from the Washington College of Law in 2003. While law students, they taught constitutional law to public high school students in the District of Columbia as Marshall-Brennan Fellows and co-founded the Education Project to promote education rights for the students of the nation's capital. Eric Lerum is currently the Legislative Counsel for the Committee on Education, Libraries, and Recreation for the Council of the District of Columbia. Sheila Moreira is an attorney with the Moreira Law Firm, P.C. in New York. Rena Scheinkman is an Associate at Fulbright &amp; Jaworski L.L.P. in Washington, D.C] “Strengthening America's Foundation: Why Securing the Right to an Education at Home is Fundamental to the United States' Efforts to Spread Democracy Abroad,” 12 Hum. Rts. Br. 13, d/l: lexis-nexis)<br />
<br />
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION repeatedly communicates its lofty goals......become an active participant in our democracy<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is ultimately problematic since without democracy the globe will face extinction<br />
<br />
<strong>Diamond</strong> 19<strong>95</strong> (Larry [Hoover Institution senior fellow, co-editor of the Journal of Democracy] “Promoting Democracy in the 1990s: Actors and Instruments, Issues and Imperatives,” <em>A Report to the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict</em>, d/l: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/1.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security.....international security and prosperity can be built.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Further, Desegregated education is essential to solve geopolitical issues and promote international peace<br />
<br />
<strong>Minow</strong> Spring 20<strong>02</strong> (Martha [Professor, Harvard Law School] “ISAAC MARKS MEMORIAL LECTURE: Education for Co-Existence,” 44 Ariz. L. Rev. 1, d/l: lexis-nexis)<br />
<br />
Working with young people is especially crucial.....conflict resolution with skills training in communication and mediation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, by accepting small steps and realizing that we can’t control the entirety of the outcomes of our actions we can undermine white supremacy<br />
<br />
<strong>Schneider</strong> 20<strong>04</strong> (Laurel C. [M.Div. from Harvard; Ph.D. from Vanderbilt; Associate Professor of Theology, Ethics and Culture at the Chicago Theological Seminary] <em>Disrupting White Supremacy From Within: White People On What We Need To Do;</em> ed. Jennifer Harvey, Karin A. Case, and Robin Hawley Gorsline; The Pilgrim Press, Cleveland) p. 160-161<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I suspect that whiteness.....we begin to take the supremacy out of whiteness.<br />

<br />
MORRISON 1AC:<br />
<br />
Observation One: The Morrison Decision<br />
<br />
Without the Morrison decision, Lopez is just a warning to Congress that they must prove a piece of legislation has a rational basis in the commerce clause.<br />
<br />
[Sargentich, 2003] Thomas O. (Professor of Law, Codirector of Program on Law and Government, Director of LL.M. Program on Law and Government, American University Washington College of Law), “The Rehnquist Court and State Sovereignty: Limitations of the New Federalism,” 12 Widener L.J. 459, p L/N<br />
<br />
Although Lopez … the Supreme Court. 55<br />
<br />
<br />
If the Court were to use rational basis review of Congress’ fact-finding in Morrison then it would not overrule the civil remedy.<br />
<br />
[Souter writing the Morrison dissent in 2000] 529 U.S. 598, United States v. Morrison<br />
<br />
Our cases, which remain … Hon. Charles McC. Mathias, Hon. James E. Bromwell).<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan text:<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) by deferring to the primacy of Congressional fact-finding when determining whether jurisdiction exists for a federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Two: The Morrison Precedent<br />
<br />
(A) Crisis response and prevention<br />
<br />
Commerce Clause precedent created by Morrison prevents effective coordination between federal and local disaster response and stops Congressional legislation to improve local responses to terrorism.<br />
<br />
[Brook, 2005] Brian, “Federalizing the First Responders to Acts of Terrorism Via the Militia Clauses,” 54 Duke L.J. 999, p. L/N<br />
<br />
Although federal agencies … under the commerce power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Morrison precedent encourages Congress not to pass anti-terrorism legislation.<br />
<br />
[Powers, 2002] Scott T, “A Retreat From Clarity: The Supreme Court Adds a Wrinkle to the &quot;Aggregated Effects&quot; Doctrine of its Commerce Clause Jurisprudence,” 75 Temp. L. Rev. 163, p. L/N<br />
<br />
A second feature of … a uniform, national solution. n285<br />
<br />
Morrison’s federalism precedent creates a state-oriented focus for public health emergencies that undermines the effectiveness of the response.<br />
<br />
[Greenberger, 2005] Michael (Law School Prof @ U of Maryland School of Law and Director of U of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security), “The Role of the Federal Government in Response to Catastrophic Health Emergencies: Lessons Learned from Hurricane Katrina,” October, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/25/" rel="nofollow">http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/25/</a><br />
<br />
In much of the recent … by the federal government.<br />
<br />
<br />
These federal response capabilities will be key to coordinating effective responses to bioterror or an epidemic.<br />
<br />
[Buchsbaum, 2002] Lori L (master’s of public health and JD candidate), “The U.S. Public Health Response to Bioterrorism: Need for a Stronger Legislative Approach,” 7 Mich. St. J. Med. &amp; Law 1, p L/N<br />
<br />
A bioterrorist attack or … public and private sectors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bioterror attack or public epidemic would destroy the economy and kill millions globally – at least one of these events is coming in the status quo, it is only a matter of time. We must respond effectively.<br />
<br />
Bill Frist MD, 8-3-2005, Senate Majority Leader, lecture delivered at Nantucket Atheneum, p <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://frist.senate.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Speeches.Detail&amp;Speech_id=261&amp;Month=8&amp;Year=2005" rel="nofollow">http://frist.senate.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Speeches.Detail&amp;Speech_id=261&amp;Month=8&amp;Year=2005</a><br />

By sickening … Preparing is deterring.&quot;<br />

<br />
(B) The Endangered Species Act<br />
<br />
Roberts’ environmental record shows he’ll side against federal environmental safeguards – with O’Connor leaving he is the key swing vote on these cases.<br />
<br />
[Community Rights Counsel et al, 2005] Defenders of Wildlife, EarthJustice, Endangered Species Coalition, Friends of the Earth, National Environmental Trust, Sierra Club; Letter to Senators Specter and Leahy, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.communityrights.org/PDFs/RobertsLetter2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.communityrights.org/PDFs/RobertsLetter2005.pdf</a><br />
<br />
Judge John G. Roberts, Jr. … federal law against polluters.2<br />
<br />
<br />
But Roberts will consistently defer to stare decisis especially in cases where he is the key vote to a 5-4 that O’Connor would have been.<br />
<br />
Jeffrey Rosen , 9-12-2005, legal affairs editor, “Liberals Shouldn’t Fight Roberts,” The New Republic, p <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050919&amp;s=rosen091905" rel="nofollow">http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050919&amp;s=rosen091905</a><br />
<br />
In addition to Roberts's views … federal power across the board.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, Morrison’s precedent will gut the ESA and most federal environmental statutes.<br />
<br />
[Koch, 2005] John Gregory (attorney in an envi and natural resources practice and Associate Representative for the Delaware Valley Environmental Inn of Court), “Congress, Cave Bugs, Courts and the Commerce Clause: Did the Fifth Circuit Figure Out How to Regulate Intrastate Activity Under the Endangered Species Act?” 16 Vill.

<br />
[Lyman, 2006] Rick,New York Times, Rising Ocean Temperatures Threaten Florida's Coral Reef, May 22, L/N<br />
<br />
On May 9, for the first time … agriculture, human poaching and boating accidents.<br />
<br />
<br />
This listing creates a host of remedies for coral that will rehabilitate destroyed habitats, create legal remedies in coastal waters and spillover to protect other species and habitats effectively.<br />
<br />

Observation Three: The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights<br />
<br />
(A) Genocide<br />
<br />

A) The false belief that courts can produce social change is a conservative trap that lures movements to litigation which trades off with more successful grassroots tactics.<br />

<br />
A) Discussions of the distribution of places and roles, the organization of powers and legitimizing this distribution is not politics, but instead is a form of social policing. This logic of policing determines what bodies and discourses are perceptible and countable – IE, the difference between language and noise. Politics, on the other hand, occurs whenever the consensus of the police counting logic is interrupted.<br />
<br />
The aff confuses politics with policing.<br />

<br />
In the initial conflict that produces a dispute about the … where these occupations are distributed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
B) The aff uses the law to organize and redistribute parts of society in order to more fully integrate society as the sum of its parts – this process is called the juridification of the social. This normalizes the social and legal hegemony that results in moral absolutism, the identification of evil, and therefore requires endless war against evil unto death of either side.<br />

C) Whenever society is seen as something that can be fully counted, there are always those that go uncounted and are literally disappeared from society. The counting logic produces discardable life, in which no one is held accountable for the eradication of this life.<br />

<br />
A condition of Ranciere’s “society,” we have…. The loss of discardable life is no loss but a wash.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
D) The counting logic demarcates who belongs to the citizenry and who is left out. This production of discardable life culminates in global life-zones and death-zones, concentrating cruelty and genocide onto populations marked as discardable life, rendered expendable, superfluous and disqualified from political existence. It is the pre-requisite for all modern violence.<br />

Observation One: The Morrison Decision<br />

Without the Morrison decision, Lopez is just a warning to Congress that they must prove a piece of legislation has a rational basis in the commerce clause.<br />

The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) by deferring to the primacy of Congressional fact-finding when determining whether jurisdiction exists for a federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Two: The Morrison Precedent<br />

<br />
Advantages:<br />

<br />
Aff Strategy Notes:<br />
If the affirmative straight turned a DA, read a kritik against a DA, or did anything else unusual, make a note of it here.<br />
<br />
They claim moral imperatives come before anything and in round admitting that we cant control our own racism solves something (I don’t know what)
