 Contention one: Regional Shift<br />
<br />
US trade leadership and a successful Doha round is key to the multilateral trade regime – the alternative is preferential trade agreements that result in trade blocks and conflict – leadership averts every global conflict and is key to solving global problems<br />
Panitchpakdi, 2/26/2004<br />
[Supachai, &quot;To Director General American Leadership and the World Trade Organization: What is the Alternative? ,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wto.org/english/news_e/spsp_e/spsp22_e.htm</a>]<br />
<br />
I can sum up my… on it. So does America. <br />
<br />
Now is key – the recent collapse of Doha will lead to a broad shift to preferential trade agreements undermining multilateral trade regimes<br />
The New York Times, 8/2/2008 <br />
[&quot;The Next Step for World Trade,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/02/opinion/02sat1.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/02/opinion/02sat1.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin</a>]<br />
<br />
The collapse of the …in more open trading.<br />
<br />
<br />
This shift destroys global trade<br />
First, The Spaghetti Bowl – Preferential trade destroys multilateral regimes, creating a patchwork system, politicizes trade and stifles global development<br />
Panagariya, Columbia University Professor, and Bhagwati 7/13/2003 <br />
[Arvind, Jagdish, &quot;Bilateral trade treaties are a sham,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/6118/bilateral_trade_treaties_are_a_sham.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/6118/bilateral_trade_treaties_are_a_sham.html</a>] <br />
<br />
Pascal Lamy, the European ….&quot; precisely delivering the opposite. <br />
<br />
<br />
Second, Trade Blocks – preferential trade politicizes free trade guaranteeing rival trade blocks collapsing the benefits of global trade<br />
Gordon, 2/13/2003 <br />

<br />
Even Americans may be …. the global trade system. <br />
<br />
Trade blocks and politicization of regional trade guarantees global economic collapse and conflict<br />
Cho, 2007<br />
[Sungjoon, &quot;Doha's Development,&quot; 25 Berkeley J. Int'l L. 165]<br />
<br />
Second, the mercantilist …. and are punished for them. <br />
<br />
Contention Two: Multilateralism<br />
<br />
Multilateral revival through Doha is the key link to multilateral cooperation<br />
Davis, Wall Street Journal, 7/31/2008 <br />
[Bob, &quot;Trade Talks' Failure Weighs on Other Issues,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=11141" rel="nofollow">http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=11141</a>]<br />

<br />
Multilateral cooperation through trade regimes solves global problems – unilateralism, trade blocks, and localism are all insufficient to solve global conflict, poverty and development<br />
Matthews, 11/8/2007 <br />
[Jessica, &quot;Europe and the US: Confronting Global Challenges,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/transcript_mandelson.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/transcript_mandelson.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Now, the question I want to … when people break those rules.<br />
<br />
This leads to the end of nuclear war, and prevents the impacts to escalating environmental destruction<br />
Dyer, 12/30/2004<br />
[Gwynne, &quot;The end of war,&quot; Toronto Star, l/n]<br />
<br />
War is deeply embedded …. of the existing state system. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan: The United States federal government should eliminate nearly all of its domestic cotton subsidies, including, but not limited to, user marketing payments, direct payments, export credit guarantee programs, counter-cyclical payments, marketing loan provisions, market loss payments, production flexibility contract payments, and analogous domestic cotton subsidies.<br />
We reserve the right to clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Three: Doha Revival<br />
<br />
The US has cut domestic cotton subsidies and further cuts are in the hopper – none of these will succeed in complying with the WTO dispute mandate on cotton subsidies<br />
Schnepf, 1/25/2008 <br />
[Randy, &quot;brazil's WTO case against the US cotton program: a brief overview,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RS22187.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RS22187.pdf</a>]<br />
<br />
Ultimately, Congress is … direct payments are included in the AMS calculation.18 <br />
<br />
<br />
There are three links to Doha Revival<br />
First, The Litmus Test<br />
<br />
Doha revival is possible – US cotton subsidy cuts are the key issue for getting negotiators back to the table<br />
Agence France Presse, 8/5/2008 <br />
[&quot;We can bring back world trade talks: Brazilian president,&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gRxNvzIMcqncI2wLVIc-xbDyJozw" rel="nofollow">http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gRxNvzIMcqncI2wLVIc-xbDyJozw</a>] <br />
<br />
World trade talks have … hammered out in the WTO. <br />
<br />
Cotton subsidies overwhelm every other issue – this is the litmus test for a meaningful Doha<br />
PanJanuary 2007 <br />
[Suwen, Mohamadou Fadiga, Samarendu Mohanty, Mark Welch, &quot;Cotton in a Free Trade World,&quot; Volume 45, Issue 1, Pages 188-197]<br />
<br />
Cotton has been at the … for all major market participants. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now Key – reviving Doha solves, gets future administrations and developing countries on-board<br />
Business Line, Former IIM Calcutta Economics Professor, 8/27/2008 <br />
[&quot;OPINION THE DOHA ROUND IMPASSE,&quot; lexis]<br />
<br />
One may ask: Why try….on the part of developing nations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Two – Negotiating Credibility<br />
<br />
US cotton subsidy cuts bolster US negotiating credibility and leverage – this is the key link to a successful agreement<br />
Newell, Summer 2005 <br />
[Matthew, &quot;NOTE: Cotton, U.S. Domestic Policy, and Trade Wars: The Future of WTO Agriculture Negotiations,&quot; 14 Minn. J. Global Trade 301]<br />
<br />
Regardless of …. agriculture negotiations are likely to fail.<br />
<br />
US trade cred is key to prevent destructive forms of regional trade blocks – causes economic collapse and war<br />
Bergsten, April 2001 <br />
[Fred, &quot;America's Two-Front Economic Conflict,&quot; foreign affairs, lexis]<br />
<br />
This international leadership …. and the disintegration of global economic links. <br />
<br />
Three – Dispute Settlement<br />
<br />
Full implementation of the DSB decision is a fundamental requirement to sustain the credibility of multilateral trade regimes<br />
Ministry of External Relations 10-15-07 Brazil-US dispute over cotton subsidies. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brazil.org.uk/newsandmedia/pressreleases_files/20071015.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.brazil.org.uk/newsandmedia/pressreleases_files/20071015.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The Brazilian Government …the credibility of the multilateral trading system. <br />
<br />
Compliance with the Cotton decision bolsters DSB legitimacy – leads to resolution of every issue in Doha<br />
Shumaker, Spring 2007 <br />
[Michael, &quot;Tearing the Fabric of the World Trade Organization: United States - Subsidies on Upland Cotton,&quot; Lexis]<br />
<br />
Clearly, the DSB's adoption …. through general negotiations.<br />
<br />
WTO dispute mechanism solves inequalities within global trade regimes – creates fair recourse for every nation<br />
Ikenson, 2/26/2007 <br />
[Daniel, &quot;Is the WTO Dispute Settlement System Fair?&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/12665/is_the_wto_dispute_settlement_system_fair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/12665/is_the_wto_dispute_settlement_system_fair.html</a>]<br />
<br />
The WTO dispute settlement …. the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Independently, US compliance with the WTO cotton decision is key to prevent collapse of the global economy and multilateral trade regimes through a US-Brazil trade war, spillover is inevitable absent the plan<br />
Petelin, 2006 <br />
