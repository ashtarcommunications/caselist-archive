The Us crruently spnsers an illegal wall<br />
Mark 04 (Clyde R, “Israeli-United States Relations” CRS ISSUE Brief for Congress, pg. 11 July 9 <br />
The security wall-endrsed the wall)<br />
<br />
The construction of the wall builds a state paramount to that of apartheid <br />
Yiftachel 5 (Oren, “Neither Two States Nor One :the Disangagment and “creeping Aparthied” in Israel/Palistiine” The Arab World Geographer/Le Geographe du monde arabe Vol 8 No 3 125-129<br />
The disengagement was –method of operation <br />
<br />
The state is ethnocratic, oppressing any minorities <br />
Yiftachel 5 (Oren, “Neither Two States Nor One :the Disangagment and “creeping Aparthied” in Israel/Palistiine” The Arab World Geographer/Le Geographe du monde arabe Vol 8 No 3 <br />
I have developed-major reasons <br />
<br />
In addition the wall is used to further Israeli power over Palistine, allowing more oppressive measures<br />

The disengagement-managing Palestinian populations<br />
<br />
US support of this state through Israel denies hope for human rights in both Israel/Palistine and the US, Acting ethically can bring the US out of this moral deficit <br />
Van ness 99(Peter, “debating Human Rights:Critical Esays from the United States and Asia” Routledge 99)<br />
Even today, after-psychological morass <br />
<br />
This guarentess violence <br />
Yiftachel 5 (Oren, “Neither Two States Nor One :the Disangagment and “creeping Aparthied” in Israel/Palistiine” The Arab World Geographer/Le Geographe du monde arabe Vol 8 No 3 <br />
Israel’s ethnocratic-two-state solution <br />
<br />
The United States Federal Government should constructively engage the government of the Palestinian Authority by offering to supply materials and funding to break down the Wall <br />
<br />
Initiative should be taken as an ethical sance against “values” such as apartheid <br />
Jenson 97 (J Vernon, Ethical Issues in the Communication Process pg 33-34<br />
This golden rule-ethivcal decision making <br />
<br />
A moral stance is necessary to overcome apartheid South Africa proves<br />
