<strong>George Mason CH Casey</strong><br />
<br />
Observation 1 -- The Culture of Death<br />
<br />
In Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court advanecd the quasi-religious doctrine of the self-constituted self. Positive rights are only found after identifying a social body of enemies. The inevitable result of the religion of liberalism is the atomization of individuals and eventual totalitarianism.<br />
Neuhaus, 1996<br />
www. heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL572.cfm<br />
<br />
&quot;This is most explicitly spelled out in the 1992&quot;<br />
<br />
State sanctioned abortion--on-demand is the culmination and lynchpin of the on going war of the powerful against the weak. Abortion has distorted the way in which we view the world and the relationship between citizen and law. This culture has eclipsed our sense of morality such that all atrocities are justifiable.<br />
Pope John Paul II, 1995<br />
Karol Wojtyla, leader of Christianity on Earth, <em>Evangelium Vitae</em>, #11-12<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not only that in generalized&quot;<br />
<br />
The culture of death dooms efforts to spread human rights, and establishes a notion of freedom that denies true freedom, making all citizens slaves. Whever a state chooses to kill one part for the convenience of another, it has denegedrated into an absollute tyranny.<br />
Pope John Paul II, 1995<br />
Karol Wojtyla, leader of Christianity on Earth, <em>Evangelium Vitae</em>, #18-20<br />
<br />
&quot;The process which once led to discovering&quot;<br />
<br />
Ensuring a right to life for all humans is the most pressing moral imperative of our time - we're all slaves devoid of value in a world that permits the murder of the defenseless.<br />
Reagan 1984<br />
Ronald, <em>Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation</em>, p. 38<br />
<br />
&quot;We will never recognize the true value of&quot;<br />
<br />
The impact to the culture of death is unending war - every act of state sponsored violence has its roots in the government's failure to unconditionally respect the right to life.<br />
Pope John Paul II, 1995<br />
Karol Wojtyla, leader of Christianity on Earth, <em>Evangelium Vitae,</em> #101<br />
<br />
&quot;The value at stake is one in which every&quot;<br />
<br />
Plan: The United State Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 US 833 (1992) on the grounds that the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal rights should apply to the unborn.<br />
<br />
While previous abortion decisions grounded abortion rights in privacy, Casey ruled on the fourteenth amendment. By ruling that the unborn are persons protected by the Equal Protection Clause, Casey will be completfely overruled and abortion jurisprudence will finally become coherent.<br />
Sekulow and Tuskey, 1996<br />
Counsel for American Center for Law and Justice. Jay and John, 40 NYL Sch. L. Rev. 945, 960-961<br />
<br />
&quot;Casey upheld the proposition that the Constitution&quot;<br />
<br />
The function of the law is primarily pedagogical. The Supreme Court did not make abortions &quot;legal,&quot; it made them socially acceptable without regret for the unborn. The plan is key - we must unteach the culture of death.<br />
Goldstein, 1996<br />
Robert D., Wm. &amp; Mary Bill of Rts. J. 787, 794-796<br />
<br />
&quot;The expressive function of law is as important&quot;<br />

Plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should grant writ of certiorari to a relevant test case and rule on said test case that the Federal District Courts do have broad remedial power to desegregate, including desegregation across district lines. We’ll clarify.<br />

Outline:<br />
Adv. 1:<br />
- US model for desegregation is worldwide. Ginsburg 2005<br />
- Europe is facing their own desegregation fight. Goldhaber 2005<br />
- The Roma have suffered a grand defeat in the European Court. Ivanov 2006<br />
- Now is the key time – appeals are in progress. BBC August 1, 2006<br />
- The desegregation battle continues as mass genocide occurs Romany are Beins victimized on a daily basis, survival is at stake. Kawczynski 2000<br />
- Ethnic cleansing continues in the aftermath of Kosovo. The Roma are ignored. Bloom 2004<br />
- History has a way of repeating itself, millions of Roma were exterminated in the Holocaust. Millions more at risk today. Voolasranta 2006<br />
- Here’s the internal link and solvency, as racism and violence increase against the Romani, desegregation is the only strategy for success. Thomas 2006<br />
- Genocide must be prevented at all costs. It’s corporate nature makes it morally worse than extinction. Lang 1985.<br />

2. case o/w’s: who cares about drugs when you have gypsies<br />
3. Impact turns on Russian fism mean Aff solves terrorism faster<br />
a. Turns mean worldwide terror, Neg doesn’t (crap)<br />
4. 1AC doesn’t take a stance on the US, only gypsies, thus no link?<br />
T OVERRULE=HOLDING<br />
1. WM—overrule decision, opposite direction of case<br />
2. counter-interp: change reason for decision (I honestly can’t read my flow, this could be wrong)<br />
a. better for predictable ground<br />
b. better ground b/c Aff overrules whole case<br />
3. specific test case (solvency cards prove): no abuse<br />
4. C-X checks abuse<br />
5. Reasonability<br />
6. Neg must name at least 5 topical cases<br />
7. Err on side of Aff =&gt; win-win situation<br />
8. infinitely regressive<br />
9. normal means checks<br />
10. no voter<br />

<strong>Aff Strategy Notes:</strong><br />
<em>If the affirmative straight turned a DA, read a kritik against a DA, or did anything else unusual, make a note of it here.</em><br />
<br />
**The trickiest thing they have is the first part of the plan text. They avoid test case fiat by waiting for the next available test case, which, according to the politics flow, is sometime in December.<br />
<br />
I also don’t think they understand the effects of the plan in the US, even for US gypsies.<br />
In our round at least, the 2AC went fairly top-heavy.<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe they tried to straight turn Fism good with Russia (our 1NC scenario), but they may have made defensive args too. The 1AR definitely went for the turns only.<br />

Quirin -- Overrule decision. Quirin destroys support for war on terror, alienates allies, destroys US Hegemony. Khalizhad<br />

CH<br />
Milliken -- Overrule decision. Milliken overrule decision will be modeled by the Roma (ethnic group in SE Europe). Key to prevent genocide of the Roma.
