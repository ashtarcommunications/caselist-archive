Texas CM v Vanderbilt Round 4<br />

Intro from Nietzsche- <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/6903256/" rel="nofollow">www.scribd.com/doc/6903256/</a> Friedrich-W-Nietzsche-On- truth-and-lie</u><br />
Thus wrote Nietzsche…<br />
And yet Nietzsche’s brief description does not capture the complexly catastrophic dance that defines life on this globe. At least five times in the past half billion years, the Earth cleared away most of its existing life. And after fifty thousand years of human ascendancy, we are mid-way through the sixth mass extinction event- Dave Foreman, 2004, Co-founder of Earth First!, “6th great extinction coming’ <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rewilding.org/" rel="nofollow">www.rewilding.org/</a> thesixthgreatextinction.htm</u><br />
Soon a…….suffering</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the face of this dire event, we do not dispair. Life survives even the largest catastrophes to evolve anew- Christopher Wills, Professor Biological Sciences at the UC-SD, 2008 Global Catastrophic Risks ed. Bostrom pg. 51-52<br />
Life is common in a multitude of forms- Martin Rees 2003, New Scientist, Vol. 179 Issue 2403 “Is there life beyond Earth?’ Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics and Master of Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, EBSCO<br />
Throughout the history………..1999).<br />
Given that death is inevitable, you shouldn’t care how soon it happens- James Lenman, Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Sheffield, 2007, New Essays in Applied Ethics ed. Hon-Lam Li pg 229-232<br />
It is not only…………sixteenth century<br />
We must use this moment to initiate a counciousness shift towards a community that recognizes the interconnectedness of existence- Richard Epstein, Laboratory of Computational Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong 2009, w/ Y. Zhao Perspectives in Biology and Medicine 52:1 Winter<br />
The end of……..ehrlich’s (1968).<br />
The message of the earth is to evolve or die. We must develop an ethic that transcends pity by recognizing our connection to all existence- Werner Krieglstein- no date given, Ph.D, a Fulbright Scholar etc. <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://papers.isud.org/files/" rel="nofollow">http://papers.isud.org/ files/</a> Kreiglstein_Werner.doc</u><br />
In my paper………become reality</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Human life is too short to be a speciest. You must take the next step in moral evolution and embrace your part in a cosmic dance going back billions of years- John Sneed, 1995 “Beyond Anthropocentrism”, online<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">PLAN: The United States federal government should eliminate domestic subsidies for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations and wheat, soybean, and corn grain feed<br />
Observation II. The Moral Imperative</span><br />
<br />

While a welcome…it is right</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You have a moral imperative to fight for animal liberation- Steven Best, Chair Philosophy at UTEP, no date given, <u><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.animalliberationfront.com/" rel="nofollow">www.animalliberationfront. com/</a> Philosophy/ARNewEnlightenment. htm</u><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Subsidies are tax dollars transferred from our bank accounts to industrial agriculture.

We must tackle specieism head-on- Katherine Perdlo, PhD, 2007 Journal of Critical Animal Studies 5.1<br />
Animal rights…….industries<br />
Don’t evaluate theoretical scenarios of future disasters that could result from the plan. Tests involving thousands of forecasters prove how even professionals routinely ignore realistic probabilities when told a good story- Philip Tetlock 2005 Ph.D Yale, Professor of Leadership at Berkeley Haas School of Business, Expert Political Judgement: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? Pg. 190-194<br />
