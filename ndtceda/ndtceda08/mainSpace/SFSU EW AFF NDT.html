 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Answer to fw:</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We are the political that the neg calls for.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They fascination with policy that gives out agency to USFG reduce us to bear life (refer to Agamben). This reduction of life becomes the impact in the round.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Top is the fantasy we are the real world</span></li></ol><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">There should be five standards to evaluate debate.</span><ul><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Fairness- challenges the notion of fairness. It only applies to the white, hetero, dominant male. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Aff choice</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Limit- explodes the restriction.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Pred- denies Venerability</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Fun!</span></li></ul></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Voter is a internal link to assimilation</span></li></ol><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">FW Perm- we should look at them as re-enforcining one another.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1. perm text: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2. We don’t cause excluding but create more inclusion</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">K:</span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We are the K.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our methodology solves, the neg create status quo.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">We highlight the dominant practice in order to expose them</span></li></ol><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The lens of the aff, by removing the myths that subsidize dairy, creates political spaces for contesting heteropatriarchy and other systems of power. Since messages and imagery are at the root cause of impacts, our discourse can redefine the violent associations. The aff is a perquisite to any effective govt action. </span><br />

Our f/w of performative transgression and situated knowledge is a pre req to their interpretation of political change<br />
Armstrong 2000 (Paul, Dean and Prof of Lit at Brown U, New Litaary History, 31: 211-233 “The Politics of play: The Social implications of Iser’s Aesthetic Theory”<br />
“transgression for iser….copy the given.”<br />
<br />
Critical education is the most important value in this debate – without it democracy fails<br />

Laugher shifts political rhetoric from a demand to an offer to understand, making public debate discourse more accessible and flexible<br />
Hairman 2008 “Political parody and public culture” Quarterly journal of Speech 247-272<br />
“The core operation in this……rather than for peer review, formal deliberation, or informed consent.”<br />

Turn – the problem doesn’t lie with suffering but with killing – we don’t attempt to stop death or suffering but we must learn to kill and die responsibly<br />
Haraway 2008 (Donna, When Species Meet, U of Minnesota Press, p 81-82 Prof at UCSC)<br />
“I suggest that…have become accustomed.”<br />
<br />
Ethical obligations don’t solve for violence – we must first understand the logic of the sacrifice<br />

“Jacques Derrida ahs een……in US Prisons.”<br />
<br />

Unique doubling effect of parody is a linguistic strat that prompts reflection<br />
Hair 2008<br />
“The earliest use…..where discourse ends.”<br />
<br />
Perm card: Instead of looking at these FWs as mutually exclusive we should look at them as re-enforcing to disrupt normative views of debate.<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our 1AC is a performance of the &quot;Happy Cow commercials&quot;. We read a plan text and we will defend that subsidies are bad and should be removed but we do not defend FIAT implications. We will defend that there are not only economic subsidies but also ideological and cultural myths that subsidize dairy. Our framework for the debate is who has the best methodology for the removal and knowledge surrounding these myths. We read one piece of evidence in the 1AC and it is a card by Wendy Brown in 1995 from her book States of Injury pg. 49-51.<br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br />
Framework permutation – Instead of looking at both of these frameworks as mutually exclusive of one another we should look at them as reinforcing each other to disrupt the normative view of debate. We should combine both the policy fw of the neg and the situated knowledge fw of the aff in order to have a unique vantage point to view what debate is and what it can become<br />

<br />
The problem doesn’t’ lie with suffering but with killing. We don’t attempt to stop death or suffering but we must learn to kill and die responsibly so that we can nurture living. We must understand how our orientations with others are connected to ourselves and the world<br />
Donna Haraway, 2008, <em>When Species Meet</em>, Pgs. 81-82<br />
<br />
Parody is better than formal debate and direct discourse at uncovering th partiality and limits of language<br />
Hariman 2008 “Political parody and public culture” Quarterly journal of speech 94(3)<br />
“so it is that…because inherently fallible<br />
