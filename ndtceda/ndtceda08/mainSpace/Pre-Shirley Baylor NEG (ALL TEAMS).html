 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the affirmative posits THEMSELVES as able to create a new reality which more closely resembles the ideal form which makes their plan defensible. this drive towards purification and explanation, this will to truth, is an attempt to escape suffering and creative potential which negates life.</span><br />

<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">the ethic of the affirmative gives existence a trancendent justification or reason. this lends itself to a metaphysical supplement to life, as if it were lacking something to make it good. such an eye towards the world negates what already is, including life and its preciousness.</span><br />

THE DESIRE TO CREATE A NEW WORLD, TO SUBJECT THE WILL OF SELF-AFFIRMATION TO A PERSISTENT SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY IS AN ETHIC OF TRANSCENDENCE WHICH IS NIHILISTIC, FORCING US TO DESIRE OUR OWN REPRESSION BECAUSE IT RENDERS LIFE BLAMEWORTHY.<br />

their rhetoric of preservation of the community and community building in west africa through standards and exclusion necessitates the suicide of the community. community is not a producable object (by the ballot or plan) but is impossible, allowing us to share this experience of impossibility. their unwillingness to engage this perspective proves the pertinence of our argument.<br />

for their communities, DEATH becomes an OBJECT. THE LOGIC OF THIS COMMUNITY IS ONE MAKES OR DOES WORK. THE AFFIRMATIVE’S UNDERSTANDING OF COMMUNITY PUTS DEATH TO WORK, in the name of an immanent, or self-evident community. this putting death to task forecloses any space for ethics and puts the community to suicide.<br />

INTERPRETATION – The Affirmative must read a plan that advocates USFG action and defend the outcome of that plan action for those that do the plan and/or those that are affected. We have resolutional basis for this:<br />
1. Resolved means “to make a firm decision about.”<br />
