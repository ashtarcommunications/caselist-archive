overrule<br />
<br />
violation the plan text establishes a new precedent instead of just overruling<br />
<br />
the neg interpretation is superior<br />
1. the issue of what occurs in the law after a case is oveeruled is core negative ground by identifying the new precedent the affirmative forecloses this area of debate which destroys key solvency args allows the aff to spike out of das and crushes negative predictability<br />
2. limits – allowing the aff to do more than oveerule justifies an infinite combination of alternative precedenta a fair limit on the topic is keyt o debatibility and equitable research burdens<br />

ZIZEK<br />
<br />
The concept of fluid identity is only conceivable against the backdrop of capitalist globalization this system appeases subgroups in order to calculate and control their existence this cycle ofdeterritorializationa nd reterritorialization creates the preconditions that made Nazism possible we must reassert the dimension of the Universal against capitalist globalization<br />
Zizek 99 The Ticklish Subject 209-11<br />
Here however one must fully…roman global empire”<br />
<br />
The incomplete nature of the legal system creates a splitting of the law which perpetuates an obscene secret code of the law<br />
Zizek 95<br />
“Law and the Postmodern Mind: Supreego by Default Cardozo Law Review<br />
“from whence does this splitting of the law…form of enjoyment”<br />
<br />
the era of post politics radically depoliticizes the economy – this can never obtain the dimensions of universality because it precludes acts of authentic politics we must establish a radical strategy that repoliticizes the economy in order to break free from the chains of global capitalism – vote negative to disturb the fantasy of the depoliticized economy and engage in an authentic act of politics<br />

Wayne State NP – Due Process Clause CP vs. Morrison<br />
In the next available test case, the USSC should overrule its decision in U.S. vs. Morrison by ruling that section 13981 of the Violence Against Women Act does not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution and that inaction by the USFG in the realm of gendered violence violates the right to the pursuit of life, liberty, and happiness (*not pursuit of?) guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. We can clarify.<br />
<br />
The Net Benefits<br />
<br />
A. Due Process is Good<br />
<br />
In the Lawrence decision Justice Kennedy established the groundwork of a new form of Due Process – granting new fundamental rights represents a turn away from the historical baggage of previous Due Process Claims<br />
Parshall 05 Albany LR<br />
Justice kennedy consistently reflected AND protected liberty interests<br />
<br />
B. Expanding due process to include a fundamental right to be free from gendered violence established a precedent for future cases. The CP proved the necessary groundwork for larger Due Process struggles.<br />
Hard 2k4 (Assistant Executive Editor of the Buffalo Law Review) (Nicole, Buffalo Law Review, fall page lexis)<br />
Yet by characterizing the petitioners’ claim as one of due process….the result is a narrow win that could eventually work against the gay comunity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Imapcts<br />
<br />
Due Process is key to international law<br />
Parshall, Assistant Professor, Department of History &amp; Govt at Daemen College, 2k5 (Lisa, Albany Law Review page lexis)<br />
The Various interpretation given Lawrence….Lawrence has also served as affirmation that history alone is not solely determinative.<br />

<br />
IR Law is key to solve extinction<br />
Boyle, University of Illinois College Law, 1985<br />
(Francis, American Journal of International Law, October, page lexis)<br />
Miles Kahler has astutely oberseved in his now classic Foreign Affairs article……he will have to produce a book-length exposition.<br />
<br />
Due Process is Key to Gay Marriage<br />
Parshall, 2k5 cites above page lexis<br />
On the other hand, Justice Kennedy’s rhetoric on the nature….have nothing to do with the decision of this Court.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Acceptance of gay marriage is key to solve hetero-sexism and gender dichotomies<br />
Law, Professor of Law, New York University Law School, 1988<br />
(Sylvia, Wisconsin Law Review, March page lexis gjm)<br />
Litigants in the gay marriage cases have not attempted to demonstrate the complex….without gender-defined constraints.<br />
<br />
<br />
Our Interpretation of due process access all of their reasons why equal protection is good.<br />
Parshall 2k5 cites above page lexis<br />
Lawrence, moe than any other decision in the Supreme Court’s history, both presupposed and advanced and explicitly….historical trajectory of substantive due process and thus of liberty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heterosexism<br />
<br />
The Links:<br />
First Equal protection is a dangerous precedent for progressive struggles because it relies on hetero-normative standards which force assimilation as a compromise for legal protection.<br />
Hart Cites above 2k4 fall page lexis Hard 2k4 (Assistant Executive Editor of the Buffalo Law Review) (Nicole, Buffalo Law Review, fall page lexis)<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the forgoing philosophical concerns, utilizing an equal protection analysis…..to be compared to the benchmark of heterosexual conduct.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, Equal protection relies on a male-female paradigm that erases interseuxals<br />
Hart Cites above 2k4<br />
However, sex-based equal protection arguments rely on the assumption that gender is a rigid characteristic….Biological circumstances at birth can lead to a range of intersex conditions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Impacts:<br />
<br />
First, heterosexism in the law erases and exterminates sexual minorities<br />
Eskridge, Jr., John A. Garver, Prof. of Jurisprudence, Yale Law School, 1997<br />
(William, Yale Law Review, page lexis)<br />
Once mobilized at the state level….their identity secret in exchange for survival, is now known as the “closet”.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second, Your should reject equal protections essentialist notion of intimacy and sexual identity-only the CP can allow for a discursive space for marginalized person to come to the forefront of criticism.<br />
Iglesias and Valdes, Prof. of Law at the University of Miami Law , 1998<br />
(Elizabeth and Francisco, Chicano-Latino Law Review, Spring page lexis)<br />
The observation about the anti-essentialist….as with all hierarchies of social power, be consciously critical and self-critical.<br />
<br />
<br />
Third, Hetero-normativity replicates discrimination and assures the failure of progressive movement-it should be rejected.<br />
Hutchinsion, Assistant Professor, Southern Methodist University School of Law, 1999<br />
(Darrent Lenard, Buffalo Law Review, winterpage lexis)<br />
Furthermoe, a heteronormative response to white supremacy….anti-racist legal theory and civil rights regime.<br />
<br />
Fourth, Equal protections reliance on heterosexual identity actegories is a form of supremacist identity politics which sanitizes violence again those written out of legal standards like equal protection.<br />
Valdes cites above<br />
The hate crimes, microaggressions and other acts of violation….are multiply diverse across multiples axes of identity and interest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fifth, the hetero-normative standards of the 1ac are a strategy of erasure which must be rejected<br />
Valdes, 1997 cites above<br />
Moreover, the practice of erasure inevitably….similar patterns of social or legal injustice<br />
<br />
<br />
The CP solves theses arguments:<br />
<br />
Due Process is key to struggle against heterosexism<br />
Hart cite above<br />
A substantive due process argument….ways in which gays are similar to heterosexuals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Narrow interpretations make equal protection unachievable for many oppressedgroups- their precedent precludes a multi dimeninsional prtocetions from the law,<br />

Their theory relies on a conflation of the political and the contingent nature of politics- lacan’s focus on tonology does not preclude the use of lack in an analysis of politics<br />
Thomassen, 2004, the british journal of politics and international relations volume 6 issue 4 pae 558<br />
Robinson believes that, since lacan did not- including lacanian) political theory<br />

Robinson misreads the role of violence in Zizeks theory- even if its part of the revolution it is not a defining feature of a transcendent society<br />

Observation One: Visible Boundaries, Invisible populations<br />
The US Supreme Court Milliken v. Bradley decision established the immutability of local sovereignty by ignoring the responsibility of suburban populations for racial segregation<br />
<br />
Richard Thompson Ford Assistant Professor of Law, Stanford Law School 107 Harv. L. Rev. 1843 1994<br />
<br />
This reliance on local sovereignty has allowed suburban populations to segregate themselves from the urban center contributing to the continuing economic subjugation of minority populations<br />
Jerry Frug Professor of Law, Harvard University 1993 60 U. Chi. L. Rev. 253<br />
<br />
This continuing resegregation and economic exclusion is a part of a logic that renders urban populations invisible and unthinkable in American society- this forecloses active participation in democratic politics and exposes whole populations to militaristic values and violence,<br />
Henry A. Giroux currently holds the Global TV Network Chair Professorship at McMaster University in the English and Cultural Studies Department College Literature 33.3 (2006)<br />
This logic of disposable populations necessitates exposing outgroups to ongoing violence and genocide in order to preserve the hierarchies of race and class that constitute the sovereign.<br />

1 .They get our 1AC wrong;; it is not an eroticization of structures, but a dialogue in which we can have discussions about the body<br />
2. not a starting point; it is responsibility; it is not that everybody should stand in solidarity with the oppressed, but rather we should engage; until people are in a space where they feel comfortable, they will not engage<br />
3. we are a starting point to rethink our thought of the body; the way that we think about the body in the way in the status quo is because of economics; the public/private dichotomy is responsible; economic elites tell us what we can and cannot talk about<br />
4. only by imagining a new space and a new way where we can discuss these various structures of oppression allows us to rethink sexuality<br />
5. no reason why you can’t vote aff and do theirs at the same point; if we can have multiple starting points, they’re not exclusive; don’t vote neg<br />
6. they engage in the eroticization of structures themselves—their only serious question in the 1ac was about sexuality<br />
7. academic debate is a key place to resist racist socio-economics; Giroux 2000<br />
8. their attempt to divide pedagogy between sexual and non-sexual ignores ours—keep the pedagogical orders open; essential to open up new spaces of education—Giroux 2000<br />
9. our 1ac is critical to their alternative; until we engage in the public sphere, in new kinds of public spheres, else we’ll always be stuck in the private sphere; we won’t be able to change the public sphere, and the force of oppression of sexuality<br />
10. looking at the law is not the problem; questions of sexuality exist at the level of discourse; we need to use the law as a form of political rights; butler<br />
11. no utopian vision of the 1ac that is incompatible with their alternative<br />
12. using democratic institutions is critical to the formation of liberation movements; smith 1998<br />
13. don’t allow them to coopt our 1ac; if they’re able to engage in our ethical acts, there’s no reason we can’t participate in their call for action; their Ellison evidence would not “reach the public” unless we engage in hope for new forms of agency<br />
14. voting aff is a radical utopian project; closure of imagination precludes new forms of agency—roe 2000<br />
15. our vision for education is critical in order to reach new forms of body work—precondition to think about how outside structures influence our education; Ellison was engaged in our vision for new forms of education; allows people to think about our education<br />

The game of fort-da exemplifies how we attempt to master rather then mourn the loss of the feminine. In this game a child throws a wooden spool with thread attached into the veiled bed. After the fort, which means gone or far-away, the thread is pulled and the spool re-appears – this is the da, translated loosely as there. This game of revealing and concealing is predicated on a desire to master the disappearance or sacrifice of the mother – this attempt to master the other makes us slaves to the concept of power and displaces the power of mourning – the manipulation of the veiled bed is indicative of our ability to conceal the underbelly of the symbolic order by adhering to a cause that is greater then ourselves<br />
Keenan, Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, 04<br />
Dennis King, Hypatia, fall, p. proquest<br />
Irigaray relates that she associated or joined…substantial alien Entity excluded from knowledge. All the mother(’s body) “is” is loss.<br />
<br />
Mastering this economy of revealing creates a system of safe belief that is predicated on a sacrifice of the Other’s body. The aff attempts to repress this sacrifice by striving for a cause that gives meaning to our relations with the Law. This unconscious acceptance of a function of Law makes us mechanical participates in its symbolic order. The aff call for action within this system attempts to master the sacrifice that law asks fo the feminine. Exposing the underbelly of the Law makes the ideology of safe belief a non-option.<br />
Keenan 04<br />
Belief is safe, Irigary argues, when…other by making the other the other of the same<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the aff deployment of the Law to master rather then mourn the loss of the feminine appropriates its existence into the violent language of masculinity. Only sacrificing this urge to master can recognize the radical otherness of the other.<br />
Keenan 04<br />
The fort-da game seeks to master rather than mourn…that can be presented in language.<br />
<br />
This linguistic ploy matters because the system of language is the ultimate resort of all human violence<br />
Zizec 06<br />
Slavoy, Dimmed Tide is Loosed, The Symptom Volume 7, spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizantinomies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizantinomies.htm</a><br />
This simple and all too obvious fact should compel us to render…sustaining and justifying their acts.<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to sacrifice the affirmative. This sacrifice of sacrifice rejects the patriarchal fantasy that presupposes that women exist waiting to be revealed by suspending our relationship to meaning. This act separates us from the symbolic order and allows the subject to access reality by suspending the Big Other<br />
Keenan 04<br />
Revelation traditionally has been interpreted in visual or epistemological…revelation of truth is nothing but “still to come.”<br />
<br />
Finally this suspension of the Big Other is the ultimate ethical act because it acts without guarantees and counters the aff depoliticized notion of ethics.<br />
Zizec and Daly 04 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizec, p. 163-4)<br />
I think that Lacanian ethics breaks out of this…point you have to assume responsibility for the act.<br />

Their method pf politics only reinforces the ideology of Capital – attempts towards inclusive democratic practices cannot overcome the inherent ignorance of the economy within these politics<br />
Dean, 2k5, “Zizek against democracy” online<br />
“in this article I take up…. Envisioning a different political order”<br />
<br />
The ideology of democracy precludes politics proper – it creates a stop-gap in thought which assures super structures remain the same – the presence of capital dooms the affirmative project to radical failure<br />
Dean, 2k5, “Zizek against democracy” online<br />
“the second way to read…. Critical cultural and political theory”<br />
<br />
Their run to the Holocaust is a stop-gap in thinking which falsely calls to ethics in order to prevent radical actions – their argument is just another tool of maintaining the current social order<br />
Zizek 2k Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pg 127<br />
“the problem with today’s… with this terrain of shared premises”<br />
<br />
Their project of radical democracy accepts the domination of capital as inevitable – the 1ac is at best a form of damage control, but more likely means absolutely nothing<br />
Zizek 2k Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pg 321<br />
“this brings me finally to the big question… or it means absolutely nothing”<br />
<br />
The struggle for hegemony always returns to the domination of Capital – the 1ac radically fails to change the political imagination<br />
Zizek 2k Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, pg 223<br />
“and my point is that in so… this economico-politcal regime”<br />
<br />
Multiculturalism is global capitalism’s ideal ideology because it treats each local culture as a colonized people – this ideology is a form of paternal distanced racism which allows groups to assert their superiority to subcultures – global capitalism only incorporates this politicization until it becomes necessary to destroy it<br />
Zizek The Ticklish Subject pg. 216-7<br />
“And of course the ideal form… exclusionary measures quashes it”<br />
<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s attempt to provide guidelines for ethics within the existing political framework engages in a radically depoliticized notion of ethics – only our ethic which is willing to risk the impossible can establish the necessary condition for a politicized ethical stance<br />
Zizek and Daly, “Conversations with Zizek” p.18-9<br />
“for zizek a confrontation with… to risk the impossible”<br />
<br />
Capitalism’s naturalization of the process of subjugation creates social exclusion on a global scale – the ultimate ethico-political responsibility is to challenge the foundations of this system’s organization principles<br />
Zizek and Daly, “Conversations with Zizek” p.14-6<br />
“For zizek it is imperative that… otherwise sound matrix”<br />
<br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO COMPLETELY WITHDRAW FROM THE IDELOGY OF CAPITAL<br />
<br />
This act is essential to destroy the fetish that allows capital to exist – the alternative stops belief in this system which collapses its ability to steer our existence<br />
Johnston 2k4 “Psychoanalysis, culture &amp; society” v9 i3<br />
“Perhaps the absence of a detailed political roadmap…. Deceptively comforting fiction”<br />
<br />
Calls for direct action are a short-sighted stop-gap in thinking. The need to liberate thinking from the hegemony of capitalism makes our alternative a pre-condition for political change<br />
Johnston 2k4 “Psychoanalysis, culture &amp; society” v9 i3<br />
“the height of zizek’s … ideologically co-opted by it”<br />
<br />
The concept of fluid identity is only conceivable against the backdrop of capitalist globalization this system appeases sub groups in order to calculate and control their existence – this cycle of deterritorialization and reterritorilizaiton creates the preconditions that made Nazism possible – we must re-assert the dimension of the Universal against capitalist globalization<br />

The 1ac elevates law to the status of divinity-pieces of evidence are cobbled together to make a unified argument, parallel to scriptural interpretation.<br />
Steven D. Smith, Robert and Marion Short Professor, Notre Dame Law School. 1999 (September, 40 B.C. L. Rev 1041, lexis)<br />
The apparent commitment to faith in a....... ...runs through the heart of twentieth-century jurisprudence.<br />
<br />
This faith in law is an obsession that sanitizes history which prevents us from viewing other possibilities for understanding. This fixation functions as a pathological asymmetry in which the law is presumed to be governed by reason.<br />
Pierre Schlag, Nicholas Rosenbaum Professor, University of Colorado School of Law, 1998<br />
(The Enchantment of Reason, duke university press, page 117-9)<br />
Legal thinkers and actors strive to put ..... find here evidence of something altogether different.<br />
<br />
Dogmatic defenses of reason based on arbitray determinations collapse inward on themselves<br />
Schlag in 98<br />

The affirmative’s faith in the legal system is founded on authoritarian ideals of nihilism, submission and stagnation in which the individual is constrained and bound by the external authority of the law.<br />
Robin West, Professor of Law, University of Maryland, 1989 (Summer, 83 Nw. U.L. Rev. 977, lexis)<br />
<br />
The affirmatives desire to be bound by external authority in the form of law requires them to humanize law. This process of investing the ideal qualities of human existence destroys the value to life for the same reason as religion. Both require us to remove ourselves from positions of agency and depend upon authority to give our lives meaning.<br />
Pierre Schlag, Nicholas Rosenbaum Professor, University of Colorado School of Law, 1998<br />
(The Enchantment of Reason, duke university press, page 105-6)<br />
“Sometimes, the law is even invested with personality...a renunciation of life, a kind of self-loathing.”<br />
<br />
The 1ac's desire to be bound by law also leads to an uncritical acceptance of authoritarianism that justifies the worse abuses of authority because we seek to please authority by carrying out their commands.<br />
<br />
Henderson, Professor of Law at Indiana University School of Law, 1991<br />
(Lynne, Indiana Law Journal, Spring page lexis)<br />
“The argument for uncritical acceptance of authority ... dictatorships such as the Romanian regime of Ceausecu”<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to reject the affirmatives use of law. Suspending the obsessive desire to practice law creates space for an examination of the way in which the law operates. Only this examination can produce the conditions to solve the current arrested development in law.<br />
Steven D. Smith, Robert and Marion Short Professor, Notre Dame Law School. 1999 (september, 40 B.C. L. Rev 1041, lexis)<br />
A similar re-examination seems called for at the present time in law...And we need to consider how law, as it really operates, relates to what we really believe.<br />

The affs use of spatial metaphors which define war as an event which occurs between the poles of declarations is based on a crisis-driven ontology which is ignorant of the omni-presence of militarism which subjects the Earth, indigenous peoples and minorities to violence by the state.<br />

<br />
<br />
Page four: Come Together<br />
<br />
The alternative to this rhetorical domination is the rejection of the aff in favor of the rhetoric and the text of the 1nc—we believe that the presentation of hteis counter-knowledge is presentation of a discursive map of the nuclear militaristic landscape<br />
<br />
This project is essentially engaging in a localized text of militarism that denies our complacency with the systems of nuclear militarism—only our mapping can allow for real resistance to militarism.<br />
<br />
Cuomo Again<br />
“Emphasising the ways in which....even when peace seems present.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, mapping the militaristic transformation of the 4th world is crucial to expose mechanism of power exclusion. This is how our project achieves its goals. Vote negative to map the nuclear landscape and stand in solidarity with the struggles of the Western Shoshones, the Navaho, Australian Aborigines, and all victims of nuclear violence worldwide.<br />

SACRIFICE:<br />
<br />
The game of fort-da exemplifies how we attempt to master rather then mourn the loss of the feminine. In this game a child throws a wooden spool with thread attached into a veiled bed. After the fort, which means gone or far-away, the thread is pulled and the spool re-appears – this is the da, translated loosely as there. This game of revealing and concealing is predicated on a desire to master the disappearance or sacrifice of the mother – this attempt to master the other makes us slaves to the concept of power and displaces the power of mourning – the manipulation of the veiled bed is indicative of our ability to conceal the underbelly of the symbolic order by adhering to a cause that is greater then ourselves<br />
<br />
Keenan, Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, 2004<br />
(Dennis King, Hypatia, fall, page proquest gjm)<br />
<br />
Irigaray relates that she associated or joined ... All the mother('s body) &quot;is&quot; is loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastering this economy of revealing creates a system of safe belief that is predicated on a sacrifice of the Other’s body. The affirmative attempts to repress this sacrifice by striving for a cause that gives meaning to our relations with the Law. This unconscious acceptance of a function of Law makes us mechanical participants in its symbolic order. The affirmatives call for action within this system attempts to master the sacrifice that law asks of the feminine. Exposing this underbelly of the Law is key to eliminating safe belief.<br />
<br />
Keenan, Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, 2004<br />
(Dennis King, Hypatia, fall, page proquest gjm)<br />
<br />
Belief is safe ... and appropriating the other by making the other the other of the same (CM 38-39/BI<br />
26).<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore the affirmatives deployment of the Law to master rather then mourn the loss of the feminine appropriates its existence into the violent language of masculinity. Only sacrificing this urge to master by piercing the fantasy can recognize the radical otherness of the other.<br />
<br />
Keenan, Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, 2004<br />
(Dennis King, Hypatia, fall, page proquest gjm)<br />
<br />
The fort-da game seeks to master rather than mourn this primordial &quot;loss&quot; of the mother('s body). ... The mother('s body) is nothing that can be presented in language.<br />
<br />
This linguistic ploy matters because the system of language is the ultimate resort of all human violence<br />
<br />
Zizek in 2006<br />
(Slavoj, Dimmed Tide is Loosed, The Symptom Volume 7, spring, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizantinomies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizantinomies.htm</a> [gjm])<br />
<br />
This simple and all too obvious fact should compel us to render problematic the idea ... the words sustaining and justifying their acts. [8]<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to sacrifice the affirmative. This sacrifice of sacrifice rejects the patriarchal fantasy that presupposes that women exist waiting to be revealed by suspending our relationship to meaning. This act separates us from the symbolic order and allows the subject to access reality by suspending the Big Other<br />
<br />
Keenan, Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, 2004<br />
(Dennis King, Hypatia, fall, page proquest gjm)<br />
<br />
Revelation traditionally has been interpreted in visual or epistemological terms ... With this new sacrifice the revelation of truth is nothing but &quot;still to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
this suspension of the Big Other is the ultimate ethical act because it acts without guarantees and counters the affirmatives depoliticized notion of ethics<br />
<br />
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, page 163-164)<br />
<br />
I think that Lacanian ethics breaks out of this. ...at a certain point you have to assume responsibility for the act.<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s attempt to provide guidelines for ethics within the existing political framework engages in a radically depoliticized notion of ethics – only our ethic which is willing to risk the impossible can establish the necessary conditions for a politicized ethical stance<br />
<br />
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, page 18-19)<br />
<br />
For Zizek, a confrontation with the obscenities of abundance capitalism... exhorts us to risk the impossible.<br />

Empowerment:<br />
<br />
PAGE ONE: THE PROCESS OF IDENTITY   Access to the legal system is determined by a racialized notion of identity that  systemically excludes women of color. This exclusion prevents movement  forward on the empowerment continuum because whiteness defines women of  color out of the legal system   <br />
<br />
Morrison, Associate Professor of Law, Northern Illinois University College of Law,  2006  (Adele, Changing the Domestic Violence (Dis)Course: Moving from White Victim  to Multi-Cultural Survivor, University of California, Davis Law Review[Vol. 39:1061], page  1063-1069 [gjm])  <br />
<br />
A battered woman’s identity ... intervention to a multi-cultural one. 22    <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the VAWA relies on a construction of whiteness which portrays  white women as the only authentic victim of gendered violence – the exclusion  of women of color from victim status combined with cultural racial stereotypes  systemically deny these women access to civil legal protections – in the case of  the racialized law it is impossible to separate the foundational theories of their  engagement of domestic violence law from the practice of exclusionary racism  that they deploy   <br />
<br />
Morrison, Associate Professor of Law, Northern Illinois University College of Law,  2006  (Adele, Changing the Domestic Violence (Dis)Course: Moving from White Victim  to Multi-Cultural Survivor, University of California, Davis LR[Vol. 39:1061], page  1084-1087 [gjm])   <br />
<br />
In the construction of the perfect plaintiff ... grounded are white as well.    <br />
<br />
Finally, the discourse of the law is inherently stacked against women – every  part of the civil process is viewed through a lens which is controlled by  dominant discourses   <br />
<br />
Nan Sueffert 1999 (LLM – Master of Laws)  Melbourne University Law Review  <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://mirapointms6.wayne.edu/cgi-bin/fetch.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.austlii.edu.au%2Fau%2Fjournals%2FMULR%2F1999%2F8.html%23fn1" rel="nofollow">http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/1999/8.html#fn1</a>   Butler seems to be suggesting that ... men who abuse them.[213]    <br />
<br />
PAGE TWO: THE EMPOWERMENT CONTINUUM  <br />
<br />
Legal discourse is shaped by racialized notions of identity, the empowerment  continuum and legal practices – this renders women of color invisible and  subjects them to violence - legal remedies like the affirmatives force people into  roles which are highly racialized – women of color are constructed and  responded to as if only the dominant culture was involved – this mindset is then  projected onto society as a mechanism of domination and control   <br />
Morrison, Associate Professor of Law, Northern Illinois University College of Law,  2006  (Adele, Changing the Domestic Violence (Dis)Course: Moving from White Victim  to Multi-Cultural Survivor, University of California, Davis LR[Vol. 39:1061], page  1076-1078 [gjm])   <br />
<br />
The white battered woman identity ... but that could change.    <br />
<br />
And the civil rights remedy is nothing more then psychotherapy – it cleanses the  legal system of its guilt without addressing the needs of abused women   <br />
<br />
Regan 1999 (Christopher, JD Candidate, Notre Dame Law School, “A WHOLE LOT  OF NOTHING GOING ON: THE CIVIL RIGHTS &quot;REMEDY&quot; OF THE VIOLENCE  AGAINST WOMEN ACT,” Notre Dame LR, Dec, pp. LN, Kel)   <br />
<br />
The CRR is a kind of psychotherapeutic legislation... in an academic sense, very  comforting.    <br />
<br />
And the inadequacy of their remedy will disempower survivors of domestic  violence   Kramer 2005 (PhD, Professor @ Virginia Commonwealth U and has worked in  domestic violence field for over 20 years)  Elizabeth, Women’s Studies Quarterly, v. 33  <br />
<br />
on the contrary ... in the hands of others.    <br />
<br />
And abusers will increase violence in an attempt to force survivors to drop their  case – the legal system does nothing to protect against this escalation of  violence  <br />
Hart in 2005  Barbara, (legal director of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence  and an associate director of the Battered Women's Justice Project)  <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://mirapointms6.wayne.edu/cgi-bin/fetch.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mincava.umn.edu%2Fdocuments%2Fhart%2Fhart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/hart/hart.html</a>   <br />
<br />
Criminal justice system personnel ... for the crimes previously committed.    <br />
<br />
PAGE THREE: STARTING POINTS:  <br />
<br />
The legal system is a dangerous starting point for the struggle against domestic  violence – OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO REJECT THE AFFIRMATIVES USE OF THE LAW  BECAUSE IT CENTERED ON WHITENESS.  The alternative is a radical act of recentering which resists the violence of the  legal system and acknowledges communities of color’s construction of the  struggle against domestic violence   Morrison, Associate Professor of Law, Northern Illinois University College of Law,  2006  (Adele, Changing the Domestic Violence (Dis)Course: Moving from White Victim  to Multi-Cultural Survivor, University of California, Davis LR [Vol. 39:1061], page  1103-1105 [gjm])   <br />
<br />
The white “battered woman” identity, ... multi-cultural survivor.    <br />
<br />
The legal system does not provide adequate grounds for address violence  against women – we must create strategies that work outside of that system   <br />
Goodmark in 2004  Leigh, (Assistant Professor, University of Baltimore School of Law. J.D., Stanford  Law School; B.A. Yale University.) Saint Louis University Public Law Review (23 St.  Louis U. Pub. L. Rev. 7)   <br />
<br />
On the systemic level, ... deadly for our clients.    <br />
<br />
We must start with challenging the epistemology of social structures rather than  the legal system to stop the oppression of women   <br />
Grabe 2006  Shelly (recent recipient of the Ruth L. Kirschstein National  Research Service Award)\  Psychology of Women Quarterly, V. 30   <br />
<br />
Johnson pointedly states that ... guilt or defensiveness.   <br />
<br />
Legal focus prevents communities of color from continuing their local actions by  forcing them to divorce their efforts from their community   <br />
<br />

QUIRIN<br />
<br />
We’ve only debated critical / left leaning versions of this affirmative this is the 1NC we read against Georgia, so there are a couple Laclau answers that we would take out against teams that don’t claim radical democracy stuff:<br />
A) THE CONCEALMENT OF THE ILLEGAL<br />
The 1AC’s belief in the law conceals its nonsensical and obscene nature. Their erasure of the legal / illegal distinction within the public law will not remedy the treatment of those who our government currently deems illegal – the dehumanization and oppression the 1AC outlines will simply be repressed and moved to the underbelly of the law<br />
<br />
Keenan, Professor of Philosophy at Fairfield University, 2004<br />
(Dennis King, Hypatia, fall page proquest gjm)<br />
<br />
The Real, for Lacan, is the maternal … for forgetting the real, and appropriating the other by making the other the other of the same (CM 38-39/BI 26).<br />
<br />
Concealing this split in the law only perpetuates the 1AC harms in the unwritten obscene structure of the law – in the same way that vigilantly lynchings were clearly not supported by the public law but continued with full support of the community via the secret code of the law the 1AC simply masks the violence done by the government by deeming it illegal<br />
<br />
Zizek in 1995<br />
(Slavoj, Law and the Postmodern Mind: Superego by Default, Cardozo Law Review, page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
From whence does this splitting of the law …with a specific form of enjoyment).<br />
Furthermore, the ethnic violence that motivates the 1AC harms is not due to a simple flaw in the system, it is instead due to this systems inherent foreclosure of the realm of the political – working within the limits of the system will never be political – only changing the very framework by which we determine how a system works can we engage in a political act that does not return to the symbolic order as racism<br />
<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1999<br />
(Slavoj, The Ticklish Subject, page 198-201, gjm)<br />
<br />
Today however, we are dealing with another form of the denegation of the political, … on the other, the­ immigrant, ever more prevented from politicizing his predicament of exclusion.3O<br />
<br />
Their project of radical democracy accepts the domination of capital as inevitable – the 1AC is at best a form of damage control but is more likely to mean absolutely nothing<br />
<br />
Zizek in 2000<br />
(Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, page 321 gjm)<br />
<br />
This brings me, finally, … or it means absolutely nothing.<br />
Finally, Suspension of political and social freedoms is inevitable without a strategy that confronts the universal ideology of Capital – only our criticism can access the mechanisms necessary to address the root cause of their impact claims<br />
<br />
Zizek, Senior Researcher at the Institute for Social Studies, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 1989<br />
(Slavoj, The Sublime Object of Ideology, page 3-4 gjm)<br />
<br />
It is upon the unity of these two features that the Marxist notion of the revolution, …a transparent, rationally governed society.<br />
B) ETHICS<br />
Capitalism’s naturalization of the process of subjugation creates social exclusion on a global scale – the ultimate ethico-political responsibility is to challenge the foundations of this system’s organization principles<br />
<br />
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, page 14-16)<br />
<br />
For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol and recognize that …what is novel about Zizek’s universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.<br />
<br />
The affirmative’s attempt to provide guidelines for ethics within the existing political framework engages in a radically depoliticized notion of ethics – only our ethic which is willing to risk the impossible can establish the necessary conditions for a politicized ethical stance<br />
<br />
Zizek and Daly 2k4 (Slavoj and Glyn, Conversations with Zizek, page 18-19)<br />
<br />
For Zizek, a confrontation with the obscenities of abundance capitalism also requires … like Zizek’s own thought, exhorts us to risk the impossible.<br />
<br />
C) THE FETISH<br />
OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO COMPLETELY WITHDRAW FROM THE IDEOLOGY OF CAPITAL<br />
This act is essential to destroy the fetish that allows capital to exist – the alternative stops belief in this system which collapses its ability to steer our existence<br />
<br />
Johnston, interdisciplinary research fellow in psychoanalysis at Emory University, 2004<br />
(Adrian, Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society, December v9 i3 p259 page infotrac gjm)<br />
Perhaps the absence of a detailed political roadmap in Zizek's recent writings isn't a major shortcoming. … (&quot;Capitalist commodity fetishism or the truth? I choose fetishism&quot;).<br />
Calls for direct action are a short-sighted stop-gap in thinking. The need to liberate thinking from the hegemony of capitalism makes our alternative a pre-condition for political change<br />
<br />
Johnston, interdisciplinary research fellow in psychoanalysis at Emory University, 2004<br />
(Adrian, Psychoanalysis, Culture &amp; Society, December v9 i3 p259 page infotrac gjm)<br />
The height of Zizek's philosophical traditionalism, his fidelity to certain lasting truths too precious to cast away in a postmodern frenzy, …since all such rushes to action are doomed; they either fail to disrupt capitalism or are ideologically co-opted by it.<br />
Don’t believe the hype – doing nothing in the face of the affirmative is essential to opening a space for resistance to the ideology of capital – the plan can only replicate domination and their harms<br />
<br />
Zizek in 2004<br />
(Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle, page 71-71 gjm)<br />
<br />
The stance of simply condemning the postmodern Left for its accommodation, however, is also false, since one should ask the obvious difficult question: what, in fact, was the alternative? …thus opening up the space for a different kind of activity.<br />
<br />
The struggle for hegemony always returns to the domination of Capital – the 1AC radically fails to change the political imagination<br />
<br />
Zizek in 2000<br />
(Contingency, Hegemony, Universality, page 223 gjm)<br />
<br />
And my point is that …changes within this economico-political regime.<br />

<br />
THE PASSION 1NC<br />
A) The passion of the courts<br />
The 1ac elevates law to the status of divinity-pieces of evidence are cobbled together to make a unified argument, parallel to scriptural interpretation.<br />
Steven D. Smith, Robert and Marion Short Professor, Notre Dame Law School. 1999 (september, 40 B.C. L. Rev 1041, lexis, (ajt))<br />
The apparent commitment to faith in a....... ...runs through the heart of twentieth-century jurisprudence.<br />
<br />
This faith in law is an obsession that sanitizes history which prevents us from viewing other possibilities for understanding. This fixation functions as a pathological asymmetry in which the law is presumed to be governed by reason.<br />
Pierre Schlag, Nicholas Rosenbaum Professor, University of Colorado School of Law, 1998<br />
(The Enchantment of Reason, duke university press, page 117-9 (ajt)<br />
Legal thinkers and actors strive to put ..... find here evidence of something altogether different.<br />
<br />
B) The crucifix<br />
The affirmatives faith in the legal system is founded on authoritarian ideals of nihilism, submission and stagnation in which the individual is constrained and bound by the external authority of the law.<br />
Robin West , Professor of Law, University of Maryland, 1989 (Summer, 83 Nw. U.L. Rev. 977, lexis, (ajt))<br />
<br />
Using Law and Literature as evidence, I will argue in this review that ...but solely because they are authoritative.<br />
<br />
The affirmatives desire to be bound by external authority in the form of law requires them to humanize law. This process of investing the ideal qualities of human existence destroys the value to life for the same reason as religion. Both require us to remove ourselves from positions of agency and depend upon authority to give our lives meaning.<br />
Pierre Schlag, Nicholas Rosenbaum Professor, University of Colorado School of Law, 1998<br />
(The Enchantment of Reason, duke university press, page 105-6 (ajt)<br />
Sometimes, the law is even invested with personality...a renunciation of life, a kind of selfloathing.<br />
<br />
The 1ac's desire to be bound by law also leads to an uncritical acceptance of authoritarianism that justifies the worse abuses of authority because we seek to please authority by carrying out their commands.<br />
<br />
Henderson, Professor of Law at Indiana University School of Law, 1991<br />
(Lynne, Indiana Law Journal, Spring page lexis gjm)<br />
<br />
The argument for uncritical acceptance of authority ... dictatorships such as the Romanian regime of Ceausecu. n7<br />
<br />
c) los/las apocaliptos/as<br />
Our alternative is to reject the affirmatives use of law. suspending the obsessive desire to practice law creates space for an examination of the way in which the law operates. Only this examination can produce the conditions to solve the current arrested development in law.<br />
Steven D. Smith, Robert and Marion Short Professor, Notre Dame Law School. 1999 (september, 40 B.C. L. Rev 1041, lexis, (ajt))<br />
A similar re-examination seems called for at the present time in law...And we need to consider how law, as it really operates, relates to what we really believe.<br />
<br />
Finally, The affirmatives authoritarian deployment of reason and law is dubious at best. All of the affirmatives impact claims should be held under strict scrutiny because reason is easily hijacked to support the worst abuses of authority and eliminate alternative methods of understanding.<br />
Pierre Schlag, Nicholas Rosenbaum Professor, University of Colorado School of Law, 1998<br />
(The Enchantment of Reason, duke university press, page 78-9(ajt))<br />
And because these predicaments constitute the identity of reason.... it should not surprise if the things of logic should bear the marks of the logic of things.<br />

1NC off case position #1: Footnoting<br />
<br />
1NC Structure and cites: 1NC was a narrative – a conversation between the two debaters. It had two tags separating large chunks of narrative<br />
<br />
Links<br />
1. Footnoting – we ignore broader issues like housing segregation<br />
2. Reductionism - through legal action reduce individuals to nothing more than a footnote in our affirmative policy<br />
3. Emotionally dependent on law<br />
4. Legal majorities – CLS law indeterminate, not enforced argument<br />
5. Inaccurate determinations – school systems still flawed and racist irregardless of integration<br />
B. alt – reject plan (use of law)<br />
In cx – states that they embrace fictional stories, that there is their methodology of the 1NC just like policy analysis is the methodology of the 1AC<br />
<br />
Key 2NC/1NR arguments and cites:<br />
No 2AC F/W = reject law good args<br />
