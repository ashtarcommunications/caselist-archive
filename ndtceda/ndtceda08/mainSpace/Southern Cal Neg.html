A constitutional convention will send a stronger societal signal and has more public perception than any other political process, especially Supreme Court decisions<br />

In the neg round vs. Emory SS we also banned the death penalty in the CP text. I’m not sure what the line was exactly. Here is the rest of the CP text:<br />
<br />
Text:<br />
<br />
The United States Supreme Court should rule that <em>United States v. Morrison,</em> 529 U.S. 598 (2000), and <em>United States v. Lopez,</em> 514 U.S. 549 (1995), lack precedential value because they only apply narrowly to the facts of the cases. The Supreme Court should further clarify that <em>Gonzales v. Raich,</em> 545 U.S. 1 (2005), is to be used as standing precedent for commerce clause jurisprudence, and that lower courts are to use the rational basis test and the definition of “economic” as used in <em>Gonzales v. Raich.</em><br />
<br />
The United States Congress should pass a resolution stating that violence against women is intricately tied to gender animus within our communities, and that violence against women should be treated as a civil rights issue because it discriminates against women as a class of individuals.<br />
<br />
The legislatures of the 50 states and all territories should pass legislation institutionalizing restorative justice as a solution to gendered violence including, but not limited to, family group conferences, sentencing circles, and victim-offender mediation. Victims will be given the choice to use these methods of restorative justice instead of or in addition to traditional legal means.<br />

The Supreme Court’s recent decision … leaves Raich very much intact.<br />

Returning to the rational basis test is what their own solvency evidence says is needed<br />
Dral and Phillips, J.D. from UTennessee and Professor of Law, UTennesse, 2001<br />

Applying Raich means zero judicial restraint on Congress’ commerce clause powers – Raich would return Commerce Clause jurisprudence to the rational basis test, and would solve all of their Commerce Clause advantages<br />
Somin, 2006 [Ilya, Assistant Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law, “Gonzales v.

<br />
As several commentators have argued…Commerce Clause cases can survive Raich.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lower courts are using Raich – even the most conservative ones<br />
Somin, 2006 [Ilya, Assistant Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law, “Gonzales v.

<br />
Post-Raich Court of Appeals decisions…will reach the same conclusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lower Court judges are smart – they understand the Supreme Court’s intentions and will model the CP – empirically proven<br />
Eskridge ’04 (William N, John A Garver Prof of Law @ Yale Law School, 88 Minn. L. Rev. 1021 May ln)<br />

There is no value to explicitly overruling Morrison – the Raich decision exploited gaps in Morrison such that even if Morrison is on the books, future decisions will come out the way of Raich<br />
Somin, 2006 [Ilya, Assistant Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law, “Gonzales v. Raich: Federalism As a Casualty of the War On Terror,” Forthcoming Cornell Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy, Sune 31, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ssrn.com/abstract_id=916965" rel="nofollow">http://ssrn.com/abstract_id=916965</a>]<br />
<br />
Overall, Raich’s evisceration … water until Raich is either limited or overruled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Overruling a decision is a clear violation of stare decisis – only distinguishing allows the Court to sidestep precedent without violating the stare decisis doctrine<br />
Lafferty ’94 [Latour Rey, judicial law clerk for Honorable John H. Moore II, Chief Judge, Middle District of Florida, “A Review of Piazza v. Major League Baseball” 21 Fla. St. U.L. Rev. 1271 lexis]<br />
<br />
Rule stare decisis is the binding …if it distinguishes precedent on either basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CP Solves the Case - Distinguishing is an appropriate alternative to overruling<br />
Hashimoto ’96 (Dean Masaru, Assistant Prof of Law @ Boston College, 4 UCLA Asian Pac. Am. L.J. 72 ln)<br />
<br />
To the extent that there is a consensus…usually associated with stare decisis.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Distinguishing robs decisions of precedential value without overruling<br />

<br />
In recent years, the restorative justice movement …reduce victims' fear of victimization (Umbreit, 1994).<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, restorative justice deals with the underlying problems behind gender violence – it solves them at the community level, and empowers the victims throughout the process<br />

A third way to examine whether …procedural justice or by making decisions that follow principled rules.<br />

2. Overruling decisions without a reason for the change in constitutional interpretation makes the Court look political and destroys its legitimacy – this evidence also make the argument that our CP would be a way of avoiding the difficult constitutional decision of the plan<br />

Torts Bad<br />
<br />
The civil remedy is anti-therapeutic – they are worse than the criminal process itself – torts are based on a notion of “comparative fault” which stipulates that damages are awarded in accordance with how much a particular party is at fault – more often than not, civil trials will find victims partially responsible for their own rape. Civil trials re-victimize women<br />
And don’t provide enough compensation.<br />
Koss, 2000 [Mary P., Public Health, Family and Community Medicine Psychiatry, and Psychology University of Arizona, “Blame, Shame, and Community: Justice Responses to Violence Against Women,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Because an attorney retained by the survivor … make the rapist's act 'her fault&quot;' ( Bublick, 1999, p. 1476 ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Victim fault turns the case –<br />
<br />
A) It makes women responsible – civil trials treat gender violence as a common occurrence that women are themselves responsible for protecting against – if they haven’t taken a reasonable amount of care to prevent against violence, it is partially their fault that it happened.<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />
<br />
The central problem with current comparative fault defenses…design of broader institutional protections.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Tort law puts women back in their place – it is based on notions of what a reasonable women is expected to do – this reinscribes static notions of appropriate sexual behavior – it forces women back into homes and motherly roles and turns their public/private argument<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />
<br />
As in the context of criminal rape cases… not women who are agents as well as victims.<br />
<br />
<br />
C) Tort law turns the symbol – civil trial send the message that women are responsible for the crimes against them – it teaches women that gender violence is a normal part of the environment – women are forced t olive in fear of violence and rape<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />
<br />
2. Equality Norms Inside and Outside the Courtroom… exercised in the face of constant risks of rape.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
D) The normalization of violence – tort law treats violence as a legally accepted reality that women have the obligation to protect themselves against – this naturalizes gender violence as an acceptable part of society<br />

Reauthorization Cites<br />
<br />
1. Their interpretation is an antiquated theory of law that no longer applies – it assumes that when courts strike down a law, they render it out of existence – this is false; when a court overrules, it can only render a law unenforceable, it immediately comes back into existence when the previous decision is overruled<br />
Plave, 1990 [Erica Frohman, “THE PHENOMENON OF ANTIQUE LAWS: CAN A STATE REVIVE OLD ABORTION LAWS IN A NEW ERA?,” 58 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 111]<br />
<br />
More recently, however, one court construed the void ab initio doctrine…overruling the prior holding would reinstate the statute. 51<br />
<br />
<br />
2. This is proven by the fact that section 13981 is still part of the U.S. Code – the minute Morrison is overruled, victims can file civil cases under the VAWA section – here it is US Code, updated through 2005<br />

The United States Congress should pass legislation stating that gender violence is a form of torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and that states must take adequate measures to protect against gender violence as per our obligations to the ICCPR. As per our obligations to the ICCPR, Congress should also institutionalize restorative justice as a solution to gendered violence including, but not limited to, family group conferences, sentencing circles, and victim-offender mediation. Victims will be given the choice to use these methods instead of traditional legal means.<br />

Text: The United States Supreme Court should clarify the Planned Parenthood v. Casey 505 U.S. 833 (1992) decision that &quot;at the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life&quot; by rejecting any interpretation of that passage that prioritizes the Court's rulings on individual liberty over community norms, normative truth, or revelation for any purpose but the improvement of unborn life. No part of the Court's ruling will be interpreted to mean that &quot;improvement&quot; can include the termination of unborn life, and the Court will explicitly reject interpretations of the passage that justify abortion or euthanasia. Furthermore, the US federal government will establish a utility-theory-based national health system that guarantees funding for all legal medical procedures partially or fully utilizing methods of therapeutic cloning<br />
<br />

A] Not topical – doesn't have the Court overturn any decision<br />

B] Competition –<br />
(1) Mutually exclusive – you can't overturn a decision and not overturn it<br />
(2) Net benifits – Solves case, avoids case turns, and gets our social inequality net benefit<br />
<br />
(1) The Court's Casey Mystery Passage is critical to legalizing therapuetic cloning – the parts of Casey we endorse are only those that involve the embrace of life – the Court will avoid hedonism and uphold bans reproductive cloning but it will overturn bans meant to prevent us from helping babies – it can even do so under community rather than individual justifications<br />

Most specific lin/internal link/impact story – the banning of the law in Gitmo is an attempt to cover its operation and abit critics into demanding more law<br />
<br />
Johns ’05 (above)<br />
“In arguing against Agamben and others . . . indeed, an overdetermined version thereof)”<br />
<br />
<br />
Gitmo is not an actual zone of exclusion, but saying that it is causes us to look their for our enemies. Since those enemies are within the law, our search fails – the affirmative destroys our ability to recognize genuine zones of exception, undermining our ability to locate enemies that are genuinely Other. This causes the destruction of the political dimension of subjectivity.<br />
