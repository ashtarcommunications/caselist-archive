Their move inward in order to address the question of openness is dangerous b/c neoliberal powers will coopt it. Debate matters in asmuch as it allows to create methodological movement. The aff forgets that there are people who are not able to subscribe to their method of being. This becomes endemic in the status quo which is necessary for the atlternative. The role of the ballot is to vote for the team which allows or the most political change. We are impact turning their arguments as to why nothing outside debate matters.</span><br />
