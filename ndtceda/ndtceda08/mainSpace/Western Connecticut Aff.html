The rights of minors to achieve an abortion are under assault. The federal government is attempting to sacrifice the lives of young women in order to slowly Chip away at roe v wade.<br />
<br />
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 2k6 (august 1st)<br />
<br />
Although affirming Roe, The Casey decision upheld as constitutional the right for states to pass parental consent provisions for minors.<br />
<br />
Daly, Ast prof at Widener Law School, 1995 (Erin, 45 Am. U.L. Rev. 77 RECONSIDERING ABORTION LAW: LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND THE NEW RHETORIC OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD v. CASEY)<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 – Health<br />
<br />
Parental involvement laws commonly result in denial of the right to abortion. The alternative to this is women often die from illegal back ally abortions. Even when consent is given the resulting delays increase medical risks and costs.<br />
<br />
There is a shockingly high amount of sexual and physical abuse of children. Parental involvement laws increase the likelihood of domestic violence by giving them an excuse to abuse their children.<br />
<br />
Berman, JD U of Toledo, 1994 (Leonard, 7 How. L.J. 577 OTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UNEMANCIPATED MINORS' ABORTION RIGHTS<br />
<br />
Judicial bypass doesn’t alleviate the problem. It causes delays, emotional and psychological distress, violates their right to privacy, and often results in a denial of the abortion<br />
<br />
Schmidt, 1993 (Catherine, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 597 WHERE PRIVACY FAILS: EQUAL PROTECTION AND THE ABORTION RIGHTS OF MINORS)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2 – feminism<br />
<br />
Parental consent legislation demoralizes waves of young women by forcing them to accept an inferior position in society. This is particularly true for younger women whose emotional and psychological development is dependent upon personal decision making. Failure to combat traditional stereotypes about women make full equality in society impossible.<br />
<br />
Schmidt, 1993 (Catherine, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 597 WHERE PRIVACY FAILS: EQUAL PROTECTION AND THE ABORTION RIGHTS OF MINORS)<br />
<br />
Teenage motherhood has a crippling effect on minors, devastating their ability to achieve in life<br />
Schmidt, 1993 (Catherine, 68 N.Y.U.L. Rev. 597 WHERE PRIVACY FAILS: EQUAL PROTECTION AND THE ABORTION RIGHTS OF MINORS)<br />
This retrenchment of patriarchy risks extinction<br />
Betty Reardon, feminist author and peace activist, WOMEN AND PEACE: FEMINIST VISIONS OF GLOBAL SECURITY, 1993, p.30-1.<br />
Adopting a feminist approach to social relations improves the chances for human survival.<br />
Betty Reardon, feminist author and peace activist, WOMEN AND PEACE: FEMINIST VISIONS OF GLOBAL SECURITY, 1993, p.24-5.<br />
Advantage three – ageism<br />
<br />
Casey espouses an ideology that affords minors no constitutional freedom or privilege, ensuring that they will never have full legitimacy.<br />
<br />
Berman, JD U of Toledo, 1994 (Leonard, 7 How. L.J. 577 OTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UNEMANCIPATED MINORS' ABORTION RIGHTS<br />
<br />
The next step in minors rights is to give women constitutional parity in regards to abortion and privacy.<br />
<br />
Berman, JD U of Toledo, 1994 (Leonard, 7 How. L.J. 577 OTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UNEMANCIPATED MINORS' ABORTION RIGHTS<br />
<br />
<br />
The adult/child dichotomy is the foundation for which all oppression exists.<br />
<br />
Dominick 97<br />
(Brian A Dominick, youth activist and writer,”revolution kid style ”, 1997)<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court will overrule Casey v Planned Parenthood on the grounds that laws requiring parental involvement in abortion violate the 14th amendment and should be subject to strict scrutiny.<br />
<br />
<br />
The supreme court must overrule Casey and negate the constitutionality of parental involvement laws.<br />
Berman, JD U of Toledo, 1994 (Leonard, 7 How. L.J. 577 OTE: PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY: SUPREME NEGLECT FOR UNEMANCIPATED MINORS' ABORTION RIGHTS<br />
<br />
Abortion law is ripe for consideration under equal protection. Strict scrutiny is necessary to solve sex discrimination and prevent states from passing oppressive legislation that isn’t narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest<br />

<br />
Contention One: The Status Quo<br />
<br />
First, Segregation trends are accelerating super quick and look to get worse<br />
Chemerinsky, Law Professor at USC, 2003<br />
[Erwin. “Essay: Separate and Unequal: American Public Education Today” American University Law Review, August, 52 Am. U.L. Rev. 1461, Pg. l/n]<br />
<br />
And, Milliken is responsible for these continuing segregation trends<br />
Chemerinsky, Law Professor at USC, May 2003<br />
<br />
Thus the plan text: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Milliken v Bradley on the grounds of the Equal Protection clause of the 5th and 14th Amendments. We’ll Clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Education<br />
<br />
First, segregation directly effects education<br />
Chemerinsky, Law Professor at USC, 1994<br />
<br />
Second, many intangible factors also undermine segregated education<br />
Mickelson in 03<br />
52 Am. U.L. Rev. 1477, ESSAY: ACHIEVING EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE WAKE OF JUDICIAL RETREAT FROM RACE SENSITIVE REMEDIES: LESSONS FROM NORTH CAROLINA, Roslyn Arlin, Professor, Department of Sociology, pg. ln<br />
<br />
And, quality education is critical to the economy<br />
Biegel, 1989<br />
[Stuart. Cornell Law Review, September, 1989, 74 Cornell L. Rev. 1078, Pg. l/n]<br />
<br />
And, Economic collapse causes extinction<br />
Bearden, Lt. Col, Tom; PhD Nuclear Engineering, April 25, 2000,<br />

<br />
Furthermore, education is also to maintaining U.S. hegemony<br />
Marcum, 2001<br />
[John. “Eliminate the Roadblocks” Chronicle of Higher Education, May 18, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.umabroad.umn.edu/ci/stats/resources/marcum.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.umabroad.umn.edu/ci/stats/resources/marcum.html</a>]<br />
<br />
Economy competitiveness is key to sustain U.S. hegemony<br />

Sustained US leadership is key to prevent multiple scenarios for nuclear war<br />

[Zalmay. “Losing the Moment? The United States and the World After the Cold War” The Washington Quarterly, Spring, Vol. 18, No. 2, Pg. 84]<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Racism<br />
<br />
First, Milliken’s faulty application makes it appear to be a punishment, and in turn stigmatizes minority students as such<br />
Ford, March 2004 (Professor of Law, Stanford Law School, and Justin M. Roach, Jr. Faculty scholar)<br />
[Richard, “Symposium: Brown at Fifty: Brown’s Ghost,” Lexis, Accessed 8/1/06]<br />
<br />
And, segregation is a direct manifestation of racism that creates a hierarchy of value, rendering individuals less than human<br />
Hall, Winter, 2006 (Professor of Law, Northeastern University)<br />
[David, “Symposium Article: Black Children and the American Dilemma: The Invisible Tears of Invisible Children,” Lexis, 8/2/06]<br />
<br />
We must reject racism in every instance<br />
Barndt 91<br />
Joseph Barndt, co-director of Crossroads, a ministry to dismantle racism, 1991, &quot;Dismantling Racism: The Continuing challenge to White America,&quot; p. 155-6.<br />
Contention Two: Solvency:<br />
<br />
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE MILLIKEN – NO OTHER SOLUTIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE WITHOUT COURT ACTION<br />
Gewirtz, 1983<br />
[Paul. “Remedies and Resistance” Yale Law Journal, 92 Yale L.J. 585, Pg. l/n]<br />
<br />
Reversing Milliken would have had a profound effect<br />
The Honorable Nathaniel R. Jones, ‘92<br />
[“Symposium: Brown v. Board of Education and Its Legacy” Fordham Law Review, October, 61 Fordham L. Rev. 49, Pg. l/n]<br />
<br />
And, Metropolitan districts are empirically successful at decreasing segregation<br />
