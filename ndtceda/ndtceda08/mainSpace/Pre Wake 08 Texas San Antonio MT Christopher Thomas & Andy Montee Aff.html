<br />
Queer Time<br />
(The full citations for the cards are not up yet, but I'll fix that shortly.)<br />
<br />
Modern civilization's ability to function relies on its ability rationally determine what is considered best for society. This mentality is deeply ingrained within nearly every thought and action that we take, whether we realize it or not. The development of agricultural production is the epitome of this – food production has been consolidated within industrial farms in order to create massive food stocks for the future.<br />
<br />
Thus modern society developed the practice of monoculture. Farmers stopped growing a different types of commodities and switched to a model that emphasized continual forward progress and efficiency. Every crop within a monocultured farm is exactly the same – all are produced from the same genetic strain in order to maintain a predictable stability. Monoculture requires intense control of all aspects of life. Fields are planted in such a way as to produce maximum output. Control is kept through uniform growing requirements in order to standardize all aspects of crop life. Crops are sectioned off into compartmentalized vectors to prevent interaction between any of the organisms.<br />
<br />
This top down control and sanitization parallels the way society is treated. Our heteronormative government is the farmer, while every living being under its control is viewed in terms of its contribution to a productive future. These hegemonic structures look upon American soil and identify individuals that stand outside the idealistic genetic makeup of a productive citizen – these differences are broken up by identities that include race, sex, class, gender, age, and others. These constructions are created and understood to be flaws to the societal whole.<br />
<br />
This productive futurism relies on oppressive hetero-culture in order to continue its power. The future is the carrot held on the stick in front of us as we are continually denied any true societal change. Future goals are used as a destructive tool for heteronormativity to justify the elimination of queer populations to achieve those future goals. However, the future we desire is always outside of our grasp - it is merely a fantasy to coerce people to constantly maintain the controllable present.<br />

But this linear understanding of time is a heteronormative concept. While queer communities are forced to work towards it, they are incapable of experiencing that outlook. For the queer, there is no future – queer sexuality, explicitly denies the reproductive outlook because there simply is no place for it. The queer cannot understand the ideal stable future that is so desired by heternormativity – queerness knows that there is no such thing as stability and that life, identity, our bodies and our world are fluctuating parts of infinite possibilities.<br />

This heteronormative thought is one that creates and establishes an invisible center – one that is definable and sanitary. This center is subconsciously desired and worked towards, but always kept from our grasp. This construction of producing and reproducing standards for rationality, desirability, and superiority becomes the primary instrument for power and violence. Modern day society relies upon this unspoken rule in order to legitimize its decisions and rationalistic scenarios. Our institutions and theories of understanding are backed by a force that creates and sustains the systemic marginalization of the abnormal.<br />

<br />
Therefore, we affirm a queer counter public in opposition to the dominant agricultural discourse of heteronormativity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The heteronormative temporality is founded on its ability to perceive time as a striaght line. Within this debate round, we are faced with the question of the resolution. Should the USFG eliminate its support for some agricultural commodities? Our options are limited to either a conservative approach that attempts to recall the past, or a progressive approach that pushes for a new future. In response to these options, we affirm a queer counterpublic. A queer counterpublic is a communal group that operates outside of THE public. THE public is a social totality – one that is organized around dominant group structures. This public seeks to define and normalize publics around itself and thus control them. Agriculture has many of these publics, but by far the most dominant is the aspect of hetero-normative futurism.<br />
<br />
Warner 05<br />
<br />
<br />
This counter-public is one where no one is forced into the closet, and thus does away with there inherent hetero-normative cover up of THE public. The usage of public discourse is to gain support for the counter public. This is critical in recognizing within ourselves the potential to challenge hierarchies. The counter public is not just the ability to have a place for ourselves to be free – it is a group that supplies different ways of imagining stronger social ability.<br />
<br />
Dominant publics are ones that seek to normalize and define the scope of universality and rationality. Counter publics are spaces which the poeisis of these scense is transformed. A queer counter publics can operate in anyway that disturbs the thoughts of THE public. In order for agency to be taken seriously, we must inhabit this new worldview by devoting attention to it. It may be difficult to see what this world would look like, but it is a question of diffusing the role for state based thinking. If the state is seen as a mandatory and desired force, the counter public loses focus and any hope for transformation.<br />
<br />
Warner 05<br />
<br />
<br />
A queer adjustment to the way we consider time is critical. Queer time embraces the models of temporality that break down models of time that break down societal binaries. The queer counter public is the critical site for new temporal understandings.<br />

Round 3 Aff<br />
vs. MO State FS<br />
Judge: Vega<br />
<br />
The aff is a speech act against heteronormativity.<br />
<br />
Some of the text:<br />
<br />
Welcome brothers and sisters. I am proud to stand before you today a homosexual. with our hearts full of love and the faith in justuce, we have come here to speak to america. i welcome you to a great weekend in american history; a weekend that will fundamentally shape our political and social history. a little over a week ago our community was once again pushed into the mud and told that we are second class citizens. we were told by the state of CA that marriage, no not marriage, but love can only publicly exist between a man and a woman. This is not an exception, but a reaffirmation of the social understandign of queer communities as not equal they are not the same, something odd or different, something that cannot be defined and therefore do not meet standard for equality. there has been a call this weekend for all people of every community to protest/march/and speak to challence ignorance. it is during this weekend that we are saying no. queer communities and its allies are tired of being told to wait to calm down and to take it to the courts. we are tired of a system that seeks to eliminate those who cannnot be defined into a hetero-normative idea.<br />
<br />
We only get to discuss this when senators get caught in the bathroom having sex. Why are they in the bathroom? we have a structure of power that pushes people to the periphery. paraphrasing here.<br />
<br />
this is not about marriage, but about the institutionalization of bigotry. it is time to love those who are not like us.<br />
<br />
you have a choice: standing with us represents a joining of our proetest against hate and bigotry and prop 8. key to freedom.<br />
<br />
people died in the anti-racism protests, and people have struggled for rights, but we can win.this is a starting point for future communities. they will see what we have done here and understand the power of protest. on this day, with love in our hearts, we have come out and we have come out across america to build a brikdge of understanding of progress as solid as steel, a bridge to a land wehrer no one suffers prejudice because of their sexual orientation, their race, their gender, their religion or their human diffferences.<br />
<br />
They also hang some protest signs and they play recordings of some people talking about the prop 8 vote.<br />
<br />
Framework ans<br />
the idea of framework is on thta testablishes a normative sanitized center in which to judge and evaluate everything else. we use the resolution to limit out those issues not capable of being researched, we use the topic to ground our arguments in something predicatble and contollable.<br />
<br />
there can never be a topical version of the aff - not defined and not related to the topic<br />
<br />
the idea of a topical version is like giving queer communities a civil union instead of marriage<br />
<br />
your interp forces role-playing onto individual bodies. this is another process of siiking a static ideneity - justifies violence antonio 95<br />
<br />
role playing has historically been used to kill off identity - nazi killed gay men because they can't reproduce but kept lesbians to force sex to show them what to do<br />
<br />
role-playing is bad, then this is a disad to thier interp - who has implemented prop 8, who has enacted other anti-queer policies?<br />
<br />
we won't all become policy makers so we have to learn alt ways of shaping politics. our method is key<br />
<br />
even if loss of debatability, the short term through a loss of rsch ground or predic can't o/w the benefits of queer ed - lee 8 &quot;if public administration...to demolish them&quot;<br />
<br />
you are just theoretical politics, no help for anyone<br />

 <br />
In the beginning there was the word and the word was god.<br />
The human consciousness originally perceived the universe as indivisible. Through language we were able to give form and shape to reality. The process of naming separates human subjectivity from everything else with sings and symbols and thus creates and constructs the diverse world around it. The story of the status quo and the resolution is the story of names, like the biblical adam in the garden of eden, asserting domination over life through the naming of the birds and the ebasts. Reality begins with logos, the word: that is our mastery over the universe. We name corn ethanol for fuel, we name fish stocks as food prices, we name gifts of the earth as commodities in order to be used for human conscumtion. We reduce all human experience to observation and empirical science. From here, we build distinctions: Eaerth and Sky, human and non-human, thought and desire, being and becoming. The world around us wills policies into being without a prior understanding of the mutually constitutive and symbolic relationship between will and nature. It sets itself in opposition to nature and thereby assimilates and conquers nature. Such dissolution separates reality from its divine origins and fragments humanity's experience of the beauty of nature.<br />

“In my tradition...or something else.” P89-90<br />
<br />
This type of separation from the Divine, or the holiness and supernatural, which terminates the belief that we can never achieve paradise on Earth. Even if you are not religious, this thought is built into most cultures. This attitude is the principle caus of environmental abuse and degradation. The pending doom of the status quo is indicative of this type of thinking: the coral reef is dying because we want coastal communities. Animals on the verge of ceasing to exist because we heard them into factory farms, and we treat cows as production machines to add to our morning serving of CoCoa Puffs. When divinity is objectified, nature becomes just another commodity. This industrial cosmology contributes to the destruction of our planet and the extinction of our souls.<br />
<br />
Curott 2001<br />

“There's a terrible wound...we are destroying divinity” p 175-6<br />
<br />
We then read a story. It involves Eve taking back the names of animals, nature, etc. after Adam names them.<br />
It's written by Ursula Le Guin in 1985 and is called “She Unnames Them”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the story, Eve takes back the names of the animals because they were either wrong to begin with or created harmful relationships between people and beings. The removal of the names deconstructs the logocentric walls that divide humans from the rest of the world. We must think through our feelings of vulnerability and begin to perceive the world as full of new possibilities of experience.<br />
Le Guin and White 95<br />
“She Unnames Them” is really...therefore its sacredness”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus andy and I affirm that we should engage in a pagan process of unnaming the words and labels of the resolution.</strong><br />
<br />
Our alternative to the current system relies an understanding paganism. This refuses the names of the labels imposed by the resolution. By doing so we can expose the substance, truth and the being of nature. If I point outside the window to the green mouths and bodies of brown, you would say “I know that's a tree.” but do you really know? The naming process creates artificial difference and distinctions betweeen and within the self and nature. This is not some form of Deep Ecology because even environmental movements still rely on names and labels. Our pagan process allows for every “object” to be a conductor of Divinity. It doesn't matter if it's as small as the weed in your garden or as big as the Pacific Ocean, the unnaming process opens the human consciousness to experiencess the interconnectedness of life.
