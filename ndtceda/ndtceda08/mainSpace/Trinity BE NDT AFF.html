<u>Politics</u> <br />
Banning subsidies has bipartisan support, the fish lobby has to go along<br />
Granquist 08 Fishing subsidies and the world trade organization<br />
“In the United…contribute to overfishing”<br />
<br />
Obama’s slashing subsidies now – causing massive fights in congress, destroying unity and mobilizing the farm lobby. Plan would be debated as part of his large subsidies bill<br />
LA Times 2/27 Cuts proposed for subsidies to large farms<br />
“a proposal to…opposed he said”<br />
<br />
That means its middle of the docket – senate must deliberate omnibus and DC district first<br />
CQ Poltiics 2/25 Omnibus bill passes in the House; Senate consideration will wait<br />
“The House passed…in the House”<br />
<br />
Say no – the model of politics assumes Obama is pushing the bill right now and the judge is determining the vote. If the judge votes no then the plan was proposed and then lost. This triggers their politics link<br />
De Moines Register 2/27 Obama wants to cut subsidies to farmers<br />
“Farm organizations and…would lose payments”<br />
<br />
People vote on ideology not spillover – current politics proves otherwise everything obama proposed would pass bc hes in his first 100 days<br />

Scouted by:Jeffrey White, Liberty<br />
<br />
<br />
TRINITY BE AFF VS CAL BJ<br />
1ac:<br />
usfg should eliminate its fishing subsidies.<br />
<br />
ADV 1: OVERFISHING<br />
group solidarity explains why fishers help each other despite intensely competing-- it's based off the ethic of equality matching that arises in hunter-gatherer groups.<br />
steven pinker, &quot;the blank slate: the modern denial of human nature,&quot; p. 257-258<br />
in other cultures, too... injector or the leaking hydraulics.<br />
<br />
this is why fishers band together to protect their economic interests despite harm to the environment.<br />
samuel fromartz, &quot;the end of the line: author charles clover on the scourge of overfishing, disgraceful restaurants, and, yes, sustainable mcdonald's,&quot; salon, june 20, 2007<br />
one thing you write about is the tension... self-interest to build self-delusion.<br />
<br />
overfishing caused by subsidies<br />
rene sharp and rashid sumaila, &quot;quantification of US marine fisheries subsidies,&quot; north american journal of fisheries management, 29:18-32, 2009<br />
the united nations' food and agriculture... acccepted in the fisheries subsidies literature.<br />
<br />
the best study proves that fishery subsidies directly cause overcapacity and overfishing<br />
doug saunders, &quot;a dose of global cod-liver oil,&quot; may 26, 2007<br />
his field, bioeconomics, had been invented... actually give the world more fish.<br />
overfishing is largest factor in oceanic destruction.<br />

exti<br />

<br />
ADV 2: EVOLUTION/SCIENCE<br />
evolution lets us see the value of suffering-- it shows the imperfections that make life precious<br />
steven pinker, &quot;the blank slate: the modern denial of human nature,&quot; p. 266-268<br />
the many roots of our suffering illuminated... rather, no consciousness at all.<br />
<br />
science is metaphysically grounded and key to effective human-nature relationships<br />
john barry, &quot;rethinking green politics,&quot; 29-30, 1999<br />
if green politics is to base itself... within a secular scientific naturalism.<br />
<br />
any criticism has to answer our science args first-- empirical evidence comes first.<br />
alan sokal, &quot;what the social text affair does and does not prove,&quot; a house built on sand: exposing postmodern myths about science, p. 10-11<br />
there is nothing wrong with research informed... is fostered or hindered.<br />
<br />
science doesn't foreclose critique-- denying its claims gets us nowhere.sokal, above, 17-18<br />
this theme was further elaborated in the now-famous... degree of approximation, objectively true.<br />
<br />
there are external checks on pet theories-- observable reality proves.<br />
philip kitcher, &quot;a plea for science studies,&quot; a house built on sand: exposing postmodernist myths about science, p 40-41, 1998<br />
duhem started a line of thought ... that these possibilities are rational.<br />
<br />
statistics aren't tainted by ideology-- methods invented by eugenicists don't cause eugenics. revealing ideological reasons to distort evidence isn't sufficient to prove that the evidence is distorted.<br />
philip sullivan, &quot;an engineer dissects two case studies,&quot; a house built on sand: exposing postmodernist myths about science, 1998<br />
finally, the development of statistics provides... in the absence of the other half.<br />
<br />
science doesn't reflect any power's interest-- too many competitive incentives to expose flawed work and is put together too gradually<br />
philip sullivan, &quot;an engineer dissects two case studies,&quot; a house built on sand: exposing postmodernist myths about science, 1998<br />
this story illustrates all the characteristics... may take decades and longer.<br />
<br />
NIETZSCHE 2AC:<br />
even if it's hard to see objective truth, some methods are still obviously better-- refusing to acknowledge this makes critical theory and the nazi critique of jewish science equivalent.<br />
paul boghossian, &quot;what the sokal hoax ought to teach us,&quot; a house built on sand: exposing postmodernist myths about science, 26- 27, 1996<br />
what ross and co. should have said... behavior of the editors of social text.<br />
<br />
valuing perspective over argument leads to take over by the right-- if traditional beliefs are accepted, why doesn't that include traditional christian fundamentalism?<br />
boghossian, above, 29<br />
even on purely political grounds... it is supposed to further?<br />
<br />
pessimistic tragedy affirms life because it discovers joy in its inevitable destruction. the tragic perspective liberates us from despair in inevitable destruction.<br />
joshua foe dienstag, &quot;tragedy, pessimism, nietzsche,&quot; new literary history 34:1, muse<br />
tragic art is the organization of a small... and sensibility would be given.
