&quot;Farming,&quot; as a practice, has all but ceased to exist. In its place, Agribusiness has risen. Decisions about agribusiness are made based upon an economic and technical rationale, a rationale willing to sacrifice everything at the altar of efficiency. Subsidies and prevailing agricultural science are examples of this thinking – they attempt to solve every agricultural problem with more money or more technology. Because of this mindset, agriculture is in a state of crisis<br />
John S. Miller, 1986, &quot;Technology and Human Productivity: Challenges for the Future,&quot; John W. Murphy and John T. Pardeck, editors<br />
5. Land ethics in a Technological Age<br />
The 1980's are witnessing…despite high production capacity, agriculture is in a crisis.&quot;<br />
<br />
This focus on production at the expense of all else has been ensconced into law by policymakers, lobbyists, and agricultural scientists. Tech has emerged as the primary mode by which their goals are achieved. The economic decision-making rationale towards farming cannot be divorced from a complete faith in technology<br />
Thompson 95, The Spirit of the Soil, p. 59-60<br />
Just as the work ethic reinforced…in production enhancing agricultural technology.<br />
<br />
This ethically defective mode of decision-making grows and spreads out of our treatment of agriculture. The expectation of constant progress and mastery of the earth espoused in industrial farming has become the grounds on which our society interacts with the world at large.<br />
Wauzzinski 2001, Discerning Prometheus: The Cry for Wisdom in our Technological Society, p. 51-52<br />
I now arrive at an evaluation of the heart of technological…labels them by a calculus known as utilitarian. …happiness produced by technology.<br />
<br />
Subsidies to CAFOs are exactly the sort of policy we should reject – they are post-hoc environmental cleanup that promotes expansion and trades off with sustainable, ecological agriculture<br />
Noble et al 7, www.citizenscampaign.org/PDFs/ EQIP_CAFOletter_Senate_ 8May2007.pdf<br />
Our organizations urge you to support reform…soaked up large amounts of the program's funding.<br />
<br />
Technology, if left along its current trajectory, will destroy everything. We're obligated to respond.<br />
Schuurman 2, www.nd.edu/~ecoltheo/text_ schuurman.htm<br />
Small wonder that the trumpets of praise…ethical question par excellance.<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate domestic subsidies for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.<br />
<br />
Contention Two - Choosing wisely<br />
<br />
We have to move away from the current economic and technical mindset engendered by agricultural subsidies. We must expose the morally groundless nature of current policies. However, it's not just what we decide, it's HOW we decide it – the meanings we attach to our decisions about agriculture, and the way that we justify those decisions, can have a massive effect on social values.<br />
Have to move away from tech – expose morally groundless nature current policies – decisionmaking paradigm has huge impact on societal values – Miller 86<br />
The question arises of whether continued…preservation of America's land.<br />
<br />
We need a return to biological and ecological agriculture. Technologizing has lead us to forget……we are dealing with living things, and should treat them as such.<br />
Politics should be our avenue of action—The plan acts as a derailment against status quo agendas of technological and economic rationality. Political action, focused on justice, can put the breaks on the dangerous advance of technological thinking<br />
Schuurman 02, Professor, Department of Christian Philosophy, Technological Universities of Delft and Eindhoven and the Agricultural University of Wageningen, Member of the Senate of the Dutch Parliament, [Egbert, “The ethics of technology: technological worldview, pictures, motives values and norms”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.nd.edu/~ecoltheo/text_schuurman.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nd.edu/~ecoltheo/text_schuurman.htm</a>]<br />
12.3 Ecological agriculture … The prophetic message of Amos is of current interest: &quot;But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream&quot; (Amos 5:24).<br />
<br />
We don’t claim that we should get rid of technology—rather, we should change our relationship with it to prevent the rise of a purely technological mindset. This requires acting with the RIGHT MOTIVES and being prepared for a struggle—the call to reform our relationship with technology is a never-ending one.<br />

AT T<br />
Not FW question, judge must make the decision if we win the ethics argument these arguments not accessable<br />
<br />

C/I - Justifications for policy are also policy<br />
Ground<br />

Literature Checks<br />
<br />
Reasonability – Roll of ballot question not a FW question, ethics claim at best, don’t evaluate unless the negative can not win the debate<br />
<br />
AT Solvency<br />
Solve 100% of our impact – we attack technocism not technology itself<br />
Impact is extinction, solvency is that we interrupt this<br />
Plan is a means of derailing which is enough to take care of technocism at a government level<br />
Even if CAFO’s exist we derail enough – reversion back to government not supporting – solves the entity of case<br />
Util doesn’t apply either<br />
<br />
AT Reps<br />
Evidence is not neo-malthusian<br />
Concede empirics are key – technology has caused problems in the past<br />
Growth can’t solve in the future<br />
AFF is not environmental movement, these movements fail treat symptoms not root<br />
Roll of ballot is to focus on ethical question<br />
No economic rationality argument in the 1AC, growth is inevitable<br />
Relationship with technology in the status quo will inevitably lead to extinction<br />
Privileging economics over all else means the environment will always lose<br />
Ethical action is key – chaos theory argument not a take out to our affirmative<br />
<br />
AT Counterplan<br />
1. Doesn’t matter if you get rid of CAFOs, question of a movement against technical thought – rockridge institute evidence<br />
2. Treating the symptoms not the cause – schurrman<br />
3. No spillover, cant get rid of CAFO’s means they solve 0 percent of the case<br />
4. Permutation – do both<br />
5. Permutation do the plan and mark it other forms of organic fertilizer<br />

“Mr. Obama has told Republicans in Washington… in a fight now. And it probably won’t let up for eight years.”<br />
<br />
3. Family farms hate EQUIP, they love the plan<br />
The Edina sentinal 2008, family farmers rally at the state capitol<br />
“One hundred and fifty family farmers…. Going to be allowed.”<br />
4. Family farmers key to political influence<br />
JB Ruhl “Farms their environmental harms and environmental law, ecology law quarterly, 2000<br />
“Farms possess immense political power…. Dominated by them.”<br />
5. IL doesn’t match their impact – IL is political hype of entitlement reform impact is existence<br />
