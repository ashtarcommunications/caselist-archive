<span class="cite">We begin our process of affirmation by engaging the metaphor of the monoculture. Monocultures of nature and Monocultures of the mind: when, in the course of creating value based on sameness, reiteration of norms, and the goals of the market, there is a loss of diversity- both of ways of thinking and of the biodiversity that creates our shared material existence. This form of thinking is what justifies the either/or logic necessary for ecocide and genocide. We must break free from this form of thinking by rejecting the policies and activities that maintain their justification.<br />

This years resolution allows us a unique opportunity to engage the causes and effects of these monocultures. Specifically, current agriculture policies have started at the wrong point in the attempt to preserve natural resources as well as produce food for the globe: by starting with the framework of value agriculture policies have ensured that genetic and biodiversity will be wiped out under the guise of “maintaining value”. The only hope we have as a public is to embrace a new framing of agriculture that values diversity above all else. Any reiteration of value based agriculture policy would simply be more of the same.<br />

Specifically, We see the artificial market for biofuels supported by US agriculture policy to be an example of this gross negligence in policy making. The biomass market driven by first world producers is not sustainable- while visions of energy independence dance in the heads of our policy makers, unfair trade problems rear their ugly heads beneath the fluff. International trade policies in biofuels have lead to the loss of food sovereignty, large monocultures, and deforestation, destroying the culture and livelihood for billions. Those most at risk are those most dispossessed- women and indigenous populations<br />

Corn ethanol expansions will bolster a Midwest drought and create massive dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico- the continual expansion of corn because of subsidies ensures monocultures on land and Sea<br />

The current agriculture system has also allowed the market to overtake nutrient cycles in the process of growing. While we’ve been tricked into believing that chemical additives can maintain biodiversity we’ve actually laid to waste miles of agricultural land. In destroying the land we’ve ensured total collapse of all ecosystems unless a massive change in valuation happens. Only by jettisoning our cult like connection to industrial agriculture can we hope to ensure the survival of the global ecosystem<br />

Also, Our current agriculture system is not sustainable. Sustainability is intimately tied with diversity. The only way we can create a sustainable agricultural system is by valuing, above the market and value, diversity of minds and types. Diversity guarantees ecological stability and lessens economical, social, and political instability. Implications like colonization are founded upon the norms of monocultures<br />

<span class="cite">The failure of the global economic system, as fueled by US agriculture policy, to maintain diversity- both biological and cultural- has created the conditions that will bring an end to all life. As people are displaced and diversity dies cycles of violence continue to grow and destroy life, through terrorism, extremism, and the most violent forms of xenophobia<br />

Due to the problematics of monocultures, we feel compelled to affirm that<br />
The United States Federal Government should eliminate its support for domestic agriculture by eliminating all biofuels subsidies.<br />

</span>And: Individual rejection of the global system of industrial agriculture support, in however small a space, is critical to overcoming the totalitarian agriculture regime that nations of the world have placed in front of us. Not matter how small one might think something like the ballot is in the grand scheme, it is large in terms of the alternative of not acting. And no “larger” change is ever “better”- its all small in relation to the dirth of alternatives. To accept the laws of Food Facism is to lose our own freedom- the freedom guaranteed in diversity, cultural and biological. As citizens of a larger community than the population og this room we must reject these systems that continue<span class="cite"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span><br />

The process must start with us and the policies that maintain the system of trade that supports the markets that give the incentive to international positions to destroy biodiversity. We have an ethical obligation to ceases these processes and value life intrinsically. Rather an accepting the current framework for agriculture, we ought to adapt a bio-centric framing<br />
