T- we solve interpretation plus limits best not one or the other, we get rid of the undue burden standard, they have no vacuum standard, this is predictable, aff flexibility should outweigh<br />
Case- They conceded our Daly ev, no impact extended in the 2nc, must combine and institutionalize, no reason psychoanalysis is bad more ev-<br />

Kritik- Walden terrible; links more to their arguments, only a risk exclusion happens, more ev-<br />

CP- all futurism is bad; if we win CP is justified reason to reject the CP, extend Zizek 95 from 2ac, we don’t operate within their consensus, West not say ONLY congress act<br />
DA- no rollback, we don’t stigmatize, you exclude with net benefit, not us, already o/r and activist now, no spillover<br />
Framework- extend we do not deny all politics, we impact turn your specific politics, must answer question of rez in a spontaneous fashion, we are not the radical right. People denied kids in squo because of stigma, you uphold a false analogy.<br />

Topicality: they have no evidence that to get rid of precedent means go back to old, new rule is what makes this an o/r, this is the Dunn evidence (directly opposite of the Casey decision)<br />
-strict scrutiny allows for some restrictions and allows for others, no solvency contention would ever exist, Aff flexibility outweighs<br />
CI- authorize all state restrictions or repeal all restrictions, only TWO topical Casey affs on a four case resolution, this is preferable, we prove that it is there.<br />

2AC AT: Lesbian Motherhood K<br />
We don’t claim, as they presume, that homosexuality IS the death drive. Rather the death drive is present in any sexuality. The chauvinist refusal of this reminder leads to the queer as a figure of the death drive that must be repressed. Our focus is not on any sexual identity but acceding to this figure so as to disturb the heteronormative futurism on which their alternative depends.<br />
Lee Edelman, 02 – “Post-partum,” Narrative 10.2, 181-5<br />
“But ‘figure’ is the pivotal term…he child as its privileged sign”<br />
Their hope for a social order wherein queers are incorporated only means the replication of new figures of negativity to stand in their place. The alternative’s complicity with reproductive futurism guarantees inevitable violence against alterity.<br />

Zizek, 95 – “Law and the Postmodern Mind: Superego by Default,” Cardozo L. Rev.<br />
“from whence does this…speak about aloud”<br />
Litigation is politics proper – it is antagonism. Their model of post-political consensus building is only available to those with access, degenerates into technocratic management, and justifies all sorts of political violence.<br />
Erik Swyngedouw, 06 – “Impossible ‘Sustainability’ and the Post-Political Condition”<br />
“A genuine politics…extremists and terrorists”<br />
Focus on the details of policy implementation causes interpassivity which divorces the self from politics.<br />
Gijs Van Oenen, 06 – Theory &amp; Event 9:2<br />

This interpassivity prevents a confrontation with the symbolic order.<br />
Gijs Van Oenen, 06 – Theory &amp; Event 9:2<br />
“Interpassivity thus also…disavowed passivity”<br />
Their cheerleading for democracy discourages radical attempts at stepping outside the coordinates of the current order. They’ll call such a hope utopian but liberated spaces have and do exist. The crucial step in realizing them is to reject the humanitarian arm of liberalism.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, 04 – “From Politics to Biopolitics…And Back,: South Atlantic Quarterly 103:2/3<br />

<br />
The debate world is mired in regulatory schemes of control meant to subjucgate creative instincts of debaters to tried and true “frameworks” for evaluation. The productive capacities of individual debaters are suffocated I attempts to force all to play by “the rules of the game.” What are these rules? From where do they come? Who authorizes them? These are all questions left unanswered even as debaters blindly defer critical energies to routine and tired “interpretations,” naively presuming that these are ahistorical, objective, neutral. Not so. In fact, there is no pure form of debate waiting to be discovered. Only the meager attempts of directors and debaters aline to secure their fantasy world of debate in their image.<br />
Ian Johnson. “There’s Nothing Nietzsche Couldn’t Teach Ya About the Raising of the Wrist: A Lecture in Liberal Studies.” Google It. 1999.<br />
“The analogy I want to put on the table…no claim to privileged access.”<br />
<br />
The dogmatists will likely rise up to insist that, eve given the fallability of any rule book, we can create rules to ensure the best way to play our game—debate. But this is impossible.. To presume such would mean that any of us has privileged access to an external reality which authorizes some inventions as right and others as wrong. This is naïve and misleading. There is no true way to play any particular game just as there is no true game at all.<br />
Ian Johnson. “There’s Nothing Nietzsche Couldn’t Teach Ya About the Raising of the Wrist: A Lecture in Liberal Studies.” Google It. 1999.<br />
“Now, at this point you might… particular game are false.”<br />
<br />
This urge to fix debate is severely limiting for the capacity of debaters to become self-fashioned excellent individuals. The goal of education, which is the primary goal of the ativity, ought not be to suppress the createive insticts of the individual but to let them flourish. Our ultimate aim ought to be providing debaters with a venue for self-realization. This requires open-ended frameworks which do not subsume individuality in deference to authority This does pose risks to predictable routine debate, but contestation and conflict are necessary to stimulate individual will. Further, these unpredictable aspects of debate are precisely those that make the learning experience an adventure- exciting and worthwhile.<br />
Jarkko S. Tuusvuori. “Nietzsche and Nihilism: Exploring a Revolutionary Conception of Philosophical Conceptuality.” Academic dissertation. Univ. of Helsinki. 2000.<br />
“Nietzsche not only acted as a teacher… the factual world to a utopian totality.”<br />
<br />
Therefore, we affirm the resolution. Resolved: the United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey.<br />
You won’t be surprised to hear that we are not interested in pretending that such a plan may be implemented by the “high court.” As affirmers and creators we accept this impossibility and propose our will regardless. This aesthetic of affirmation is much more integral to our general affirmation of life than are the opinions of 9 detached individuals. This is our will: a world of human independence, unrestrained by external authority, however, we do not seek to impose it on anyone else. Our affirmation is a general liberation of the human spirit to define our own truths.<br />
Frederick M. Dolan. “SYMPOSIUM: Nietzsche and Legal Theory (Part 1): Nietzsche’s Gnosis of Law” 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 757. January. 2003<br />
“Nietzsche cultivates above all by means of style… I bid you lose me and find yourselves… .”<br />
<br />
This is an effort o our part to remake debate as our own game. We refuse the traditional models that have been handed down to us and prefer instead to recreate our own verrsio of the rules, recognizing them as pertaining only to us. The ballot is an explicit affirmation, on your part, of our attempt to make debate our own as well as a refusal that our’s or anyone’s ersion o the game is the one on which you must decide. Voting affirmative means liberating your own creative potentials while simultaneously allowing us to do the same. Do not be frightened be crisis rhetoric. Rest assured t hat debat will not collapse as a result of an affirmative ballot. Rather, any innovation in debate or any other g ame has resulted from accidental disruptions of tradition- not unlike the aff. Further, debate dogmatists seem so committed to their project that they risk killing debate in order to save it. Making debate human means refusing the imposition of another’s rules but using the resources there afforded to fashion a game of our own.<br />

Observation 1: It takes a village...<br />
<br />
America is totally beholden to the image of a Child. When I was little my parents entertained the fantasy of Santa Clause, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny in an effort at preserving my childhood, a specially revered shelter from the corruption of the adult world. Indeed, social and legal mores are routinely reshaped and regulated in the name of protecting &quot;the innocent children.&quot; Even fetal personhood has come to shape expectations of and exert pressures on national membership and identity.<br />
<br />
Lauren Berlant. Prof. of English @ Univ. Of Chicago. The Queen of America Goes to Washington City. 1997<br />
pp. 97-100<br />
&quot;The conditions of American citizenship....national membership is supposed to provide.&quot;<br />
<br />
The image of the Child works to restrict politics to the terms of Reproductive Futurism. Proponents of abortion rights all too often fall into this trap by framing their arguments in terms of securing a future safe for women.(ideological consensus)<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 2-3<br />
&quot;But what helped him most...resistance from every social structure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood v. Casey is an example of these compromise politics which affirm the &quot;rights&quot; of women while simultaneously pledging fidelity to the reproduction of the social order by sanctioning the right of a state to pursue its &quot;legitimate interest&quot; in promoting the life of unborn children.<br />
O'Connor Et. Al. (from the decision)<br />
&quot;a number of guiding principles...is also reaffirmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Obervation 2: They hate us for our children...<br />
<br />
Reproductive Futurism keeps us terroristically beholden to the Child. Life itself is deferred to a phantasmatic tomorrow as human freedom is sacrificed to the fascism of the baby's face. Furthermore, this ideology obligates us to identify and root out all those individualities and lifestyles which are perceived to threaten the endless repetition of the social order.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 19-22<br />
&quot;The Child, in the historical epoch...Satan's power to kill our children, God children.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not an empty theoretical gesture toward ontological violence. The logic of reproductive futurism literally compels us to constantly identify new threats to the eternal reproduction of the ordered polity.

Observation 3: No Child Left Behind...<br />
<br />
The plan issues from a radically queer ethic which refuses integration into the social order and the logic of intelligibility it presupposes. Embracing our negativity by means making demands against the future exposes the constancy of negativity in the social order itself. In so doing, it effectively aborts the continued replication of the status quo which is always attended by a figure of queerness in need of extermination.<br />

Rather than rejecting, with liberal discourse....within which my argument takes shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
We should embrace the stigmatization of queers as a &quot;culture of death.&quot; We do not advocate life, choice, or even access. We advocate abortion. Only such a radical position, which insists that the future ­ as continuing the same ­ must end, that the child ­ as figure for that future ­ must die, is capable of exposing the violence which inheres in the social order. Only such an ethic is capable of reclaiming life from the future which currently enslaves it.<br />

<br />
We should accede to the status of sinthomosexuals, identifying with that kernel of our identity which, however perverse, makes us distinctly ourselves and also embracing the stigmatization and abjection that this involves. Only doing so reveals the extent to which each of us is potentially the next victim of violent attempts at ensuring that tomorrow is always only a day away.<br />

The debate world is mired in regulatory schemes of control meant to subjugate the creative instincts of debaters to tried and true “frameworks” for evaluation. The productive capacities of individual debaters are suffocated in attempts to force all to play by “the rules of the game.” What are these rules? From where do they come? Who authorizes them? These are all questions left unanswered even as debaters blindly defer critical energies to routine and tired “interpretations,” naively presuming that these are ahistorical, objective, neutral. Not so. In fact, there is no pure form of debate waiting to be discovered. Only the meager attempts of directors and debaters alike to secure their fantasy world of debate in their image.<br />

&quot;The analogy I want to put...no claim to privileged access&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The dogmatists will likely rise up to insist that, even given the fallibility of any rule book, we can create rules to ensure the best way to play our game – debate. But this is impossible. To presume such would mean that any of us has privileged access to an external reality which authorizes some inventions as right and others as wrong. This is naive and misleading. There is no true way to play any particular game just as there is no true game at all.<br />
<br />

&quot;Now, at this point you...particular game are false&quot;<br />
<br />
This urge to fix debate is severely limiting for the capacity of debaters to become self-fashioned excellent individuals. The goal of education, which is the primary goal of this activity, ought not be to suppress the creative instincts of the individual but to let them flourish. Our ultimate aim ought to be providing debaters with a venue for self-realization. This requires open-ended frameworks which do not subsume individuality in deference to authority. This does pose risks to predictable routine debate, but contestation and conflict are necessary to stimulate individual will. Further, these unpredictable aspects of debate are precisely those that make the learning experience an adventure – exciting and worthwhile.<br />

Therefore, we affirm the resolution. Resolved: the United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey<br />
<br />
Abortion restrictions strike us as superbly moralizing efforts at imposing upon women an externally derived form over and above their own self-making.<br />
You wont be surprised to hear that we are not interested in pretending that such a plan may be implemented by the “high court.” As affirmers and creators, we accept this impossibility and propose our will regardless. This aesthetic of affirmation is much more integral to our general affirmation of life than are the opinions of 9 detached individuals. This is our will: a world of human independence, unrestrained by external authority, however, we do not seek to impose it on anyone else. Our affirmation is a general liberation of the human spirit to define our own truths.<br />

&quot;Nietzsche cultivates above...find yourselves&quot;<br />
<br />
This is an effort on our part to remake debate as our own game. We refuse the traditional models that have been handed down to us and prefer instead to recreate our own version of the rules, recognizing them as pertaining only to us. The ballot is an explicit affirmation, on your part, of our attempt to make debate our own as well as a refusal that our’s or anyone’s version of the game is the one on which you must decide. Voting affirmative means liberating your own creative potentials while simultaneously allowing us to do the same. Do not be frightened by crisis rhetoric. Rest assured that debate will not collapse as a result of an affirmative ballot. Rather, any innovation in debate or any other game has resulted from accidental disruptions of tradition – not unlike the aff. Further, debate dogmatists seem so committed to their project that they risk killing debate in order to save it. Making debate human means refusing the imposition of another’s rules but using the resources there afforded to fashion a game of our own.<br />

DEMOCRACY AFF --- forgive my tyops.<br />

The planned parenthood v casey decision inaugurated a new era of reproductive rights which presume a singular experience of pregnancy and ignore the particularities of some women's lives that prevent them from exercising the choice that the decision guaranteed them.<br />

These measures effectively establish a financial test for motherhood. The socioeconomic circumstances in which people live profoundly influence their capacity to make decisions concerning their bodies. This implicates the modern reproductive rights movement in a larger eugenic process of screening the unfit out of the gene pool.<br />

<br />
Furthermore, these compromise politics have lead the bush administration to implement international policies aimed at restricting abortion access for the world's women. Abortion access movements are global and systemic, however the United States stifles their efforts in the name of conservative ideology which does not directly deny a women's right to choice but denigrates it in comparison to a larger concern for public morality and family values.<br />

&quot;In 1973, the United States....misguided and morally bankrupt policies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Status Quo conceptions of politics and democracy normalize society, endorsing a small set of identities and pretending that the rest of society ought to conform to them. In the context of abortion, contemporary notions of choice have defined good mothers and good choice-makers, and proliferated abnormalities, stigmatizing those who do not pass the financial test for motherhood. The ultimate task of today must be to politicize and contest the dogmatic identities of the status quo.<br />

&quot;A normalizing society treats...to be the corrective&quot;<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, repealling all state restrictions on abortion.<br />
<br />
The affirmative is a new theorization of politics that does not relegate democracy to the confines of the territorial state. Instead, we recognize that democracy flows through, above, and below the state. This enables the globalization of politics that contest the claims of sovereignty. The aff stands in solidarity with other people and groups fighting for access to abortion, disturbing the normal operation of state-centered politics. This democratizes the global issue of abortion.<br />

&quot;But such economic modifications...penitentiary of democracy&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, we do not pretend that our approach is universally desirable or should be universally implemented. Instead, ours is an inherently self-critical affirmation that recognizes ALL identity as contingent. We recognize the imperfection of our affirmation even as we strive to instill it in public life. This ironic problematization allows for political contests in which neither side supposes their identity to correspond to truth and is net beneficial to an alternative that attempts to squeeze the contingency out of life by presuming its own sufficiency.<br />

What does it mean to be an American? An asshole NASCAR fan concerned with guns, god, and gays? A wasteful and oblivious mall-going SUV driver? A pretentious exceptionalist with a NIMBY approach to everything from human rights to culture? Maybe.<br />
But more and more America has coalesced around the image of a family. The violent cultural debate over gay marriage, Ford pickup truck commercials, the commercial failure of the tv show Arrested Development, and Dr. Phil’s domination of the bestsellers list all remind us that our primary responsibility is to father our sons, mother our daughters, and love our kin.<br />
This sacred institution is constantly threatened. Its scapegoats take various forms at different times, but the family is always under attack.<br />
This locates the american family within the horizon of utopia, which calls into its service all political energy above and against a persistent ontological negativity.<br />
Stavrakakis explains in 99.<br />
<br />
Stavrakakis. Lacan and the Political. 99-101<br />
<br />
The persistent and prevalent enemy of the modern family is the stereotypical welfare queen. The racialized, impoverished single teenager mother. The fat lazy couch potato – these women disgust our collective morality and endanger our collective identity. Dangerously, utopian politics enlist the service of scientific objectivity to assess and control the situation. The result is a violent genetic essentialism which takes aim at the reproductive liberties of low-income women of color in an effort at maintaining the purity of the population.<br />
Beverly Horsburgh. 17 Cardo. L. R. 531 January 1996<br />
&quot;Furthermore, today's eugenic thinking...purposes are in mind&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood v. Casey is an exemplary manifestation of these politics. The restrictions legitimized by the decision presume a singular experience of womanhood and pregnancy -- indeed the experience of the ideal mother in the utopian imaginary. This women is white and affluent, and likely married. The result is an increased vulnerability of marginalized women to genocidal attacks on their reproductive freedom.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
&quot;Courts considering petitions...women to sterilization&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The stage is set for eugenics. Current case law provides the legal context, and prevalent public attitudes the social environment, suitable to forced sterilization of the unfit. Abortion jurisprudence is key.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
&quot;Although Buck v. Bell has never...as whole human beings&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The law’s presumption of a single idealized woman creates a cycle of victimization for welfare mothers. Absent a political forum which respects the intersectional nature of their identity they are powerless to contest encroachments on their freedom and genocidal efforts at eliminating them from motherhood. A legal culture which respects difference is crucial to low-income women of color for repudiating their material subordination and claiming public and political recognition as human beings.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
&quot;Single black mothers on welfare...bothers to look&quot;<br />
<br />
Reproductive rights are critical to fostering this jurisprudential space.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG.<br />
&quot;Furthermore, still another aspect...on involuntary sterilization&quot;<br />
<br />
PLAN (The USSC should OR the undue burden standard established by PP v C on the grounds that any state restriction on abortion violates a welfare mothers right to natality.)<br />
<br />
Claiming the right to natality is key to affirming the innate capacity of marginalized women to change the world. Natality represents the unlimited potentiality of being. Claiming this right can reshape the entire welfare dialectic in a way that respects the humanity of impoverished women of color and is critical to breaking the eugenic tide of the status quo.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
&quot;Finally, reproductive rights invoke...transform the future&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, we situate our affirmative within the context of politicizing negativity. Institutionalizing the antagonism of threatening identities into the law is an avenue for disrupting the totalizing narrative of utopian politics. It is critical to challenging the universal notion of a collective identity from which those who deviate must be repressed. Insisting upon difference within the law subverts its attempts at harmony in a way that opens the political to persistent contestation and change. This is the critical political ethos for respecting alterity.<br />
