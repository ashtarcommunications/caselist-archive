 <strong>Lets take a step back and think about our world. When I talk about our world, I’m not talking about the world as it is, I’m talking about the world as perceived, as it is for you. We’re here, in the same room undergoing the same experience of a debate round, but in spite of being in the presence of the same experience we all perceive this event differently.<br />
<br />
This is the result of our own individual paradigms for viewing life through. In general, people aren’t meant to experience the reality of their surroundings, instead they experience the perception of that reality. And that perception is unique to all people. This is the individualizing, authenticating process of the world. What makes you you and me me. In a sense, the world around you is an extension of yourself because it is built around your own perceptions.<br />
<br />
But there is a nihilistic paradigm that has been slowly engraining itself in our collective mindsets since the age of Plato. A hegemonic and destructive paradigm of viewing the world that seeks to see the world as it is, rather than how it is perceived. This viewpoint sees the world, specifically other individuals in terms of computability, facts, numbers, charts and in doing so it dangerously blurs what it means to be an individual in the world. This levels all being and experience to cold hard numbers, ignoring the joys of life. The paradigm becomes productivity. To take objects in the world and mathematically use them to their fullest potential. To value a thing is to be being towards that thing. To value progress is to be being towards being towards. It is an endless cycle of progression for the sake of more progression that leaves us fitter, happier, and more productive. Empty robots. <br />

Arthur Kroker explains how the technological interpretation of being has taken a stranglehold on the American mind.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>When the American narrative is set within the concept of progress built upon progress, the technological paradigm reveals itself no longer as the will to power or the will to accumulation, but instead as the will to will. A directionless, unmoving and infinitely self-referential will that shrugs off any attachment to the subject. <br />

<br />
<strong>Where do individuals stand within this paradigm? The will to will brings all of society into it’s fold, consuming any and all modes of being as technological. Individuals see others not as anything intrinsically good, but as tools to be used for specific tasks. This cycle closes when individuals view themselves as tools- forever divorced from being and the essential nature of life that is given to them by their own unique paradigms.<br />

<strong>There should be no subsidies for biofuels in the United States.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <strong>The removal subsidies on biofuels would end biofuel production.<br />
<br />
The AgBioForum 2007</strong><br />
(Kruse, J., Westhoff, P., Meyer, S., &amp; Thompson, W., “Economic impacts of not extending biofuel subsidies”, AgBioForum, 10(2), 94-103, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.agbioforum.org/v10n2/v10n2a04-kruse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.agbioforum.org/v10n2/v10n2a04-kruse.htm</a>)<br />

<strong>Biofuels are great for the economy- they increase jobs and income. <br />
<br />
Jennings, 2007</strong>  (Margaret J. J.D., Candidate, Drake University, 2007, “Bioenergy: Fueling the Future?” 12 Drake J. Agric. L. 205, Spring 2007, ln))<br />
<br />
<strong>But what do biofuels have to do with anything? The exponential and endless power of the will to will comes from it’s status in our society as absolute truth. The paradigm of technology, the ultimate nihilistic will, places itself within our minds as being the destiny of humankind, and not merely a paradigm for viewing the world. Everything must be thought of in the context of efficiency and productivity.<br />
<br />
The narrative of our plantext breaks with the ideology of the will to will, we imagine an action that will end in the outrageous failure of a loss of productivity. This type of imagining forces us to think outside of the context of the will to will. Thinking outside of the will is how we are saved- if we are capable of imagining a mode of existence not led in the name of progress, then that way of being is shown to be a paradigm and not a destining by the mere virtue of our capacity to imagine free of its chains.<br />
<br />
This shows the will to will AS paradigm instead of truth. This understanding is the one true step we can take to free ourselves. This card has been gender modified.*<br />

<strong>Framework will be an issue in this round- we see our speech as an example for how the people in this room can attain ontological freedom. In the event where the negative reads a framework violation, we'll defend the following interpretation - Debaters should only claim advantages off of their discourse.</strong>
