2 Off and Case<br />
Global Local Kritik as found on the Wiki already<br />
<br />
Counterplan<br />
Text: Thus James and I believe that the best way to approach the topic is to advocate a materialist inquiry of Agrarian Capital and be in solidarity with the Global Labor Force against the structural foces of Capital<br />
<br />
<br />
Obs one: Competition<br />
Any perm severs out of the metaphor they use to describe their solidarity-they chose the words they put in their advocacy text, they should have to defend them-severance guts all neg strat, making us have to start over in every speech.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Ableism<br />
<br />
Their use of the word &quot;standing&quot; to describe their solidarity assumes the &quot;able&quot; body as a norm-excluding those who cannot stand from their project.  Social Critiques must be particularly attentive to their use of ableist language-their careless language reifies the type of oppression they seek to challenge, leaving those who cannot walk out of their vision of anti-capitalist resisitance.  Only replacing their metaphor with inclusive language is able to challenge this pernicious form of discrimination.<br />

The struggle to empower others , especially people with disabilities is a gateway to a larger struggle for an empowered consciousness.  Struggling for an open society which eschews norms of existence in favor of an ethic of respect and dignity provides the necessary tools for dealing with all forms of oppression<br />
