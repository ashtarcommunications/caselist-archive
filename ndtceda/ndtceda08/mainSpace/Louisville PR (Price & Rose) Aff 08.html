This isn’t new, Palestinians been misused and abused since Israel’s creation – Palestinians had land but Israel ended up with a nation. Conditions are horrible. People with hope for the future but no solution in sight. People who despite it all choose to fight – and we have the gall to hinder their progress – to talk of a peace process – words that don’t mean a thing when our actions have a hollow ring. The United States allows Israeli hate because we really care about us and our interests. We’re not impartial and we martial the means to their destruction, and freeze their aid while Israel gets paid. We can’t begin to show solidarity till our rhetoric and actions reach some kind of parity – when instead of taking lives we find hope in our eyes and give rise to compromise <br />

We all have roots that we can’t be separated from – roots that we never forget  <br />
Pryse, “I am the son of a marine who was stationed overseas. I am the son of a marine who guarded our embassies. The son of a marine who during my birth, my life’s dawn, was trying to find his way home from Lebanon – who is rushing to life while those in his barracks found it gone. A marine who was willing to sacrifice his life for his country – and therefore I want to make sure that if it was needed his country was worthy of sacrifice.  <br />
<br />
I couldn’t personally relate to a world like Iron Sheikh described, I haven’t lived a life of tears. I don’t live in fear, my family has lived in America for 377 years. I have had a land of my own, I have had a home – I have privilege and I have power. But I was raised believing in the American dream – not the nightmare and for this reason I do care. I want to believe, I want everyone to achieve and I want to stop this hypocrisy, I want people to realize their rights, to be able to sleep through the night, and not just those people who happen to look like me. More than words I want my actions my community’s, and my country’s to say I am not your enemy. <br />
<br />
Speaking of communities, our community too has roots that it may distanced itself from by can’t be forgotten <br />
James F. Klummp, an associate professor of communication at Maryland, past President of the American Forensics Association, wrote in the Summer of 200, edition of Argumentation and Advocacy, that:  <br />
“The 1950s had prepared the AFA to launch significant initiatives that…Network (today’s Public Broadcasting Service).” <br />
<br />
Debate used to be a game that focused on persuasion and was therefore accessible to large audiences and more participants. But just as the Palestinians now live in refugee camps and face an existence radically different their pre-1947 lives, the debate community is no longer the same organization it was in the 1960s. <br />
<br />
Professor Cynthia Valdivia-Sutherland of Butte Community College presented this argument at the National Communication Association Convention in 1998, <br />
Valdivia-Sutherland Butte Community College, 98 <br />
Cynthia-; “Celebrating Differences: Successfully Diversifying Forensic Programs”; National Communication Association’s 84th Annual Meeting, November 22, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.phirhopi.org/prp/spkrpts5.2/sutherland.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.phirhopi.org/prp/spkrpts5.2/sutherland.htm</a> <br />
<br />
“So you want to increase diversity within your forensics…reasons in support of acts, beliefs, attitudes and values.” <br />
<br />
Essentially a westernized perspective founded on the philosophies of classic rhetoricians such as Aristotle, Protagoris, and Quintilian, and modern rhetoricians such as Stephen Toulmin, Chaim Perelman, and Richard Weaver, the argumentative perspective promotes “rationality in the pursuit of knowledge,” (Kim, 1985, in Samovar and Porter, 1991, p. 404). <br />
“ In contrast, an Eastern perspective “places an emphasis on perceiving and knowing things and events holistically and synthetically, rather than analytically” (p. 403). The significance of these differences is marked, with Eastern thought comprised of vague, sometimes imprecise statements utilizing circular reasoning, while Western thought is comprised of logical…culturally different communicative style is warranted.” <br />
<br />
While the crisis are nowhere near the same in magnitude this was the same kind of situation faced b the debate community in the 70s when CEDA was formed. On a small scale the kind of inseparable community was partitioned just as the status quo peace process proposes Israel and Palestine might be and it failed miserably. First, the groups couldn’t survive as effectively on their own. Second, there was an overlap – kind of like not only the web of roads and land that Israeli settlements have intertwined into Palestine, but also the large numbers of Palestinians living in Israel and family members on both sides of the wall – debates and coaches often debated in both communities. We can see from the attempt at debate separation that sometimes what sounds good in theory doesn’t play out in real life.  <br />
<br />
The breaking apart of groups does nothing for the people that don’t feel they should have to move or leave – similarly, in debate tow organizations doesn’t fix the Louisville’s and other schools who don’t want to be told to go elsewhere when the debate community was one focused on persuasion and a completely different speaking style that the contemporary one in the first place. Israel was created and pushed the Palestinians out just like some people, albeit not everyone who practice the dominant debate style today have tried to do, and with some success, to those stylistically different.  <br />
<br />
Withal love this evident in mind we believe that the United States government should offer a security guarantee to the Palestinian Authority in exchange for their endorsing an include one-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict in the same way that NDT/CEDA judges should offer a security guarantee to stylistic minorities in exchange for their endorsing an inclusive one-community solution to the current stylistic divide in debate.  <br />
<br />
Look at our personal lives, this helps lead to libratory knowledge <br />
Pryse, (Prof at Albany State University of New York) 1998 (Marjorie, “Critical Interdisciplinary, Women’s Studies, and Cross-Cultural Insight,” <u>NWSA Journal</u>, Volume 10, #1, Spring, 1998) <br />
“Thus, she argues, “in an important if controversial sense, the subject…behaviors of the new global social order.” <br />
<br />
This border crossing plays itself out in the debate community, this is the first time that I have seen myself as a minority in a community with two sides fighting <br />
<br />
This metaphorical analysis is important <br />
Shimko, no date <br />
“Johnson see “the essene of the metaphor [a]s understanding and experiencing one kind of thing…their use is “common-place and inescapable”” <br />

Debate is dying [SAME CITES ON WIKI] <br />
<br />
Generic Kritik doesn’t mention the death of Palestinians, how they are suffering <br />
<br />
They don’t recognize their privilege, their white privilege.  <br />
<br />
They are privileged in a system of debate <br />
<br />
Permutation, we can talk about the criticism and establish an ideal that gives one state to Palestine.  <br />

They said the Burke K linked harder to the negative because of our framework.<br />
<br />
Framework:<br />
--Traditional debate doesn’t allow metaphors which are important for learning<br />
--Debate culture is becoming extinct<br />
--Only way to connect is through metaphors<br />
--Conditional arguments bad<br />
--T and CP contradict<br />
--Neg framework props up East/West dichotomy<br />
--Neg excludes certain rhetorical styles<br />
