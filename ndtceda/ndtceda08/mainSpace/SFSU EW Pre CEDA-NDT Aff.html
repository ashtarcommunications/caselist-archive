SFSU EW AFF:<br />
<br />
Our 1AC is a performance of the &quot;Happy Cow commercials&quot;. We read a plan text and we will defend that subsidies are bad and should be removed but we do not defend FIAT implications. We will defend that there are not only economic subsidies but also ideological and cultural myths that subsidize dairy. Our framework for the debate is who has the best methodology for the removal and knowledge surrounding these myths. We read one piece of evidence in the 1AC and it is a card by Wendy Brown in 1995 from her book <em>States of Injury</em> pg. 49-51.<br />
<br />
Here's the SFSU plan text you have always wanted:<br />
Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for dairy.<br />
<br />
Other authors that we will refer to are: Kathy Glenn, Janet Kauffman, and Patrice Jones. (I will make the cites come tonight)
