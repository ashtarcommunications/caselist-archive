 The United States Federal Government should repeal the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 conditioned on the Palestinian Authority’s acceptance.<br />

 Our 1st argument is Democracy at a crossroads – historically the US has been the biggest champion of democracy, but its self interests and bias has created a situation where authoritarianism has begun to creep into its foreign policy. The US does not want the rest of the world to have a voice unless that voice is the same as its own. Respect for plurality of the rest of the world has been traded in for static representation of how it thinks the world should be.<br />
This change of heart has led to the condoning of mass scale violence against the democratically elected leaders of the Palestinian authority. This has led to secret takeover of the Palestinian government by the unelected fatah party. The Palestinian anti-terrorism act of 2006 condems the elcted leaders of Palestine as terrorists creating a crisis for the democratic voice of the Palestinian people.<br />

-The established terrorist threat of Palestine has become an excuse for US supremacy. Constructive engagement and foreign assistance to hamas has been abandoned. This has allowed the static Identity of terrorism to be applied to all Palestinians. This demonization has created the conditions for violent retaliation. Terrorist discourse has become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This makes constructive engagement impossible in the status quo<br />
John marshall 2007 “us must stop hypocrisy, give hamas a chance”<br />
<br />
<br />
-this labeling of terrorist against hamas fuses the war on terror with radical Zionism. This fusion has given Israel a blank check for the erasing of Palestine.<br />
Derek Gregory colonial present p 139-140<br />
<br />
This bias toward Zionists has created the framework for the complete devaluation of all Palestinian life – this permanent exception makes any violence acceptable and inevitable<br />
Derek Gregory colonial present p 126-128<br />
<br />
<br />
The homogenization against Palestinian people, culture, land, and government is dangerous for democracy. Our advocacy is that an ethos of pluralization should be employed into our foreign policy. The Palestinian anti-terrorism act of 2006 is the major roadblock to embracing a respect for Palestinian peoples. In order to respect the voices of Palestine and embrace political pluralism, we believe that the Palestinian anti-terrorism act of 2006 should be repealed. This repealing of the law is a rejection of isolation against Hamas and embraces the possibility of constructive engagement with the Palestinian Authority.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pluralism is not some western concept to save the world. It is an ongoing, incremental, always, process of democratization. Our favoritism against pluralism will only lead to more hostility. We should be the first to show our solidarity in allowing political pluralism by standing against the ingrained bias against hamas.<br />
Robert Hefner 2005 remaking muslim politics: pluralism, contestation, democratization p 25-26<br />
<br />
Our embrace of the uncertainty of political pluralism allows us to not fear the other we feel we have to securitize against. Securitization is part of the American arrogance that promotes its monopoly of truth upon the rest of the world. Our reflection and resistance toward the dogmatic identity of hamas allows us to reconceive of the other and embrace a world where the other has agency and power. This is not a call to relativism but rather a stand against the absolutism that is American imperialism.<br />
Derek Gregory in 04 p 260-262<br />
<br />
<br />
Our second argument is the ethos of pluralization. Our democracy is a medium to rethinking difference and identity. Democracy allows us to disturb the dogmatization of identity and leads us to a new form of political engagement where everything is contestable. Power can flow through, below, and above the state apparatus freeing us from the chains of the territorial state.<br />
William Connolly, Identity/difference, p xi-xii<br />
<br />
Pluralism is not based upon success or an outcome. Pluralism is a process that best gives the conditions for a positive ethos of engagement with multiple others who have multiple faiths. We do not know if success is possible, but we know that dogmatization has led to multiple forms of violence. Pluralism is thus a very fragile achievement to be cherished, we should not take for granted the outcome we have with it.<br />
William Connolly in 2005 pluralism p 62-64<br />
<br />
<br />
The status quo is an ongoing battle between religious unitarianisms, we are not criticizing Zionism alone but rather all hegemonic identities intent on dominating others. There are multiple identities in fear of the other and are attempting to master and control the things that they fear. If left unchecked any violence becomes possible. Our affirmative is an attempt at displacing the drive for ultimate control that territorial Unitarianism has. To fail to embrace this ethical pluralism is to invite a form of violence that will make the genocide against native Americans look like an early shot in an endless series of civil wars.<br />
