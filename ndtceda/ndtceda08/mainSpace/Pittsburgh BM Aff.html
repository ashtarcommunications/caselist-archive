 THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IN ORDER TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE ITS CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH SYRIA, SHOULD GIVE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT IN ORDER TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A LONG TERM LIVING AND WORKING INFASTRUCTURE FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE REFUGEES.<br />

 Observation One is the living situation<br />
The flight of Iraqi’s to Syria is reaching unmanageable heights. There is not enough international aid coming in and there are ever incrasing amounts of refugees pouring into Syria’s borders.<br />
Rosen, 2007 (The Flight from Iraq, New York Timnes, May 13)<br />
Most of this movement .. resolve it.<br />
Iraqi’s fleeing violence only meet prostitution, lack of education, and economic depression upon arriving in Syria. None of these problems will go away any time soon, with the risk of Iraqi refugees being displaced indefinitely, no matter what course the US takes in Iraq. These refugees are experiencing dehumanizing conditions and are often forced to turn to prostitution – they could quickly become the most destabilizing force in the region and be a haven for terrorist recrutiting.<br />
Rubin 2007 (Tracy, the Sorry Case of Iraqi Refugees, Charleston Gazzette, July 14<br />
Most of them are fleeing … no chance to go home?<br />
Observation Two – the Traffickign of Refugees<br />
With the huge increase of refugees into Syria, specifically weomn who are now head of the family and aged men, the refugees have had to take up prostitution in order to survive. Women,m young and old, are forced to sell their bodies in order to support their families.<br />
New York Times, May 29, 2007<br />
Back home in Iraq, Umm … is their bodies.<br />
Sex trafficking in Syria because of the influx in refugees is uniquely problematic in two years. It is not just adult Iraqi female of refugees that are turning towards prostitution in Syria – children as young as 11 must sell their bodies for sex because it is the only way to survive.<br />
Phillips 2005 (Unveiling Iraq’s teenage prostitutes: Fleeing their war-torn homes, Iraqi girls are selling their bodies in Syria to support their families, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/06/24/prostitutes/index.html" rel="nofollow">dir.salon.com/story/news /feature/2005/06/24/prostitutes /index.html</a><br />
The story of a Sunni girl from … not been confirmed.<br />
Trafficked women face a laundry list of struggles outside of the uindsutry – they are labeled as criminals by police forces and concurrently shunned by their communities and lose out on opportunities to alter their position. Sex trafficking creates a viscous dehumanizing positive feedback loop.<br />
Cole, 2006 (Reconceptualizing Female Trafficking: the Inhuman Trade in Women, Cardozo Journa l of Law and Gender, Summer, lexis<br />
The definitional debate over … on traffickers.<br />
Rioghts violationsoutweigh even nuclear war: cannot allow a certain evil because a possible evil, and we can always take steps in the future to prevent their disadvantage impacts.<br />
Gewirth, 1994 (Are there any absolute rights?, Absolutism and its COnsequentialist Criticts. P. 137<br />
Suppose a clandestine … own principle.<br />
The existence of sex trafficking is an inherent eveil – each instance must be rejected and every effort must be made to alter the legal system to stop<br />
Cole, 2006, above<br />
Trafficked women suffer … lega system inexcusable.<br />
SOLVENCY<br />
Now is the critical time for engagement over refugees – if the United States fails toe engage Syria on the question of Iraqi refugees the crisis may ecome more destabilizing and dangerous as Syria’s economy collapses and they refuse to take on more refugees.<br />
Butters, 207 (Syria: A Pariah becomes the Arab world’s lifeboat, Time, ebsco<br />
The Iraqi-refugee issue … pay off too.<br />
Plan is critical to sovle for sex trafficking in SyriaSyria’s take-in of Iraqi refugees has made for a creation of organized crime driven sex trafficking. This sex trafficking, even involving children, can only be stopped with aid from the Untied States which the Syrian government has been asking for.<br />
Arbuthnot, 2007, Exodus of Iraqi Refugees: Syria – the Price of Compassion, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=6384" rel="nofollow">__www.globalresearch.ca/index .php?context=va&amp;aid=6384__</a>, August 22<br />
Syria is also courageously … Pan Arab Nationalism.<br />
And aid from the US is critical<br />
There will be an increasing amount of refugees who are in need of a place outside of Iraq – the war will continue, but Syria can’t keep up without aid<br />
Arbuthno, 2007, above<br />
Since the illegal invasion … mass destruction.<br />
US leadership on refugee policy is critical to a successful international protection system – plan will spillover<br />
Schoenholtz 2005 36 Colum. Human Rights L. Rev. 323, lexis<br />
The answer to the immediate … civil conflict.<br />
The united States has a moral obligation to do the plan – this obligation functions on two levels – 1. The iraq war was started by the Untied States, 2. US obligations under international treaties demand that we act. The plan, using fdorce of diplomatic pressure and incentive will ensure continued aid and open borders.<br />
Downes, 2007 BOOK REVIEW: FULFILLIN THE PROMISE?: WHEN HUMANITARIAN OBLIGATIOSN AND FOREIGN POLICY GOALS CONFLICT IN THE UNTIED STATES, Boston College Third World Law Journal, Spring, lexis<br />
In the 1980s, activists … have been denied.<br />
Current US refugee policy does little more than fund ineffective programs. A combination of pressure and aid is critical to a reconceptualization of regugee policy that would serve to allow an international framework that aids individuals rather than nations.<br />
CUeller, 2007 (The Limits of the limits of idealism: Rethinking American refugee policy in an insecure world, Harvawrd Law and Policy Review.<br />
U.S. refugee policy … interests converge.<br />

<strong>OBSERVATION ONE: THE STATUS QUO</strong><br />
<strong>The State Department has reappropriated millions of dollars originally slated for family planning in Afghanistan</strong><br />
<strong><u>Cohen</u></strong>, Guttmacher Institute, <strong><u>03</u></strong><br />
&lt;Susan A., “Bush Administration Isolates U.S. at International Meeting to Promote Cairo Agenda”The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy, March 2003, Volume 6, Number 1 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/06/1/gr060103.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs /tgr/06/1/gr060103.html</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>This reappropriation is an extension of the administrations pro-life agenda and has a devastating effect on Afghani women’s access to abortion</strong><br />
<strong><u>Inter Press Service, 05</u></strong><br />
&lt;William Fisher, Global Gag: USAID Sued for Impeding Foreign Family Planning, AIDS/HIV Funding with 'Anti-Prostitution Policy' August 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0824-05.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.commondreams.org /headlines05/0824-05.htm__</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong>Our refusal to engage Afghanistan on the issue of abortion has stalled reproductive freedom – material conditions are preventing choice in the Afghani debate over family planning, but the government is open to foreign engagement.</strong><br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>There is a global trend toward reproductive freedom but the debate is not settled and the US plays a central role. For many countries, a pro-choice stance is limited by scarce resources. A shift in US foreign policy, spearheaded by financial assistance for abortion, is vital to allow the trend toward choice to continue.</strong><br />
<strong><u>Ernst</u></strong> et al, lawyers with the Center for Reproductive Rights, <strong><u>04</u></strong><br />
(Julia L., Laura Katzive, Erica Smack, “The Legacy of Roe: The Constitution, Reproductive rights, and feminism: the global pattern of U.S. intiatives curtailing women’s reproductive rights: a perspective on the increasingly anti-choice mosaic,” 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 752 Lexis&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Thus the plan:</strong><br />
<strong>The United States Federal Government, using the US Agency for International Development, should provide the government of Afghanistan a substantial increase in foreign assistance to fund family planning and pressure the government of Afghanistan to allow open access to abortion.</strong><br />
<strong>We use normal means and will clarify.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>OBSERVATION TWO: THE MEANING OF LIFE</strong><br />
<strong>US foreign assistance to Afghanistan is vital to provide the material conditions necessary for abortion. Establishing the infrastructure for reproductive freedom reduces population growth by one third.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Moreover, with new resources available and the influence of international dialog, Afghanistan would accept pro-choice policies.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>At the heart of the abortion debate is a key question which is rarely asked and even more rarely answered: what is the value of being born? A pro-life view of abortion must necessarily posit life as an absolute good, a preeminent value that must never be abrogated. However, we think this stance is problematic: the suffering that faces children once they are born turns the pro-life view on its head – the absence of suffering is good, and the absence of pleasure is only harmful if someone is deprived of it.</strong><br />
