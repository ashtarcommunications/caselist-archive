<u>CP</u> <br />
PIC out of “Increase” financial aid.<br />
<br />
<u>Iraq</u> <u>Pull Out</u> <br />
A. Link – Plan drains Bush’s political capital<br />
<br />
And Bush will win the debate over Iraq, because of GOP support, but any losss of Bush cred allows Dems to cause a pullout.<br />
Leon Hadar, 9-19-07, Lexis<br />

<br />
Bush will need all of his political capital to preserve GOP support for Iraq.<br />
Corpus Christi Caller-Times, 7-24-07<br />

<br />
Our internal link will outweight – loss of gop support is the only thing that can change course on Iraq.<br />
Catherine Dodge, Bloomberg News, 8-27-07<br />
“Bush also is… to happen there.”<br />

Fiscal discipline and deficits are decreasing – this is driving growth.<br />

The plan is a new spending proposal that occurs after the budget deal was reached. The untouchable nature of the plan fragments the budget process – undermining fiscal discipline.<br />
Greenspan, congressional record, 1996<br />
<br />
Now is the key time to adhere to budgetary rules and fiscal discipline – even spending on the margins could derail fiscal responsibility.<br />
St. Pioneer Press, 9-7-07<br />
“Democratic leaders did… billion in 2004.”<br />
<br />

“The ever-cautious… another Great Depression.”<br />
<ol><li>Mead 92</li></ol><br />
<br />
<u>Eurocentrism K</u> <br />
The affirmative operates within a Eurocentric regime of knowledge where the possibilities for action are defined in advance.<br />
Arturo Escobar, Encountering Development, 1995<br />
“Development was not… same discursive space.”<br />
<br />
