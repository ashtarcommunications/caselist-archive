We’re dying for those Iranians to commit some terrorist attacks in Iraq or Afghanistan. People don’t take WMD’s seriously anymore, so we need to get terrorized to make the campaign against them legitimate. In short, we need them to hurt us, so we can hurt them to prevent them from hurting us.<br />

What we should worry about…...Cheney and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Accusing Iran of terrorism works particularly well because it taps into a powerful symbolic economy built around violence. We must crusade in response to an intolerably evil offense. The terrorists started this war, and now we shall finish it. Of course, the humans who become terrorists increasingly live up to the propaganda.<br />
<br />
These exchanges yield an unending cycle of meaningless and bloody violence, which paradoxically can only operate because it assigns deeply meaningful codes to particular acts. The ability to isolate an act of evil terrorism can be exchanged in the pain economy for limitless justified killings of the terrorists.<br />
<br />
Alain Badiou, former chair of philosophy @ ENS, ’03, Infinite Thought, trans. Oliver Feltham and Justin Clemens, pp. 145-163<br />
<br />
It must be said that today, at the end of its … resources, its tools and its knives.<br />
<br />
<br />
We are enmeshed in a politics founded on pain; in which our government welcomes death because it can use it for the production of additional useful killing. That is, it employs a seeming masochism because of underlying sadistic motives. How best to resist the sadistic torture and killing?<br />
<br />
We propose the following masochistic contract:<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should, in exchange for Iran’s acceptance of the “terrorist” label, provide a security guarantee to the government of Iran that it will not retaliate against Iranian-backed terrorism.<br />
<br />
That is, we’ll let Iran hurt the US as they adopt the role it fetishizes. In Sacher-Masoch’s Venus in furs, Severin finds a similar escape in fantasies of pain:<br />
<br />
“Finally, I fell asleep and dreamed that in a fit of jealous rage I had killed Wanda, and was sentenced to death. I saw myself on the scaffold; I felt the blade fall, but I was still alive; then the executioner slapped me in the face. But it was no executioner, it was Wanda who stood before me in a fury, demanding her furs..”<br />
<br />
(Venus in Furs, in Masochism, 228)<br />
<br />
Recoding terror as potentially desirable shatters the system through which terrorist attacks must be avenged through war. The current closed-minded and hegemonic response to violence offers no choices: it dictates a response to terrorism that attempts to seal off self from other and accepts any regime that asserts itself as necessary to prevent more evil. The open-minded response interrogates the meaning of the violence itself. Once we embrace the pain of discipline, we no longer have to submit to it.<br />
<br />
John K. Noyes, Prof. of German @ UToronto, 1997, The Mastery of Submission, pp. 8-12, 219-220<br />
<br />
This does not mean returning to the …quality of discipline into pleasure.<br />
<br />
<br />
The masochist contract marks the entry into a fantastic situation, outside the normal rules of society, in which technologies and discourses of power are subverted and eroticized. The plan’s contract doesn’t just represent an agreement between the US and Iran—it also generates a relationship between judge and the debate, in which you agree to indulge the political fantasy.<br />
<br />
Perverting grand political narratives with our terrorist theatre allows you to step outside history itself…to break the otherwise inevitable cycle of violent cause and effect. All you have to do is take the tools of power and start using them nefariously.<br />
<br />
Peter Cosgrove, assoc. prof. English @ Dartmouth, ’99, English Literary History 66.2, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu.ezp1.harvard.edu/journals/elh/v066/66.2cosgrove.html" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu.ezp1.harvard.edu/journals/elh/v066/66.2cosgrove.html</a><br />
<br />
The image-making faculty, then, … incompatible subject positions in a parody of suturing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Masochism opens access to a new form of time: Aion instead of Chronos. Whereas Chronos describes a linear form of time privileging direct chains of causality and action from moment to moment, Aion means engagement with transhistorical repetitions that shape the world more deeply.<br />
<br />
You have a choice between sadistic and masochistic thinking. The sadistic thinker demands immediacy, quantity, objectivity, turning from victim to victim without consideration for any larger patterns or meaning. The masochist, in suspended anticipation of punishment, sees at the world in a grain of sand and lives eternity in an hour. This deeper reflection underpins true politics.<br />

<ol><li>Rpahael Patai writs in <em>The Arab Mind</em> that “the Segregation of the sexes, the veiling of the women…and all the other minute rules that govern and restrict contact between men and women, have the effect of making sex a prime mental preoccupation in the Arab world.”</li></ol><br />
<ol><li>The Arab Mind has become the bible of the neocons on Arab behavior, teaching “one, that Arabs only understand force and, two, that the biggest weakness of Arabs is shame and humiliation. Torture and humiliation in the Abu Grahib prison become an obvious tactic.</li></ol><br />
<ol><li>The Iranian publisher of “Clash of Civilization” supplies 1,000 copies to the IRGC. One goes to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</li></ol><br />
2007. The mainstream media and governments continually beat the drums of war between US and Iran. The rhetorical frame of the clash of civilizations and the threat to Israel dominate the discourse on both sides.<br />
Obviously there’s no straight causal line from racist discourse within academia to racist violence in practice, but equally obvious is the close connection between the two. Again and again, we see orientalist scholarship returning in the political to justify atrocities.<br />
We can see, even more directly, how the mass media have badly mistranslated Ahmadinejad in order to make him scary<br />
Steele ‘06<br />
“Lost in translation”, the Guardian, 6/14<br />
“My recent comment piece explaining…the reason for no”<br />
This has been the basis for thousands of editorials and think tank reports demonizing Iran. Said Bush,<br />
“the threat from Iran is…our ally, Israel”<br />
<br />
The failings of American Middle East scholarship aren’t just curiosities whose history its interesting to trace. They are inextricably part of an approach to Iran that dovetails with violent otherization and intervention<br />
Hurd ‘04<br />
“The international politics of secularism: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Islamic Republic of Iran”, Alternatives<br />
“To understand U.S. foreign policy…secularism itself”<br />
With this historical context, many of America’s tropes for understanding Middle Eastern countries make sense. They <em>would</em> have sexual vulnerabilities, they <em>would</em> initiate a clash of civilizations, they <em>would</em> unreasonably try to wipe other countries off the map<br />
The U.S. continually threatens to change the regime in Iran, based on false claims about Iran’s intentions to change a different regime. That legitimates a policy of violent Iranian regime change is the presumptive identification of the Israeli-US alliance with world peace and the right values.<br />
AS part of this process, we must become epistemological terrorists, challenging the media’s pre-packaged narratives at every turn. We must imagine that the world might now always work like America wants it so<br />
