Clarity advantage<br />
-lower courts scenario<br />
Current commerce clause jurisprudence is in utter confusion—plan is key to send a clear signal (Fordham Law Review, on wiki)<br />
Massive confusion leads to a flood of new cases, clogging lower and state courts (Morgan 06, on wiki under another tag)<br />
This decimates legitimacy and the rule of law (Evan Caminker, dean of Michigan Law, April 94, 46 STn. L. Rev. 817, l/n) “Respect for judicial authority. . . . we live under the rule of law”<br />
Collapse of judiciary leds to nuclear war (Charles S. Rhyne, 5/1/58, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/lawday/rhyne58.html" rel="nofollow">__www.abanet.org/publiced/lawday /rhyne58.html__</a>)<br />
Effective lower court suits are key to the environment (Christopher S. Elmendorf, april 2001, 110 Yale L. J. 1003, l/n) “I use the example of EPCRA. . . . beneficiaries of state-court citizen suits)<br />

The failure to develop an international system to hedge against the possibility of worldwide depression- will open their eyes to their folly. Hundreds of millions-<u>billions</u>-of people around the world <u>have pinned their hopes on the international</u> market <u>economy</u>. They and their leaders have embraced market principles-and drawn closer to the West-because they believe that our system can work for them. But what if it can't? What <u>if the global economy</u> stagnates, or even <u>shrinks</u>? In that case<u>, we will face</u> a new period of <u>international conflict</u>: South against North, rich against poor. <u>Russia</u><u>. China. India</u>-these countries <u>with</u> their <u>billions of people and</u> their <u>nuclear weapons will pose a</u> much greater <u>danger to world order</u> than Germany and Japan did in the 1930's.<br />

Under the third option, the United States would seek to retain global leadership and to preclude the rise of a global rival or a return to multipolarity for the indefinite future. On balance, this is the best long-term guiding principle and vision. Such a vision is desirable not as an end in itself, but because <u>a world in which the United States</u> <u>exercises leadership would</u> have tremendous advantages. First, the global environment would be more open and more receptive to American values -- democracy, free markets, and the rule of law. Second, such a world would <u>have a better chance of dealing cooperatively with</u> the world’s <u>major problems, such as nuclear proliferation</u>, threats of regional hegemony by <u>renegade states, and</u> low-level conflicts. Finally, <u>U.S. leadership would</u> help <u>preclude the rise of another hostile global rival, enabling</u> the United States and <u>the world to avoid</u> another global cold or hot war and all the attendant dangers, including <u>a global nuclear exchange.</u> U.S. leadership would therefore be more conducive to global stability than a bipolar or a multipolar balance of power system.<br />
