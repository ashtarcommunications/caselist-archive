Lebanon receives $75 million US grant to pay off World Bank <br />
<br />
BEIRUT: Lebanon received on Friday a $75 million grant from the United States as part of a $250 million cash transfer, which itself is a part of a $300 million pledge to help the Lebanese government tackle its massive public debt and implement reforms. Under the watchful eyes of US Ambassador Jeffrey Feltman, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm/cid1001010" rel="nofollow">**USAID**</a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm/cid1001010" rel="nofollow">**USAID**</a>                 mission director Raouf Youssef signed the loan agreement with Finance Minister Jihad Azour at the Grand Serail. Under the agreement, the US government will provide the funds to the government of Lebanon, enabling Lebanon to reduce its external debts and pursue economic reforms. These are outlined as the government of Lebanon's priorities at the friends of Lebanon Conference in Paris on January 25, 2007. Azour told reporters the $75 million grant will be used to pay off a loan to the <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm/cid1002325" rel="nofollow">**World Bank**</a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.zawya.com/cm/profile.cfm/cid1002325" rel="nofollow">**World Bank**</a>  . &quot;The first batch of the money has been executed today based on a set of reform measures that were implemented earlier,&quot; Azour said. Responding to a question, the minister said the $75 million will be used directly to extinguish part of the public debt and will not be used for spending puropses. He added that the government is determined to maintain economic and monetary stability and implement all reforms that were agreed during Paris III conference. The US Embassy said that the agreement is a result of the long-term partnership between the United States and Lebanon, adding that it embodies the United States' commitment to assisting Lebanon achieves stability and prosperity. <br />

FINANCE: U.S. Brokers Afghan Debt Cancellation<br />
<br />
The United States, Germany and Russia have agreed to write off one billion dollars in bilateral debts owed by Afghanistan, or 92 percent of the poor nation's debt to the three nations.  The move comes only a week after the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Kabul has followed their economic advice and now qualifies for more debt forgiveness.  The United States, which considers Afghanistan a central front on the so-called &quot;war on terror&quot;, said it played a major role in bringing about both deals.  After the attacks on the Pentagon and New York's World Trade Centre, the administration of Pres. George W. Bush forged a national security strategy that united diplomacy, defence and development, in which aid was officially tied to the self-styled war on terror.  The agreement with the United States, Russia and Germany is under the terms of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, an international plan by rich lenders that benefits the world's poorest nations.  HIPC was devised by such multilateral lenders as the World Bank and IMF to reduce the external debt of the world's poorest nations, which have been ensnared by decades of foreign debts.  After announcing the deal with Afghanistan, Washington urged other members of the Paris Club, a cartel of bilateral creditors from rich nations, to follow suit. Washington was also instrumental in winning a similar debt write-off plan for Iraq in 2005.  Last week, the executive boards of the World Bank and IMF, at the urging of the U.S., said Afghanistan had formally qualified for the HIPC initiative.  To achieve this, the U.S.-backed Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai had to adhere to the terms of its IMF programme as well as meet certain other economic requirements.  <br />

President Bush said the United States expects Syrian troops and intelligence services to be “completely out” of Lebanon before that country’s parliamentary elections. He added that the international community will want to help Lebanon build its economy and democracy following the end of occupation. Speaking to the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation April 18, Bush said he is pleased that Syrian troops are beginning to leave Lebanon. The president said the United States expects Syria “to be completely out” to allow the Lebanese people to vote in free parliamentary elections. Bush said the elections should be held “as scheduled” before the end of May, and “need to be free and fair, without interference.” He added that he hopes international election monitors will be used to help the Lebanese people “feel comfortable about going out and voting and expressing their opinion.” The president said the United States and Europe want to work closely with international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank “to help this country get back on its feet after occupation; help this new democracy succeed.” Bush added, “there will be plenty of help” and that people “no matter what their politics may be, really want Lebanon to succeed.” The president said many Lebanese Americans have been calling upon him to work for a free Lebanon, and added, “If the spirit of those Lebanese Americans is strong here, imagine what the spirit will be of their relatives and friends in Beirut.” <br />

Besides the ongoing Israeli occupation, the top concern of most Lebanese is the state of the economy. Here, too, there are apprehensions about the U.S. role and its economic agenda. In 1998, Washington—in league with Microsoft—pressured the Lebanese government to pass a special copyright law to protect U.S. products, ensuring that such technologies remain beyond the reach of most Lebanese, who have become accustomed to purchasing affordable, albeit pirated, products. In this regard, serious misgivings are being expressed about globalization and its impact on Lebanon and other developing countries. The World Trade Organization, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are now symbols of resented U.S. global hegemony. U.S. economic and trade policies in the region seem to reward client regimes regardless of their human rights violations, and the policies of the World Bank and the IMF are increasingly geared toward privatization and the reduction of the public sector, which is often the largest employer within a country. Conditions imposed by the IMF and the World Bank often lead to substantial reduction in government expenditures on health and education, while military expenditure is allowed to grow. Thus, the U.S. version of globalization is scaring, not reassuring, many Lebanese.<br />

<br />
Economically, the United States should revise its foreign aid priorities. In contrast to the Canadian government, which determines its foreign aid policy purely on the basis of need, Washington continues to apply reward-and-punish standards, often to the detriment of Lebanon's economic development. By contrast, Israel, one of the world’s wealthier countries, is still the largest recipient of U.S. aid. Foreign aid based on need, rather than politics, would go a long way toward addressing the deep problems of poverty, underdevelopment, and hunger. The U.S. also needs to encourage the World Bank and the IMF to reverse their policies and start supporting initiatives that facilitate wider public access to food, education, and health. Finally, U.S. aid to the region should shift away from military hardware to support for sustainable development. Until now, Lebanon has been on the receiving end of too little American economic assistance and too many American weapons. Unfortunately, the end of the cold war has seemingly only hardened American unilateralism toward Lebanon and the Middle East. Unless there is change, most Lebanese—like many others throughout the world—can only look forward to an aggressive and often violent imposition of American economic and political will.<br />

<br />
Since the start of operations, the policies of the World Bank were determined by the context of the Cold war and US interests in this regard. <strong>The president of the World Bank has always been a US citizen proposed by the US government</strong> Since its origin and up to the present time, the president of the World Bank has been a US citizen proposed by its government. The members of the Board of Governors simply ratify the candidate presented by the US. This privilege does not figure in the statutes of the Bank. Although the statutes allows it, no governor has ventured up to now - or at any rate, publicly |<a name="nh17"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2194#nb17#nb17" rel="nofollow">17 </a> | - to propose a candidate of another country or even an American candidate other than the one selected by the government. |<a name="nh18"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2194#nb18#nb18" rel="nofollow">18 </a> | <strong>The United States’ right of veto at the World Bank</strong> From its beginnings till today, the US is the only country to have a <em>de facto</em> right of veto at the World Bank. With the creation of the Bank, the US had 35.07% of the voting rights |<a name="nh19"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2194#nb19#nb19" rel="nofollow">19 </a> |; since the last modification of voting rights, made in 2002, they enjoy 16.41%. Since its origin in 1947 (the year the Bank went into operation), the majority required to modify the statutes was 80% (held by at least 60% of the member countries), which in fact gave the US a right of veto. The wave of newly independent countries in the South increased the number of member nations of the World Bank Group, gradually diluting the weight of the US vote. However, the US took care to preserve its right of veto: in 1966, it had only 25.50% of voting rights but this percentage was still sufficient for the purpose. When in 1987 the situation was no longer tenable for the US, the definition of the qualified majority was modified in its favour. In fact, that year, Japan |<a name="nh20"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2194#nb20#nb20" rel="nofollow">20 </a> | negotiated a significant increase in its voting rights with the US, placing it as the second most important country ahead of Germany and Great Britain. In order to concede this increase to their Japanese allies, the US accepted a reduction of its voting rights provided that the required majority was raised to 85%. In this manner it gave full satisfaction to Japan while maintaining its right of veto. According to Catherine Gwin, <em>“The United States is also the dominant member of the Bank’s board - but only in part it is lead shareholder. Formally, most Bank decisions, including those affecting lending levels and loan allocations, require a simple majority vote of the board.”</em> Which means that that the US could be made a minority. But the author continues: <em>“Decisions are, however, often worked out between the United States and Bank management before they ever get to the board, or among members of the board before they get to a vote. And most board decisions are taken by consensus. It is the weight of its voice, therefore, more than the exercise of its vote that gives the United States effective power on the board.”</em> |<a name="nh21"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cadtm.org/article.php3?id_article=2194#nb21#nb21" rel="nofollow">21 </a> |  <br />

<br />
The campaign for debt cancellation has broad implications for people in the Middle East. It challenges the global role of the IMF and the World Bank and enhances the prospects for opposition to the economic model being promoted and imposed throughout the developing world by the IMF and US Treasury on behalf of Wall Street and multinational corporations. If debt campaigners succeed in forcing the IMF and the World Bank to cancel debt from their own resources, it will affect future relations between the US-run IMF and other countries. It is precisely for this reason that the IMF, the World Bank and the US Treasury vigorously oppose the movement to cancel debts, which everyone knows are unpayable, because they correctly perceive cancellation as a threat to their ability to impose their agenda on developing countries. From the point of view of the IMF and US Treasury, debt cancellation would set a &quot;dangerous precedent&quot;: Like Cold War dominoes, all developing countries might demand more freedom and a better deal.<br />

Millions of poor people face early death unless the world’s richest nations write off all the unpayable debts in developing countries. This warning comes today from campaigners who reveal that at least 62 states – not just the 27 heavily-indebted poor countries so far earmarked for debt help – need total debt cancellation to lift people out of poverty. And debt write-off must provide new money, says the Jubilee Debt Campaign and member organisations ActionAid UK and Christian Aid. The three organisations make the warning in a new report to mark World Debt Day on Monday (16 May), when activists will demand the write-off of all debt in events around the globe. The report, In the Balance, cites the 30,000 children who die each day from poverty through hunger, lack of clean water and disease which debt cancellation could help prevent. It says Britain, whose chancellor Gordon Brown is pushing other wealthy nations to agree a deal on debt relief, must cancel debt stocks, not just provide debt service relief until 2015. Stephen Rand, co-chair of the Jubilee Debt Campaign, said: “The UK government says it is pushing for 100 per cent debt relief. Yet, by committing only to cover debt service until 2015, ministers offer more like 30 per cent debt relief. Britain must use the G8 summit to go much further.” ActionAid UK policy officer Romilly Greenhill, co-author of In the Balance, said: “Our report shows that the current debt relief proposals on the table are grossly inadequate, compared to the scale of need. At least 62 countries will need total debt cancellation if they are to avert the deaths of thousands of children every day. “ The coalition makes its plea exactly seven years after the Jubilee 2000 human chain at the G8 summit of the world’s richest nations in Birmingham and seven weeks before the G8 talks at Gleaneagles in July. Reports suggest that in the weeks ahead UK prime minister Tony Blair will use his close relationship with president George Bush to persuade the US to support Britain’s plans for development at the G8 in Scotland. The IMF spring meeting last month in Washington ended in US refusal to back Mr Brown’s move for the IMF to finance debt cancellation from gold sales by the fund. Mr Blair is said to believe he can secure agreement at the summit to write off the debts owed by the world’s poorest countries to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the African Development Bank. <br />

<u>The deadliest form of violence is poverty</u>. -- Ghandi<br />
<br />
It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as shown by the thousands of cases of social and communal violence that occurs daily in the nation. Every year, some 20,000 people are killed by others, and additional 20,000 folks kill themselves. Add to this the nonlethal violence that Americans daily inflict on each other, and we begin to see the tracings of a nation immersed in a fever of violence. But, as remarkable, and harrowing as this level and degree of <u>violence is</u>, it is, by far<u>, not the most violent feature of living in the midst of the American empire</u>. <u>We</u> live, equally immersed, and to a deeper degree, in a nation that <u>condones and ignores wide-ranging &quot;structural&quot; violence</u>, of a kind that destroys human life with a breathtaking ruthlessness. Former Massachusetts prison official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; &quot;By `structural violence' I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and that structure is itself a product of society's collective human choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting `structural' with `behavioral violence' by which I mean the non-natural deaths and injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide, suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on.&quot; -- (Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) <u>This form of violence</u>, not covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected media, <u>is invisible to us and because of its invisibility, all the more insidious</u>. How dangerous is it -- really? Gilligan notes: &quot;<u>[E]very fifteen years, on the average, as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths</u>; and every single year, two to three times as many people die from poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the Jews over a six-year period. <u>This is, in effect, the equivalent of an ongoing, unending, in fact accelerating, thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every decade, throughout the world</u>.&quot; [Gilligan, p. 196] Worse still, in a thoroughly capitalist society, much of that violence became internalized, turned back on the Self, because, in a society based on the priority of wealth, those who own nothing are taught to loathe themselves, as if something is inherently wrong with themselves, instead of the social order that promotes this self-loathing. This intense self-hatred was often manifested in familial violence as when the husband beats the wife, the wife smacks the son, and the kids fight each other. This vicious, circular, and invisible violence, unacknowledged by the corporate media, uncriticized in substandard educational systems, and un-understood by the very folks who suffer in its grips, feeds on the spectacular and more common forms of violence that the system makes damn sure -- that we can recognize and must react to it. This fatal and systematic violence may be called The War on the Poor. <br />

<br />
The fiasco of the Paris 3 aid commitments<br />
<br />
Into this scenario one has to add that the aid (almost US$8bn) promised to the Siniora government by the Western powers and many Arab countries during January's Paris summit not only never came but is in fact generating debt. Treasury minister Jihad Azour has had to recognize that the bogged-down political situation is going to cost Lebanon a billion dollars since the neo-liberal economic measures promised in order to get that aid cannot be implemented. Parliamentary assent is required for that to happen and the opposition is clear that there will be no parliamentary quorum so long as elections are not called or else until a national unity government is installed. One must not forget that Saudi Arabia has big financial interests in Lebanon that cannot proceed so long as the current parliamentary boycott persists.<br />
<br />
On May 10th, the Siniora government signed an agreement to oversee Lebanon's State sector spending with the IMF, heavily criticised by Hizbollah, Amal and the Free Patriotic Movement (the biggest Christian organization composed mainly of that religion's middle and lower-middle classes). The instability helps prop up Siniora, hands arguments to those forces pulling the strings from the outside and to some extent confounds the opposition albeit indirectly since in supporting the Lebanese army they are obliged to align themselves to a degree with the government. That is something Siniora's pro-Western, neoliberal administration actively sought since several criticisms have been heard internally of what is considered &quot;complicity with the opposition&quot; by a section of the army, which is mostly made up of Shia.<br />

For Hezbollah, the present political confrontation is absolutely vital. The party has been the target of Israel's attempt to destroy it. The attempt failed, but the project has not been discarded. Washington took over from Israel and is trying to continue the war by other means. It pressed for UN security council resolution 1701, through which it got NATO forces to deploy in southern Lebanon as standby forces to be used in case of domestic confrontation in the country; that is, in order to give a helping hand to Washington's partners. Since then, Washington has been constantly and actively pushing toward civil war in Lebanon. Actually, if one had to summarize Washington's policy toward Lebanon as well as toward Palestine, it could be accurately described as &quot;incitement to civil war&quot;: civil war between Palestinians and civil war between Lebanese, not to mention the unfolding civil war in Iraq. In both Lebanon and Palestine, there is a force that Washington sees as a major enemy -- Hamas among Palestinians, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Behind these two forces, Washington targets Iran (Syria, too, but Iran is Washington's main concern). And in both countries there are partners of Washington: the &quot;majority&quot; and the Siniora government in Lebanon, Fatah and Mahmoud Abbas in Palestine.<br />

<br />
The United States' secret war against Hizbollah Time, an implacable judge, has ended up vindicating people who have been right all along despite the campaigns of the Western mass media. No one can dispute that Hizbollah's victory over Israel is perhaps the most striking event so far in the 21st century, given that it put an end to one of the myths of the 20th Centruy, the invincibility of Israel. It is what Middle East experts are beginning to call the &quot;Hizbollah effect&quot; and it has overturned neocolonial designs in this part of the world. That is why from almost the very moment it acknowledged Israel's defeat the United States has set in motion a secret war against the Lebanese political-military movement. Various newspapers (the UK Guardian, the Lebanese Daily Star and the US New Yorker for example) have published since January this year news or reports on that issue. In March the journalist Seymour Hersh said that the US Vice-President Dick Cheney, National Security Council adviser Elliot Abrams and Prince Bandar bin Sultan, himself his country's Security Minister, had agreed to fund Fatah al Islam &quot;as a counterweight to Hizbollah&quot;. On April 12th, the Daily Star noted that the United States had earmarked US$60m to reinforce Interior Ministry forces and Sunni organizations identified by the paper as &quot;jihadists&quot;, without specifically mentioning any of them. Some days later Asia Times gave ample coverage along the same lines, &quot;Iraq has arrived in Lebanon. Hundred of jihadists spread among more than 400,000 Palestinians who live in the refugee camps are joining Ansar al Islam or Fatah al Islam clearly following plans of Al Qaeda and with combat experience acquired on the Iraqi battlefield fighting the US occupation.&quot;(6) And Hizbollah itself, via its Al Manar television station confirms the thesis, alleging that the presence of jihadists in Lebanon is part of a US, Israeli and Saudi strategy seeking a regional war between Sunni and Shia which would see the partition of Iraq followed by the partition of Syria and Lebanon. (7) The US plan is being implemented by Fouad Siniora's government which has not hesitated for a moment to accuse Syria of protecting and arming Fatah al Islam. With this episode, on the one hand strong tensions are built up with the aim of softening the positions of countries critical of US, French and British efforts to secure a new UN Sceurity Council resolution to extend UNIFIL's mission, to control the Syrian frontier under the pretext of arms smuggling and to justify a kind of international tutelage of Lebanon. The new French President Nicolas Sarkozy will have his first test to see if he maintains the policy of his predecessor Jacques Chirac who has received favours and money from Saad Hariri and who in return supported him unconditionally following his father's assassination. On the other hand, the Lebanese army is being tried out in a role it has not been involved in since the Taif peace agreement, until now : internal repression. What is being seen is the possibility of a future confrontation between the Lebanese army and Hizbollah, which explains why the political military movement has from the outset supported the army. In a somewhat complex statement, Hizbollah has condemned the attacks of Fatah al Islam against the Lebanese army at the same time as it has criticised the government (&quot;we feel there is someone who wants to drag the army into confrontation and bloody fighting to serve well-known projects and objectives&quot;) and asked for a political solution to the crisis to avoid more suffering for the already hard-hit Palestinian population of the camps. (8) Hassan Nasrallah, Hizbollah's Secretary General has been more explicit, saying &quot; the problem in the north can be solved politically and judicially in a way that protects the Lebanese army, our Palestinian brothers, a state of stability and peace wihtout turning Lebanon into a battlefield on which we fight Al Qaeda on the Americans' behalf&quot;. Nasrallah went even further and categorically said that what imperialism wants is a conflict between Al Qaeda and Hizbollah and &quot;is bringing Al Qaeda fighters from all over the world to Lebanon&quot; to that end. (9) Nasrallah also said, in a warning to the Siniora government and the forces that support it that &quot;the Lebanese army is the guardian of national security, stability and unity&quot;, for which it is respected as the &quot;only institution&quot; able to preserve those things and that an attack on the army is the &quot;red line&quot; whose transgression that Hizbollah will not tolerate by anyone. Furthermore he put his finger on the sore point by affirming that military aid provided by the United States is dangerous and asks the Siniora government &quot;where were these arms when Israel bombed your vehicles and your positions? It is something one has to ask the Lebanese, Palestinian and Arab peoples.&quot; Nasrallah has repeatedly accused the Bush administration of unleashing a &quot;fitna&quot; or &quot;fragmentation within Islam&quot; referring to tensions and confrontations between Sunnis and Shia. But there is more. NATO has in mind building a military base in Qleiat very close to Tripoli - where the Nahr el Bared camp is sited - and to the northern frontier with Syria. It will accommodate a helicopter squadron, special forces units and will train the Lebanese Army and police. (10) The area will already have been visited in mid-April by a team of US, German and Turkish military looking for the ideal location. The US and its European and Arab allies are doing all they can to avoid the collapse of the Siniora government because that would be seen by the Arab peoples as an unequivocal sign of US decline in the Middle East. For that reason every change in the current correlation of forces in Lebanon (where the Shia population is under-represented in the government despite forming 40% of the coutnry's population) needs to be blocked, which in turn explains Siniora's resistance to the opposition forces' democratic proposals : either a government of national unity or a bringing forward of elections.<br />

Sheikh Qassim, who was interviewed last week from a safe house in southern Lebanon, also charged that the U.S. had thwarted attempts by the Lebanese government and the Hezbollah-led opposition to reach a compromise over a months-old political crisis triggered by the government’s failure to form a unity coalition. “We think that if <strong>it wasn’t for the U.S. interference</strong>, we would have resolved the issue of participating in the government a long time ago,” he said. “America is forcing the government forces to prolong this crisis; because they want a price for it. They want to tie Lebanon into negotiations that benefit Israel and their plan <strong>for a new Middle East</strong>.”  <br />

As the war between Israel and Lebanon escalates, growing regional and world outrage may increasingly be channeled toward the United States -- the only country that has influence over Tel Aviv. This may encourage the world's three largest oil producers, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, to reduce oil exports significantly in order to increase pressure on Washington to rein in Israel's military actions. An oil export embargo undertaken by just Russia and Iran, which together account for 20 percent of the world's oil exports, would be much more effective at extracting a major policy change from the Bush administration than Syrian and Iranian missile strikes against Israel. Economic data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on July 28 showed that economic growth in the United States is weakening. Because excess oil production capacity does not exist anywhere in the world, a coordinated reduction of just five percent of oil exports between any or all of the world's largest oil exporters would quickly send international oil prices toward $125 per barrel. An increase in oil prices of this magnitude could be expected to push the United States economy into recession. With the November mid-term Congressional elections in the United States approaching rapidly, those countries opposing Israel's military actions may soon act to cut oil exports and effect political change in the United States, touching off a global recession in 2007.<br />

&quot;The thirties after all began three months after the inception of the Great Depression and ended four months after the start of World War II. This is not a coincidence. Tens of millions were killed and maimed in the Second World War. If another historical credit liquidation cycle is allowed to take place in the usual chaotic fashion the chances of another global armed conflict will be greatly increased--time not only would hundreds of millions (rather than tens of millions) be killed or wounded but the very hopes and the future of mankind, as such, might well be destroyed in the process. <br />

<strong>IT SEEMS that one way you could cut across the sectarian divide would be through political and union organizations that posed a non-sectarian alternative based on resisting these neoliberal policies.</strong> <br />
<br />
THAT'S EXACTLY the point. You've got people trying to do that, fortunately. That's what the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) is trying to do. The LCP did not participate in the sit-in of the opposition since it started in downtown Beirut last December. They stood out of it, stating that they don't share the opposition's views, which are aimed at cutting a deal with the majority. The communists said, &quot;That's not our program, we don't think the way out in Lebanon will come through a deal between sectarian leaderships. What we are ready to fight for together with the opposition are democratic demands -- a new electoral law, new elections. But we don't want to be involved in a fight for a deal between sectarian forces that would end up forming a joint government.&quot; And then, when it came to opposition to Paris III, the LCP refused to participate in the day of demonstration called by the union confederation and supported by the opposition because, they said, it was not credible. They decided to organize their own demonstration, but the deterioration of the situation obliged them to cancel it. <strong>THE SECTARIAN clashes in Beirut?</strong> YES, INDEED. So the Lebanese Communist Party is trying to stand outside the two camps and constitute a third force on the basis of a left-wing program. They've been doing so from the beginning of the period that started after the assassination of Rafik Hariri in 2005, when you had the two demonstrations in March, one by Hezbollah and the other by what is now called the &quot;majority,&quot; or the &quot;March 14 coalition.&quot; The LCP did not take part in either of the two demonstrations, and called for a third one on another day -- with a few thousand marchers. It was not much compared to the huge half-million demonstrations that you had from the two major camps. But, still, it was not completely negligible to have a few thousand people demonstrating with red flags and slogans devoid of any sectarian character -- progressive slogans. In the recent war, the Lebanese CP did not stay neutral, of course. It took part in the mobilization and fighting against the Israeli aggression, in alliance with Hezbollah -- an alliance without subordination, as the CP's general secretary put it. It was an alliance from an independent position against Israel, but not an alliance around the goal of forming a joint venture of sectarian forces for a new government; the latter is not the CP's program.
