Louisville PR:<br />
My name is Aaron Price and I am Ebony Rose's partner for the upcoming tournament. I am not sure what information you need from me but we run pretty much the same affirmative that Rosie Washington and I ran (Milliken w/ Chemerinsky Deseg Plan) from the casebook with the addition of a David Hall card about invisibility (I am searching for the cite but am at school right now and don't have it on me)<br />
<br />
We believe that debate should embrace the points of the MPOWER 10-pt program and will talk about the program during the debate round. Ummmm, like I said I'm not really sure what you are looking for so just let me know - I'll help however I can.<br />
<br />
David Hall's SYMPOSIUM ARTICLE: BLACK CHILDREN AND THE AMERICAN DILEMMA: THE INVISIBLE TEARS OF INVISIBLE CHILDREN - it can be found on lexis nexis in the Boston Third World Law Journal, Winter 2005.<br />
<br />
Ummm, the most accurate case listing for us would be from Miami or West Georgia - the arguments we made in those debates are similar to how we draw distinctions. Ethos is the credibility of the speaker - but Ethos, Pathos, and Logos are just a small part of what we think debate should address/include. The Louisville 10-pt plan mentions many different things we believe about the debate community and, again, depending on how our opponents choose to debate us they could become very important in the round.<br />

We won on 'metaphorical' counterplan and disad. We can endorse the entirety of their advocacy, but we should implement the policy portion of their affirmative (which they defend?) through a constitutional amendment. The only solvency argument that emerged clearly as being impossible to implement through a constitutional amendment was in the 2AR and was the role of the ballot, i.e. voting for Louisville means allowing Louisville to bring the &quot;Louisville Judges&quot; into outrounds, which allows for the enfranchisement of women, especially black african american women.<br />

They read a Milliken aff, banning private schools. Played &quot;the sun will come out tommorow&quot; from Annie. Explained their 10 demands at the end.<br />
<br />
We read T, Scapegoating, Hollow Hope, Amendment, Case, and Framework.<br />
<br />
They read speed kritik (debate is collapsing because of too rigid and unwelcoming structures).<br />
<br />
We beat them on speed kritik is silly and framework.<br />

“We live in a world” “logos, ethos, and pathos”<br />
<br />
Ethos – credible to speak about school system<br />
Logos – abandon all schools besides public schools<br />
Pathos – emotional appeal to change segregation in schools<br />
Stylicality – judicious blending of pathos, ethos, logos = percussion<br />

1ac w/ cites<br />
We conted that there is a mixture of people, debate is a logos centered activity, debaters are ships passing the common person in the night. The compromise lies in persuasive argumentation, and equilibrium of ethos pathos and logos.<br />
<br />
Chapter one my ethos is my credibility.<br />
Talks about being black and beautiful, being black is important to society and civilization.<br />
African-American are suffering in school systems- replicates slavery, schools are bad, we have to look at the history of the legal system to challenge these things.<br />
<br />
Plan<br />
<br />
Chapter 2 is ethos<br />
There supreme court’s stance against racial remedies to address systemic discrimination is a form of racial discrimination serving only to benefit whites at the expense of minorities.<br />
Demand for race neutrality is nothing more than modern oppression.<br />
<br />
There is nothing noble about race neutrality.<br />

Chapter three is pathos.<br />
The debate community has to come back to earth and realize that we are not relating to the common man but are ignoring the disenfranchised, we need a reality check to propel us to act in their favor.<br />
<br />

We must be able to connect to the rest of the world after we leave debate. That is where policy decisions are really made, have to relate to common people.<br />

Chapter One: Ethos<br />
<br />
Who I am grants me the permission to speak against societal injustices that my black community faces. By being a black male in these days and time I am not only seen, but am also treated as a problem. A problem that our governmental officials feel they need to properly contain and control. I come from a reality where being caught <strong>dark</strong>, after dark meant that you were hustling, mugging, or thugging. Carrying a book-bag after school hours is enough of reason to get stopped walking home. I come from a reality where the police don’t protect or service the people, but only service their monthly quotas for that next promotion. Continuous oppression, marginalization, and disenfranchisement of my Black community attempted to hinder my progress of becoming a successful Blackman. But I made it. I made it through the drug game, through a broken community overcoming the crack plague, through the bullets, through the police and their fucked up policies. And since I made it through what some may call the “trap” I have the innate responsibility to protect my people from any further depredations caused and maintained by our governmental officials.<br />
<br />
Chapter 2: Logos (Quality over Quantity)<br />
<br />
Totay, “enemy combatants” is used to now oppress Blacks. Alton H. Maddox, activist and staff writer for the New York Amsterdam News, wrote:<br />
<br />
“Lynching is now occurring in courtrooms…racial profiling in federal court.”<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s failed to recognize that Blacks would become negatively and disproportionately affected by ex parte quirin. This can be solely attributed to their stance on race-neutrality.<br />
<br />
Our Position is that the refusal of the Supreme Court to provide racial remedies to societal discrimination is a direct form of institutional racism<br />
<br />
The Court has advanced a colorblind conception of racial equality that is hopelessly artificial in American Society and should be viewed as constitutionally suspect.<br />
<br />
This only serves to expose the Supreme Court’s complicity in Racial Discrimination<br />
Professor of Law @ Georgetown University’s Law Center, Girardeau Spann, writes in 2004 that<br />
<br />
“…The Supreme Court’s modern race cases rest on a misunderstanding of the nature…the Court’s own tradition of complicity in racial discrimination.”<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court’s stance against racial remedies to address systemic discrimination is a form of racial discrimination serving only ot benefit Whites at the expense of racial minorities<br />
<br />
The demand for a race neutrality is nothing more than the modern incarnation of historical racial oppression, reminiscent of the decision to uphold slavery and segregation<br />
<br />
Indeed there is nothing noble about contemporary race neutrality<br />
Spann again in 2004 writes that:<br />
<br />
“The United States has a long tradition of…that is called racial discrimination.”<br />
<br />
Ebony and I advocate that the Supreme Court should overrule Ex Parte Quirin, holding that there is a compelling state interest to expose institutional racism; by adopting race conscious perspective<br />
<br />
Chapter 3: Pathos<br />
<br />
<em>War</em><br />
<br />
<em>That until there are no longer first class</em><br />
<em>And second class citizens of any nation</em><br />
<em>Until the colour of a man’s skin</em><br />
<em>Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes</em><br />
<em>Me say war</em><br />
<br />
<em>That until the basic human rights are equally</em><br />
<em>Guaranteed to all, without regard to race</em><br />
<em>Dis a War</em><br />
<br />
<em>War in the east, war in the west</em><br />
<em>War up north, war down south</em><br />
<em>War, war, rumours of war</em><br />
<br />
Racism is war.. in order for war to cease we must acknowledge that we’re in war..in order for racism to cease we must acknowledge that racism still lingers..in schools, in our churches, in our homes, in our policies, and in various institutions at all levels…we can no longer ignore these issues of quality and justice that plagues us all. Who will stand up and become the voice of peace…who will sit no longer in silence and watch the continuous degradation of people…until then…a Bob Marley said… “Dis ah War!”<br />
<br />
Chapter 4: Stylicality<br />
<br />
It is our argument that debaters do not fully embrace Aristotle’s concept of persuasion – the use of ethos, pathos, and logos. We will defend that ethos, pathos, and logos is necessary for effective persuasion.<br />
Gary ORREN, Professor of Public Policy @ the Kennedy School @ Harvard University wrote in 2000<br />
<br />
“We live in a world of competing for our attention with a daily…blends the persuasive elements of logos, ethos, and pathos.”<br />
<br />
Given that debate attempts to educate the participants as well as the audience we believe that a persuasive model of debate would not only be more educational but would allow for broader participation and societal advantages. It is therefore, our contention that the current style used by most debaters to articulate their arguments actually undercuts the persuasiveness of those arguments. We hold that debaters should use Pathos, Ethos, and Logos to fully articulate a persuasive argument in contrast to the current logos-centered arguments delivered by most debaters.<br />
