<br />
Petitioner … Affirmed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, The Morrison decision devalues the impact of gender discrimination and thus perpetuates a system of gender-violence and domination.<br />
<br />
Johnson, frmr Editor-in-Chief of Santa Clara Law Review, 2003<br />
(Jennifer, PRIVILEGED JUSTICE UNDER LAW: REINFORCEMENT OF MALE PRIVILEGE BY THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT AND U.S. v. MORRISON, 43 Santa Clara L. Rev. 1399, LEXIS) JKW<br />
<br />
In… attitudes<br />
<br />
<br />
More specifically, the Court’s 14th Amendment rational is cloaked in the rhetoric of “privacy,” which historically relegates matters concerning women and the family to the private sphere and/or the states – out of the national public eye.<br />
Goldfarb, Profess of Law @ Rutgers Law, 2004<br />
(Sally F., Public rights for “private” wrongs: Sexual Harassment and the Violence Against Women Act, Directions in Sexual Harassment Law, C. MacKinnon &amp; R. Siegel (Eds), pp. 517-519) JKW<br />
<br />
Long…private.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the public-private dichotomy is rooted in the notion that women are property – legitimizing violent and terrorizing objectification tactics such as rape.<br />
<br />
Brennan, Professor, Univ. of St. Louis School of Social Service, 1995<br />
[William, Female Objects of Semantic Dehumanization and Violence, Feminism and nonviolence Studies. 1(3), <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.fnsa.org/v1n3/brennan.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fnsa.org/v1n3/brennan.html</a>] &lt;MOA&gt;<br />
<br />
The…women<br />
<br />
Additionally, History shows that rape terrorizes and robs women of their humanity – Gender equity is key.<br />

<br />
<br />
Dehumanization is the worst possible impact – it is process by which wars, genocide and human rights violations are justified.<br />
Maiese, Scholar at CU-Boulder, 2003<br />
(Maiese, Michelle. &quot;Dehumanization.&quot; Beyond Intractability. Eds. Guy Burgess and Heidi Burgess. Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, Boulder.

While…goals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the dehumanizing effect of patriarchy is uniquely harmful. Patriarchy imposes gender roles – making women powerless objects – this is the same logic that is used to justify racism, slavery, and militarism.<br />
Reardon, Coordinator of Peace Education Program, teachers College, Columbia Univ. 1985 [Betty Sexism and the War System p. MOA]<br />
<br />
The…system.<br />
<br />
Thus, We offer the following plan:<br />
The Supreme Court of the United States, using an appropriate test case, will overrule its decision in U.S. v. Morrison on the grounds that a the civil remedy of the VAWA of 1994 is sustained under the Commerce Clause and the 14th Amendment.<br />
You got questions, ask ‘em.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2: We think we’ve got a means by which to move in the right direction.<br />
<br />
The Court is uniquely suited to cause change – Supreme Court decisions issues like gender-motivated violence that can be further regulated.<br />
<br />
Gerhardt, Law Professor at William and Mary, 2005<br />
(William, 7 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 903, Lexis-Nexis Academic Universe) JKW<br />

Fourth…liability.<br />
<br />
Your states counter-plan won’t work -- The states acknowledge their failure to solve systematic discrimination in the area of gender-motivated violence and support federal civil remedies to combat violence against women.<br />

Advantage One – Soft Power<br />

Military commissions undermine the moral base for American leadership – this jeopardizes the ability for the US to win the war on terror by creating the perception of unfairness in American justice. Even if the DOD or the president have tried to rectify the tribunals’ procedural unfairness, these tinkers only ensure the perception of bias<br />

Observation Three - Solvency<br />

Refusing the legality of military commissions reaffirms impartial American support for fighting the war on terrorism by sending defendants to courts that are tried in true and capable of promoting universal justice – military commissions have zero chance of creating transparency and political circumstances prevent international tribunals from coming together<br />

Observation I – Unequal Schooling<br />
<br />
Segregation and urban flight is increasing at a rapid rate across the country – it occurred as a result of Miliken V Bradley, it is possible for us to reverse this trend<br />

Advantage 1- Science Literacy<br />
<br />
A) Robots are coming now, we must address the ideas of regulation<br />

<br />
With robots now….<br />
….. now, says Dr Christensen.<br />
B) Science and Technology aren’t inherently good nor bad, and when normal citizens with basic scientific knowledge enter the debates it ensures caution and good policies for using upcoming technology<br />

<br />
The criticism of science….<br />
….. have still not signed it<br />
<br />
C) Poor performing urban schools are forced to teach to tests – this prevents the study of science<br />

The United States Supreme Court should in Parents Involved in Community Schools v Seattle School District #1, et al overrule Milliken v.
