<strong>Oklahoma</strong> <strong>GW – NEG</strong>  <br />
<br />
Epistemological Hegemony – NEG argues that the 1AC fails to acknowledge how knowledge production is political. In the case of NU’s Corn AFF, the argument was that by promoting “sustainability,” the AFF perpetuates subservience to “expertism,” and only by politicizing knowledge production at the local level can the K solve. <br />
<br />
1AC assumes knowledge is neutral, ignoring the ways that knowledge production. Science is never neutral, and failure to recognize that ignores the biopolitics of the SQ. <br />

Vote NEG as a practice of criticizing both the universal elevation of corn and the affirmative’s acquiescence with expert knowledge – we’re a better form of democratizing epistemology by politicizing debate as a local site of knowledge production. <br />

Depeiction of the idyllic farmer, most efficient when left alone w/o government intervention, is a truth produced by neoliberal experts to assimilate local farmers at the margin.<br />
