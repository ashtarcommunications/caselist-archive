<br />
Therefore my partner and I stand Resolved: The United States Federal Government should eliminate at least nearly all domestic subsidies for biofuels.<br />
<br />
<br />
    1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
In order to avoid challenging corporate lobby groups and making hard political choices with regards to food and the environment, the United States Federal Government is pouring subsidies into the biofuel industry, snatching the food from the mouths of the global poor so we can put it into our cars.<br />
George Monbiot, visiting professor of planning at Oxford Brookes University. In 1995 Nelson Mandela presented him with a United Nations Global 500 Award for outstanding environmental achievement, 11-6-2007, “The western appetite for biofuels is causing starvation in the poor world” - <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/06/comment.biofuels" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/06/comment.biofuels</a><br />
&quot;It doesn't get madder than this. Swaziland is in the grip of a famine and receiving emergency food aid. &quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Food Prices<br />
<br />
Biofuels have introduced global structural shifts in food markets causing prices to rise and staple crops to be replaced by corn, sentencing billions of people to starvation<br />

Ford Runge, is a consultant and former senior vice president of corporate affairs at Cargill, and Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Applied Economics and Law and director of the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota, ethanol: train wreck ahead, 2007, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.issues.org/24.1/p_johnson.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.issues.org/24.1/p_johnson.html</a><br />

Despite what the USFG’s political propaganda says, the root cause of high food prices is biofuels. <br />

<br />
The people of the world are demanding the USFG eliminate their biofuel subsidies – the perception that it has caused food price spikes has made it a key flash point in global food diplomacy.<br />

&quot;Such heart-and-mind operations will require imaginative thinking and a willingness to discard the &quot;<br />
AND<br />
&quot;aid will be stolen or diverted and that compassion cannot be quantified?&quot;<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Environment<br />
<br />
The US’s current policy subsidizes the neocolonial corporate take-over of the Third World in order to expand biofuel production. Contrary to the lies of transnational agribusiness, biofuels are not a solution to the environmental crisis, but are in fact becoming the driving force behind soil erosion, monocultures, freshwater depletion, and deforestation.<br />
GRAIN, international non-governmental organisation (NGO) which promotes the sustainable management and use of agricultural biodiversity based on people's control over genetic resources and local knowledge, 7-2007, “Stop the agrofuel craze!” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.grain.org/seedling/?id=477" rel="nofollow">http://www.grain.org/seedling/?id=477</a><br />
&quot;To understand what is really going on, it is important – first and foremost – to emphasise that the agrofuels agenda is not &quot;<br />

    Answers to Off-case Arguments<br />
NEOLIB<br />
Flexible neoliberalism is key to address challenges – contextualizing decisions to use economic prudence strategically is comparatively better than outright rejection<br />
Patrick Emerson, Associate Professor of Economics at Oregon State University and Research Fellow at the IZA Institute for the Study of Labor, 8-20-08, “Economist’s Notebook: Is Neoliberalism Dead?”. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://oregonecon.blogspot.com/2008/08/economists-notebook-is-neoliberalism.html" rel="nofollow">http://oregonecon.blogspot.com/2008/08/economists-notebook-is-neoliberalism.html</a><br />
Now, however, with the impact of economic activity on the global climate coming under intense scrutiny, and <br />
But is also impossible to utilize the resources of a country to address these problems without first creating these resources. <br />

Neoliberal policies are key to form an integrated system where both social and economic harms are considered – the alternative is a split system where the critique’s impacts continue unnoticed<br />

Reich's main concern is not to describe the mechanics of either the old or the new system of production, but rather to explicate what might be called their intellectual and sociological underpinnings. <br />
And <br />

Moving away from pure-market neoliberalism allows anti-market forces to discredit the natural laws of capitalism and destroy humanity (gender paraphrased)<br />

Mises was, as we have seen, convinced that economics must be pursued dispassionately—as a wertfrei discipline—but he wrote with white-hot passion about the dangers that face mankind should it ignore the truths which academic science reveals. <br />

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The billions of dollars the government will invest in dozens of banks is providing little or no lift to those banks' shares.  <br />

CELLULOSIC DA<br />

No cellulosic plants exist in the squo<br />

It may be one of the biggest green gambles of the century: a national goal of converting wood, grass, corn stalks and garbage into 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuels annually by 2022.  No commercial-scale refineries exist, researchers have yet to agree on the best technology for fuel conversion and there is no distribution network to handle fuel once it is made.  <br />
And<br />
which include reducing reliance on foreign oil, shrinking greenhouse gas emissions and keeping basic transportation affordable. <br />

Cellulosic sparks massive global deforestation<br />

The industry claims that &quot;second-generation&quot; biofuels, using by-products such as corn stalks and woodchip as a feedstock, will be able to redress the balance. <br />
And<br />
There is no simple solution. Much of the increased biofuel demand comes from the US, where Democratic and Republican politicians alike have talked themselves into a dead-end search for &quot;energy security&quot; - with US-grown corn top of the list.<br />

Cellulosic links to food prices and uses CRP land<br />

Even cellulosic ethanol produced using waste products like wood chips and corn stalks, or fuel crops like switchgrass or hybrid poplars do not solve the food/fuel conundrum. <br />
And<br />
(CRP) to raise fuel crops. Switching land from the CRP to ethanol production will obviously effect wildlife, water usage, and soil erosion.<br />

Dr Rachel Smolker, researcher and campaigner with the Global Justice Ecology Project and the Global Forest Coalition, 2007, “The real cost of agrofuels: Current and Future Technologies for Agrofuels: Path to Deforestation, Climate Change and Loss of Livelihoods”<br />
The use of crop residues such as straw and corn stover for agrofuel production is often described as the most foolproof solution, requiring no additional land. <br />
And<br />
200 Clearly the use of agricultural wastes for agrofuels production would significantly increase this threat.<br />

One other problem with the rush to &quot;greener&quot; fuels is that, despite the biodiversity happy talk, wildlife is already prominent among biofuel victims. <br />
And <br />
And they have begun pulling land out of CRP and putting it back into production.
