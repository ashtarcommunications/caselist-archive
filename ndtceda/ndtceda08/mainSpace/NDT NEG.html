( _ ) Their rejection of identity politics makes displacing hegemonic forms of knowledge impossible.<br />

<u>Although identities are</u>, … <u>structures of oppression.</u> </span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">( _ ) Despite arguments otherwise, we can resist essentialism and still use identity to help map our social world. Identity constructions provide narratives that explain links between group historical memory and individual contemporary experience that help to develop a meaningful self. To deny this would confer a social death in which culture and heritage becomes erased.<br />

But the arguments themselves strain our credibility. <strong><u>….</u></strong> to make meaning in the first place.<br />
( _ ) their only answer seems to be a piece of spanos evidence they read in the 2ac where they say they don’t deny identity but that they allow for coalitional politics in which we can create a solidarity to take into account identities – this sort of coalitional politics simply lumps everyone together and fails to take into account any effective social change in their unique, individual struggles<br />

<strong>Their position of charity and false solidarity that takes place from a distance and above are precisely the sort of voyeuristic investments in suffering that not only make true solidarity impossible but also invest in the narratives of power at the root of the violence they describe.</strong><br />

<strong>The picture perfect world the 1AC longs for expresses hatred fo the only word we’ve got. The 1AC is only an of creative impotence – our relationship to life is the only way to escape resentiment</strong><br />

<strong>The plan’s failure to recognize the inevitability of suffering and impossibility of progress makes it futile. Even if the plan is good in the short-term, its effect on the world will only be brief and fleeting. Case Can’t solve.</strong><br />
<strong>Thus the alternative is to embrace suffering. This is the only way to break free from the psychological stranglehold suffering has on life and to affirm life as it is – for both its beauty and its tragedy. We need to take ownership of pain to gain the power to rise above it.</strong><br />
