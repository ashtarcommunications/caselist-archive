Contention 1 is Africa<br />
<br />
Despite rulings against upland cotton subsidies in the WTO, the 2008 farm bill continued to endorse trade distorting subsidies for the US cotton industry<br />
Oxfam International, 08 (US blocking on cotton, undermining trade talks, July 25, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2008-07-25/us-blocking-cotton-undermining-trade-talks" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2008-07-25/us-blocking-cotton-undermining-trade-talks</a>)<br />

WHAT’S MORE - Cotton subsidies have become a lightning rod for anti-Americanism, drastically increasing the risk for terrorism<br />
Chapman, 06 (Dan, investigative reporter, interviewed more than 200 farmers, economists, government officials and agricultural experts on three continents. Chapman flew to Brazil and Mali to assess the state of cotton farming overseas.

Rev. 1427<br />
<br />
Contention 2 is Trade<br />
<br />
FIRST – The WTO is on the brink of collapse. The continual breakdown of Doha negotiations and lack of judicial legitimacy threaten the relevance of the WTO.<br />
Blustein, 8-21 (Paul, Journalist in Residence, Global Economy and Development at The Brookings Institution, “Doha Trade Talks Collapse: What’s Next for Global Trade?,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0820_trade_blustein.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2008/0820_trade_blustein.aspx</a>)<br />
<br />
There are two internal links to global trade:<br />
<br />
First – the Doha Negotiations<br />
<br />
If the Doha round fails, the WTO as an institution won’t be far behind. Absent the stability provided by the WTO, protectionist trade wars will break out, threatening the viability of the global economy.<br />
Ikenson, 06 (Daniel, Trade Policy Analyst at Cato, “The WTO After Hong Kong - Where Do We Go From Here,” February 14 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/710" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/710</a>)<br />
<br />
BUT – despite the temporary setback at Geneva, there is still hope for the Doha. A renewed commitment from the US can finish the round before the end of the year.<br />
The Economist, 7-19 (“Defrosting Doha,” lexis)<br />
<br />
What’s more – the Geneva talks collapsed not because of SSM negotiations, but because the US refused to budge of cotton subsidies. The US engineered the collapse because it refused to let the cotton issue come to the table.<br />
Sharma, 08 (Devinder, food and trade policy analyst, “What Caused WTO Collapse? It Was Cotton Subsidies, Stupid?” Zmag, August 5, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.countercurrents.org/sharma050808.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
If left unresolved, the most recent cotton dispute at Geneva will end the Doha round forever.<br />
PK Vasudeva, trade professor @ Icfai Business School and author of five books on the WTO and related issues, 2008 (August 10, &quot;Doha round of WTO crucified&quot;, The Financial Times, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Doha-round-of-WTO-crucified/346793/3#" rel="nofollow">http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Doha-round-of-WTO-crucified/346793/3#</a>)<br />
<br />
What’s more – the cotton dispute is representative for the WTO as a whole. Unless it gets resolved, the entire WTO system will lose authority.<br />
Pfeifer, Alpert, and Kripke, 04 (Kimberly, Gawain, and Emily, policy analysts for Oxfam and Senior Policy Advisor on international trade issues with Oxfam America and policy analyst for Oxfam America, “Finding the Moral Fiber”, Oxfam Briefing Paper 69, October, p. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/briefing_papers/cotton_brief101804/cotton_brief101804.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
BUT – reaching an agreement on cotton would revive the talks:<br />
<br />
FIRST: spillover.<br />
<br />
it’s the most important impasse and would lay the groundwork for resolving all of the agricultural disputes.<br />
Pan et al 2007 (Suwen, Research Scientist, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Cotton Economics Research Institute, Texas Tech University, “Cotton in a Free Trade World”, Economic Inquiry Vol. 45 Iss. 1, January, ProQuest)<br />
SECOND – trade leadership.<br />
<br />
Cotton is the leading drain on US trade credibility. It must be resolved before the US can reasonably lead the Doha negotiations.<br />
Hall 08 (Joshua, Scott Beaulier, Profs at Beloit College Dept of Economics, Madeline Helling, Beloit College, Wisconsin, USA, and, “HIGH COTTON: WHY THE USA SHOULD NOT PROVIDE SUBSIDIES TO COTTON FARMERS,” Economic Affairs, Volume 28, Issue 2, Pages 65-66)<br />
<br />
What’s more – US trade leadership in the WTO is necessary to keep the world on a multilateral track. Absent US credibility within multilateral negotiations, bilateral and regional trade agreements are inevitable and will take down the whole system.<br />
Even if preferential agreements are inevitable – as long as the US can support the multilateral regime, they aren’t problematic.<br />
Tarullo, 07 (Daniel, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, “The Case for Reviving the Doha Trade Round,” Center for American Progress, January, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2007/01/pdf/doha.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Striking a deal on cotton would enable the US to regain its trade leadership. The world is waiting.<br />
James, 06 (Sallie, trade policy analyst at CATO, “Agriculture and the Doha round,” July 14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.freetrade.org/node/249" rel="nofollow">http://www.freetrade.org/node/249</a>)<br />
<br />
THIRD – enabling concessions.<br />
<br />
A US concession on cotton enable developing countries to make concessions on tariffs and NAMA. The plan ushers in new agreements in the Doha round.<br />
Bhagwati, 07 (Jagdish, Senior Fellow for International Economics, “Why the Trade Talks Collapsed,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/13730/why_the_trade_talks_collapsed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/13730/why_the_trade_talks_collapsed.html</a>)<br />
<br />
What’s more – a move of unilateral liberalization by the US would revive and fix the flawed WTO negotiating framework. It would propel negotiations forward.<br />

<br />
The SECOND INTERNAL LINK to global trade is COMPLIANCE.<br />
<br />
First – the upland cotton case renders the US out of compliance with WTO obligations<br />
Randy Schnepf, Specialist in Agricultural Policy Resources, Science and Industry Division, 2005 (July 11, &quot;Background on the U.S.-Brazil WTO Cotton Subsidy Dispute&quot;, CRS Report for Congress, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/57876.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Failure to comply with the cotton case threatens the judicial legitimacy of the WTO as a whole.<br />
BENICCHIO, 05 (Romain, economist and a political adviser on trade for Oxfam International, based<br />
in Geneva, Switzerland. “The WTO ruling on the Brazil-US cotton dispute: Implications for African countries and agriculture Negotiations,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://ictsd.net/downloads/2008/04/cotton_book_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://ictsd.net/downloads/2008/04/cotton_book_en.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
What’s more – compliance with WTO rulings is necessary not just to the credibility of the DSB, but to the WTO as a whole. The US specifically must be seen as a compliant member or else the system will break down.<br />

Buck, Jr. Professor, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis; and member of the Giannini Foundation. Sumner has also been an economic expert for Brazil in the WTO upland cotton case discussed below, “U.S. Farm Policy and WTO Compliance,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research/farmbill07/aeibriefs/20070515_sumnerWTOfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research/farmbill07/aeibriefs/20070515_sumnerWTOfinal.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
And – A strong DSU is critical to sustaining norms of international trade while reviving negotiations<br />
Lawrence, 07 (Robert Z., Albert L. Williams Professor of International Trade and Investment at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, “The United States and the WTO Dispute Settlement System,” the CFR, March, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/WTO_CSR25.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/content/publications/attachments/WTO_CSR25.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Compliance with judicial decisions are also necessary for negotiations to work – Doha can’t succeed unless the US starts complying with the DSB.<br />
Sumner, 07 (Daniel A., Director, University of California Agricultural Issues Center; Frank H. Buck, Jr. Professor, Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis; and member of the Giannini Foundation. Sumner has also been an economic expert for Brazil in the WTO upland cotton case discussed below, “U.S. Farm Policy and WTO Compliance,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research/farmbill07/aeibriefs/20070515_sumnerWTOfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://aic.ucdavis.edu/research/farmbill07/aeibriefs/20070515_sumnerWTOfinal.pdf</a>)<br />
<br />
Next are the impacts to Free Trade.<br />
<br />
First - Failure to save the WTO guarantees the world splits into US and China trade blocs<br />
Ikenberry, 08 (G. John, Albert G. Milbank Professor of Politics and International Affairs at Princeton University, “The Rise of China and the Future of the West,” Foreign Affairs, January/February, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080101faessay87102-p30/g-john-ikenberry/the-rise-of-china-and-the-future-of-the-west.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080101faessay87102-p30/g-john-ikenberry/the-rise-of-china-and-the-future-of-the-west.html</a>)<br />
<br />
US-China trade disputes guarantees global economic depression and large scale conflict that escalates<br />
Liu, 05 (Henry C K, Chairman of a New York-based private investment group, Asia Times, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/global_economy/GH20Dj01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.atimes.com/atimes/global_economy/GH20Dj01.html</a>)<br />

<br />
And – the ensuing economic collapse causes nuke war<br />

Further - collapse of the WTO causes global thermonuclear war<br />
Copley News Service, December 1, 1999<br />
<br />
And – multiple studies prove that free trade reduces the likelihood of conflict<br />
