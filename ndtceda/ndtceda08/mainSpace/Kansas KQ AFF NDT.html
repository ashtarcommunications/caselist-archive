<br />
<strong>Kansas KQ aff (new rd 4)</strong><br />
In order to affirm we offer youa meal in 4 parts – we begin with everyday aesthetic of food.<br />
Our everyday relationship to agg being at the table. In the act of eating we are physically connected to a global system made up of billions of everyday experiences – the farmer, the corporate executive, the factory worker, the policymakers, the policymaker, the and so on. This community has attempted to address and care for many of these figures through this res. We have collected endless reams of data on what we believe the experience of these others to be an yet in our hurry to save the world we have forgotten ourselves. In order to create knowledge about ag and the brutal modern system it rests upon we must first create an account of our everyday aesthetic relationship to food we consume<br />
Failure to revalue our relationship to these bits we put in our bodies everyday threatens the survival of life. Food has transformation power beyond our understating – it embodies all the chaos, dirt and devastation of the world. it is tied to nearly every disaster that life faces in the global everyday<br />
Steel 8 “hungry city: how food shapes our lives” p 306-9<br />
Second we offer a discussion of the slow lie the global food system is colonized by speed<br />
…<br />
making time for the aesthetics of food simply means investing in what time we have an affirmative and mindful way of living. The food system as we know it relies upon a never ending supply of unthinking subjects who will consume with no relation.<br />
In the evening of the season we choose to use this debate as a moment for reflection on what we have left undone. We choose to slow down and make time for an aesthetic relationship to the food we consume<br />
Parkins and craig “slow living’<br />
Under this condition a monolithic vision of speed renders us incapable of seeing anything but destruction in our everyday existence. Unable to make room for other temporalities we flee from the present and the everyday, blaming structures and institution of the new world for out loss of value. Only adopting a perspective of everydayness allows us to break from the inevitable destruction of politics and a world of mundane catastrophe. In the never-ending desire to save time we end up destroying it.<br />
Virillo 2 “a landscape of events” trans. Julie rose p xii-xiii<br />
If we look for a … of the moment.<br />
we offer the everyday activity of cooking<br />
we find ourselves in this world due to the knowledge produced by a disconnection from the food we eat – we ahv fled the kitchen away from the dirty vegetables and oozing meat soon to be lumps on our plate. This all seems overwhelming – the sheer weight of a system that threatens our collective suvival through its nature yet upon which we rely to ensure out personal survival nearly every hour. We propose one everyday to act to allow both a revaluation of our connection to food and open space for alt temporalities in our everyday existence. We ask yout o cook. As we gather together to for the last time this year we ask you to get up from the table and join us in the kitchen we ask you to discover the joy in the indigestion in the topic.<br />
Steel 8 p 163-170<br />
We ask you to affirm the act of cooking as a site of everyday ethical enjoyment.<br />
We affirm this vision of the slow life not to demonize or abolish speed but to make room at the table for other ways to experiencing the world. to continue unthinkingly in the world of mechanized and disconnected ag deprives us of the ability to aesthetically connected to the foods we have come to know only as commodities.<br />
