<u>Legitimacy</u><br />
We would use a test case – normal means<br />
Morrison = activist<br />
That guts legitimacy<br />
Plan popular<br />
That’s key to legit<br />
<u>Minimalism</u><br />
Concede overrules args from 1AC<br />
Morrison was a fundamentalist decision, that’s a link turn<br />
No link – No spillover<br />
Deference key minimalism<br />
Morrison was a violation of deference<br />

Defense of law uniquely empowering<br />
Approach of using state instead of micropoltical strategies<br />
Perm – do the plan and critical inquiry<br />
Not mutually exclusive<br />
No link to medusa metaphor<br />
Do not view women as submissive – this is status quo<br />
3. do not speak for others – not repeal law people speak for themselves<br />
4. fundamentally misunderstand the law – does not force women to use the law women can use alternatives<br />
They are exclusionary prevent women from going to court<br />
Tort law uniquely empowers women<br />
Gender animus easy – answers bicard evidence – do not have to play any roles<br />
Extend Goldfarb law is inevitable and neutral – endorsing<br />
Sexism is inevitable – Schneider evidence<br />

Conceive all sexual violence to be inclusive, court procedure is uniquely different from court system.<br />
Conceded solvency mechanism – focusing on crr not the language – spread to movements free from gender violence. Social reality is uniquely empowering<br />
This is uniquely good for the women’s movement and answers their noncolor access arguments<br />
1ac is a criticism of the state law – oppositional rules. The neg leaves out they need to change the<br />
Institutions, net benefit on the perm.<br />
Mackinnion and becard evidence, group, never say this is a primary role and it is to counterbalance the widespread<br />
Mackinnon criticizes metaphor does not use it.<br />
Civil tort system does not allow revictimization focuses on the badness of the act of the defendant. Vawa is empowering because they control their own suits. Rever answers women won’t win.<br />
New access points to the state system, none existing now.<br />
Law k is not nuanced enough<br />
Weisman recognizes law is never neutral must change patriarchal power structures<br />
Vawa does not provide universal construction of women<br />
Group bottom of jake – conceded injunctive relief. Role playing Rawals increases activism. Even if it is a fantasy it is a performative role solving in itself<br />
Don’t say have no change, systemic problem must include individual action and move beyond it.<br />
Extend micro political is not enough to solve the harms of the affirmative, social oppression exist in the world important to them<br />
Extend metaphor is bad this is misdirection and makes it counter productive.<br />
Approach is counterproductive, people will focus on medusa.<br />
Extend psychoanalysis causes quietism<br />

<br />
Tied to framework -- state is good always affects the debate community.<br />
Law affects, unless we solve the law we cannot begin to address to solve for sexism in the debate community. Voting aff result in educational benefit. Small risk that we have that accomplishment.<br />
Concede Goldfarb that the law is never neutral – unless we change the law, endemic with social system<br />
Allow the legal system to reflect sexism and this will spill over into the debate community.<br />
Have to tie in personal activism – systemically excludes and impact turns the entire k. small ristk we solve for activism.<br />
We do not exclude people from debate, conceded law good arguments.<br />
We make people past victims, speaking for others argument here. Claiming to be someone’s hero and not being a victim different. Not dictating how people control their own futures, impossibility of ability to speak for themselves.<br />
Answers back passivism victim argument, new arg. No cards on this.<br />
Entire 2nr is a k of the aff no articulation of what the performance is --- no solvency for what voting negative means. Aff acts as education vote aff. Answers back ethics argument – we role play we are not giving our ethics off on the government, more power than it really has.<br />
Solve for actual change – Schneider only change things for local precludes broader institutions<br />
Extend rawls specifically now in our jones evidence, pretend we can change more likely to do so<br />
We do not do the entirety of the negative, not proving it is mutually exclusive to aff.<br />
