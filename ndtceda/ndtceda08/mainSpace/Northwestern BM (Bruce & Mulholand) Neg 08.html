The term ‘foreign’ communicates fear of an enemy country and drives xenophobia at home<br />
Cheryl lynn Wofford, Hill, 2002, 27 Oklahmoa City University Law Review 297, p. lexis<br />
<br />
The terms “neighbors” and “foreigner” communicate different concepts…with strangers should be improved.<br />
<br />
The use of the term ‘foreign’ causes policy failure – it unconsciously motivates a US position of hostility and reluctance to cooperate with other nations. The Counterplan sends a crucial signal towards generating world peace<br />
Hill, 2002, same<br />
<br />
Many people use the term “foreign” without realizing its negative connotations…diffused through society…n152<br />
<br />
And it turns the case – other countries perceive the term ‘foreign’ as hostile and will backlash against the plan – regardless of US intentions – fixing hostile language empirically improves relations<br />
Hill, 2002<br />
<br />
The widespread use of the term “transnational law” within international jurisprudence…a model strategic plan follows.<br />
<br />
The language we use to communicate the plan is critical – it shapes our international relationship. Attention to each word is crucial to solvency and towards developing a more peaceful world<br />
Hill 2002<br />
<br />
Language shapes the world. International communications shape the nature of international relationship…can contribute to the development of a more peaceful world.<br />
<br />
And the language we deploy in the plan generates our expectations of the other and influences the behavior of both parties<br />
Hill 2002<br />
<br />
Language is a method that has been used to achieve a more inclusive worldview…controlling the behavior of human beings.<br />
<br />
Removing the word foreign from proposed legislation and in a place where future policymakers’ minds are shaped and trained is crucial to legal education and spills over to transform international jurisprudence to be peaceful<br />
Hill 2002<br />
<br />
First, the strategy for word-coining begins with language…greater respect for all peoples and nation states.<br />

Constructive engagement requires the extended offer be conditioned on completititon [sic] of a secific behavioral change from the target state. Vassiliki Tzivelis, '06, &quot;The European Union's Foreign Policy Towards Cub: It Is Time To Tie The Know [sic]&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www6.miami.edu/eucenter/Tzivelisfinal.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www6.miami.edu/eucenter /Tzivelisfinal.pdf</a> &quot;1.2 European Approach: Constructive Engagement and Conditionality...reach the agreed-upon goals.&quot; This requires an active process of engagement and involvement with the recipient state - one shot interactions fail this test. Chen Jian, '98, &quot;The China Challenge in the Twenty-First Century,&quot; Policy Papers &quot;With a basic understanding of China's...agenda dominated by positive themes.&quot; An offer is a commitment that's conditioned upon a specific behavioral change or pledge by the receiver - there must be an option to accept or reject.

Mooney, 02, long URL @ <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.courts.mo.gov/" rel="nofollow">www.courts.mo.gov</a> &quot;The more difficult question is whether...reach of our criminal laws.&quot; This interpretation's crucial to give both 'constructive' and 'government-to-government' meaning - allowing unconditional engagement shreds grammatical precision and allows any modicum of non-isolation to substitute for constructive engagement. Haas &amp; O'Sullivan 2K, &quot;Terms of Engagement,&quot; Survival 42 (2) &quot;The term 'engagement' was popularized... engagement for the time being.&quot;<br />

<ol><li>Precision - constructive as conditioned's the crucial meaning maker for every key resolutional term - alternate interpretations consign us to shallow debates about the general elements of 'engagement' while sacrificing the core question of constructive engagement's desirability. Precision's uniquely key in this instance to avoid the traditional confusion that plagues engagement scholarship.</li></ol>David H. Capie and Paul M. Evans, '02, <u>The Asia-Pacific Security Lexicon</u> 113-114 &quot;Third, engagement increasingly appears... often blurred in practice.&quot; 2.
