PLAN<br />
<br />
The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran by commiting to: forgo the use of force to change the borders or government of the Islamic Republic of Iran; end unilateral sanctions, reestablish diplomatic relations, settle all bilateral claims, and work in pursuit of common economic interests with the Islamic Republic of Iran; terminate the Islamic Republic of Iran’s designation as a state sponsor of terror; and commence an ongoing strategic dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran, in exchange for the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government commiting to: definitively address concerns about its nuclear fuel cycle activities, including providing full transparency and ratifying and implementing the Additional Protocols; issue a statement expressing support for United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, including affirmation of a two-state solution; work towards Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action, including stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States; to commence an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States, including representations from nongovernmental organizations in both countries; and to work with the United States in ensuring a stable Iraq.<br />
