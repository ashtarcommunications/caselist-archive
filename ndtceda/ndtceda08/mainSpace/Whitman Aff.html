OB 1: STATUS QUO<br />
QUIRIN HELD THAT A PERSON CAN BE CATEGORIZED AS AN “ENEMY COMBATANT”<br />
Charles I. Lugosi Spring 03 – 30 Am. J. Crim. L. 225<br />
During World War Two, ... themselves as enemy soldiers.<br />
<br />
QUIRIN BASED THIS HOLDING ON A SIMPLE CALCULUS – FIRST THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PUNISH OFFENSES DEFINED BY INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SECOND “ENEMY COMBATANT” IS A RECOGNIZED OFFENSE, JUST LIKE SPYING<br />
Justice Stone. 1942. Ex Parte Quririn 317 U.S. 1 1942<br />
From the very beginning of its … subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals.<br />
<br />
THIS IS THE INTERPRETATION USED BY BUSH TO JUSTIFY ITS USE OF THE TERM, AND IT HAS BEEN UPHELD BY THE COURTS<br />
Joanna Woolman Fall 2005 – 7 J.L. &amp; Soc. Challenges 145<br />
The government asserts that Hamdi’s and … will be the formal and accepted definition of this term.<br />
<br />
PLAN – THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD HOLD THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS PROHIBITS THE USE OF THE CLASSIFICATION “ENEMY COMBATANT”. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE SOFT POWER<br />
THE DESIGNATION “ENEMY COMBATANT” IS DELIBERATELY USED BY BUSH TO PROVIDE COVER FOR ABUSE OF DETAINEES<br />
Joanna Woolman Fall 2005 – 7 J.L. &amp; Soc. Challenges 145<br />
For the first time in history, … have been designated “enemy combatants.”<br />
<br />
REFUSAL TO GRANT PROTECTIONS TO “ENEMY COMBATANTS” UNDERMINES SOFT POWER<br />
Jeffrey K. Cassin April 2006 4 Cardozo Pub. L. Pol’y &amp; Ethics J. 421<br />
A loss of moral authority has several … detained in Guantanamo in the first place.<br />
<br />
HEG SCENARIO (READ AT GONZAGA, KENTUCKY AND PEPPERDINE):<br />
SOFT POWER KEY TO LEADERSHIP<br />
Dr Daniel Hamilton June 11, 2003<br />
In short, power is relative to … result is a climate regime in disarray.<br />
<br />
LEADERSHIP IS ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT GLOBAL NUCLEAR EXCHANGE<br />
Zalmay Khalilzad 95<br />
<br />
AFGHANISTAN SCENARIO (READ ONLY AT GONZAGA):<br />
FIGHTING IN SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN HAS THE COUNTRY ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE—ALLIES AREN’T REINFORCING BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS<br />
The Irish Times 9/13/2006<br />
“Nato chief Jaap de Hoop…tension between the US and some European allies.”<br />
<br />
SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN SHARES ITS BORDER WITH PAKISTAN—INSTABILITY WILL SPREAD AND CAUSE A PAKISTANI CIVIL WAR<br />
The New York Times 11/15/2001<br />
“After Sept. 11, with options and allies…shooting of weapons is the backfiring of policy”<br />
<br />
PAKISTANI CIVIL WAR LEADS TO INDIA-PAKISTAN NUCLEAR WAR<br />
The Washington Post 10/21/2001<br />
“the prospect of Pakistan being taken over…spun out of control and led to World War I.”<br />
<br />
BOOSTING SOFT POWER GIVES ALLIED LEADERS THE POLITICAL LEEWAY TO BAIL THE US OUT IN AFGHANISTAN<br />
Joseph S. Nye Jr. “America needs a strong Europe; Tapping soft power” The International Herald Tribune 11/15/2004<br />
“Power in the world today is distributed like a three dimensional…Bush would be wise to act now.”<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO IS INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW<br />
<br />
THE CLASSIFICATION “ENEMY COMBATANT” HAS NO BASIS UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW, PLACING THE US IN VIOLATION OF THE ICCPR<br />
James F. Fitzpatrick Feb 23 2004 Brief of Amicus Curiae Global Rights in Support of Petitioners” Hamdi v. Rumsfeld. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jenner.com/files/tbl_s69NewsDocumentOrder/FileUpload500/164/AmicusCuriae_GlobalRights.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenner.com/files/tbl_s69NewsDocumentOrder/FileUpload500/164/AmicusCuriae_GlobalRights.pdf</a><br />
The Government’s contrived classification of … Hamdi under international law.<br />
<br />
US COMPLIANCE IS KEY TO INCREASING HUMAN RIGHTS GLOBALLY<br />
Douglass Cassel 2001 – 2 Chi. J. Int’l L. 121<br />
To some degree, as noted, these attributes of international law … respect in US domestic and foreign policy debates.<br />
<br />
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW IS CRUCIAL TO PREVENT CRUELTY – THE MEMORY OF THE SHOAH INDICATES THE IMPACT IS GENOCIDE<br />
Michael Ignatieff April 4-7, 2000. The Tanner Lectures on Human Values, Princeton Univ. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/Ignatieff_01.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/Ignatieff_01.pdf</a><br />
In If This Is a Man, Primo Levi … unjust state law or oppressive customary practice.<br />
<br />
GENOCIDE IS THE ULTIMATE IMPACT – IT MAKES BOTH LIFE AND DEATH MEANINGLESS<br />
Claudia Card 2003 – Hypatia. Vol 18, Iss. 1 2003 Genocide and Social Death<br />
Yet such atrocities, it may … This view, however, is controversial.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE THREE IS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE<br />
GLOBAL DEMOCRATIC TRANSITIONS ARE UNDERWAY AND A STRONG SIGNAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLDING JUDICIAL REVIEW AGAINST EXECUTIVE DETENTION CLAIMS IS KEY TO STABLE TRANSITIONS<br />
The International League for Human Rights 2004 – Amici Brief Al Odah v. US 2003 U.S. Brief 334. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://jenner.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jenner.com/</a><br />
Many of the newly independent governments … their actions on the United States.<br />
<br />
STALLED TRANSITIONS ARE THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS – THE BEST MODELS PROVE THAT DEMOCRATIZATION IS PEACEFUL, BUT FAILURE INCREASES THE RISK OF CONFLICT<br />
Michael D. Ward March 98 0 The American Political Science Review<br />
As Figure 1 details, democratization – whether in mild or strong … smoothness of the transition process.<br />
<br />
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS A PILLAR OF STABLE DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION<br />
Rebecca Chavez 2004 The Rule of Law in Nascent Democracies p 2-3<br />
In contrast to electoral democracy, … in the way of the rule of law in Latin America.<br />
<br />
DEMOCRATIC CONSOLIDATION IS KEY TO SURVIVAL<br />
Diamond 95<br />
<br />
DEMOCRATIZATION SOLVES ALL WAR<br />
Sean Lynn-Jones March 98<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/lys02/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/lys02/index.html</a><br />
In addition to improving the lives of individual … myths and misperceptions that cause wars.<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION TWO IS SOLVENCY<br />
THE COURT SHOULD RULE “ENEMY COMBATANT” STATUS VIOLATES THE ICCPR<br />
Alejandra Rodriguez Spring 2003. 39 Cal. W. L. Rev. 379<br />
On June 8, 1992, the United States ratified the ICCPR, … ensure compliance with Article 9 of the ICCPR.<br />
<br />
THE ICCPR APPLIES DURING CONFLICT<br />
Ralph Wilde, Reader in Law, University College London. “Legal ‘black hole’?” 2005 26 Mich. J. Int'l L. 739<br />
B. Do International Treaties… human rights treaties are interpreted<br />
<br />
PLAN USES THE ICCPR EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT SELF EXECUTING. THAT WOULD REASSERT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE, STRENGTHEN INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS AND REBUILD SOFT POWER<br />
Jeffrey C. Goldman, Executive Editor, Duke Law Journal. “Of Treaties And Torture: How The Supreme Court Can Restrain The Executive,” Duke Law Journal December, 2005 55 Duke L.J. 609<br />
The Bush administration's original… without running afoul of the political question doctrine<br />
GOLDMAN CONTINUES<br />
“Article II treaties - those negotiated by the president and ratified by the Senate…up first and foremost to protect individuals<br />
<br />
RULING ON A NON-SELF EXECUTING TREATY WOULD SET PRECEDENT THAT ENSURES FUTURE COURTS USE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW<br />
Martha F. Davis, Visiting Professor of Law &amp; Democracy at Albany Law School, Vice President and Legal Director, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. “International Human Rights And United States Law: Predictions Of A Courtwatcher,” Albany Law Review 2000 64 Alb. L. Rev. 417<br />
This change will be much less than the… solutions to a common legal problem<br />
<br />
FUTURE COURTS WILL ADHERE TO BOTH THE PRECEDENT SET BY PLAN AND ITS METHOD OF REASONING<br />
Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice, United States Supreme Court. “The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules,” University of Chicago Law Review FALL, 1989 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175<br />
But in the context of this discussion, that particular value of having a general rule of law<br />

Michael S. Greco, president of the American Bar Association. He is a partner in the Boston office of Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart Nicholson Graham. “U.S. lawyers need to act,” Miami Daily Business Review December 05, 2005<br />
What makes the rule of law so important that it attracted such a distinguished community?<br />
<br />
Other than that we mostly just read heg/soft power/US-EU relations or democracy solves the impact to your DA. If you really want me to give you cites for cards that say things like soft power solves the environment and democracy solves prolif, I guess I can do that. But I probably cite tracked them anyway…<br />

A2: Explicit Overrule:<br />
Replacing one precedent with another is overruling<br />
Mary Dudziak, Prof of Law and History at the University of Southern Cal. “Part II: Interest Groups,” August 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/selectingjustices.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/selectingjustices.html</a><br />

Observation 1 SQ<br />
<br />
Quirin held that a person can be categorized as an “enemy combatant”<br />
Charles I. Lugosi, Assistant Professor of Law, St. Thomas University School of Law American Journal of Criminal Law. “Rule of Law or Rule By Law: The Detention of Yaser Hamdi,” Spring, 2003 30 Am. J. Crim. L. 225<br />
<br />
Quirin based this holding on a simple calculus – first, the government has the authority to punish offenses defined by international law and second, “enemy combatant” is a recognized offense, just like spying<br />
Justice Stone, writing for the Majority in 1942, C.J., Supreme Court Justice. Opinion of the Court, Ex Parte Quirin 317 U.S. 1 1942 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0317_0001_ZO.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0317_0001_ZO.html</a><br />

<br />
Plan:<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should hold that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prohibits the use of the classification “enemy combatant.” We reserve the right to clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage 1 – international human rights law<br />
Advantage two is international human rights law:<br />
<br />
The classification “enemy combatant” has no basis under international law, placing the US in violation of the ICCPR<br />

Advantage 3 – judicial independence<br />
Advantage three is judicial independence:<br />

The Bush administration’s fundamental fear from the threat of terrorism is that it may undermine democracy and give way to totalitarian politics. Thus, it is absurd that its response to this perceived threat is to enact exactly that which it condemns. Citing judicial deference and the ‘enemy combatant’ status mentioned in the Supreme Court’s Quirin decidion, it has eroded democracy and forgone an effective response to terror by denying individuals the rights to freedom and a fair trial and cementing unlimited sovereign power.<br />

“Three months to the day after Timothy McVeigh…terrorists must be eliminated.”<br />
<br />
It is precisely these actions, however, that do more harm to democracy than terrorism could ever do. But because they are done in the name of protecting democracy from its enemies this suicidal politics is justified.<br />
Samir Haddad, PhD candidate in the Department of Philosophy, Northwestern University, September 2004, Contretemps, Vol. 4, p. 29-30<br />
<br />
It is fundamentally the fear of the Other that drives this politics. The concept of the ‘enemy combatant’ is the radical other for United States liberal democracy. We are all that the enemy combatant is not and the denial of international human rights standards to the combatant, such as the right to a fair trial is rendering invisible and a rejection of any form of responsibility to that other to preserve a secure self identity. This is the height of unethical action.<br />

The terminal impact is extinction – when the suppression of the enemy combatant and the other is seen as essential to the survival of democracy anything goes in terms of responding. What’s worse, however, is that even if that response works extinction via the abandonment of the law and democracy will result.<br />

Unfortunately the Bush administration has beat us to it. The means by which the modern sovereign maintains its power over the state of exception is through the partial and overlapping compliance with international law. This is particularly true of the Bush administration’s dealings in the War on Terror. While functioning within the coordinates of international reservations, understandings and holdings have created a system of international law whereby it is nothing more than a tool for the Bush administration to declare individuals like Hamdi and Hamdan life that is devoid of meaning by arguing that international law and the ICCPR are not binding.<br />

And finally, This act is one of hospitality, a politically positive response to violence undertaken against alterity. An ethic of hospitality toward the Other should be prioritized over their disads and defenses of utilitarianism because literally no other value, even life itself, is possible without our prior relationship to the Other. While calculation is inevitable and useful, the incalculable MUST win out over calculation to act on our responsibility. Finally unconditional hospitality should not be confused for universal hospitality – we must actively condemn the forces that annihilate alterity. Even if this approach entails a measure of violence, this violence is irreducible from politics and is a condition of our responsibility.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>In this way, policymakers today perceive democracy to be under attack, the paradoxical response to this risk has been to shut off democracy itself, strip individuals of their rights and imprison them indefinitely. This logic is known as auto-immunity, where a political system immunizes itself against its own immunity – or in other words, when democracy kills itself to save itself.</strong><br />

<strong><u>“Democracy today is at risk</u></strong>. . . . much from itself as from its ‘enemies’.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Above all else it is the fear of the Other that drives this process of auto-immunity. The faceless who are presumed to threaten democracy become the justification for massive violence against all those who dare to dissent. In this case, the enemy combatant is the Other who we make invisible in order to secure an orderly world. This is a fundamental denial of ethics and responsibility.</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>This is particularly dangerous in the context of auto-immunity, it’s a logic qualitatively different from other forms of conflict – what is at stake is nothing less than the existence of the world, put at infinite risk because the threat that democracy feels it must protect itself from is equally infinite.</strong><br />

“It needs to be said immediately that if . . . . the grammar of the future anterior”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>In the face of sovereign auto-immunity, it is more important than ever to refuse to abandon human rights and sovereignty, which are the crucial grounds for struggling against the closure of democracy. While we must seek to interrogate sovereign auto-immunity, this must be accomplished through appeals to international human rights law that can call the logic of auto-immunity into question.</strong><br />

<br />
NOTE: The text of the Ignatieff cards has been altered, he uses the word “holocaust” several times, Whitman replaces this word.<br />
<br />
The term Holocaust is an anti-Semitic term. The Church Fathers used the term as a polemic against the Jewish religion. This word maintains a violent relationship between Jews and the Nazi experience because it inappropriately makes comparison between the alters and the Gas Chamber and explains the extermination as a central component of the Christian narrative. We have an alternative in the term So’ah which implies a catastrophe or disaster of incalculable proportions.<br />
<strong>Agamben 99</strong> (Giorgio, professor of philosophy at the University of Verona, Remnants of Auschwitz: The Witness and the Archive, pg. 28-31)<br />
“The history of an incorrect term… This is why we will never make use of the term.”<br />
<br />
International Human Rights law is crucial to preventing cruelty – the memory of the Shoah indicates the impact is genocide<br />

“In If This Is a Man, Primo Levi… oppressive customary practice.”<br />

Their alternative rests upon a naive assumption about the goodness of humanity – the experience of the Shoah tells us that only legal protections for human rights can solve<br />

US, 2003 U.S. brief 334, 2004, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.jenner.com/files/tbl_s69NewsDocumentOrder/FileUpload500/82/AmiciCuriae_Center_for_Justice_Int_Leage_Human_Rights_Adv_For_Indep_Judiciary2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenner.com/files/tbl_s69NewsDocumentOrder/FileUpload500/82/AmiciCuriae_Center_for_Justice_Int_Leage_Human_Rights_Adv_For_Indep_Judiciary2.pdf</a><br />
