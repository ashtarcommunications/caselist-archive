Totalization Edelman k<br />
EDELMAN’S AND OKLAHOMA’S ARGUMENT IS A SERIOUS TOTALIZATION OF THE POLITICAL: FOR EDELMAN, THE TROPE OF THE CHILD AS THE FUTURE, INFECTS ALL POLITICS: THIS IS A MASSIVE CONFLATION OF ALL POLITICS, RADICAL AND CONSERVATIVE – FOR OKLAHOMA, ALL POLITICS WHICH IS CONCERNED WITH MORE DESIRABLE SOCIAL ORDERS IS ULTIMATELY CONSERVATIVE.<br />
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE? WELL YOU’RE JUST TRAPPED WITHIN THE LOGIC OF INNER CHILD.<br />
WE HAVE TWO ARGUMENTS: 1. IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE TO SPEAK ABOUT ALL POLITICS? WHAT MAKES SUCH AN AROGANT STATEMENT POSSIBLE? HOW CAN ANYONE KNOW THE POSSIBILITIES OF ALL POLITICS? 2. FUTURE THINKING IS NOT CONSERVATIVE – IT IS ALSO THE TERRAIN THAT ALLOWS CONTESTATION – IT IS THE WORLD THAT ALLOW’S MLK TO DREAM, TO INSPIRE<br />
BRENKMAN, Professor of English &amp; Comp Lit at the CUNY Graduate Center, 2002<br />
(John, Narrative 10.2 (2002) 174-180, MUSE)<br />
B. YOU GOT IT WRONG:<br />
THE CHILD IS NOT SIMPLY THE FIGURE OF THE FUTURE: WHILE IMAGES OF CHILDREN MAY BE USED TO SPECULATE WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS, IMAGES OF CHILDREN ARE ALSO USED TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE INJUSTICES OF THE PRESENT: REMEMBER, POLICE ATTACK DOGS MAULING CHILDREN OF COLOR IN ALABAMA – THESE IMAGES WERE CRITICAL TO RAISING NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS TO PLIGHT OF DISCRIMINATION.<br />
EDELMAN’S SWEEPING GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT POLITICS IGNORES THAT THE FIGURE OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN USED TO ENLIVEN RACIAL AND GENDER PROTESTS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESENT<br />
COBB, University of Toronto, 2005<br />
(Michael, Criticism. Detroit: Winter 2005.Vol.47, Iss. 1; pg. 119, 12 pgs)<br />
C. PASSIVITY: THIS SORT OF POLITICS TEACHES PASSIVITY – IT TEACHES US TO ACCEPT WHAT IS AROUND US<br />
Hall, Professor of English at West Virginia University, 2006<br />
(Donald E., The Chronicle of Higher Education, Sep 15, Vol. 53, Iss. 4; pg. B.15)<br />
D. TOTALITARIANISM: LET’S FACE FACTS PEOPLE, ANYONE WHO BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY ETHICAL ACTION IS THE ONE THAT SUSPENDS THE FUTURE, HAS ONLY ONE THING ON THE BRAIN – IT’S CALLED IDEOLOGY.<br />
THE AFF HAS PREDECIDED THAT THE WORLD ONLY MAKES SENSE ACCORDING TO THEIR VISION OF ETHICS, THE WORLD ONLY MAKES SENSE ACCORDING TO THE HEGEMONY OF THE PROFERRED SYMBOLIC ORDER. IN A NUTSHELL, THIS TYPE OF THINKING IS TOTALITARIAN – IT DIMINISHES WHAT THE PRESENT IT OR COULD BE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO THE WAY THE WORLD HAS TO BE. THIS TURNS YOUR AFF.<br />

CP Plan Text with out appropriate Test case<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, deciding that the state has no compelling interest in protecting potential life<br />
[A] Topicality – Topicality checks abuse<br />
[B] Competititon – The counterplan is plan minus. Any permutation that avoids these net benefits would have to sever out of the part of the plan that rules in the next appropriate test case, which would be a voting issue for in round fairness and competitive equity. Reject the team not the argument because permutations create multiple worlds that exponentially increase the negative burden, and the negative can’t deploy offense in the block because the 2NR can never catch up to 1AR straight turns. Illegitimate multiple worlds are not voting issues when the neg does them because the 1AR can deploy new offense based on block choices and the 2AR can spend the full 6 minutes on the world the 2NR goes for.<br />
The selection of an appropriate test case is part of a strategy of representation, where the Supreme Court takes an aspect of reality and deflects all other interpretations<br />
Wess, English prof @ Oregon State University, 2004<br />

Housing CP<br />
<br />
The legislatures of the fifty states, territories, and district of Columbia of the United States should implement the following mandates as per the Orfield evidence: prohibit exclusionary zoning, require comprehensive planning and provide for dedicated enforcement of land use policy, use urban growth boundaries to reduce sprawl and promote infill, adopt proactive policies to prevent displacement, link affordable housing with public transportation, implement dispersed inclusionary housing policies, promote positive integration measures, effectively site subsidized housing, and enforce and strengthen laws prohibiting discrimination in housing markets. Funding and enforcement guaranteed.<br />
<br />
The CP also had the supreme court ban tracking. Can’t find the exact wording, but it wasn’t anything special.<br />
<br />
Solvency for tracking:<br />
The Supreme Court can rule tracking unconstitutional based on a series of precedents, and past cases prove that courts will go along with this precedent<br />
Dickens, 1996 [Angelia, Writing &amp; Research Editor, Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs, “Revisiting Brown v. Board of Education: How Tracking Has Resegregated America's Public Schools” 29 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs. 469]<br />
<br />
Applying the analysis of Brown…determined that the education their African [*490] American classmates were receiving was unconstitutionally inferior. 140<br />
<br />
<br />
The CP results in housing integration<br />
Orfield, 2006 [Associate professor law at Minnesota, 33 Fordham Urb. L.J. 877]<br />
<br />
Land use and housing policies should be marshaled…government agencies or by nonprofit fair housing organizations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Housing integration results in functional school desegregation – post-Brown desegregation programs wouldn’t have been necessary if housing was integrated<br />
Orfield, 2006 [Associate professor law at Minnesota, 33 Fordham Urb. L.J. 877]<br />
<br />
The way in which government agencies have located … difficult for teachers to do their jobs in public schools. 30<br />

(2) HOUSING SEGREGATION IS THE LYNCHPIN OF RACIAL INEQUALITY – LIVING IN IMPOVERISHED SOCIETIES CREATES LABELS OF POWERLESSNESS FOR BLACKS THAT DENIES THEM ACCESS TO ALL OTHER SOCIETAL OPPORTUNITIES<br />
Kenn 2001 [Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse U. College of Law, The Boston Public Interest Law Journal, 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35, Fall, p. 43-45. Lexis]<br />
<br />
The systemic effects of racism have caused … &quot;those&quot; people are the criminal element in society!<br />
<br />
<br />
(3) HOUSING SEGREGATION HAS NORMALIZED RACIAL DISCRIMINATION: WHERE ONE LIVES DETERMINES THEIR STATUS IN CULTURE AND THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS RESOURCES. THIS ISOLATION HAS BEEN UNCHALLENGED FOR DECADES AND WILL CONTINUE UNLESS CONFRONTED WITH INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE<br />
Kenn 2001 [Deborah, Associate Professor of Law and Director, Community Development Law Clinic, Syracuse U. College of Law, The Boston Public Interest Law Journal, 11 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 35, Fall, p. 43-45. Lexis]<br />

Strategy 1: State Courts + Courts and Politics<br />
<br />
CP – State Courts<br />
<br />
Text: The highest courts of the 50 States of the United States should rule on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent state grounds that their state constitutions guarantee the right to a substantially equal educational opportunity and that segregation violates their state constitutions. The state courts should also require an appropriate remedial approach. We’ll Clarify.<br />

The CP will ignite state constitutional jurisprudence – it will teach state courts that they need not play a spectator sport<br />

The United States Supreme Court should rule that United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), and United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), lack precedential value because they only apply narrowly to the facts of the cases. The Supreme Court should further clarify that Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), is to be used as standing precedent for commerce clause jurisprudence, and that lower courts are to use the rational basis test and the definition of “economic” as used in Gonzales v. Raich.<br />
<br />
The United States Congress should pass a resolution stating that violence against women is intricately tied to gender animus within our communities, and that violence against women should be treated as a civil rights issue because it discriminates against women as a class of individuals.<br />
<br />
The legislatures of the 50 states and all territories should pass legislation institutionalizing restorative justice as a solution to gendered violence including, but not limited to, family group conferences, sentencing circles, and victim-offender mediation. Victims will be given the choice to use these methods of restorative justice instead of or in addition to traditional legal means.<br />

Torts Bad<br />
<br />
The civil remedy is anti-therapeutic – they are worse than the criminal process itself – torts are based on a notion of “comparative fault” which stipulates that damages are awarded in accordance with how much a particular party is at fault – more often than not, civil trials will find victims partially responsible for their own rape. Civil trials re-victimize women<br />
And don’t provide enough compensation.<br />
Koss, 2000 [Mary P., Public Health, Family and Community Medicine Psychiatry, and Psychology University of Arizona, “Blame, Shame, and Community: Justice Responses to Violence Against Women,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mincava.umn.edu/documents/koss/koss.html</a>]<br />

Because an attorney retained by the survivor … make the rapist's act 'her fault&quot;' ( Bublick, 1999, p. 1476 ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Victim fault turns the case –<br />
<br />
A) It makes women responsible – civil trials treat gender violence as a common occurrence that women are themselves responsible for protecting against – if they haven’t taken a reasonable amount of care to prevent against violence, it is partially their fault that it happened.<br />

<br />
The central problem with current comparative fault defenses…design of broader institutional protections.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Tort law puts women back in their place – it is based on notions of what a reasonable women is expected to do – this reinscribes static notions of appropriate sexual behavior – it forces women back into homes and motherly roles and turns their public/private argument<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />
<br />
As in the context of criminal rape cases… not women who are agents as well as victims.<br />
<br />
<br />
C) Tort law turns the symbol – civil trial send the message that women are responsible for the crimes against them – it teaches women that gender violence is a normal part of the environment – women are forced t olive in fear of violence and rape<br />
Bublick, 1999 [Ellen M., Assistant Prof of Law, University of Arizona, “CITIZEN NO-DUTY RULES: RAPE VICTIMS AND COMPARATIVE FAULT,” 99 Colum. L. Rev. 1413<br />

2. Equality Norms Inside and Outside the Courtroom… exercised in the face of constant risks of rape.<br />
<br />

D) The normalization of violence – tort law treats violence as a legally accepted reality that women have the obligation to protect themselves against – this naturalizes gender violence as an acceptable part of society<br />

Their interpretation is an antiquated theory of law that no longer applies – it assumes that when courts strike down a law, they render it out of existence – this is false; when a court overrules, it can only render a law unenforceable, it immediately comes back into existence when the previous decision is overruled<br />
