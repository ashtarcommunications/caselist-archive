 The united states federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of the Palestinian authority by recognizing hamas as the legitimately elected parliamentary majority and hence including it in all relevant negotiations and activities and offering them substantial foreign assistance in the form of foreign aid on the condition that the Palestinian authority agrees to distribute all aid to the Palestinian people.macalaster <br />

The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran by commiting to: forgo the use of force to change the borders or government of the Islamic Republic of Iran; end unilateral sanctions, reestablish diplomatic relations, settle all bilateral claims, and work in pursuit of common economic interests with the Islamic Republic of Iran; terminate the Islamic Republic of Iran’s designation as a state sponsor of terror; and commence an ongoing strategic dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran, in exchange for the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government commiting to: definitively address concerns about its nuclear fuel cycle activities, including providing full transparency and ratifying and implementing the Additional Protocols; issue a statement expressing support for United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, including affirmation of a two-state solution; work towards Hezbollah’s transformation into an exclusively political and social organization and press Palestinian opposition groups to stop violent action, including stopping the provision of training, supplies, and funds to organizations designated as terrorist organizations by the United States; to commence an ongoing human rights dialogue with the United States, including representations from nongovernmental organizations in both countries; and to work with the United States in ensuring a stable Iraq.<br />

Palestine Aff<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government Should Increase its Constructive Engagement With The Government of the Palestinian Authority By Recognizing Hamas as the Legitimately Elected Parliamentary Majority and Hence Including it in all Relevant Negotiations and Activities and Offering Them Substantial Foreign Assistance in the Form of Humanitarian Aid.<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Hamas<br />
Since the 2006 Election American Policy Has Aimed at Overthrowing and Isolating Hamas, the Democratically Chosen Representatives of Palestine—This Strategy Has Not Only Failed But Reveals the Dangerous Intentions of the U.S. and Israel to Punish Palestine For Voting the “Wrong Way”—This Summer’s Violence and Ensuing Blockade Means This Ideology Has Created Humanitarian Disaster<br />
Noam Chomsky, “Guillotining Gaza,” Information Clearing House, July 30th, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18092.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18092.htm)</a><br />
The death of a nation is a rare and somber event... reaction to the January 2006 election<br />
<br />
<br />
These Policies Emphasize the Paradoxical Assumptions of Democracy—Palestine is Free Only Insofar as They Choose Who and What We Wish Them to Choose—This Assumes a Static Narrative of American Lead Progress, That If “They Were Smart, They Would Think Like Us”<br />
R. Radhakrishnan, Professor of Asian American Studies, English, and Comparative Literature, Asian American Studies, “When Is Democracy Political?” boundary 2, Fall 2006, p. 105-107<br />
With these questions in mind… a flourishing national democracy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Under this Definition of Democracy, Hamas Has Not Only Refused America’s Gift, But the Gift of God and the World—As Such, America and Israel are Entitled to Promote “True Freedom”<br />
Slavoj Zizek, In These Times, February 14th, 2005 (The Not-So Quiet American, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizbush.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizbush.htm)</a><br />
With the global American ideological offensive… anti-Zionist pan-Arab nationalists?<br />
<br />
<br />
This Logic is the Basis For Violence—Something Emergent in the Other that We Cannot Control or Understand Justifies its Extermination.<br />
Zizek '95 [Slavoj , “Ideology between Fiction and Fantasy,” 16 Cardozo Law Review 1511, 1995, LN]<br />
Our argument can be briefly summarized… dimensions acquired by the remainder.<br />
<br />
<br />
This Metaphysical Arbitration of the Conflict Between Israel and Palestine is the Ultimate Support for Zionism—The Only Justification For Israeli Claims to Supersede Palestinian Claims is Destiny<br />
Jacqueline Rose, Professor of English at Queen Mary University of London, The Question of Zion, 2005, p.54-55<br />
What I have been describing… What I have been describing<br />
<br />
This Project of Zionism is Not a Radical Break or Empowerment of Judaism Post the Horrors of World War II—Instead, Zionism Rests on the Foundation of Anti-Semitism and Ultimately Aims to View Palestine From its Perspective.<br />
Joseph Massad, assistant professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University, “The Persistence of the Palestinian Question,” Cultural Critique, #59, Winter 2005, pp. 1-23<br />
As Michael Selzer has shown in his classic book… much of the persistence of the Palestinian Question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Government Should Increase its Constructive Engagement With The Government of the Palestinian Authority By Recognizing Hamas as the Legitimately Elected Parliamentary Majority and Hence Including it in all Relevant Negotiations and Activities and Offering Them Substantial Foreign Assistance in the Form of Humanitarian Aid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Solvency<br />
The Middle East is in a Deadlock Precisely Because of the Obviousness of Solutions—Our Investment in Preserving the Ambiguity of the Status Quo Means Pragmatic Politics Will Inevitably Fail—Empirically, in Israel and Palestine, the Only Possibility to Alter the Situation is the True Act of Recognizing and Relating to the Former Enemy/Terrorist.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, “The Iraqi MacGuffin,” April 11th, 2004 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/iraq1.htm#copy%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/iraq1.htm#copy)</a><br />
The big mystery apropos of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is… line of de Gaulle or even Richard Nixon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Persistence of the “Palestinian Question” Testifies to the Legacy of Anti-Semitism—Embracing Palestine as the Abandonment of the European Anti-Semitic Legacy Strikes at the Heart of Zionism.<br />
Joseph Massad, assistant professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University, “The Persistence of the Palestinian Question,” Cultural Critique, #59, Winter 2005, pp. 1-23<br />
The persistence of anti-Semitism… hatred of Jewish Jews and of the Palestinians.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Act of Recognition Illustrates the Contingency of Identity—Things Could Have Been Different, Israelis Could Be Palestinians, etc.—Such a Recognition Allows For a True Openness to the World (Gender Modified)<br />
Jacqueline Rose, Professor of English at Queen Mary University of London, The Question of Zion, 2005, p.100-102<br />
I like to think that Ahad Ha'am… free from the tribunal of tomorrow.&quot;
