 1. The Affirmative’s concern with the environment treats nature as a energy source to be commodified and consumed. This relationship of “standing reserve” is characterized by control over resources.<br />
<strong>KINSELLA 2006</strong><br />
William Kinsella, Ph.D Assistant Professor at North Carolina State University, “Heidegger and Being at the Hanford Reservation: Linking Phenomenology, Environmental Communication, and Communication Theory”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allacademic.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.allacademic.com</a><em>meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/9/0/9/8/pages90982/p90982-1.php<br />
</em>Heidegger’s concept of ... disruption of the natural order.<em><br />
<br />
2. This belief in controlling nature through technology is like a nuclear war in slow motion. Even the destruction of the earth pales in comparison to the ontological damnation we find ourselves in when we treat nature as a “standing reserve” to be consumed.<br />
<strong>ZIMMERMAN 1994</strong><br />
Michael Zimmerman, 1994, Professor of Philosophy at Tulane University, “Contestinq Earth's Future” p. 119-120<br />
</em>Heidegger asserted ... as good as dead.<em><br />
<br />
3. What’s to be done? We can’t simply “rush in” to technological intervention, no matter how urgent the catastrophe seems. We reject the Affirmative’s managerial control over nature, and believe that deliberation is the only solution.<br />
<strong>MCWHORTER 1992</strong><br />

</em>When we attempt to think ... provision or predetermined aim.//<br />
<h1 id="toc2"><a name="Capitalism"></a><u>Capitalism</u></h1>
 1. The Affirmative’s attempt to modify the market through subsidy removal relies on a bankrupt understanding of capitalist monetary policies. While the plan might be a good idea, it rests on a faulty assumption – economic instruments are actually tools for coercion that extend the destructive powers of the state.<br />
<strong>NEGRI 1980</strong><br />
Antonio (Toni), Crisis of the Crisis State, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://libcom.org/library/crisis-state-antonio-negri" rel="nofollow">http://libcom.org/library/crisis-state-antonio-negri</a><br />
<em>The basic weapon that capital ... coercive powers of the state.</em><br />
<br />
2. This logic that we can solve every problem with the application of just a little more capitalism is the logic of sacrificial destruction. This belief that properly applied market capitalism can solve any problem underlies the logic of the end of history.<br />
<strong>SANTOS 2003</strong><br />
Boaventura De Sousa Santos, Director Of Center For Social Studies At The University Of Coimbra, 2003, “Collective suicide?&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html" rel="nofollow">http://bad.eserver.org/issues/2003/63/santos.html</a><br />
<em>According to Franz Hinkelammert ... notion of the end of history.</em><br />
<br />
3. The Affirmative falls victim to the temptation to “directly intervene” and attempt to “change things.” The actual solution is to reject the idea that action is required to solve problems. Our alternative is to say NO and reject capitalism outright.<br />
