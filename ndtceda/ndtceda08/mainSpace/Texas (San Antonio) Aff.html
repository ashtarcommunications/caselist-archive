<br />
We run a &quot;performance&quot; aff that deals with quirin. There is a movie that we<br />
put together and its just a bunch of random clips from nature, the Iraq war,<br />
celebrities, 9-11, and some scenes of people in Gitmo. We play clips from<br />
the radio broadcast habeous shmabeous from NPR and we site a study done by<br />
Seton hall about Guantanamo bay. It can be found at<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://law.shu.edu/news/guantanamo_report_final_2_08_06.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://law.shu.edu/news/guantanamo_report_final_2_08_06.pdf</a>. We then<br />
&quot;recite&quot; &quot;poetry&quot; over a beat. We have an advocacy statement that we<br />
will hand to the other team each round--but it isn't read in the round...<br />
this is probably where people run their got to have a stable text for pics<br />
argument, but it is just a way to show that we are sticking to an advocacy<br />
from round to round.<br />
