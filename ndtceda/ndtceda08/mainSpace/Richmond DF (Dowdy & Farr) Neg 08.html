The modern age is committed to a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempts to order life and renounce suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal real in opposition to the apparent world of chaos and violence. Enter the affirmative. In the modern drive toward certainty and security and, in an attempting at resolving disorder and insecurity the plan labors to mold the world to make it fit into an idealized image of order.<br />
<br />
Saurette 1996 (Paul, professor of political theory at John Hopkins U “I mis trust all systematizers and avoid them: Nietzsche, Arendt, and the Crisis of the Will to Order in International relations Theory” Journal of International Studies, 25.1 pg 1-28) <br />
<br />
According to Neitzsche, the philosophical foundation…philosophical principle of modernity. <br />
<br />
<br />
We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently comprised of danger and insecurity in an attempt at reclaiming joy from the affirmative’s world of paranoid tiptoeing. <br />
<br />
James DerDerian 1998 (professor of political science at Amhert, U Mass., The political subject of violence, p. 101- 105)<br />
<br />
One must begin with Neitzsche’s idea of the will to power…calculation of risks and benefits<br />
<br />
<br />
September 11th, the war in Iraq, Katrina- all these events confirm the error and futility of predicting and managing crises. The scenario to planning of the aff does not resolve threats but ironically turns them into the very catastrophes we try to avoid. <br />
<br />
James Der Derian 2005. (National Security: An accident waiting to happen” Harvard International Review 27.3 p.83) <br />
<br />
It often takes a catastrophe to reveal the illusory beliefs…networked systems that defy national management; in other words, planned disorders. <br />
<br />
<br />
The alternative is to do nothing<br />
Frederich Nietzsche 1897, Human, All Too Human, Maxim #284<br />
<br />
In favor of the idle…you do think I am alluding to you, do you, you sluggards?<br />
<br />
While we do not have an explicit blueprine for what a world of the alternative would look like, the first step to real change is a commited step away from the existing order of things<br />
<br />
Zizek 2004 Iraq: The Borrowed Kettle p.71-2<br />
<br />
The stance of simply condemning…from the compulsion to act, to do nothing- thus opening up the space for a different kind of activity. <br />

The modern age is committed to a disavowal of tragedy. The triump of Socratic reason manifest in our attempts to order life and renounce suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal real in opposition to the apparent world of chaose and violecn.e Enter the AFf. In the modern drive toward certainty and secuty and, in an attempting at resolving disorder and insecurity, the plan labors to moold the world to make it fit into an idealized image of order.<br />
Saurette, ’96 (Paul, “I Mistrust all Systematizers and Avoid them: Nietasche, Arendt, and the Crisis of the Will to Order in Internaitonal Relations Theory,” Journal of Internatioanl Studies)<br />
According to Nietzsche…the Truth, and the Real<br />
<br />
The aff is only another breaking news tory warning us of the chaos which surrounds us ans compelling us toward resoling that chaos Unforutnatley, our attmepst at secuifng the world are admned to fail. It is not a coincidence that bbreaking news occurs every fifteen minutes because international politics are unpredictable. Terrorism is an ever prestn threat, a SARS outbreak is just around the corner, killer bees are invading our neighborhoods and there just might be poison in the hidren’s Halloween candy. The uncomfroable yet irresistible truth is that human life is dangerous. Rather htan coming to terms with this condition, the aff encourages us tto say sglued to the tv scre, stocking up on dcuct tape and water. AT tissue here is not just life but what makes life worth living. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently comprised of danger and insecurity in an attempt at reclaiming joy from the affimrative’s world of paranoid tiptoeing.<br />
