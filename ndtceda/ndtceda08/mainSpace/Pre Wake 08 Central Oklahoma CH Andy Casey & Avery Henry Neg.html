<u><strong>DEATH FRAMEWORK</strong></u><br />
THE AFFIRMATIVES DISCUSSION OF DEATH AND ROLEPLAYING AS THE STATE TO SAVE LIFE MAKES FOR DANGEROUS POLICYMAKING THAT PROMOTES A STATE MONOPOLY OF THE CONTROL OF LIFE AND DEATH. THE SUBVERSIVE NATURE OF SUICIDE BECOMES PROHIBITTED BY THE CAPITALIZATION OF LIFE.<br />
Baudrillard 1993, <u>symbolic exchange and death</u>, p 175-6<br />
This is why….dissolution and negation<br />
OUR ARGUMENT IS NOT THAT PLAN OR POLICY DEBATE IS BAD, RATHER DEBATING ABOUT DEATH NUMBS US TO SOCIAL CONTROLS THAT SECURITIZE ALL LIFE FROM DEATH PLACING LIFE IN A VALUE-LESS SARCOPHAGUS, MAKING US UNABLE TO ETHICALLY RELATE TO POLICY ISSUES. CONSIDER THIS ARGUMENT A GATEWAY ISSUE – IF THEY JUSTIFY DISCUSSIONS OF DEATH THEN WE CAN HAVE THE REST OF THE FOLLOWING DEBATE, IF NOT THEY LOSE BECAUSE THEIR FORM OF ROLEPLAYING DOESN’T MAKE US BETTER ADVOCATES BUT RATHER DESK KILLERS. THIS IS A VOTING ISSUE.<br />

Fear of the bomb and the abstract desire to survive displaces the value to life. Only a rejection of nuclear extortion can maintain meaningful existence.<br />
Baudrillard Amerique p 42-44<br />
Everywhere survival has become a burning issue…. A political fact of the utmost importance,<br />
<br />
Antagonisms create a crisis for utopia.n politics. The politics today is one of aporia. The affirmative posits these antagonisms as mere stumbling blocks on the path to harmony. The idea of utopia created by the affirmative sets in motion an imaginary revolution to social contradiction. These contradictions have been represented in different ways throughout history – the Indian in early America, Jews in Nazi Germany. Once stigmatized, these various forms of disorder are readied for extermination. A world of the affirmative is one of inevitable and perpetual violence.<br />
Stavrakakis, Lacan and the Political 91-101<br />
Our age is clearly one of social fragmentation….as a highly problematic area.<br />
<br />
<br />
The social encoding which resorts via the affirmative is an attempt at the despotic paranoic machine to breed humans, to make them to show alliances, this mode of ordering leads to atrocities such as the holocaust. Also turns case because it upholds the same division of inside outside which allows for those on the outside to be constructed as a threat.<br />
Perez, An(ARCHY) and Schizoanalysis 18-20<br />
On the other hand we have the community which sets up the despotic State….. is usually a will to violence and oppression.<br />

 Disclosure rd 1 vs. Wayne St. HP – Dog the Bounty Hunter and the Ghost-faced killaz<br />
We criticized their muslim brotherhood adv and the economy advantages. ….the 1nc was --<br />
The earnestness of the 1nc should not be underestimated. Desire produces reality and thus attending to it is of utmost importance. The world they describe is both objective and real because they have desired it and produced it is as such. They represent the status quo existence of subsidies as a lack in the current order, something is missing from their completed subject. The affirmative ego necessitates a capture through a parasitic passive synthesis via removing those subsidies.<br />
This is Deleuze and Guattari in 1983<br />
(Anti-oedipus, p 26-27)avery<br />
The affirmative’s assessment lures us into believing the issue is one of ideology, ultimately however, the masses are not fooled by ideology’s illusions; but rather, by their unconscious libidinal investments. Consequently, the ballot is not a question of what ought be, rather, it is an issue of why are we aroused by the very things we hate.<br />
This is Deleuze and Guattary in 1983 (anti-oedipus, p 104-105)<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"> </span><br />
<br />
Furthermore, Desire is revolutionary: threatening to undermine the established order described in the 1ac. Conversely, the affirmative’s description of the status quo is thus based on a methodologically flawed conception of desire as lacking. Their response necessitates a repression of desire so as to preserve the self-serving reality of the 1ac. This produces the Oedipal structures that our lives are coordinated from.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in 1983 (anti-oedipus 116)avery<br />
Next, the affirmative displays a group fantasy that concentrates and controls the individual fantasy. This construction of a pseudo-destiny represses desire subordinating the molecular individual into the goals of making the current apparatus seem inevitable.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in 1983 (anti-oedipus, p 53-53)avery<br />
<span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Further, the affirmative’s goals, interests, intentions, or ideologies are absolutely irrelevant they are a secondary priority to the original desire to be a cog in the machine. The ignorance of their unconscious investments ultimately represses desire and thus compels us to desire our own repression. This life they want is represented as a shining city on a hill that we must fight for. We enact our joy from working for the immortality of the social. We commit violence without purpose, we are simply doing our duty, we are destroying Ben Tre in order to save it.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in 83 (anti-oedipus, p 345-347)avery<br />
What the fuck is death? The affirmative’s conception is incomprehensible. Their Death assumes a terminal endpoint of a static subject which has been turned against itself in civilization to construct relationships of guilt. Death is ultimately not something to be feared, but is a constant process that works through life and for life. The very notion of becoming comes out of this void.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in 83 (anti-oedipus: capitalism and schizophrenia, p 330-31)avery<br />
This brings us to the discussion of the war-machine. A War-machine is a form of desire, a desire that is of an origin that compels it against the state apparatus. This productive revolutionary desire can easily be reduced to fascism if the state apparatus can capture it. The affirmative is another example of a fascist paranoiac pole; plan represents a new axiom to which the world is subordinated. This line of flight becomes a line of death and destruction that culminates in rivers of blood in the streets. The war-machine’s original destination is diverted into a production of pure war that annihilates not only the periphery but also all of those in the center in order to sustain the immortality of the system. The notion of the affirmative’s impacts are culminated by the need for group to risk destroying not only themselves but also the entirety of the world in order to prove that they are right.<br />
This is Deleuze and Guattari in 1987 (a thousand plateaus p 229-231)avery<br />
<br />
The task of the revolutionary includes voting negative to be anti-oedipal, anti-ego, and anti-homo. In order to initiate a radical politics of desire one must resist the sphere of political totality, to be a war-machine that strikes the sameness and unity of politics. The strict adherence to the forms of authority, the oedipal yoke, consolidates and colonizes the socius. This creates not only suffering but drastically alters the tone of our lives.<br />
Mark Seem in 1983 (anti-oedipus, p xx-xxi)avery<br />
The central question of the ballot revolves around how we can create a politics of difference. Our politics is coordinated off of our responses to difference, thus, our criticism hails us to remake social practices in a way that allows the free flow of desire in contrast to the repression of desire.<br />
This is Felix Guattari in 2003 (The guattari reader, “remaking social practices”)avery, also online. </span><br />

<strong><u>Negatives for UCO CH and UCO SS</u></strong><br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">The affirmatives description of the status quo is based upon the blindness of western knowledge’s objectivity which is a doctrine of science manipulated by religion. These Naïve descriptions of reality are unfounded, knowledge is relative, there is a liberating facet of not knowing what allows us to create a new picture of reality.<br />
<br />
Deloria 99<br />
<u>For This Land.</u> Pg. 103-105<br />
<br />
There is an underside to the affirmative that is glossed over by the 1ac’s progressive narrative. This underside is the relationship to land, the destruction of native Americans, and the trail of subsidies that followed the extermination of the buffalo. They view the land as an advesary and attempt to enclose land into territories, fields, and landscapes. This mindset alters the land and deprives it of its offering setting into corse a violent gridwork of oppositions.<br />
<br />
Marzec in 2001<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Colonization and the Robinson Crusoe Syndrome: A Genealogy of Land in a Global Context.</span></em> (Project Muse)<br />
<br />
This ideological state of knowledge that the affirmative subscribes to enables a mass colonization of the “false” to the west’s distorted view of reality. This creates a pacification of any dissident others.<br />

The Focus of management of the world set catastrophe and violence into motion. Their role as managers of the planet enables us to forget the mystery of life by embracing the blindness of the multiple truths of the worlds reduces life to standing reserve.<br />

McWhorter in 92 (Ladelle, <u>Heidegger and the Earth</u>. ISBN 0943549068. Pg. 4-7)<br />
<br />
The Epistemic memory of American has been impaired- the spectre of the annihilation of native Americans has haunted our memories until recently when it was believed our memory was corrected because of the focus defeat of the Nazi’s and the Vietnamese- This forgetting hass allowed for genocidal violence to be conducted n the spectral other for centuries and makes that spectral violence inevitable.<br />
<br />
Spanos 2000 (William, <u>Anatomy of an Empire.</u> Pg. 261-262)<br />
<br />
Our alternative is a fundamental reorientation of the basic framework of reality. We renounce the affirmative’s call to action; this refusal resist the picure of reality set into motion by Western Epistomology. This reorientation allows us to decolonize this room and this debate space.<br />
