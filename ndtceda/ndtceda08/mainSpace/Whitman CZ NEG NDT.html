 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Framework –</strong> should be a topical plan that you look at in a vacuum. The USFG cannot do the plan, which means that their advantages are not garnered off the action of the plan. </span><br />
<ol><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Predictable ground – they could read any random K on the aff – they have no evidence that says removal of cotton subsidies specifically is key to getting their advantages. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Judge criteria – has to make a decision at the end of the round as a policy maker. </span></li><li><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Education – you destroy critical thinking skills and topic specific education because you could read this aff every year. </span></li></ol><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Voter </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Any other framework is illegitimate because must use the USFG and their action to solve for advantages. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Agricultural subsidies are a key rallying point in the struggle against capitalism. In the status quo, they are sparking proletariat organization and class consciousness.</strong></span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is not only defiance from governments …community and life itself</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Subsidy removal functions as a token concession temporarily appeasing the lower classes allowing agribusiness’ to consolidate their power – delays the revolution and makes starvation and poverty inevitable.</strong> </span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Framework</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Their major contention is that the aff’s symbolic action/moral obligation is not garnered from the material action of the plan. The point specific pieces of evidence that the aff needed to provided in order to meet this violation (like “removing cotton subsidies would destroy capitalism”, etc) and how not having those cards proves that the aff could be run on any topic, thus hurting education.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Cap K</strong> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Turns the case. Subsidies are key to the proletariat resistance. Plan of turning the cotton industry over to the free market by getting rid of subsidies further entrenches capitalistic notions that the free market is better, which means that the K solves for capitalism better.</strong> </span><br />

 <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Cap K – solves for cap better, the plan action hurts current anti-cap movements, and plan risks free market take over.</strong> </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> <u>Big Cotton CP</u><br />
TEXT: The United States federal government should ensure export prices for cotton capture the full cost of production, including the cost of marketing and a reasonable profit. The United States federal government should establish a supply management system for cotton including price floors, set asides and/or quota systems designed to prevent the export of cotton below the cost of production.<br />
The cost of production should be determined by consultation with independent and non-governmental organizations outside the agriculture industry, including Oxfam International. This cost should be set at a level which ensures that the price of cotton exported from the United States does not unfairly undermine the cotton sector of other economies.<br />
The United States Department of State and United States Trade Representative should engage the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in negotiations and participation in a comprehensive study on creating a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific including the United States but open to all members of APEC, although not requiring all members to join.<br />
The United States Department of Commerce should publicly announce its decision to end the use of zeroing methodology in the calculation of dumping margins. The United States Department of Commerce should immediately cease the practice of zeroing methodology.<br />
The United States Federal Government should not reduce or eliminate its agricultural support for at least the next two years, unless pursuant to completion of talks under the World Trade Organization. President Obama should stop pushing his current proposal to reduce agricultural support, including his proposal to end to direct payments for farms with sales of more than $500,000 per year, and a cap on annual farm subsidy payments at $250,000.<br />
