Round # 4<br />
Vs Team: George Mason HO<br />
Judge:<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
The threat of apocalypse is constructed to secure the power to administer life which simultaneously mobilizes the conditions for absolute annihilation<br />
Coviello 2k, Queer frontiers: Millennial georgraphies, genders, and generations, “Apocalypse from now on”, p. 40-41<br />
Perhaps. But to claim…can scarcely be done without.<br />
<br />
Destruction and decay are immanent components to life—politics driven by a fear of the apocalypse manifests a desire for a total control of time that culminates in the destruction of the natural world<br />
Wood and Doddy 95, www.vanerdbilt.edu/rpw_center/apocalypse.htm<br />
DOODY: For a long time…with a certain irony.<br />
<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
Hillman K<br />
<br />
War is archetypal..it is necessary to see war in its mythological context, war is an indelible part of the human condition, war is central to our mythic origins, our portrayal of mythological war is the only way to make war intelligible so that we may confront it, imagining war in this light is our only hope for survival<br />
Hillman 4, The terrible love of war p. 7-9<br />
Vico thinks like a…a leap into myth<br />
<br />
Aff imagination of war must be refused<br />
The creation of an alienated war in which lives are merely blips on computer screens is the product of war’s rationalization—the aff attempts to explain war in terms of political and strategic calculability is the baisis of new modern warfare which is devoid of humanness<br />
Hillman, p. 46<br />
<br />
Realism fails<br />
Hillman, p. 3<br />
<br />
Repression—war is inevitable part of human condition, attempts to suppress the desire leads to war in the name of peace<br />
Hillman, p. 201-205<br />
<br />
Repression of war through imagination of its practical solution is like going to sleep, detaching from our present condition, peace security and reason stand in the way of understanding war, and thus connecting with the world, war cannot go away, there is no solution, the aff’s imagination is a detachment from the world<br />
Hillman, p. 214-217<br />
<br />
Instability and conflict are permanent conditions of life. The appeal to security derives its strength from a false God that cannot sustain its promise. This abolition of disorder is an eradication of difference, guaranteeing unending cycles of violence. They cannot save the world, they can only domesticate it—rendering life unworthy of its own protection<br />
Der Derian 98, The value of security: Hobbes, Marx, Nietzsche and Baudrillard<br />
Nietzsche transvalues both…of risks and benefits<br />
<br />
Alt: The United States should go to war with Israel and Iran<br />
War is a timeless theme of human existence: it is not a ‘scenario’ and it can’t be ‘solved’. The way the 1AC approaches conflict guarantees its continuity and devastates the potential for understanding, to render war coherent it must be embraced<br />
Hillman, Terrible love of war, p. 1-9<br />
“We can never prevent war…leap into myth”<br />

T—Constructive engagement = unconditional<br />
CE is a carrot without a stick<br />
South China Morning Post, “tough words on Myanmar not enough”, 2006<br />
There was no indication…advantage to the regime<br />
<br />
CE does not include conditions<br />
Skinner 86, Beyond Constructive engagement: United States foreign policy towards Africa<br />
Crocker and his associates…not positive performances<br />
<br />
Conditions are the antithesis of CE<br />
Haas and O’Sullivan, Honey and Vinegar, p. 96-97<br />
Namibia—particularly linking…field for negotiations<br />

<strong>US assistance to the middle east is a neutralization of antagonism, their distinction beteween policing and genocide relies on this assumption</strong><br />
--Narani 05<br />
<br />
<strong>their world of friendship is based on a new category of enmity, their politix requires the creation of an alternate category to human to explain the existence of what they do not accept as human, enables the global exploitation of genocide</strong><br />
--oddyseus 04<br />
<br />
<strong>good is a malleable concept, all atrocities are committted in the name of the good</strong><br />
--Strong 04<br />
<br />
<strong>embrace of the human justifies the inhumanity of the enemy, justifies violence and war</strong><br />

<strong>Alt text: affirm our capacity to resist<br />

reconfiguring rights on existence is necessary 2 deal not with what we are, but with what we are not, aggressivity is good, we should say no instead of yes, the way they frame action legitimates all action in the name of democracy</strong><br />
