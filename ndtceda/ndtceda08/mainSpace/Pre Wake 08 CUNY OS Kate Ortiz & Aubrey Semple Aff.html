[Video of an Urban Farmer speaking about the inequalities of urban<br />
farming - ETA: 2 minutes and 4 seconds]<br />
<br />
1) On the national scale, urban farmers are still ignored within the<br />
social-economic politics and sovereignty in the field of agriculture<br />
for ethiticies of color. The current structure of this government<br />
leaves us to be non-existent. Yet, instead of questioning in the end<br />
minorities is setup to be silenced and ignored and left trampled<br />
through the bureaucratic system.<br />

<br />
2) Thus - The deterioration and eventual destruction of communities<br />
begin. The fruitful diversity of the community becomes homogenized and<br />
taken over by the predominantly white greenmarkets. We are faced with<br />
issues such as obesity because limited access to fresh greens leaves<br />
us to opt towards McDonald's being the means for a cheap, sustainable<br />
diet.<br />

<br />
3) This disconnection to urban farming are indicative of the racism of<br />
the status quo which has given rise to the formation of white<br />
privilege, a racist construct that seeks to further de facto<br />
segregation within the area of agriculture, profiting outside of urban<br />
communities.<br />

<br />
4) This allows for state racism give way to a mindset of<br />
dispostability. Such disposability causes discriminatory genocide and<br />
a multiplicity of other negative impacts within the urban community.<br />

<br />
Endorsing the resolution silences the realities of farmers,<br />
particularly minority farmers who demonstrate their autonomy by<br />
producing food in the communities in which they live. The debate<br />
community, in its traditional practices, replicates its failure of<br />
assessing the topic as limited to normalized topic-specific evidence,<br />
ignoring local communities and their stories. Thus, our advocacy in<br />
this debate is to highlight the inequalities of urban farmers in<br />
relation to subsidies.<br />
<br />
5) This begins by recognizing that our individual politics allows us<br />
to formulate on different levels in initiating problems solutions.<br />

<br />
6) To solve for the injustices of the world requires listening rather<br />
than policy experts. The plan's emphasis on highlighting<br />
disenfranchised voices provides the best hope for solving the global<br />
food crisis, protecting women's rights, US Crop Dumping and WTO<br />
failures. Change begins with those who have been fighting hardest for<br />
it.<br />

7) It is imperative that we must include our personal politics to sort<br />
through the contradiction that exists, not only in our debate<br />
community but the world. The embracement of self-narrative is key and<br />
must be evaluated first in regards to how you as a judge adjudicate<br />
your decision.<br />
