Karakul hats are graining great popularity around the globe – This marriage of capitalist fashion and human centered orientation causes slaughter on a grand scale<br />

<br />
This rising industry of slaughter impedes into arenas of culture – this cruel practice is hotly debated among individuals who self-associate as citizens of Afghanistan – the alternative to the karakul would be for Karzai to wear a turban – this would allow for an embracement of self-identified culture without torture<br />

Our proposal for change:<br />
<br />
…..<br />
The United States federal government should make standing offer to government of Afghanistan to increase assistance for non-livestock livelihood programs on the condition that Karakul slaughter no longer take place.<br />
…..<br />
<br />
We initially begin with a traditional Policy Defense<br />

<br />
Some might question the use of Aid, but is inevitable – it is only a question of what kind - Other donors will soon be giving money for lamb growing strategies as part of alternative livelihood programs – a recent report will spur more money<br />

<br />
– even in a world where Karzai says NO or a world where the comparison of alternatives moves beyond the plan and the status quo or a legitimate government option – Our policy is desirable<br />
<br />
Advocating for legal change is a critical place to both EXPOSE the problems of cruelty to the non-human AND an opportunity for us to advocate for change beyond the question of the Karakhul<br />

Some might say that there are other cruelties that need to be addressed….or that legislation is inherently oppressive….these dichotomies and search for the PERFECT path causes unnecessary suffering – we must embrace piecemeal efforts whenever we are approached with them<br />

It might be desirable to imagine away legislation, but that will not address the current legislators – our affirmative is an attempt to inform legislators so that they may take less violent action – ignoring the legislative arena only fosters more violence and suffering<br />

I keep a weblog so that I can breathe in this suffocating air … In a society where one is taken to history’s abattoir for the mere crime of thinking, I write so as not to be lost in my despair … so that I feel that I am somewhere where my calls for justice can be uttered … I write a weblog so that I can shout, cry and laugh, and do the things that they have taken way from me in Iran today …<br />

A year later Iran adopts one of the worlds most advanced Internet filtering regimes in the world - they import their filtering technology from US companies and export their control over what to filter<br />

At last it’s over. I’ve spent the last five years in the nasty hell-hole of May’boad.* But it’s over … I’ve packed my things and moved back home. I remember when I started my course at that so-called university … we must have been the first group of single girls entering that God-forsaken place and setting up on our own … so many times coming home and washing the spit of passers-by off my clothes … they just could not tolerate our shameful headscarves … They say that things are changing and extremists are getting more tolerant … a friend of mine even thinks that we started a revolution here … It’s been just five years, but the same shopkeepers who would refuse to serve us if we were not wearing a chador now have teenage daughters who dress more provocatively than we ever dared to … Looking around this tiny town, only five years later you see that many of the local young girls have shed their black chadors. We did not start a revolution here. Our ‘allegedly Reformist President’ did not bring about a more tolerant society … Societies evolve and change and it’s the ordinary people that change them … 70 per cent of our population is under 30 and many just don’t want to live like their parents used to … Eventually they will have to … not just tolerate us … but also live by our rules …<br />

 Ahmadinejad is weakened - constructive engagement NOW with Iran through opening diplomatic channels leads to peace in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and the West Bank<br />

We begin with the status quo<br />
Iran considers enrichment of uranium a national security interest and will not give it up regardless of sanctions or pressure. They feel that the option is enough to deter threats and seek enrichment to relieve oil for export through nuclear technology<br />
Simpson, 2006<br />
(John [Director of the Mountbatten Centre for International Studies and Professor of International Relations at the University of Southampton] The Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research, “Iran’s Nuclear Program: Realities and Repercussions”, p. 21-23) KZ<br />
<br />
However, the Bush administration feels that Iran enrichment of uranium crosses the ‘red line’ of nuclear capability - escalation concerns and public popularity don’t matter – escalation is going to happen with our current foreign policy towards Iran and we will strike first<br />
Lodgaard, 2006<br />
(Sverre [Director of the Norwegian Institute of International Affiars. His areas of specialization include security policy; United Nations, NATO and European Union Affairs; arms control and disarmament; security and development; peace operations; and Norwegian foreign affairs] The Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research, “Iran’s Nuclear Program: Realities and Repercussions”, p. 113-115) KZ<br />
<br />
And, the United States will fail to gain support for UNSC sanctions and has zero political clout because China and Russia are adamant economic partners with Iran – STRATCOM has already drawn up plans for hitting 1500 targets and Bush is locked into authorizing it before he leaves office<br />

Plan<br />
The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Iran and it should include offering them a security guarantee of territorial sovereignty in exchange for normalization of relations between the United States Federal Government and the government of Iran.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage One – Iran Prolif<br />
Attacking Iran would not be successful in eliminating Iran’s ability to create nuclear weapons and would supercharge the current regime to the point of eliminating all dissent in the country – transitioning their uranium development toward nuclear proliferation instead of nuclear power<br />

<br />
A security guarantee would give Iran the perception that America is no longer a security risk would remove the nuclear threat<br />

<br />
Advantage Four – Iran Democracy<br />
Iran is unable to implement a totalitarian regime but after 2005 it has consolidated conservative power over every branch and is currently actively transitioning the government towards an authoritarian power<br />
Hen-Tov, 2006<br />

Democrat movements in Iran have been dealt a series of setbacks – despite this a democratic transition is possible – only US engagement can kick start the process and spur democratization in Iran<br />
