<u><strong>Observation One: The Ocean in Peril</strong></u><br />
<br />
1. We’ve reached a crossroads – continued overfishing has placed the world’s oceans at a tipping point.<br />
<strong>OCEANA 2007</strong><br />
May 24, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oceana.org/north-america/what-we-do/cut-the-bait/learn-the-facts/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oceana.org/north-america/what-we-do/cut-the-bait/learn-the-facts/</a><br />
<em>In May 2007 ... path for the future.</em><br />
<br />
2. It’s all our fault. Overfishing has rapidly outstripped climate change as the number one threat to ocean health. If we continue fishing at today’s levels, we’ll witness global disease outbreaks, the destruction of countless ecosystems, and massive extinctions.<br />
<strong>SCIENCE DAILY 2008</strong><br />
Science Daily August 13, 2008. &quot;Mass Extinctions and 'Rise of Slime' Predicted for Oceans&quot;<br />
<em>Human activities ... hands of overfishing.</em><br />
<br />
3. Overfishing is the main culprit in this upcoming environmental apocalypse. Not only will extinctions rob us of seafood, but will deliver a global blow to biodiversity.<br />
<strong>JACKSON 2008</strong><br />
Jeremy Jackson, PNAS August 12, 2008. &quot;Ecological extinction and evolution in the brave new ocean.&quot;<br />
<em>Coastal ecosystems ... in human behavior.</em><br />
<br />
4. The destruction of marine biodiversity impairs the planet’s ability to support life. Policymakers are obliged to protect the marine ecosystem – the survival of the biosphere is at stake.<br />
<strong>CRAIG 2003</strong><br />
Indiana University, Robin Kundis Craig, Winter, 34 McGeorge L. Rev. 155, p. 264-266<br />
<em>Biodiversity and ecosystem ... biosphere with us.</em><br />
<br />
5. Biodiversity is the ultimate impact. The destruction of species and ecosystems can cause quick, irreversible and complete breakdowns in the fabric of the biosphere. In fewer words, if we can’t protect the ocean, we’ll all be extinct and soon.<br />
<strong>DINER 1994</strong><br />
David Diner, Judge Advocate’s General’s Corps of US Army, Military Law Review, Winter<br />
<em>In past mass extinction episodes ... the risk of disaster.</em><br />
<br />
6. Any risk of extinction must be rejected – none of us has the right to gamble with the elimination of life of a global scale.<br />
<strong>SCHELL 82</strong><br />
Jonathan Schell, Wesleyan University, THE FATE OF THE EARTH, 1982, p.95<br />
<em>To employ a mathematical analogy ... get another chance.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>PLAN</strong>: The United States Federal government should eliminate nearly all fishing subsidies.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>Observation Two: The Domino Effect</strong></u><br />
<br />
1. US leadership is critical to getting other nations on board to save the world’s oceans—sea turtles prove the empirical example of this success:<br />

<em>As a leading ... measures for U.S. waters.</em><br />
<br />
2. The US is the critical actor to catalyze a global change on overfishing. Our ability to leverage trade pressures to set international norms is contingent on taking the first step.<br />
<strong>PEW 2003</strong><br />

<em>In order to meet ... is ours to take.</em><br />
<br />
3. US action on subsidies is critical to create global consensus on subsidy removal. A strong position from the US sparks international action within months.<br />
<strong>OCEANA 2007</strong><br />
Washington-based nonprofit organization <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oceana.org/fileadmin/oceana/uploads/dirty_fishing/cut_the_bait/2007_Subs_outreach_kit/Subsidies_Backgrounder_FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oceana.org/fileadmin/oceana/uploads/dirty_fishing/cut_the_bait/2007_Subs_outreach_kit/Subsidies_Backgrounder_FINAL.pdf</a> 2/23/2007<br />
Concerns about the ... of fish available to consumers.<br />
<br />
4. US fishing subsidies are the sole cause of overfishing. Remove subsidies, and the economic losses would slash overfishing and eliminate the threat to fish stocks. Oddly enough, this scenario would actually INCREASE the amount of fish available to consumers.<br />
<strong>SAUNDERS 2007</strong><br />
Doug Saunders, the chief of the Globe and Mail's London-based European Bureau, “A dose of global cod-liver oil”, May 26th<br />
<em>To find out ... an ideal solution.</em><br />
<br />
5. Eliminating fishing subsidies is the single greatest action that can be taken to stop overfishing.<br />
<strong>OCEANA 2007</strong><br />
Feb 20, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.oceana.org/fileadmin/oceana/uploads/dirty_fishing/cut_the_bait/2007_Subs_outreach_kit/Oceans_in_Trouble_FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.oceana.org/fileadmin/oceana/uploads/dirty_fishing/cut_the_bait/2007_Subs_outreach_kit/Oceans_in_Trouble_FINAL.pdf</a><br />
<em>Oceans cover more ... communities that depend on them.</em><br />
<br />
6. No plan of action that fails to remove subsidies will solve overfishing. Removing subsidies is the only way to effectively stop the practice.<br />
<strong>OCEANA 2007</strong><br />
“Fisheries Subsidies: The good, the bad, and the ugly,” June 5 2007<br />
<em>Massive government subsidies ... continue to exist.</em><br />

Read Econ add-on:<br />
a.) Removing fishing subsidies would shock the economy back into shape. US action would catalyze a global response.<br />

<em>Subsidizing fishing ... overfishing worldwide, he said.</em><br />
<br />
b.) Managing our fishing resources is tied to managing the economy. The fishing industry is a key engine for the global economy.<br />
