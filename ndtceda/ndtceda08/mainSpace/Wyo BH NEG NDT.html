 <br />
First, like the woman who cuts her nose to spite her face – the aff’s desire for a true and perfect world is the fatalistic condemnation of this world, the only world possible<br />
Nietzsche, 1906, (“The Will to Power”, Online, MB) “It is of cardinal importance that one should …. Itself up by the holiest names and attitudes.”<br />
<br />
Second, fantasizing about a world without suffering produces creative impotence, it causes us to hate this world because it causes us pain we can’t deal with. Only our relationship to life can escape this paradox of resentment. Their imagination of a better world is a continuation of the ascetic ideal. This association of all that is good at not of this world expresses a hatred for the only one we’ve got turns case<br />
Turlani, 2003, Aydan, “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World”, The Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 26, (2003), 55-63)<br />
“The craving for absolutely general specifications … the way out of the fly-bottle””<br />
<br />
First, the attempt to solve suffering only enslaves us<br />
Kain, 2007, Phillip, “Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the Horror of Existence”, The Nietzsche Journal, Project Muse<br />
“For the same reason, I do not think …. Is to enslave yourself to that suffering.”<br />
<br />
The 1ac’s vision of a perfect world causes us to hate the one we have, leads to denial of life of this life for a more perfect one<br />
Nietzsche, 1872, (“The Birth of Tragedy”, Online, MB)<br />
“Already in the preface addressed to Richard Wagner …. In the name of a Greek god: I called it Dionysian._”<br />
<br />
Existence is will to power, this is the only way to understand existence<br />
Aydin, 2007, (Ciano, “Nietzsche on Reality as Will to Power”, Journal of Nietzsche Studies, 33 (2007), Project Muse, online)<br />
“We can begin with some elaboration of Nietzsche’s notion of …. Other interpretations always remain possible.”<br />
<br />
The aff’s aesthetic harmony rests of the chaotic underpinnings of the universe that only the alt can expose. We cannot control the outcomes of life only our relationship to it<br />
Carty, 2003, Anthony, “SYMPOSIUM: NIETZSCHE AND LEGAL THEORY (PART II): CAN LAWYERS BE CURED?: ETERNAL RECURRENCE AND THE LACANIAN DEATH DRIVE”, Cardozo Law Review, March) Lexis<br />
“In The Birth of Tragedy and The Will to Power … strives nobly towards higher things.”<br />
<br />
There are no moral facts, only profound depths of unconscious and irrational forces which drive us and determine our destiny. We should allow full reign of these forces and rejoice in the ecstatic affirmation of the total character of life, declaring even the most qualities of life as good<br />
Carty, 2003, Anthony, “SYMPOSIUM: NIETZSCHE AND LEGAL THEORY (PART II): CAN LAWYERS BE CURED?: ETERNAL RECURRENCE AND THE LACANIAN DEATH DRIVE”, Cardozo Law Review, March) Lexis<br />
“The difference between Nietzsche and Socrates … unity of creation and destruction. N43”<br />
<br />
Eternal return is the original law. Chaos did not come into existence, but is the ever present and cyclical force of existence<br />
Deleuze, 83, [Gilles, “Nietzsche and Philosophy”, 1983, pgs. 27-29 <em>uwyo-cheek]<br />
“Whereas the thrown dice affirm chance once ….. and of play in necessity” (PTG)”<br />
<br />
First, the aff presumes the world is reaching toward a teleological goal. This is a false metaphysics. The world repeats itself endlessly. Nations rise and fall, individuals live, love and die and the world continues to exist as it always has<br />
Jeanne Shroeder, 2003, “SYMPOSIUM: NIETZSCHE AND LEGAL THEORY (PART II): CAN LAWYERS BE CURED?: ETERNAL RECURRENCE AND THE LACANIAN DEATH DRIVE”, Cardozo Law Review, March) Lexis<br />
“Nietzsche invites us to consider … the moral problems posed by modernity. N26”<br />
<br />
Embedded in this quest, is the 1ac’s vision of a more perfect state and society, they isolate instances of suffering in the world and try to eliminate those conditions, the problem with this is that suffering and violence are conditions that are necessary and essential to life itself<br />
Nietzsche, 1878, (Friedrich, “Human, All Too Human”, The Nietzsche Channel, online, MB)<br />
“Genius incompatible with the ideal state … the state is most thoroughly thwarted.”<br />
<br />
Second, even if we could reduce suffering, we cannot eliminate it. Any progress we make will imminently disappear into time and confirm the horror and meaninglessness of existence. We must affirm life in his entirety, even suffering rather than let it weaken us by continually hoping to overcome it.<br />
Kain, 2007, Phillip, “Nietzsche, Eternal Recurrence, and the Horror of Existence”, The Nietzsche Journal, Project Muse<br />
“Knowledge of the horror of existence kills action … the horror and meainglessness of existence.”<br />
<br />
The aff’s use of causality and probability abolish chance and necessity, this is the marking of a bad player that embraces the spirit of revenge through resentment and bad conscience<br />
Deleuze, 83 [Giles, “Nietzsche and Philosophy”, Pg. 25-27</em> uwyo-cheek]<br />
“The game has two moments which are those …of the fatally obtained number. 23”<br />
<br />
We cannot know or understand the world, every attempt to analyze the world is an attempt to read ourselves into it, no viewpoint or combination of perspectives can ever let us understand the world in its entirety, there will always be chaotic portions of the world we turn a blind eye to<br />
Zupanic, 2003, (Alenka, Philosopher, “The Shortest Shadow: Nietzche’s philosophy of the two”, Online, MB)<br />
“”Explanation” is what we call it …. Of the looking-glass of representation.”<br />
<br />
The impacts of the aff are inevitable, we are in a eternal reccurence of exploitation and will to power<br />
Nietzche, 1886, (Friedrich, Philosopher with a hammer, “Beyond Good and Evil”, The Nietzche Channel, online, MB)<br />
“257 EVERY elevation of the type …. Be so far honest towards ourselves!”<br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our role is to explain and interpret human action, to speak of an ought invokes the will.<br />
Schopenhauer in 1859.<br />
All life is willing, wuffering is a consequence of wil, thus all life is suffering.<br />
Migotti, 95.<br />
All life is suffering, no human life is preferable to non-being.<br />
Migotti 95. (Mark, “Schopenhauer’s Pessimism and the Unconditioned Good,” 1995 Project MUSE, online, MB).<br />
The past or the future don’t matter, existence is the ever present, our lives are nothing more than a passing moment that is flashed out in the end. Schopenhauer, 2004. “Studies in Pessimis,” online </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10732-8.txt" rel="nofollow">__http://www.gutenberg.org/ files/10732-8.txt__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">, MB<br />
Life is Endless suffering and a constant process of dying. The individual is doomed to a cautious life in fear of an inevitable death that rushes toward them. Schopenhauer 1859.<br />
Life is a cheat – a never-ending existence of miser and suffering, it would be better if the earth were like the moon devoid of life. Schopenhauer, 2004. “Studies in Pessimis,” online </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10732-8.txt" rel="nofollow">__http://www.gutenberg.org/ files/10732-8.txt__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">, MB<br />
We should embrace nothingness, it’s the ultimate salvation from the inevitable suffering that the will creates. Schopenhauer 1859.<br />
To live is to will, and to will is to suffer. The only way to end suffering is to negate the will and turn away from life itself. Schopenhauer 1859.<br />
At its best, life is a delayed dying. There is no value to life and our only hope to end the inevitable suffering of this world is to embrace our owne extinction. Jacquette in 2k. (Dale, Dpt of Philo @ Penn State Uni. “Shcopenhauer on the Ethics of Suicide,” Continental Philosophy Review, 33: 43-58, 2000) “What is death? … will to life.”<br />
We Should embrace death it is the ultimate denial of the will which is necessary to end the suffering of existence, Schopenhauer 1859.<br />
Life brings only disappointment, preserving for future generations is like watching a bad magic act over and over again. Schopenhauer, 2004. “Studies in Pessimis,” online </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10732-8.txt" rel="nofollow">__http://www.gutenberg.org/ files/10732-8.txt__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">, MB “If two men… cold blood.”<br />

The world order created by the affirmative allows absolute destruction of all those who fit outside their vision of what it means to be human<br />
Rasch 2003 “Human Rights as Geopolitics” Project Muse<br />
Yes this passage………of the liberal order<br />

Seacomb 2000- “fractured community” Project muse<br />
The aboriginal political strategy……….the living community<br />
<br />
Crucial to this process is the 1ac’s depiction of mastery over death they proclaim they can tame, conquer and remove the threat of death from social order and all of humanity, this is a critical tool for control and is a strategy to gain control over all life, taking up life and death in the name of survival<br />

No matter what steps they take to make society more unified and peaceful, it will never work. Society is not a unified body, there is no equality that can be created from community, society is conflict and life is war<br />

The attempt to create a universal community is a thinly veiled attempt to obliterate and marginalize differences under the guise of neutrality<br />
Secomb 2000 “fractured Community”<br />

Turn- Genocide-embracing the alt results in a normless world incapable of subliminating desire to the good- the result is the new auschitz except this time the impact is the destruction of all life<br />
Fasching 93 “the ethical challenge of Auschwitz and Hiroshima” p 28-29<br />
Our modern technological………….apocalyptic self-destruction<br />
<br />
Schmitt’s friend/enemy distinction only exists to provide justification for humanitarianism. He ultimately concludes on the importance of helping people<br />
Meister 2005 “never again, the ethics of the neighbor and the logic of genocide, postmodern culture<br />
Although few, if any……………..third party intervention<br />
<br />
The lave morality of neoliberal conservatism will result in the politics of disposability which cedes power to neoliberal institutions and makes fascism inevitable<br />
Giroux 2006 “Katrina and the politics of disposability” henryagiroux.com/online_articles/Katrina_Pol_Disposability.htm<br />
A new politics…………………of being reclaimed<br />
<br />
Ethics precede ontology- only though an ethical responsibility to the other can current notions of ontology be questioned<br />
Manning 93- Interpreting otherwise than Heidegger p 118<br />
But what does levinas mean……………….is first philosophy<br />
<br />
Sacred orders refuse to embrace the inherent lack, whereas holy communities embrace lack in their experience of the infinite. This prevents persecution of the other<br />
Fasching and dechant 2001 “comparative religious ethics: a narrative approach p 19-20”<br />
While a sacred society……………to the stranger<br />

Insofar as death and life………..hedonistic last man?<br />
<br />
CX 1ac<br />
Why should we always welcome the stranger<br />
-1st 2 pieces of fashing, not being open to the stranger makes it impossible to see the ultimate value of all people, you assume you are a complete person independent of relationship to others- it is genocidal<br />
Why should we care about global poverty<br />
Same answer as above- people interconnected,<br />
Why does their wellbeing constitute ours?<br />
We are not levinas, you have to be open to the stories of others, we should not dismiss the views of others outright.<br />
Can anyone be excluded?<br />
We should be open to all people<br />
<br />
CX of 1nc<br />
What does it mean to “suck it up”?<br />
Fun name for a 1nc<br />
Alternative is to reject your mode of politics and create an agonistic model of politics- doesn’t look to be responsible to others and allow us to affirm our position within the political<br />
How do u solve our impacts?<br />
It internal link turns the impact- fasching has it wrong, we say that what you do makes extinction inevitable. We shold affirm differences with people<br />
How does recognizing that you are not someone else mutally exclusive with other pople having an influence?<br />
We should not look to other people.<br />
Does it result in getting rid of biofuel subsidies?<br />
We probably solve the impact to the aff but we don’t get rid of subsidies. Your model of politics- selfish people eliminated</span>
