The United States’ status quo policy toward the Palestinian Authority is to refuse recognition of this “terrorist” organization. Engagement is strictly prohibited with an enemy so savage. Foreign assistance is diverted to Fateh in an attempt at slowly starving Hamas and eroding their political power. This is the the logic of the war on terrorism – once identified, the enemy cannot be tolerated or even acknowledged – there is no negotiating with barbarism.<br />

Though, like in wars past, the United States precludes diplomacy and prefers coercion against the terrorist enemy, this war is unique. The planetary reign of technology requires a new understanding of war altogether. The war on terrorism represents this shift and has blurred the distinction between war and peace, serving only to perpetuate itself. This means that all political responses to terrorism are doomed to fail. They assume a technological enframing of the globe that can only ensure the continued domination of the technological will over the earth. This will has rendered Bush and Hamas alike impotent – they are merely coordinates in an endless circulation of standing reserve in which everything can be planned or replaced, demanding that we think the war on terrorism in terms of its essence --the technological will it discharges<br />
Andrew J. <strong><u>Mitchell</u></strong>, Stanford Universtiy, “Heidegger and Terrorism”, <em>Research in Phenomenology,</em> 35, <strong><u>2005</u></strong><br />
“in preparing a definition of war…..beings have become uncommon”<br />
<br />
<br />
Technology’s will to manage being enframes all of politics so that all actions are taken merely for the pursuit of its own reproduction. The War on Terrorism codifies the danger in this mode of being in which all violence is authorized and planetary destruction is ensured.<br />

PLAN<br />
Resolved: The United States Federal Government should recognize Hamas and resume foreign assistance to the Palestinian Authority.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not a typical plan of action, our will to be implemented or enacted—rather our resolve represents an ontological openness to thinking Terrorism in its essence, which is the essence of thinking. Rather than imagining the imposition of the plan on the world, you should think what it means essentially – a recognition of and invitation to terror. Resolution is not to be found in decision or action, rather it lies in opening oneself, in thought, toward the expanse of being.<br />
Martin <strong><u>Heidegger</u></strong>, nazi. “Conversation on a Country Path.” <em>Discourse on Thinking</em> pp. 79-81 <strong><u>1969</u></strong><br />
“Teacher: Wait in a releasement through which….regioning of that-which-regions.”<br />
<br />
<br />
This new mode of thinking is an urgent and uniquely American responsibility as our political responses to terrorism have proven disastrous time and time again. Just as our hostile disposition toward Hamas has only fueled regional violence, all attempts to isolate and starve off the terrorist Other guarantee the continuation of a war on all and against Being itself. Challenging these violent relationships requires a new mode of thought that preserves , invites, and experiences terrorism as being’s withdrawal. The plan is a call for Americans to assume responsibility and distance themselves from the technological domination that has for so long dominated our foreign policy as to have become more or less synonymous with Americanism itself. Rather than reacting to terrorism with the same old violent will, meditative thinking can release us from technology and provide a new being in the face of terror.<br />
Andrew J. <strong><u>Mitchell</u></strong>, Stanford Universtiy, “Heidegger and Terrorism”, <em>Research in Phenomenology,</em> 35, <strong><u>2005</u></strong><br />
<strong><u>“</u></strong>Heideggerian thinking is a thinking….not too obstinately squelch them.”<br />
<br />
<br />
This thinking, rather than willing the resolution, is a way of being that allows beings to be without being subjected to our sovereign will. Only distancing ourselves from the subjective will inaugurates a manner of thought that evades technology and the destruction that it entails. Thinking takes on a new direction in the absence of a guiding will—its trajectory is outward into the openness of Being. Only such a fundamental openness can orient us appropriately toward Being.<br />
Michael <strong><u>Zimmerman</u></strong>, Prof of Philo at Tulane and Clinical prof of Psychology at Tulane Medical. <em>Eclipse of the Self</em> pp. 245-8 <strong><u>1981</u></strong><br />
“Under the domination of egoism…..christianity calls “grace”.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Accept our framework, its extremely valuable for debate—to exclude our approach to affirmation would be to technologically enframe debate to ensure its routine reproduction of old forms. Debate can survive innovation and new approaches to debate increase critical thinking. Opening debaters up to modes of thought that aren’t traditionally available is absolutely necessary given the global domination of technological thought.<br />
William <strong><u>Shanahan and Heiddeger</u></strong>. people “Kritik of Thinking.” <em>Debater’s Research Guide.</em> <strong><u>1993.</u></strong><br />
<u>“Policy has a stranglehold …..will open remains</u> above.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Ours is the most sensitive and historically responsible politics. Traditional politics involve the violent imposition of a “program” on Being through attempts at systematically ordering both physical and human nature. Only a new manner of political thought can resituate us toward one another and the world. Our thought represents a space outside of the cold grip of the standing reserve in which beings are allowed to be, this is the only imaginable way of creating a politics that doesn’t immediately subjugate everything external to the violent hegemony of the will.<br />

 their link is laughable. They did not read FW, which means we don't have to defend USFG axn. Our plan is not typical. c/a T args. Our interp of resolved means that we remain open to the rez. We become open to terror and allow for new ont.<br />
our openness is fnxnly disengagement from FW of Heidegger<br />
political disengagement. Ours is ont level. Ont comes first c/a cp answers<br />
their ev proves all these args. Strat of disengagement functions as imposition of a will onto another human being.<br />
exceptionalism is not synonymous with the west<br />
they prove this when they say that we should not push burdens on other<br />
c/a 1ac args. We don't support trsm, just trst org. Link for the K = no spilover for mpx. Any aid would lead to US taking out more trsts in future.<br />
