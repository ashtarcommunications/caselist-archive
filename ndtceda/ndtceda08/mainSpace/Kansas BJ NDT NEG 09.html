Mervyn Frost, Ethics in International Relations, 1996 p. 89-90<br />
It is necessary to be quite AND which must be confronted<br />
Logical conclusion of the 1AC is that CAFOs should go away that’s why you need the litmus test.<br />
They are the only ones that deny an ethical action. We will isolate specific problems and talk about why they are bad but never do anything about them.<br />
Anarchism (card).<br />
That means disempowerment. They are saying that we should go OUT of the government because it’s masculine and then nothing changes.<br />
Unethical to say something is specifically bad and not do anything about it (Frost).<br />
Shively evidence says exploding limits guts the negative.<br />
Policy focus solves – transformative (Card).<br />
Language of policy making (Fisher).<br />
Parliamentary study was done when they had a topic so it applies.<br />
Assumes forcing top-down prescriptions. That assumes that power is always masculine. Switch side debate solves that.<br />
They won’t even defend economic rationality. We came pretty close but that is really shitty ground that they gave us.<br />
Ground does not guarantee topic specific education.<br />
Inside this debate we have lost specific debate and we have the best method to solve for the debate.<br />
Some debate will exist but it will not encourage topic specific education.<br />
Essentialist to assume that reason denies women.<br />

They are just idealistic and utopian.<br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">If it’s true that pain of the animal is obvious then you should take action. You should not wait around for their conclusion.<br />
We have limits externally as well.<br />

<h2 id="toc25"><a name="Kansas BJ neg vs. Gonzaga BC-Economic rationality"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Economic rationality</strong></span></h2>
 <br />
<span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">Economic rationality answers the aff. It’s not that rationalism is bad.<br />
Impacts – a. Key to value to life because of social discussions, and b. environmental protection, the thesis of the aff. turns the aff because they don’t’ care about the animals but about their feelings. So it also turns their ethics argument because it provides an honest social discourse.<br />
Socal evidence says that science and economics is self reflexive so it can change.<br />
Merely observing discourse is worse because it doesn’t solve anything.<br />
Their disdain for state action dooms emancipator action at all.<br />
The ballot is not an endorsement of the plan as they have framed it.<br />
You should place negative-demand on the State. Inside of a debate you should position yourself as the State and determine whether or not action is good or bad. We are the only ones who can act for the chickens.</span><br />
<h2 id="toc26"><a name="Kansas BJ neg vs. Gonzaga BC-Framework"></a><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Framework</strong></span></h2>
 <br />
<span style="font-family: Sylfaen;">They made arguments why you should start with policy discourse first. If the affirmative can say ANYTHING they want then there is not a limit on what they can say.<br />
Switch side debate solves their plan. Place demands upon the state is unlike their interpretation of fiat.<br />
Lewis and altieri evidence is about creating change and they can reinterpret agricultural support so they still have flexibility. They conceded 1nR USFG evidence and subsidy definition.<br />
You can’t actually change anything it’s only a question of education.<br />
Shively says you should decide the best rules possible.<br />
Rules outweigh because they provide the specific forum but we outweigh anyway.<br />
We incorporate the narratives of the marginalized as well.<br />
Conceded the litmus test argument.<br />
We lead to the best form of apathy, they say we should wait around.<br />
