Despite its ethical intentions, its policy positions us as imperial witnesses consuming the globe's suffering. The outcome of this exhausted empathy can only be death and disastrous politics of institutionalized failure leading to dehumanization.<br />

First, we note that the status of bare life is not conferred exclusively upon those in the camp, but on the wider society as a whole, we are all bare life.<br />

<br />
Second, the affirmative strategy for resisting the violence of the war on terror is doomed from the outset; calling for an end to violence within classical politics is just nostalgia, it's a rigged game.<br />
<br />
The terminal impact is extinction.<br />

The perm does not get both the affirmative and the negative- the counter advocacy must precede the affirmation in order to be solvent. Pretty clear sequencing argument here. <br />
