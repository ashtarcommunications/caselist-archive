Ephraim Asculai - 9/21/2007<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalpolitician.com/articledes.asp?ID=3499&amp;amp;cid=2&amp;amp;sid=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalpolitician.com/articledes.asp?ID=3499&amp;amp;cid=2&amp;amp;sid=4</a><br />
<br />
On August 27, 2007, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) published an Information Circular (INCIRC 711) that included the text of the “Understandings of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the IAEA on the Modalities of Resolution of the Outstanding Issues.” Towards the end of that document, the following text can be found: &quot;The Agency's delegation is of the view that the agreement on the above issues shall further promote the efficiency of the implementation of safeguards in Iran and its ability to conclude the exclusive peaceful nature [sic] of Iran's nuclear activities.&quot; Resolution of the outstanding issues would take at least up to the end of 2007. Thus, by focusing on the resolution of old and almost irrelevant questions, the IAEA managed to divert attention from the main issue of Iran’s continuing uranium enrichment activities. The Iranians, of course, were overjoyed with the agreement, declaring that the &quot;Iranian File&quot; is about to be closed.<br />
<br />
The IAEA dared write this text in spite of the fact that Iran has reneged on its promise to abide by the Additional Protocol (AP). The IAEA agreed to conduct its activities &quot;in accordance with Iran's Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement.&quot; Thus, the IAEA has reverted to its old and inefficient &quot;Comprehensive Safeguards&quot; mode that failed conspicuously in Iraq and is a sure prescription for failure in Iran. The Comprehensive Safeguards failed in Iraq because they lacked one major capability: to search for concealed facilities, materials and activities. How could the IAEA let this happen?<br />
<br />
Following the 1991discovery by the IAEA Action Team in Iraq of an extensive plan to produce nuclear weapons, a program named “93+2” was launched to review the existing safeguards mode and propose a better system. The outcome of that work was the proposal for the AP that included, among other things, a provision for environmental sampling -- a &quot;nuclear forensic&quot; method for uncovering these illicit activities. Had this method been in place in Iraq, Iraq’s secret uranium enrichment and plutonium separation activities would surely have been uncovered. The AP, however, implied one very questionable promise: that it could provide assurances as to the absence of nuclear materials and activities. Such negative assurances cannot be provided, especially not in a country the size of Iran with its record of cheating, lying and concealing.<br />

<br />
That, unfortunately, however has not happened to the IAEA. And so the IAEA is still in charge of both promoting and regulating nuclear energy. In fact, it's an international entity whose official mission is proliferation.<br />
<br />
And so, that puts it in a strange position. If its inspectors find that nuclear equipment is leading to the bomb somewhere and was exported under the assumption that it would be peaceful, the conclusion would be that it might not be such a good idea to proliferate this stuff in the first place, and therefore that the Agency's other function shouldn't be carried out.<br />
<br />
Thus inspectors really have an institutional incentive not to find things. That's important. And I think that attitude was primary in the early days of the IAEA's history. The inspectors didn't want to find things. That is literally true. When David Kay and his band of inspectors in Iraq discovered the Iraqi nuclear weapon program, they had to do so by violating the IAEA's rules of engagement.<br />
<br />
The IAEA was giving the Iraqis 6 to 12 hours notice before they went to a site, during which time our satellites were watching the Iraqis clean things out.<br />
<br />
So Kay took his guys in with no notice and they found the calutron program. The IAEA was unhappy about that. They told David that he was not going to be welcome on any more inspections in Iraq, as a result of his not following the rules. I'm not making this up, this is true.<br />
<br />
The agency had a definite credibility problem before the first Gulf War. But, because its failure was so obvious-literally, it was inspecting parts of a site where bombwork was going on in other buildings- it had to change. It had to change its attitude. And I think it has. I think in Iran it's doing a much better job.<br />
<br />
It's engaged in the same iterative process that the UNSCOM inspectors used successfully in Iraq. That is, the inspectee (the country being inspected) has an obligation to tell the truth and to present a coherent picture of what its nuclear program is.<br />
<br />
The inspectors can poke at that picture and find holes in it and demand explanations and do just what the IAEA is doing now. One can get closer and closer through this process to a coherent statement you can believe. In Iraq, it was never possible to get to the end because the Iraqis had an official policy of lying, which revealed the basic problem or limitation with inspections.<br />
<br />
Inspections are meant to verify things. They're not meant to create agreements or to find things that have been hidden. They're meant to verify statements. You cannot verify a lie. You can only verify the truth.<br />
<br />
And so, if you're inspecting a country that is lying, it's not going to work. The only cases that I know of where you've had successful inspections have been cases where the country being inspected had an incentive to be truthful and to prove that.<br />
<br />
When you get those conditions, inspections are going to work for you. But when you don't have those conditions, you can inspect all you want, but you'll wind up sooner or later with a conclusion that look, these guys are not telling the truth. In Iraq, we couldn't find out whether Iraq actually had stuff or didn't have stuff. All we could find out at the end was, whether they were presenting a coherent picture of what they claimed that they had.<br />
<br />
And the answer was that they were not. It was clear that that was the answer.<br />
<br />
In Iran, I think there are a lot of lessons to be learned from Iraq, because we seem to be going down the same road. The Iranians don't seem to be telling the truth. And so, where are we going to come out with inspections in Iran? We're going to come out sooner or later with the statement that what these guys are saying just doesn't add up. These guys aren't telling the truth.<br />
<br />
A group of inspectors cannot guarantee that there is not something hidden in a cave or a building somewhere. But what they can tell you is that the reality that we're seeing doesn't square with the country's declarations.<br />
<br />
That's where we are now. The Iranians have not told the truth up to now and so the IAEA's job is to report that. They've done it, but they haven't said the magic word that takes the case to the U.N. Security Council.<br />
<br />
One of the big issues is whether they're going to do that. Because once they say that word- and Blix was in this position in Iraq- once they say that word, it goes out of their hands into somebody else's hands.<br />
<br />
So if you're an inspector, if you're the IAEA, if you're even the Director General, you've got a problem, because if you say, &quot;look, I'm not being told the truth, I can't get any further here,&quot; then you're going to lose the case to the U.N. Security Council and, in effect, you have dropped out. That was Blix's problem.<br />
<br />
A final note. It's often said that the IAEA's job is to verify the NPT. That is not true. The NPT is a treaty with no verification mechanism. There are many Articles, such as Article 1, which is not verified by anyone. All the IAEA does under the NPT is make safeguards agreements with countries. And then the IAEA determines whether those agreements have been fulfilled, and that's it.<br />
<br />
It's a very narrow function. You can't expect anything other than that. But you can expect that. When the IAEA runs up against that brick wall and can't get any further and is not being told the truth, you have to expect the Agency to report that. Because that's really the Agency's job.<br />

Attack on Iran Said To Be Imminent<br />

Attack on Iran Said To Be Imminent<br />
BENNY AVNI<br />
<br />
UNITED NATIONS — In a sign that U.N. Security Council-based diplomacy is losing steam, a number of sources are reporting that a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities may be imminent. France and America also are pushing for tighter economic sanctions against Tehran, without U.N. approval.<br />
<br />
Yesterday's edition of Le Canard Enchaîné, a French weekly known for its investigative journalism, reported details of an alleged Israeli-American plan to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. The frontpage headline read: &quot;A report sent to the Elysée — Putin tells Tehran: They're going to bomb you!&quot;<br />
<br />
The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, also expressed concerns to reporters in New York that an attack on Iran might be imminent.<br />
<br />
Like most stories in the French paper, the article was based on unnamed sources who said that in order to reduce casualties, the attack against Iran is planned for October 15, the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israel would bomb the first targets while America would orchestrate a second wave of strikes, the report said.<br />
<br />
However, the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, who recently spoke of preparing for war with Iran, berated reporters yesterday, telling them that he had said war is the &quot;worst option.&quot; Instead, he is now calling for &quot;diplomacy, diplomacy, diplomacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
As foreign ministers representing the five permanent members of the Security Council — China, Russia, France, Britain, and America — and Germany plan to sit down Friday for a long-planned meeting to discuss ideas for addressing Iran's refusal to end uranium enrichment, Mr. Kouchner told reporters that China and Russia are likely to delay any significant decision until at least December.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be very difficult to convince the Russians and the Chinese before&quot; December, he said. A Russian diplomat told The New York Sun on Monday that Moscow would call on the council to await the conclusion of a new round of diplomacy conducted by the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei.<br />
<br />
At a breakfast with reporters yesterday, Mr. Kouchner said he had &quot;spent hours&quot; with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, trying to convince him to approve council sanctions against Iran. Russia, Mr. Kouchner said, is attempting to regain its top world status, while &quot;we treat them, they told me, like little adolescents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a former American ambassador to the United Nations, John Bolton, indicated yesterday that President Sarkozy of France may be a more reliable ally on Iran than Prime Minister Brown of Britain.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not at all clear where Brown is at,&quot; Mr. Bolton told the Sun. &quot;The question is, ‘Will Britain follow in the footsteps of France?'&quot; Either way, Mr. Bolton said he did not invest too much hope in Security Council diplomacy.<br />
<br />
Some American diplomats are saying the next phase of diplomacy with Iran may involve a separate track of sanctions that would be imposed without Security Council approval.<br />
<br />
Mr. Kouchner said yesterday that the French government is trying to lean on companies like the oil giant Total to end ties with Iran. Between 2005 and 2006, he said, French commerce with Iran was cut in half.<br />
<br />
But an unnamed German government official told Reuters yesterday, &quot;Unlike the United States and the French, the German government is not ready to go outside the U.N. for sanctions.&quot; The official expressed doubts that Europe could reach a consensus on such sanctions. German companies such as Siemens, BASF, Mercedes, and Volkswagen maintain strong business ties with Iran. In 2006, such companies reportedly exported goods worth $5.7 billion to Iran, up from $5 billion in 2004. In Vienna, Mr. ElBaradei is preparing a report that is not expected to be ready before December. In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly earlier this week, President Ahmadinejad of Iran said the &quot;nuclear issue of Iran is now closed,&quot; and he said Tehran would stop dealing with the Security Council and would negotiate only with the IAEA.<br />
<br />
Mr. ElBaradei recently reached an agreement with Iran that allows it to report on outstanding nuclear issues over a long period of time. The Iranians, nonetheless, are &quot;very, very, very firm that they don't want to stop enrichment,&quot; Mr. Kouchner said yesterday.<br />
<br />
Mr. ElBaradei, who is charged with reporting on technical nuclear issues, was berated by Secretary of State Rice, who said the Tehran accords amounted to conducting private diplomacy.<br />
<br />
Before he became U.N. ambassador, Mr. Bolton sought to mount a campaign to unseat Mr. ElBaradei. A former secretary of state, Colin Powell, &quot;was never enthusiastic about it,&quot; Mr. Bolton said yesterday. &quot;When Rice became secretary of state, the winds came out of the sails&quot; of the campaign to unseat the IAEA director. &quot;Stopping him would have required a lot of effort,&quot; Mr. Bolton said, but he added that Mr. ElBaradei's current behavior on Iran &quot;proves that it was worthwhile.&quot;<br />

National Review, Dec 27, 2004<br />
<ul><li>Immediately after the International Atomic Energy Agency welcomed Iran's offer to suspend uranium enrichment while negotiating with Britain, France, and Germany over a long-term nuclear deal, Iran's chief negotiator, Hassan Rohani, declared, &quot;We have proved that, in an international institution, we are capable of isolating the U.S.</li></ul>And that is a great victory.&quot; Unfortunately, Rohani is right: This latest European diplomatic &quot;breakthrough&quot; allowed Iran to avoid facing the Security Council, and now the U.S. has to sit on the sidelines while Europe buys the mullahs more time. Iran will almost certainly continue to pursue weapons clandestinely, as it would even in the unlikely event that a long-term deal went through. If the Europeans believe otherwise, they are delusional. More likely, they are so desperate to prove they can take care of world problems without using force--unlike those cowboys in Washington--that they are willing to be strung along by the mullahs indefinitely (they have been negotiating to no avail since August 2003). This could have dire consequences. In Iran, the world may soon face a nuclear-armed terror state. Phony diplomatic deals will only delay the day of reckoning--if that.<br />

<strong><u>Regime Change CP</u></strong><br />
<br />
The United States federal government should appoint an Iran Coordinator to oversee the substantial expansion of U.S. internal regime change efforts within Iran, including replacing Radio Farda’s popular music programming with strategic communications programs for regime change determined by Iranian dissident groups, changing the programming of Voice of America to support debate over Iranian democracy, providing communications assistance to dissident groups within Iran, and disseminating information within Iran about constitutional change. The U.S. should also offer Iran a conditional security assurance that it will not pursue violence against Iran if Iran agrees to a verifiable commitment to stop its nuclear program. The U.S. should redirect current and future funding from ethnic separatist groups into strategic communications for nonviolent internal regime change.<br />
<br />
All engagement towards Iran should be conditioned on Iranian response to nukes – plan goes to far and amounts to appeasement<br />
Takeyh and Dueck, 07, Pol. Sci. Q, v. 122, no. 2, Summer 2007, www.psqonline.org/cgi-bin/99_article.cgi?byear=2007&amp;amp;bmonth=summer&amp;amp;a=01free&amp;amp;format=view<br />
A better starting point for and of its nuclear program<br />
<br />
CP bans violent regime change which addresses Iran’s primary security concerns but avoids appeasement – plan empowers hardliners by convincing them their confrontational strategy worked. Keeping internal regime change on the table doesn’t anger hardliners<br />
