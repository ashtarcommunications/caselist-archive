<br />
<strong>Observation 1: Property and Rationality</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. Western conceptions of property have devolved into a rationalized process of transaction and production. What was once a moral bond among community members has been reduced to a logic of “use value,” stripped of its former ethic.</strong><br />
<strong>Bryan, 2000</strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"> [Bradley, Property as Ontology: On Aboriginal and English Understandings of Ownership, The Canadian Journal of Law &amp; Jurisprudence - 13 Can. J.L. &amp; Juris. 3, Lexis] </span><br />
<br />
<strong>B. This rationalistic understanding of property excludes all other views. The language of transaction can only comprehend truth claims that fit its model. Thus, it requires all assertions be couched in its language the language of transaction.</strong><br />
<strong>Bryan, 2000</strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"> [Bradley, Property as Ontology: On Aboriginal and English Understandings of Ownership, The Canadian Journal of Law &amp; </span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">Jurisprudence - 13 Can. J.L. &amp; Juris. 3, Lexis] </span><br />
<br />
<strong>C. Our conception of property signifies our ontology – it organizes the way that we relate to each other and the world.</strong><br />
<strong>Bryan,</strong> <strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">2000</span></strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"> [Bradley, Property as Ontology: On Aboriginal and English Understandings of Ownership, The Canadian Journal of Law &amp; Jurisprudence - 13 Can. J.L. &amp; Juris. 3, Lexis] </span><br />
<br />
<strong>D. This language of rationalization that forms the foundation of Western property is the essence of technology. It enframes the world and humanity in the form of standing reserve, inventory to be stored for later use and transaction.</strong><br />
<strong>Bryan, 2000</strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt"> [Bradley, Property as Ontology: On Aboriginal and English Understandings of Ownership, The Canadian Journal of Law &amp; Jurisprudence - 13 Can. J.L. &amp; Juris. 3, Lexis] </span><br />
<br />
<strong>E. The enframing of being is more dangerous than the complete annihilation of the earth. Even if we survive a nuclear war there will be no ontological clearing for us to exist in.</strong><br />
<strong>Zimmerman, 1994</strong> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">[Michael E. Zimmerman, Chair of Philosophy at Tulane University, Contesting earth’s future : radical ecology and postmodernity, 1994 pps. 119-20] </span><br />
<strong>Advocacy: Thus, we advocate the use of poetics to reject the essence of technology present in Western property law.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Observation 2: A New Ontology</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>A. Poetics can reconfigure existing language and go beyond the status quo enframing of being. Poets and philosophers are the unrecognized legislators of the world.</strong><br />
<span class="cite">Jenkins</span> <strong>6</strong> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">(Martin Pathways School of Philosophy, “Heidegger, Technology, and Our Future,” <em>Philosophy Pathways,</em> Issue 123, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.philosophos.com/philosophy_article_137.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.philosophos.com/philosophy_article_137.html</a>) </span><br />
<strong>B. The dominance of technology can easily co-opt any attempt to stand outside the system. The poetic is the only way to resist technological thought.</strong><br />
<strong>Foltz 95</strong> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">(Bruce V. Foltz, Inhabiting the Earth: Heidegger, Environmental Ethics, and the </span><br />
<span style="FONT-SIZE: 8pt">Metaphysics of Nature, 1995, p. 166.) </span><br />
<strong>C. Ontology is the ground of all human understanding. The question of being is essential to real practical and political thought, in addition to authentic freedom.</strong><br />
<strong>Cropsey 87</strong> (Josepth, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago, “History of Political Philosophy,” 891)<br />
<br />
<strong>Observation 3: Debate as Technology</strong><br />
<strong>A.</strong> <strong>Debate itself uses the same technological systems we are criticizing</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Further, we are guilty of two bad assumptions about the nature of language.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Next, this is impacted in the Zimmerman evidence.</strong><br />
<strong>Additionally, artificial languages, like topicality and debate in general, are no more objective than natural languages -they are just narrower and more rigid.</strong><br />
<strong>Finally, our argument is that we should apply Heidegger’s critique of technological thinking to debate itself.</strong><br />
