<br />
<strong>Case:</strong><br />
<br />
Rhetoric of pov and cotton in Afirca is tied to the legacy of colonialism. Sneyd 06 (Adam, qualifying paper department of political science McMaster University) &quot;poverty is a contested concept and indicators used&quot; &quot;economics literature does not address its own political and cultural underpinnings and biases&quot;<br />
<br />
The discourse of poverty and hunger is used to keep developing countries in a permanent position of subserviance.<br />
Batterbury and Fernando 04 &quot;the professionalization of development.... rights of the other societies&quot;<br />
<br />
Discourse of poverty assumes a commodified view of human value and deny agency. Pieterse 00 (&quot;after post-development&quot; TWQ) &quot; 'poverty' is not simply a deficit... and which action follows&quot;<br />
<br />
Their focus on needs unmet treats the South as dependent rather than people to cooperate with. Rahman 93 (&quot;People's self-development: perspectives on participatory action research&quot;) &quot;a focus on economic needs and economic 'poverty' &quot;<br />
<br />
The alt is to reject and criticize the rhetoric of poverty Ross 90 (&quot;the rhetoric of poverty: their immortality, our helplessness&quot;) &quot;the patter of choice and rhetoric provides a structure for understanding&quot; ..&quot;to understand how this happens to us&quot;<br />
<br />
Rejecting the rhetoric of poverty and venturing into our own interpretations allow us to break out of the constraints the rhetoric imposes on us, make our own choices and reshape our futures. Ross 90 (&quot;the rhetoric of poverty: their immortality, our helplessness&quot;) &quot;the question posed by this article is where will we choose to stand on the rhetorical field... storm of human suffering.&quot;<br />
<br />
Discourse of poverty causes real oppression and recreates systems of poverty.<br />
Escobar 1994 (Arturo, Encountering Development: The making and unmaking of the Third World, p. 52-54) &quot;underdevelopment became the subject&quot;... &quot;condemning indigenous populations to near extinction&quot;<br />
<br />
Doty, Kleinman and Juma for Discourse shapes reality...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Terror Talk- Labeling serves the ends of replicating hegemonies of power rather than the goal of accurately describing reality.<br />
Zulaikia and Douglas 96 (Terror and Taboo: The Follies, Fables, and Faces of Terrorism, p 100-1) &quot;The label &quot;terrorist&quot; ... likely to change over time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terror Talk is part of the security industry that frames oppression as heroic practice which causes terrorism. Rather than solving problems, you create and encourage the system you fear. Zulaikia and Douglas 96 p. 22-3 &quot;the increase in 'expert' knowledge about acts of terror&quot;... &quot;entire discourse&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 1ac's framing of medical needs and solutions legitimize the state structures which liquidate entire communities.<br />
Nandy 95 (Ashis, The Savage Freud, p. 174-5) &quot;the history of power has become in many ways the history of the body&quot; &quot;the hegemony of the medical state&quot;<br />
<br />
Vote neg- challenging the nature of discourse creates ethical spaces to confront the hegemony of modern science.<br />
Nandy p. 160 &quot;too often dissenting groups have sought the replacement&quot; &quot;esoteric critiques have provided ethical space from within&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Cotton args:<br />
<br />
Trade war inevit with Brazil over ethanol.<br />
<br />
Sq structural adjustments make poverty inevitable Shah 07 (&quot;Structural Adjustment-A Major Cause of Poverty&quot;) &quot;many developing nations are in debt... standard of living of their people&quot;<br />
<br />
Cotton subsidies wont reduce African poverty<br />
Birdsall, Rodrik and Subramanian 05 (Foreign Affaris) &quot;take cotton specifically... increased in parts of the country.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terrorism is low in West Africa<br />
News Blaze 07 (&quot;african cooperation growing on anti-terrorism, u.s. report says&quot;) &quot;no longer quite the... according to the report.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1NC Domestic PIC</strong><br />
<br />
Text: The United States Federal Government should eliminate nearly all subsidies for cotton.<br />
<br />
Its textually and functionally competitive- elimination of subsidies that rely on domestic/foriegn, us/them, inside/outside creates biopolitical violence.<br />
Campbell 98 (Writing Security, p. 9-10) &quot;Identity is an inescapable dimension... tenuously constituted in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the root of biopower- turns the case.<br />
Campbell 98 (Writing Security, p. 199-201) &quot;As invitation to this line... individual's continued existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1NC-Cant have a plan:</strong><br />
-inf number of plans from rez, explodes topic<br />
-substantial is without material qualification<br />
-vague plan writing, moving targets bad<br />
-causes ASPEC which is worse<br />
-the nazis had plans<br />
<br />
<strong>1NC- Must read a framework:</strong><br />
-cant predict 2ac frameworks- prevents us from reading our best arguments<br />
-encourages better strategies- key to education<br />
-aff choice is good- but must be in the 1ac<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1NC- Constitution is suspended:</strong><br />
<br />
The Constitution was suspended 60 years ago. Schroder and Mellis 95 (Dr. Eugene and Micki, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://buffalo-creek-press.com/cffrev.htm" rel="nofollow">http://buffalo-creek-press.com/cffrev.htm</a>)<br />
&quot;through the insidious, yet stead encroachment... more than 60 years later.&quot;<br />
<br />
100% take out- there is no ability to create federal law, no action is protected under the Constitution<br />

<br />
AT Harvard –<br />
<br />
We consulted Ashtar. – 2 cards from Ashtar – one that says Ashtar helps reach the best outcome and one that says that solves for nuclear war<br />
We PICed out of “The” – against Wyoming and read some cards about coalitions that “The global labor force” splintered labor forces.<br />
We PICed out of “domestic” and read some Dillon stuff domestic/foreign and citizenship.<br />
We said its bad to read plans.<br />
We said its bad not to read framework in the 1ac.<br />
We said the constitution is suspended.<br />
We said time is a cube with 4 sides and you should specify which quadrant of time your aff takes place in.<br />
We said you should specify your robot theology.<br />
We said the bible code has found hidden meanings in the 1ac that say vote neg.<br />

Normativity<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO REASON TO VOTE AFFIRMATIVE: THEY CANNOT ARTICULATE ANY LINKAGE BETWEEN THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS AND PRACTICAL, WORLDLY EFFECTS<br />
<br />
SCHLAG, PROFESSOR OF LAW@ UNIV. COLORADO, 1990 (PIERRE, STANFORD LAW REVIEW, NOVEMBER, PAGE LEXIS)<br />
“In fact, normative legal thought is so much in a hurry … put any of its wonderful normative advice into effect.”<br />
<br />
THEIR DESCRIPTION OF THE STATUS QUO PRESUPPOSES A RATIONAL, AUTONOMOUS SUBJECT THAT NOT ONLY DESCRIBES THE BUREAUCRACY, BUT ALSO OUR AGENCY TO ACT AS EMPOWERED CARTESIAN EGOS- IN REALITY, THESE SUBJECT POSITIONS DO NOT EXIST<br />
<br />
SCHLAG IN 1991 (PIERRE, COLORADO LAW PROF. 139 U. PA. L. REV.801, APRIL)<br />
For these legal thinkers, it will seem especially urgent to ask once again: What should be done? … discussion that almost all of us in the legal academy practice.<br />
<br />
THEIR RHETORICAL PERFORMANCE SHIELDS US FOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS TO MATERIAL PAIN AND SUFFERING-<br />
<br />
DELGADO IN 1991 (RICHARD, COLORADO LAW PROFESSOR, 139 PA. L. REV. 933, APRIL)<br />
“But what is the cash value of all this priest-talk in the law reviews … the Supreme Court has been faced with subsistence claims.”<br />
<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE’S RHETORICAL PERFORMANCE IS PREMISED ON THE IDEA OF A RATIONAL SUBJECT WITH FREE WILL WHO CAN ACT UPON THE LAW AND BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL- THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THEIR SOLVENCY CLAIMS AND THE CLAIM YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR THEM- THIS NORMATIVE MODEL OF SUBJECTIVITY IN FACT IS BUREAUCRATIC CONTROL- ITS ESSENTIAL MEANING IS THE INFLICTION OF PAIN AND DEATH.<br />
<br />
SCHLAG, PROFESSOR OF LAW@ UNIV. COLORADO, 1990 (PIERRE, STANFORD LAW REVIEW, NOVEMBER, PAGE LEXIS)<br />
“All of this can seem very funny … constructions of bureaucratic practices -- academic and otherwise.”<br />

Demon Engine<br />
<br />
The modern agricultural system is bankrupt—mechanized production and slavery to the notion of “progress” have lead to all sorts of ills, from the destruction of the biosphere to the emptying out of meaning from our lives—liberation is impossible without the dissolution of agriculture itself!<br />
<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/%7Ekaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
“Food has been one of our most direct contacts with the natural<br />
environment … is impossible without its dissolution.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The modern American agricultural system is particularly indefensible—this is the same industry that the affirmative attempts to “correct”—this is in fact impossible, because the harms of the status quo are rooted in something much deeper than subsidies, but the technological imperative of civilization itself<br />
<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/%7Ekaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
“Today the organic, what is left of it, is fully mechanized … accelerating the crime against nature.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Civilization only exists because we have come to believe in its inevitability—this is tragic because civilization was a mistake. It is bound to collapse, and our critique is necessary to begin readapting to the way that humans lived for 99% of their existence, otherwise we can just be ignorant of the coming universal biological holocaust<br />
<br />
Heinberg 1995 (Richard, “The Primitivist Critique of Civilization, presented at the 24th annual meeting of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm</a>)<br />
“Isn't civilization simply the inevitable expression of the evolutionary urge … think of this process as &quot;getting back on track.&quot;”<br />
<br />
There is no universal social model for primitivism—we can only hope to build momentum towards the end of civilization, because every manifestation of civilization is a usurpation of freedom!<br />
<br />
Willful Disobedience 2005 (Vol 3, No 3, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/destroycivilization.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/destroycivilization.htm</a>)<br />
To put it another way, what all civilized societies have in common … journey into the unknown that is freedom.”<br />

Capitlist growth is the root of the evnrionmental crisis – it necessitates widespread sacrifice of ecology to the ever-rpesent drive toward accumulation and cannot be reformed<br />
Kovel, 2002 (The enemy of nature: the end of capitalism or the end of the world?, p. 82)<br />
<br />
Capitalism bestrides the world because … as the prospect may be.<br />
Economic growth gollapse the biosphere<br />

The drive for hegemonic imperialism is inevitable according to the logic of capitalism--only the alternative avoids multiple scenarios for inevitable extinction.<br />
Foster 2005 (John Bellamy, Monthly Review, September, Vol 57, Iss 4, &quot;Naked Imperialism&quot;)<br />
From the longer view...the new naked imperialism.<br />
<br />
Out alternative is to not do the aff--capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital<br />

REGARDLESS OF OUR ALTERNATIVES SOLVENCY, WE HAVE AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO GET OVER CAPITALISM<br />
MARSH 95<br />
(JAMES L, CRITIQUE, ACTION, AND LIBERATION P. 334-335)<br />
The basic question concerning the possibility of socialism … The prevailing rationality is profoundly irrational.12<br />
<br />
Try or die – capitalism necessitates extinction<br />
Marko 2003 (May 14, Indymedia UK, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www2.indymedia.org.uk" rel="nofollow">https://www2.indymedia.org.uk</a> /en/.2003.05/68173.html)<br />
Bertrand Russell throughout his … accidental nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Utilitaranism means you vote neg – structurally impossible to achieve greatest happiness for the greatest number under capitalism<br />
Meszaros 95 (Beyond Capital, www.marxists.org/archive /meszaros/works/beyond-capital /ch03-2.htm<br />
A great deal has been written about the so-called ‘naturalistic fallacy’ … in the long run’.<br />
<br />
Militarism and imperialism are the inevitable result of capitalism – it is not a question of just defeating the necons or stopping a single policy<br />
Foster, 2005, Monthly Review, VOl. 57, Iss 4, Naked Imperialism<br />
Numerous critics on the U.S. left … the world.<br />

“If it is true as they say … there can be ‘no alternative’.”<br />
