<strong><u>1NC</u></strong><br />
<u>1- Biopower</u><br />
Western legal system reinforces discourse of power and sovereign by regulating local and regional institutions<br />
Smart 02 (Barry, Michel Foucault, Routledge (UK), pg. 79)<br />
“Foucault’s interrogation” … “and politically useful.”<br />
Sovereign power is exercised at the level of live through the transformation of juridical power<br />
Rabinow and Rose 03 (Paul and Nikolas, “Thoughts on the concept of biopower today”, “What is biopower?” … “exercised at the level of life.”<br />
Wars waged and destruction justified only by the sovereign<br />
Foucault 78, History of Sexuality vol 1, pg. 136-137<br />
“Since the classical age the” … “large scale phenomena of poplation.”<br />
<u>2- victimization</u><br />
framing of the victim denies women of their agency<br />
Dunn 05 (Jennifer, “Victims” and “Survivors”: Emerging Vocabularies of Motive for “Battered Women who Stay”, Sociological Inquiry 75 (1), 1-30<br />
“Barry discusses what she calls” … “whom things “are done””<br />
Labels of victim –&gt; powerlessness<br />
Jean Elshtain 97, Politics of Everyday Life, p. 253<br />
“Note that the language of” … “rights and responsibilities.”<br />
Label as sufferer creates a cycle of vicimization<br />
Same as above (Elshtain)<br />
“There are real victims in” … “of its own story.”<br />
To break the cycle of violence must shatter concept of victim<br />
Zanita Fenton, 1998, Columbia Journal of Gender and Law, “Domestic Violence in Black and White: Radicalized Gender Stereotypes in Gender Violence”<br />
“Violence, beyond the conceptual” … “her home and in society.”<br />
Vawa demands people move to the sphere of victimization<br />
Caroline Joan Picart, 2003, Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs, 6.1, 97-125<br />
“It appears that one factor” … “mixed results in this case.”<br />
<br />
<br />
language in legal system only makes them more helpless<br />
Same as above (Picart)<br />
“Mattison v. Click Corporation” … “side of the men they love.”<br />
<u>CASE</u><br />
law creates a destruction of public/private dichotomy<br />
using discrimination model doesn’t solve- makes it worse<br />

They also run a vicitmization K and Statism as well.<br />
<br />
Biopower K<br />
<br />
THE WESTERN LEGAL SYSTEM AND ITS SURROUNDING DISCOURSE USES<br />
DISCIPLINARY POWER TO ENFORCE THE ABSOLUTE POWER OF THE SOVEREIGN BY<br />
REGULATING AT LOCAL AND REGIONAL INSTITUTIONS. ONLY BY STUDYING POWER<br />
RELATIONS THOUGH ITS EXCERCISES AND PRACTICES AT A MICRO LEVEL AS IT<br />
CIRCULATES THROUGH THE SOCIAL BODY WILL ALLOW US TO PROCEED<br />
<br />
Smart, 2002. (Barry, Michel Foucault. Routledge (UK) pg 79.)<br />
<br />
Foucault's interrogation of the question 'how is power exercised?' has<br />
had two important …mechanisms of power become economically<br />
advantageous and politically useful.<br />
<br />
SOVEREIGN POWER IS EXCERCISED AT THE LEVEL OF LIVE THROUGH THE<br />
TRANSFORMATION OF JURIDICAL POWER (AMONG OTHER THINGS)<br />
<br />
Rabinow and Rose, 2003. (Paul and Nikolas. &quot;Thoughts on the Concept of<br />
Biopower Today.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.molsci.org/files/Rose_Rabinow_BiopowerToday.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.molsci.org/files /Rose_Rabinow_BiopowerToday.pdf</a>, access 10/05/06)<br />
<br />
What is &quot;biopower&quot;? In a book ostensibly devoted to the history …Power,<br />
Foucault argues, is now situated and exercised at the level of life.<br />
<br />
WARS ARE WAGED ON BEHALF OF THE POPULATION AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE<br />
SPECIES. THIS IS ONLY JUSTIFIED THROUGH THE POWER OF THE SOVEREIGN<br />
EXERTED ON INDIVIDUAL BODIES. THIS EXPOSES US TO TOTAL DESTRUCTION<br />
THROUGH NUCLEAR WAR, NO LONGER A DISTANT DREAM (HAVE YOU READ THE NEWS<br />
LATELY?)<br />
<br />
Foucault, 1978 (Michel. The History of Sexuality Vol. 1. pg 136-137)<br />
<br />
Since the classical age the west has undergone a very profound<br />
transformation of these mechanisms of power…exercised at the level of<br />
life, the species, the race, and the large scale phenomena of<br />
population.<br />
<br />
<br />
POINTS OF RESISTENCE ARE LOCATED EVERYWHERE WITHIN THE FIELD OF POWER<br />
RELATIONS. REVOLUTION IS POSSIBLE THROUGH MULTIPLE AND TRANSITORY<br />
FRACTURES ACROSS ALL FIELDS. VOTING NEGATIVE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR<br />
INFLAMMATORY RESISTENCE AGAINST THE AFFIRMATIVE'S ATTEMPT TO LOCATE<br />
POWER IN THE SPECIFIC LOCUS OF THE SUPREME COURT.<br />
<br />
Foucault, 1978 (Michel. The History of Sexuality Vol. 1. pg 95-96)<br />
<br />
Where there is power, there is resistance…somewhat similar to the way<br />
in which the state relies on the institutional integration of power<br />
relationships.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Churchill K<br />
<br />
The affirmatives reliance on the current legal structures props up a<br />
system that has continuously supported the denial of indigenous<br />
rights. The foundations of American legal doctrine are also the<br />
foundations of American colonization and conquest of indigenous<br />
people.<br />
<br />
[Churchill, Ward. (2002). &quot;The Law Stood Squarely on its Head&quot;.<br />
Oregon Law Review. Vol 81. P 664-665.]<br />
<br />
As anyone who has ever …thereby purports jurisdiction over it.The<br />
Supreme Court has long been tied to the imperialist and cultural<br />
genocide policies conducted against Native Americans. Decisions upheld<br />
by the court system continue to grant legitimacy to U.S. imperial<br />
power and control over Indigenous people.<br />
<br />
[Churchill, Ward. (2002). &quot;The Law Stood Squarely on its Head&quot;.<br />
Oregon Law Review. Vol 81. P 679-680.]<br />
<br />
As legal scholars …early twentieth century.80=Only through questioning<br />
the colonial legacy can U.S. imperialism and extralegality come to an<br />
end. Ending jurisprudence towards Native Americans and restoring<br />
native lands would prevent further U.S. colonization.<br />
<br />
[Churchill, Ward. (2002). &quot;The Law Stood Squarely on its Head&quot;.<br />
Oregon Law Review. Vol 81. P 696-697.]<br />
<br />
Actually, the roots of the current U.S positive transformation of the<br />
global status quo.158<br />
<br />
Global collective action must be taken to reject statist structures,<br />
delegitimize global imperialism and create a jurisprudence that<br />
includes the rights of indigenous people.<br />
<br />
[Churchill, Ward. (2002). &quot;The Law Stood Squarely on its Head&quot;.<br />
Oregon Law Review. Vol 81. P 702-703.]<br />
<br />
The same situation prevails …structure upon which it depends.182<br />
<br />
The alternative is to reject violent statist structures and embrace a<br />
system of anarchy that would restore resources and rights to<br />
indigenous communities worldwide.<br />
<br />
[Churchill, Ward. (2002). &quot;The Law Stood Squarely on its Head&quot;.<br />
Oregon Law Review. Vol 81. P 704-706.]<br />
