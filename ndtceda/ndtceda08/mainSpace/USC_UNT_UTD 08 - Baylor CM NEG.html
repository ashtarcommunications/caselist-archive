 interpretation: the AFF must establish an explicit framework for evaluating the ROUND IN THE 1AC.<br />
<br />
1. ground: we need to understand the epistomological basis for their prescriptive and normative claims to garner any stable link ground. any other interp moots the 1nc – because we don’t know what the plan will mean or how their speeches relate to it, we can’t make our best arguments.<br />
<br />
2. education – no claim is independent of epistomological basis which must be defended for those claims to be cogent. BEING CLEAR ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION OF THE 1AC IS KEY TO ANY EDUCATIVE CLARITY OR PRECISION ABOUT HOW THE PLAN AND ADVANTAGES WILL BE DEFENDED. best for strategic and critical thinking.<br />
<br />
3. FAIRNESS – THE AFF GETS TO CHOOSE THEIR 1AC. GIVING THEM THE ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGE OF SHIFTING THE ENTIRE METHOD OF EVALUATION OF THE 1AC UNTIL AFTER THE 1NC PRECLUDES STRATEGIC NEG THINKING AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ESTABLISH A COMPETITIVE EPISTOMOLOGICAL BASIS. MAKES THE AFF FUNCTIONALLY CONDITIONAL. INDEPENDENT REASON TO VOTE NEG.<br />

and, understanding the epistomological basis of their factual claims is essential to problem solving and political planning.<br />

You have to defend a literal interpretation of the resolution. That means having a plantext which defends a reduction in U.S. federal government agricultural support at least eliminating nearly all subsidies for one of the commodity crops listed in the resolution.<br />

That's bad - rules are not laws - they are the opposite. The law is a 2 way obligation requiring the responsibility of a political subject. The rule is an imposition. We should affirm these arbitrary rules - Baudrillard 90 (Selected Writings)<br />

 <span class="underline">THE AFFIRMATIVE’S CONCERN WITH DEATH IS MERELY AN EXPRESSION OF ANXIETY, THE INEVITABLE DISCOMFORT OF BEING ALIVE IN THE WORLD.

<span style="font-size: 12pt;">DEBATE IS UNIQUE– THE 2AC WILL PROBABLY COME UP SHORT ON PROVIDING OFFENSIVE ANSWERS TO OUR LINK LEVEL (THE REPRESENTATIONS AND ONTOLOGY OF THE 1AC). IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO MERELY ASSERT THAT THESE REPRESENTATIONS ARE GOOD BECAUSE THE ACTION YOU IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCES IS GOOD; THEY MUST SUBSTANTIVELY DEFEND THE ACT OF THEIR THOUGHT AND SPEECH. FOR EDUCATION TO BE ACHIEVED, WE MUST CHALLENGE OUR MOST ESSENTIAL UNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT EXISTENCE, NOT JUST OUR ABILITY TO HOLD AND STORE FACTUALLY CORRECT INFORMATION OR DATUM. </span><br />

 The 1AC can only conceptualize reality in terms of the passing of time. This inability to escape linear time is the lynchpin by which we are tied to capitalism.<br />
Agamben 78<br />
Infancy and History<br />

Capitalism presents our life repeated back to us as a spectacle. Rather than reinvest in this spectacle by buying into the Aff's notion of progress, you should carry it to its completion, revel in the images of destruction they present.<br />

The 1AC's desire to run from catastrophe merely pushes us headfirst into disaster. Simulations of the apocalypse produce viral responses of seismic porportions. There's no alternative - a negative ballot merely operates outside of the bad consciousness of the affirmative.<br />
