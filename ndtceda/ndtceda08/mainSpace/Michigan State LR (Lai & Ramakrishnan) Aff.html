New Federalism Advantage:<br />
Morrison is the key symbol of the federalism revival – it had much more public potency than any other decision.<br />
McGinnis, California Law Review, 2002<br />
Morrison depends the Rehnquist Court’s AND remains unchanged<br />
Raich hasn’t changed this signal for 2 reasons –<br />
First, Raich was perceived as a drug case, not a federalism case<br />
Parry, Lewis &amp; Clark Law Review, Winter 2005<br />
I’ll end this section AND hold in the next case<br />
Second, Raich was a substantive victory for New Federalism<br />
Brown, Ohio State Law Journal, 2005<br />
Nonetheless, there are reasons AND of the New Federalism<br />
This signal is key – the continued functioning of the US federalist system is key to promoting dual federalism abroad.<br />
Bogen, Hastings Law Journal, Dec. 2003<br />
Finally, American federalism AND viable form of government<br />
Pre-empt to Moravscik – anti-Americanism doesn’t stop modeling – other countries continue to emulate the US<br />
The Times, Dec 7, 2002<br />
Regrettably, the Romans AND first phase of the War on Terror<br />
Court decisions that promote federalism undermine the process of decentralization – the relationship is the opposite of what is commonly assumed<br />
Cross , Cardozo Law Review, Nov. 2002<br />
The most serious flaw AND achievement of those benefits<br />
This is specifically true of Morrison, which set a precedent against decentralization<br />
Cross, above<br />
Simply examining Supreme Court federalism AND professed benefits of federalism<br />
This distinction is crucial – federalism undermines the effective functioning of democracy – multiple cross-national studies prove<br />
Cross, above<br />
Finally, federalism may reduce AND values of federalism<br />
Democracy solves extinction<br />
Diamond<br />
Independently, decentralization key to effective public health services<br />
Cross, above<br />
The significant association AND weak organizational form<br />
New pandemic inevitable – only effective public health services can prevent a catastrophe<br />
Dayton Daily News, 12-9-05<br />
World and national health AND human pathogen emerges<br />
Impact: death of billions within a year<br />
Chandra, 5-7-04, online<br />
This scenario, as frightening as it is AND mortality rate is estimated<br />
No offense – decentralization solves all benefits of federalism without the down sides<br />
Cross, above<br />
Yet another benefit attributed AND presents the proof<br />
Specifically true in Indonesia – decentralization key to stability, but transition to federalism undermines stability<br />
Antlov, online, 1999<br />
In order for Indonesia AND less central supervision<br />
Indonesian instability crushes global economy<br />
Menon, National Interest, Fall 2001<br />
Indonesia’s size and location AND 1997 would slow<br />

The result of the court’s decision has to establish a precedent against cooperative federalism-oveturning Morrison is critical to establish a more preductive precedent.<br />
Goldfarb, associate prof of law at Rutgers U school of law, 2002<br />
(sally F., Fordham Law review, October, lexis)<br />
there is a third, less… it made in Morrison<br />
Us empirically provides the key model for russian federalism reform<br />
Lynn and novikov 1997 – publius, spring, proquest<br />
“one of the most important political debates in Russia” … “who proposed abolishing all the republics and national-formations”<br />
Cooperative federalism is key to solve RFE forest fires<br />
wilkson 2005 – pacific rim law and policy journal, april, lexis<br />
“implementing cooperative federalism into russia’s” … “most effective fire prevention in the RFE”<br />
<br />
RFE forests key to global bio-d and to prevent global warming<br />
wilkson 2005 – pacific rim law and policy journal, april, lexis<br />
“the RFE’s forests are… and far eastern leopard”<br />
The impact is runaway warming and extinction<br />
Henderson 2006 – <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.countercurrents.org/cc-henderson190806.htm" rel="nofollow">www.countercurrents.org/cc -henderson190806.htm</a><br />
“scientific understanding increasingly points to runaway global warming leading to human extinction” .. “therefore extinction or very near extinction of humanity”<br />
Gender advantgate<br />
First, the supreme courts failure to uphold the VAWA on commerce Clause grounds relegated gendered violence to secondary importance—overturning Morrison is necessary to create pathways for empowerment.<br />
Gleason, program coordinator at the center for American women and politics, 2001<br />
(Christy, Women’s Rights Law reporter, Summer/Fall, Lexis)<br />
by ignoring the legislative… status as economic actors along the way.<br />
Its not about the VAWA, its about the dicion—Morrison sets the key precedent upholding the public-private dichotomy—as long as this system remains unchallenged, gendered violence and sexual inequality are inevitable.<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of law at university of michagen law school, 2000<br />
(Catherine, Harvard law review, novermber, lexus)<br />
the morrion majority does…and what does not<br />
You cant win any offense—criminalization guarantees continued patriarchy in the status quo<br />
Iglesias, prof of law at U Miami, 96<br />
(Elizabeth M., Vanderbilt Law Review, May, Lexis)<br />
this article explores… intervention and political struggle.<br />
And, the VAWA avoids these problems<br />
Goldfarb, Rutgers U school of law, 2002<br />
(sally F., Fordham Law review, October, lexis)<br />
On a more concrete level… than a criminal statute.<br />
The ultimate impact is extinction—the dysfunctionality of patriarchy guarantees continued violence, war , and environmental destruction. Only moving away from this system can create opportunities for survival.<br />
Warren and Candy, professors of philosophy at Macalester College and Hamline U, 1994<br />
(Karen and Duane, Hypatia, Spring, Proquest)<br />
the notion of patriarchy as a socially dysfunctional system… national, and global contexts.<br />

Economic collapses causes extinction<br />
Mead 92 (Walter Russell, Senior Fellow – Council on Foreign Relations, New Perspectives Quarterly, Summer, p. 30)<br />
The failure to develop an international system to hedge against the possibility of worldwide depression- will open their eyes to their folly. Hundreds of millions-billions-of people around the world have pinned their hopes on the international market economy. They and their leaders have embraced market principles-and drawn closer to the West-because they believe that our system can work for them. But what if it can't? What if the global economy stagnates, or even shrinks? In that case, we will face a new period of international conflict: South against North, rich against poor. Russia. China. India-these countries with their billions of people and their nuclear weapons will pose a much greater danger to world order than Germany and Japan did in the 1930's.<br />
