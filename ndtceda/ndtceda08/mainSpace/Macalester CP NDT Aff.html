Judge: Naputi, b. Johnson, Hamilton<br />
<br />
Plan Text: Plan: The United States Federal Government Should Increase its Constructive Engagement With The Government of the Palestinian Authority By Recognizing Hamas as the Legitimately Elected Parliamentary Majority and Hence Including it in all Relevant Negotiations and Activities and Offering Them Substantial Foreign Assistance in the Form of Foreign Aid.<br />
<br />
1ac w/ cites<br />
<br />
Observation 1: Hamas<br />
<br />
Since the 2006 Election American Policy Has Aimed at Overthrowing and Isolating Hamas, the Democratically Chosen Representatives of Palestine—This Strategy Has Not Only Failed But Reveals the Dangerous Intentions of the U.S. and Israel to Punish Palestine For Voting the “Wrong Way”—This Summer’s Violence and Ensuing Blockade Means This Ideology Has Created Humanitarian Disaster<br />
<br />
Noam Chomsky, “Guillotining Gaza,” Information Clearing House, July 30th, 2007 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18092.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18092.htm)</a><br />
<br />
The death of a nation is a rare and somber event... reaction to the January 2006 election<br />
<br />
American support of collective starvation policies toward Gaza puts us at the root of their extermination – this makes it impossible to relate to Palestine<br />
<br />
Karker 07, President, Women for Palestine “Can You Hear the Cries From Gaza?” ZNET, August 16<br />
<br />
No one seems to hear…. Bombs dropped from the sky<br />
<br />
The collective starvation is literally genocidal<br />
<br />
Falk 07, Richard, Professor at Princeton, “Slouching toward a Palestinian Holocaust” Transnational Foundation for Peace and Future Research, June 29<br />
<br />
Israel is currently stiffening….post-nazi pledge of never again<br />
<br />
These Policies Emphasize the Paradoxical Assumptions of Democracy—Palestine is Free Only Insofar as They Choose Who and What We Wish Them to Choose—This Assumes a Static Narrative of American Lead Progress, That If “They Were Smart, They Would Think Like Us”<br />
<br />
R. Radhakrishnan, Professor of Asian American Studies, English, and Comparative Literature, Asian American Studies, “When Is Democracy Political?” boundary 2, Fall 2006, p. 105-107<br />
<br />
With these questions in mind… a flourishing national democracy.<br />
<br />
Under this Definition of Democracy, Hamas Has Not Only Refused America’s Gift, But the Gift of God and the World—As Such, America and Israel are Entitled to Promote “True Freedom”<br />
<br />
Slavoj Zizek, In These Times, February 14th, 2005 (The Not-So Quiet American, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizbush.htm%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacan.com/zizbush.htm)</a><br />
<br />
With the global American ideological offensive… anti-Zionist pan-Arab nationalists?<br />
<br />
This Logic is the Basis For Violence—Something Emergent in the Other that We Cannot Control or Understand Justifies its Extermination.<br />
<br />
Zizek '95 [Slavoj , “Ideology between Fiction and Fantasy,” 16 Cardozo Law Review 1511, 1995, LN]<br />
<br />
Our argument can be briefly summarized… dimensions acquired by the remainder.<br />
<br />
This metaphysical arbitration of the conflict between Israel and Palestine is the ultimate support for Zionism – the only justification for Israeli claims to supersede Palestinian claims is destiny<br />
<br />
Rose 05 (Jacquelin, Professor at Queen Mary University of London, The Question of Zion, p. 54-55<br />
<br />
What I have been describing… there is no earthly reason of the claim?<br />
<br />
This project of Zionims is not a radical break or empowerment of Judaism post the horrors of WWII, instead, Zionism rests on the foundation of anti-semitism and ultimately aims to view Palestine from its perspective<br />
<br />
Massad 05(Joseph, The Persistence of the Palestinian Question” Cultural Critique #59 Winter 2005 pp. 1-23_<br />
<br />
The only possibility to alter the situation is the true act of recognizing and relating to the former enemy/terrorist<br />
<br />
Zizek 04 “The Iraqi MacGuffin”<br />
<br />
The Persistence of the “Palestinian Question” Testifies to the Legacy of Anti-Semitism—Embracing Palestine as the Abandonment of the European Anti-Semitic Legacy Strikes at the Heart of Zionism.<br />
<br />
Joseph Massad, assistant professor of modern Arab politics and intellectual history at Columbia University, “The Persistence of the Palestinian Question,” Cultural Critique, #59, Winter 2005, pp. 1-23<br />
<br />
The persistence of anti-Semitism… hatred of Jewish Jews and of the Palestinians.<br />
<br />
The Act of Recognition Illustrates the Contingency of Identity—Things Could Have Been Different, Israelis Could Be Palestinians, etc.—Such a Recognition Allows For a True Openness to the World (Gender Modified)<br />
<br />
Jacqueline Rose, Professor of English at Queen Mary University of London, The Question of Zion, 2005, p.100-102<br />
<br />
I like to think that Ahad Ha'am… free from the tribunal of tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our case solves better than any alt – psychoanalytic method is critical to establishing a notion of ethics devoid of scapegoating violence – we solve your impacts<br />
<br />
Zizek 07 “Robespierre or the Divine Violence’<br />
<br />
We can see now why Lacan’s motto…..for determining what my duty is.<br />
<br />
Foreign aid and recognition are crucial for ethics<br />
<br />
Oneil 96 (Onora, “Ending World Hunger” World Hunger and Morality, p. 105-106)<br />
<br />
Moral issue of food outweighs everything else<br />
<br />
Watson 77 (Reason and Morality in a World of Limited Food” p. 118-120)<br />
<br />
These arguments are morally spurious….of individual moral behavior<br />
<br />
Case outweighs nuclear war for three reasons<br />
<br />
Martin 84 (Brian, “Extinction Politics” Scientists Against Nuclear Arms Newsletter, p. 5-6)<br />
<br />
There are quite a number…. And the environmental movement.<br />

c/a 1AC Zizek – normal ethics are an appeal to the big Other<br />
<br />
c/a 1AC Zizek – recognition changes political coordinates<br />
<br />
Their lines of flight are false – those come from Lack<br />
<br />
Braungardt 01(Jurgen, Theology in Freud and Lacan)<br />
<br />
The focus on the signifier…fallacy of objectification<br />
<br />
Desire and lines of flight are arbitary<br />
<br />
We are rooted in language<br />
<br />
No link - We make particular claims, not universal<br />

Perm: Plan + and be a “nat fly Socrates thing”<br />

Heidenber 04<br />

Overidentification is the only way to create resistance<br />
<br />
Zizek 04<br />
<br />
The negative is political wholeness – this requires a fantasy<br />
<br />
Stavrakakis 99 (Yannis, Lacan and the Political, p. 74)<br />
<br />
It is this constitutive…root of our symbolization of political reality<br />
<br />
Their alternative – they try to question from the Outside, there is a curse within the fantasy<br />
<br />
Stavrakakis 99 (Lacan and the Political, p.51-52)<br />
<br />
In that sense…of this pre-symbolic real<br />
<br />
They don’t solve universality<br />
<br />
We solve their offense, they allow unchecked state violence<br />
<br />
Zizek 01 (The Ticklish Subject)<br />
<br />
And to give this… false transgressive radicality<br />
<br />
We access their alternative solvency, no scenario of how we are the state/war machine<br />
<br />
Their alternative doesn’t solve means that violence continues<br />

1ar Strategy Notes<br />
<br />
We have defenses of our reasoning, we are not dogmatic<br />
<br />
We defend particular truths that are not universal<br />
<br />
Extend Watson – we need to take action, so that individuals can act ethically<br />
<br />
Extend Zizek 07 – aff destroys ability to appeal to big Other<br />
<br />
Extend Zizek 95 – negative scapegoats universalism which leads to the elimination otherness<br />
<br />
No specific link of our dogmatism<br />
<br />
Extend Zizek 04 – we allow individual ethics to emerge<br />
<br />
The lack exists because we have differences<br />
<br />
We rely on the indeterminate nature of subjects<br />
<br />
They have conceded that Lack exists<br />
<br />
Zizek 07 – lines of flights allows for the expansion of capitalism<br />
<br />
The only way to challenge totalitarianism is through particular demands on the state<br />
<br />
2ar Strategy Notes<br />
<br />
Concedes that Lack exists – because we have common terms, there is a primordial need for language<br />
<br />
They negative tries to get outside of the symbolic order – this is impacted by Stavrakakis<br />
<br />
We have particular reasons to vote affirmative – 1.5 million people are suffering<br />
<br />
We win that feeding people is good<br />
<br />
An ethical system of taking responsibility avoids the impacts of dogmatism<br />
<br />
Permutation functions if we access Zizek evidence + net benefit of feeding people<br />
<br />
Concedes Zizek 07 that says that rhizomatic order allows for more capitalism<br />
<br />
Zizek proves that justice can be good
