Round 1<br />
Adv. 1 Iraq<br />
The Mini Surge Doesn’t hit 7,500 necessary for battle success<br />
<strong>International Herald Tribune 01/11/2008</strong><br />
&lt;Senior U.S. military officers . . . have agreed are needed.<br />
And Bush will choose to maintain a ‘pre-surge’ presence in Iraq without further drawdown of US troops<br />
<strong>The Huffington post 01/19/2008</strong><br />
&lt;Petraeus seems at this point . . . cutbacks beyond july.<br />
The American troop presence in Iraq is not sustainable.<br />
<strong>Kojm – Professor of International Affairs, GWU – 2007</strong><br />
(Christopher. Christian Science Monitor 12/03/2007)<br />
&lt;We need to move as . . . no longer be sustained.<br />
The window of opportunity for success in Iraq is closing, failure to generate momentum for political reconciliation will push Iraq deeper into conflict and war.<br />
<strong>Ackerman – Senior Reporter for the American Prospect -2008</strong><br />
(The Washington Independent, “Security Gains from the Surge backsliding” 01/31)<br />
&lt;It used to be that the surge enthusiasts. . . “a sword on the neck of the people.”&gt;<br />
If Iraq falls deeper into Sectarian war, Conflict will spread across the Midde East<br />
<strong>Defence Journal,</strong> “Sectarian Conflict – Implications for Muslim Community” <strong>12/20/2006</strong><br />
&lt;Spread of sectarian tensions . . . applies to all countries&gt;<br />
This Escalates to all out nuclear war with nuclear weapons<br />
<strong>Steinbach 2002</strong><br />
(John. Israeli Nuclear Weapons: a threat to peace, 3/3)<br />
&lt;Meanwhile, the existence of an arsenal. . . could trigger a world conflagration.”&gt;<br />
Augmenting our troop presence in Afghanistan means Bush will have to initiate a phased withdrawal from Iraq at the tail end of the surge.<br />
<strong>The New York Times 01/18/2008</strong><br />
&lt;When they decided last September . . . strain on the overall force.&gt;<br />
Initiating a phased withdrawal of American forces is necessary to pressuring warring factions to adopt a lasting political solution that stabilizes Iraq.<br />
<strong>Obama – democratic Senator for President &amp; Candidate for Democratic Presidential nomination – 2007</strong><br />
(Barack. <em>Renewing American Leadership,</em> Foreign Affairs, July/August)<br />
&lt;To renew American leadership . . . stability to their country.&gt;<br />
Beginning the Withdrawal now is necessary for success – Waiting to withdraw will increase resistance to American troop presence escalating violence and instability.<br />
<strong>Brimley &amp; Miller</strong>, Shawn A., research fellow @ CNAS, Vice President @ CNAS. Iraq: response to Max Boot. Commentary pg. 3 <strong>12/03/2007</strong><br />
&lt;Mr. Boot himself notes . . . later is the best bet.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Only by achieving the end game in Iraq can we make American Hegemony sustainable<br />
<strong>Daalder &amp; Lindsay,</strong> <em>Restore trust in America’s Leadership”</em> Policy review Fall <strong>2007</strong><br />
<strong>&lt;</strong>No foreign policy decision since America’s retreat . . . into greater instability and violence.&gt;<br />
American Predominance is key to prevent intensifying rivalries with nuclear weapons<br />
<strong>Kagan 2007</strong><br />
Policy Review, “End of Dreams; Return of History” August/September<br />
&lt;The jostling for status and influence . . . make them more catastrophic.&gt;<br />
<strong>Adv. 2 Red Dawn</strong><br />
The US is competing with Russia and China for energy resources in central Asia. Stabilizing Afghanistan is a pre-requisite to getting TAP built which is necessary to break Russia’s stranglehold over natural gas in the region.<br />
Blank 2006<br />
Eurasia Insight, “Afghanistan is key to prevent Russian Gas Hegemony” 08/03<br />
&lt;the release of new estimates. . . Afghanistan into Central Asia.&gt;<br />
<br />
And a lack of a credible commitment for the US and skittish NATO forces to counter increasing levels of insurgent violence have forced Karzai into the arms of Russia.<br />
Shlapenktoh 2007<br />
“The Afghanistan-Russia rapproachment and its geopolitical implications” CACI Analyst 05/30<br />
&lt; Background: The major reason for Karzai . . .Middle East and Surrounding areas.&gt;<br />
<br />
This will prevent cooperation over the region<br />
Shlapenktoh 2007<br />
“The Afghanistan-Russia rapproachment and its geopolitical implications” CACI Analyst 05/30<br />
&lt;Conclusions: the impending American withdrawal . . . mutual rapprochement indicates.&gt;<br />
<br />
Furthermore, energy revenues allow Russia to accelerate its expansionist, global power pursuit by employing divide and conquer tactics in the EU.<br />
Bugjaski 2007<br />
Wall Street Journal, “Russia’s Far Abroad” 03/22<br />
&lt;In his landmark speech. . . a European hub for Caspian gas.&gt;<br />
Russia’s increasing influence over EU policy will undercut American Unipolarity, inviting conflict between the US and Russia.<br />
Bugjaski 2003/2004<br />
The National Interest, “Russia’s New Europe” Winter<br />
&lt;Having invested enormous political . . . the United States will as well.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
War between the US and Russia goes nuclear resulting in extinction<br />
Dyer 2005<br />
<em>War: The Lethal Custom pg. 1</em><br />
&lt; When I wrote the first edition of this book. . . “nuclear winter” that closes the account.&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>Solvency</u></strong><br />
Increasing the number of troops within the PRT’s and the number of PRT’s is key to stabilize Afghanistan.<br />
Akin 2007<br />
US Fed News, “Statement on Role of DOD in Provincial Reconstruction Teams.”<br />
&lt;Also, we must keep in mind. . . when a PRT’s work is done.&gt;<br />
At most 20,000 troops are key to fight the insurgency<br />
Wadhams&amp;Korb 2007<br />
National security Policy, “The Forgotten Mission in Afghanistan Can Succeed.”<br />
&lt;Sunday, October 7, 2007, marks . . . equipment and airlift.&gt;<br />
Phased Withdrawal will reprioritize Afghanistan and create necessary political conditions for political solution in Iraq.<br />
<strong>Obama – democratic Senator for President &amp; Candidate for Democratic Presidential nomination – 2007</strong><br />
(Barack. Business Wire<em>, “Obama Discusses we need to change judgement”</em> Foreign Affairs 12/18)<br />
&lt;On Iraq, we hear that the surge is succeeding . . . that’s what I’ll do as President.&gt;<br />
Increasing the number of troops is key to effective counterinsurgency and a victory at the southern border<br />
<strong>Royle 2007</strong><br />
Sunday Herald, “Karzai Meets Bush to ensure US keeps its eye on the Afghan Ball.” 08/05<br />
&lt;Gordon also acknowledged that point . . . That’s the way forward.”&gt;
