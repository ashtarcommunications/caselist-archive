 Plan: The United States Federal Government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Syria. This should include offering them a security guarantee that the United States does not seek regime change in Syria as an inducement to engage in dialogue about Iraqi refugees displaced in Syria, Engagement should also include the United States allowing Iraqi refugees to enter into the United States as well as a substantial increase in foreign assistance to address sex trafficking in Syria, in exchange for Syria to re-open it’s borders to Iraqi’s who seek refuge in Syria and to allow all refugees to seek legal employment status in Syria.  <br />
<br />
First, at least 80 percent of the prostitution ring in Syria consists of Iraqi refugees; it’s sell sex in Syria or go back to Iraq and die.  <br />
New York Times 2007 (May 29, Desperate Iraqi Refugees Turn to Sex Trade in Syria) <br />
Inexpensive Iraqi prostitutes… only work available.” <br />
<br />
And, it’s estimated that some 50,000 Iraqi refugees in Syria are forced into prostitution because the Syrian government does not allow them to seek legal employment as refugees in the country- <br />
Hassan 2007 (Nihal, 50,000 Iraqi Refugees Forced into Prostitution, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2701324.ece" rel="nofollow">http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article2701324.ece</a>, June 24)  <br />
It's Monday night …the figure at 50,000. <br />
<br />
Recent regulations imposed to cut off refugees to Syria is the final straw- this is not the solution to the growing problem of refugees engaging in sex trafficking.  <br />
Owies Sept 3 2007 ( Khaled, Reuters, Syria severely restricts Iraqi refugee influx, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL0362348320070903?&amp;src=090307_1351_TOPSTORY_bush_in_iraq&amp;pageNumber=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL0362348320070903?&amp;src=090307_1351_TOPSTORY_bush_in_iraq&amp;pageNumber=1</a>)  <br />
Syria has imposed …even more miserable,&quot; said Fadel Ahmad, who came from Baghdad. <br />
<br />
A lack of a resolution on the sex trade of Iraqi refugees in Syria is a time bomb waiting to explode- and it’s directed at the United States. <br />
Engel 2007 (David, The Daily Nightly, In Syria, Girls March as Timebomb Ticks, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/07/10/265072.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/07/10/265072.aspx</a>, July 10)  <br />
Some of the girls … war in Iraq. <br />
<br />
Each night Iraqi women as young as 13 and 14 are forced to work in clubs, selling sex to ensure their survival as refugees in Syria- every night reminded they are a victim. <br />
Engel 2007 (David, The Daily Nightly, In Syria, Girls March as Timebomb Ticks, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/07/10/265072.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://dailynightly.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/07/10/265072.aspx</a>, July 10)  <br />
The girls circle … again every night. <br />
Being forced into prostitution to earn a living destroys the value of life of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi women, this is the equivalent of death to them. <br />
CBS 2007 (Iraqi Refugees Turn to Prostitution, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/07/eveningnews/main2445663.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/07/eveningnews/main2445663.shtml</a>, Feb 7) <br />
It's after midnight, and … desperate refugees from the war.  <br />
<br />
Descriptions of the harms of the status quo and impact comparisons prioritizing the harms of traditional “wars” denies the sexual horror inflicted on women through trafficking everyday. We must challenge this domination and objectification wherever it occurs.  <br />
Amy Ray, US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, 2-1997 American University Law Review  <br />
<br />
Because, as currently constructed, … camp in a foreign country. <br />

<br />
A security guarantee of no regime change is the critical first step in engaging Syria- <br />
Anthony H. Cordesman, Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy Center for Strategic and International Studies June 2007 <br />
Improving US and Syrian Relations: Some Possible Beginnings <br />
<br />
This paper has focused on … and instant “democracy.” <br />
<br />
A change in US policy to allow more refugees into the United States would alleviate the overwhelming problem of prostitution of Iraqi refugees in Syria. <br />
Arbuthnot 2007 (Felicity, Exodus of Iraqi Refugees: Syria The Price of Compassion, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=6384" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=6384</a>, July 20) <br />
&quot;If we were to take legal … the 2003 invasion. In Britain,  <br />
<br />
<br />
Aid from the US is needed for Syria to begin to address this problem- they can’t do it alone. <br />

Local activists … donor commitment we will begin.&quot; <br />
<br />
The United States must take responsibility; it is the war in Iraq that led to women selling their bodies for survival.  <br />
New York Times 2007 (May 29, Desperate Iraqi Refugees Turn to Sex Trade in Syria)  <br />
<br />
For anyone living … asset is their bodies.  <br />
<br />
And, creating the economic opportunity in Syria is critical to stop the initial cause of trafficking- inability to be employed- work permits are issued for some, they should be allowed for all.  <br />

<br />
When Iraqis … Iraqi children is growing. <br />
<br />
The international community cannot stand idly by- the growing despair of Iraqi refugees in Syria must be addressed. <br />
