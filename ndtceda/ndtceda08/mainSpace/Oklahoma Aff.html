Read speeches from Willie Lynch about how to make a &quot;negro&quot; slave.<br />
We read three speecehs.<br />

Then we play some beats and give various speeches about Milliken and the term negro.<br />
<br />
NO we do not have a &quot;plan&quot;.<br />
<br />
No we do not use the Supreme Court.<br />
<br />
Yes we defend Milliiken was a bad decision.<br />
<br />
The term &quot;negro&quot; in the decision outweighs any arguments attempting to claim it is a good decision.<br />

Plan: Overturn Milliken – Nothing more specific is identified.<br />
<br />
Outline:<br />
Speech by Willy Lynch (sp?) describing how to keep slaves in their place. Implication is that separation by categories is evil.<br />
<br />
Rap to music arguing Milliken is racist and dehumanizing and should be overturned.<br />
<br />

Affirmative Team: OU BK<br />
Negative Team: Vandy EY<br />
Judge: Dustin Rimmey<br />

Affirmative Read: Quirin<br />
<br />
Plan Text:<br />
Write out the affirmative's full plan text word for word. If the complete plan is already on a caselist or on a previous round report and hasn't changed, then you can simply indicate that.<br />
We seek to overthrow the rhetoric of “enemy combatant” and offer the plan: In the next available test case, the United States Supreme Court should overrule section 9 of ex parte Quirin defining enemy combatant.<br />

They claim that they solve both on the policy and an in round discursive level.<br />

Advantages:<br />
If a new affirmative is read or you hear a new advantage, you should get complete cites. Otherwise, just list the advantages that the affirmative claims.<br />
<br />
• enemy combatant was defined as unlawful belligerence in quiren<br />
• construction of enemy combatant creates them an enemy that needs to be exterminated<br />
• the other is sometimes neutral or sometimes positive, but if it is categorized as dangerous, killing it is justified<br />
• security is socially constructed<br />
• the concept of enemy forces us into monolithic thinking<br />
• the reality of war masks categories that can …<br />
• inflations leads to 6 million deaths during war time<br />
• the creation of enemy prompts militarization which diverts funds from real needs and threats<br />
• bush uses totalizing rhetoric of enemy and friend<br />
• judiciary endorses same rhetoric<br />
<br />
• knowledge of the world is encapsulates in language<br />
• through stari decisos plan can alter language<br />
• plan will have a lasting effect because starie decises binds courts to new language<br />
• (some guy) says we create our own threat<br />

Abortion restrictions presume the reporuction to be natural and termination unnatural. This presumption issues from an unconscious Law<br />
Roof 1996<br />

thier reading of the law is both essentializing and niave. yes, we are subjected to the law but this subjection is also liberation from the arbitrary whims of violent states of nature. zizek agrees that the law provides a space for the subject to pursue his/her enjoyment without the inconvenience of anarchy.<br />

Ours is an inherently self-critical affirmation. central to our claim that all identity is contingent is a recognition that this limitation applies, foremost, to our own ethical projects. we recognize the imperfection of our affirmation of contingency even as we strive to instill it in public life. this ironic problematization allows for political contests in which neither side supposes thier identity to correspond to capital-t Truth and is netbeneficial to an alternative that attemtps to squeeze contingency out of life by presuming its own sufficiency.<br />

William Connolly, identity/difference, 1991, p. ix-xi<br />
&quot;Agonistic democracy breaks ...into the penitentiary of democracy&quot;<br />
<br />
Such politics de-territorializes democracy, recognining that politics can exist underneath and between states. This neither destroys the state nor replicates it but contests its monopoly on politics. This is critical to challenging the forces that dogmatize idetntity, and reworking our relationships to difference so as to avoid violence.<br />

<br />
What does it mean to be an American? An asshole NASCAR fan concerned with guns, god, and gays? A wasteful and oblivious mall-going SUV driver? A pretentious exceptionalist with a NIMBY approach to everything from human rights to culture? Maybe.<br />
But more and more America has coalesced around the image of a family. The violent cultural debate over gay marriage, Ford pickup truck commercials, the commercial failure of the tv show Arrested Development, and Dr. Phil’s domination of the bestsellers list all remind us that our primary responsibility is to father our sons, mother our daughters, and love our kin.<br />
This sacred institution is constantly threatened. Its scapegoats take various forms at different times, but the family is always under attack.<br />
This locates the american family within the horizon of utopia, which calls into its service all political energy above and against a persistent ontological negativity.<br />
Stavrakakis explains in 99.<br />
<br />
Stavrakakis. Lacan and the Political. 99-101<br />
<br />
The persistent and prevalent enemy of the modern family is the stereotypical welfare queen. The racialized, impoverished single teenager mother. The fat lazy couch potato – these women disgust our collective morality and endanger our collective identity. Dangerously, utopian politics enlist the service of scientific objectivity to assess and control the situation. The result is a violent genetic essentialism which takes aim at the reproductive liberties of low-income women of color in an effort at maintaining the purity of the population.<br />
Beverly Horsburgh. 17 Cardo. L. R. 531 January 1996<br />
<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood v. Casey is an exemplary manifestation of these politics. The restrictions legitimized by the decision presume a singular experience of womanhood and pregnancy -- indeed the experience of the ideal mother in the utopian imaginary. This women is white and affluent, and likely married. The result is an increased vulnerability of marginalized women to genocidal attacks on their reproductive freedom.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The stage is set for eugenics. Current case law provides the legal context, and prevalent public attitudes the social environment, suitable to forced sterilization of the unfit. Abortion jurisprudence is key.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The law’s presumption of a single idealized woman creates a cycle of victimization for welfare mothers. Absent a political forum which respects the intersectional nature of their identity they are powerless to contest encroachments on their freedom and genocidal efforts at eliminating them from motherhood. A legal culture which respects difference is crucial to low-income women of color for repudiating their material subordination and claiming public and political recognition as human beings.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
<br />
<br />
Reproductive rights are critical to fostering this jurisprudential space.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG.<br />
<br />
PLAN (The USSC should OR the undue burden standard established by PP v C on the grounds that any state restriction on abortion violates a welfare mothers right to natality.)<br />
<br />
Claiming the right to natality is key to affirming the innate capacity of marginalized women to change the world. Natality represents the unlimited potentiality of being. Claiming this right can reshape the entire welfare dialectic in a way that respects the humanity of impoverished women of color and is critical to breaking the eugenic tide of the status quo.<br />
<br />
HORSBURG<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, we situate our affirmative within the context of politicizing negativity. Institutionalizing the antagonism of threatening identities into the law is an avenue for disrupting the totalizing narrative of utopian politics. It is critical to challenging the universal notion of a collective identity from which those who deviate must be repressed. Insisting upon difference within the law subverts its attempts at harmony in a way that opens the political to persistent contestation and change. This is the critical political ethos for respecting alterity.<br />

Ruth Colker. Pregnant Men: Practice, Theory, and the Law. 1994. pg. 188<br />
<br />
<br />
These measures effectively establish a financial test for motherhood. The socioeconomic circumstances in which people live profoundly influence their capacity to make decisions concerning their bodies. This implicates the modern reproductive rights movement in a larger eugenic process of screening the unfit out of the gene pool.<br />

<br />
Furthermore, these compromise politics have lead the bush administration to implement international policies aimed at restricting abortion access for the world's women. Abortion access movements are global and systemic, however the United States stifles their efforts in the name of conservative ideology which does not directly deny a women's right to choice but denigrates it in comparison to a larger concern for public morality and family values.<br />

&quot;In 1973, the United States....misguided and morally bankrupt policies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Status Quo conceptions of politics and democracy normalize society, endorsing a small set of identities and pretending that the rest of society ought to conform to them. In the context of abortion, contemporary notions of choice have defined good mothers and good choice-makers, and proliferated abnormalities, stigmatizing those who do not pass the financial test for motherhood. The ultimate task of today must be to politicize and contest the dogmatic identities of the status quo.<br />

<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule the Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, repealling all state restrictions on abortion.<br />
<br />
The affirmative is a new theorization of politics that does not relegate democracy to the confines of the territorial state. Instead, we recognize that democracy flows through, above, and below the state. This enables the globalization of politics that contest the claims of sovereignty. The aff stands in solidarity with other people and groups fighting for access to abortion, disturbing the normal operation of state-centered politics. This democratizes the global issue of abortion.<br />
<br />
William Connolly. Identity/Difference. 1991. pp. 215-20<br />
<br />
Finally, we do not pretend that our approach is universally desirable or should be universally implemented. Instead, ours is an inherently self-critical affirmation that recognizes ALL identity as contingent. We recognize the imperfection of our affirmation even as we strive to instill it in public life. This ironic problematization allows for political contests in which neither side supposes their identity to correspond to truth and is net beneficial to an alternative that attempts to squeeze the contingency out of life by presuming its own sufficiency.<br />

The debate world is mired in regulatory schemes of control meant to subjugate the creative instincts of debaters to tried and true “frameworks” for evaluation. The productive capacities of individual debaters are suffocated in attempts to force all to play by “the rules of the game.” What are these rules? From where do they come? Who authorizes them? These are all questions left unanswered even as debaters blindly defer critical energies to routine and tired “interpretations,” naively presuming that these are ahistorical, objective, neutral. Not so. In fact, there is no pure form of debate waiting to be discovered. Only the meager attempts of directors and debaters alike to secure their fantasy world of debate in their image.<br />
<br />
Ian Johnston. “There’s Nothing Nietzsche Couldn’t Teach Ya About the Raising of the Wrist: A Lecture in Liberal Studies.” Google It. 1999.<br />
<br />
<br />
The dogmatists will likely rise up to insist that, even given the fallibility of any rule book, we can create rules to ensure the best way to play our game – debate. But this is impossible. To presume such would mean that any of us has privileged access to an external reality which authorizes some inventions as right and others as wrong. This is naive and misleading. There is no true way to play any particular game just as there is no true game at all.<br />
<br />
Ian Johnston. “There’s Nothing Nietzsche Couldn’t Teach Ya About the Raising of the Wrist: A Lecture in Liberal Studies.” Google It. 1999.<br />
<br />
This urge to fix debate is severely limiting for the capacity of debaters to become self-fashioned excellent individuals. The goal of education, which is the primary goal of this activity, ought not be to suppress the creative instincts of the individual but to let them flourish. Our ultimate aim ought to be providing debaters with a venue for self-realization. This requires open-ended frameworks which do not subsume individuality in deference to authority. This does pose risks to predictable routine debate, but contestation and conflict are necessary to stimulate individual will. Further, these unpredictable aspects of debate are precisely those that make the learning experience an adventure – exciting and worthwhile.<br />

<br />
Therefore, we affirm the resolution. Resolved: the United States Supreme Court should overturn Planned Parenthood v. Casey.<br />
<br />
Abortion restrictions strike us as superbly moralizing efforts at imposing upon women an externally derived form over and above their own self-making.<br />
You wont be surprised to hear that we are not interested in pretending that such a plan may be implemented by the “high court.” As affirmers and creators, we accept this impossibility and propose our will regardless. This aesthetic of affirmation is much more integral to our general affirmation of life than are the opinions of 9 detached individuals. This is our will: a world of human independence, unrestrained by external authority, however, we do not seek to impose it on anyone else. Our affirmation is a general liberation of the human spirit to define our own truths.<br />
<br />
Frederick M. Dolan. “SYMPOSIUM: Nietzsche and Legal Theory (Part 1): Nietzsche;s Gnosis of Law.” 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 757. January, 2003.<br />
<br />
This is an effort on our part to remake debate as our own game. We refuse the traditional models that have been handed down to us and prefer instead to recreate our own version of the rules, recognizing them as pertaining only to us. The ballot is an explicit affirmation, on your part, of our attempt to make debate our own as well as a refusal that our’s or anyone’s version of the game is the one on which you must decide. Voting affirmative means liberating your own creative potentials while simultaneously allowing us to do the same. Do not be frightened by crisis rhetoric. Rest assured that debate will not collapse as a result of an affirmative ballot. Rather, any innovation in debate or any other game has resulted from accidental disruptions of tradition – not unlike the aff. Further, debate dogmatists seem so committed to their project that they risk killing debate in order to save it. Making debate human means refusing the imposition of another’s rules but using the resources there afforded to fashion a game of our own.<br />

Observation 1: It takes a village...<br />
<br />
America is totally beholden to the image of a Child. When I was little my parents entertained the fantasy of Santa Clause, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny in an effort at preserving my childhood, a specially revered shelter from the corruption of the adult world. Indeed, social and legal mores are routinely reshaped and regulated in the name of protecting &quot;the innocent children.&quot; Even fetal personhood has come to shape expectations of and exert pressures on national membership and identity.<br />
<br />
Lauren Berlant. Prof. of English @ Univ. Of Chicago. The Queen of America Goes to Washington City. 1997<br />
pp. 97-100<br />
&quot;The conditions of American citizenship....national membership is supposed to provide.&quot;<br />
<br />
The image of the Child works to restrict politics to the terms of Reproductive Futurism. Proponents of abortion rights all too often fall into this trap by framing their arguments in terms of securing a future safe for women.(ideological consensus)<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 2-3<br />
&quot;But what helped him most...resistance from every social structure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood v. Casey is an example of these compromise politics which affirm the &quot;rights&quot; of women while simultaneously pledging fidelity to the reproduction of the social order by sanctioning the right of a state to pursue its &quot;legitimate interest&quot; in promoting the life of unborn children.<br />
O'Connor Et. Al. (from the decision)<br />
&quot;a number of guiding principles...is also reaffirmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Obervation 2: They hate us for our children...<br />
<br />
Reproductive Futurism keeps us terroristically beholden to the Child. Life itself is deferred to a phantasmatic tomorrow as human freedom is sacrificed to the fascism of the baby's face. Furthermore, this ideology obligates us to identify and root out all those individualities and lifestyles which are perceived to threaten the endless repetition of the social order.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 19-22<br />
&quot;The Child, in the historical epoch...Satan's power to kill our children, God children.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not an empty theoretical gesture toward ontological violence. The logic of reproductive futurism literally compels us to constantly identify new threats to the eternal reproduction of the ordered polity. REAL VIOLENCE is visited upon these queers who must be eliminated lest they endanger the Child and the future for which this celebrity stands.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 115-7<br />
&quot;On October 12, 1998...force that sinthomosexuality names.&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: No Child Left Behind...<br />
<br />
The plan issues from a radically queer ethic which refuses integration into the social order and the logic of intelligibility it presupposes. Embracing our negativity by means making demands against the future exposes the constancy of negativity in the social order itself. In so doing, it effectively aborts the continued replication of the status quo which is always attended by a figure of queerness in need of extermination.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 4-7<br />
Rather than rejecting, with liberal discourse....within which my argument takes shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
We should embrace the stigmatization of queers as a &quot;culture of death.&quot; We do not advocate life, choice, or even access. We advocate abortion. Only such a radical position, which insists that the future ­ as continuing the same ­ must end, that the child ­ as figure for that future ­ must die, is capable of exposing the violence which inheres in the social order. Only such an ethic is capable of reclaiming life from the future which currently enslaves it.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 28-31<br />
&quot;Bernard Law, the former cardinal of Boston...to insist that the future stop here.&quot;<br />
<br />
We should accede to the status of sinthomosexuals, identifying with that kernel of our identity which, however perverse, makes us distinctly ourselves and also embracing the stigmatization and abjection that this involves. Only doing so reveals the extent to which each of us is potentially the next victim of violent attempts at ensuring that tomorrow is always only a day away.<br />

Plan: The US Supreme Court should grant cert to the next pertinent case and overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, holding that the state has no compelling interest in promoting unborn life.<br />
<br />
Observation 1: It takes a village...<br />
<br />
America is totally beholden to the image of a Child. When I was little my parents entertained the fantasy of Santa Clause, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny in an effort at preserving my childhood, a specially revered shelter from the corruption of the adult world. Indeed, social and legal mores are routinely reshaped and regulated in the name of protecting “the innocent children.” Even fetal personhood has come to shape expectations of and exert pressures on national membership and identity.<br />
<br />
Lauren Berlant. Prof. of English @ Univ. Of Chicago. The Queen of America Goes to Washington City. 1997<br />
pp. 97-100<br />
&quot;The conditions of American citizenship....national membership is supposed to provide.&quot;<br />
<br />
The image of the Child works to restrict politics to the terms of Reproductive Futurism. Proponents of abortion rights all too often fall into this trap by framing their arguments in terms of securing a future safe for women.(ideological consensus)<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 2-3<br />
&quot;But what helped him most...resistance from every social structure.&quot;<br />
<br />
Planned Parenthood v. Casey is an example of these compromise politics which affirm the “rights” of women while simultaneously pledging fidelity to the reproduction of the social order by sanctioning the right of a state to pursue its “legitimate interest” in promoting the life of unborn children.<br />
O'Connor Et. Al. (from the decision)<br />
&quot;a number of guiding principles...is also reaffirmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Obervation 2: They hate us for our children...<br />
<br />
Reproductive Futurism keeps us terroristically beholden to the Child. Life itself is deferred to a phantasmatic tomorrow as human freedom is sacrificed to the fascism of the baby’s face. Furthermore, this ideology obligates us to identify and root out all those individualities and lifestyles which are perceived to threaten the endless repetition of the social order.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 19-22<br />
&quot;The Child, in the historical epoch...Satan's power to kill our children, God children.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is not an empty theoretical gesture toward ontological violence. The logic of reproductive futurism literally compels us to constantly identify new threats to the eternal reproduction of the ordered polity. REAL VIOLENCE is visited upon these queers who must be eliminated lest they endanger the Child and the future for which this celebrity stands.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 115-7<br />
&quot;On October 12, 1998...force that sinthomosexuality names.&quot;<br />
<br />
PLAN<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, ruling that the state has no compelling interest in promoting unborn life.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: No Child Left Behind...<br />
<br />
The plan issues from a radically queer ethic which refuses integration into the social order and the logic of intelligibility it presupposes. Embracing our negativity by means making demands against the future exposes the constancy of negativity in the social order itself. In so doing, it effectively aborts the continued replication of the status quo which is always attended by a figure of queerness in need of extermination.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 4-7<br />
Rather than rejecting, with liberal discourse....within which my argument takes shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
We should embrace the stigmatization of queers as a “culture of death.” We do not advocate life, choice, or even access. We advocate abortion. Only such a radical position, which insists that the future – as continuing the same – must end, that the child – as figure for that future – must die, is capable of exposing the violence which inheres in the social order. Only such an ethic is capable of reclaiming life from the future which currently enslaves it.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 28-31<br />
&quot;Bernard Law, the former cardinal of Boston...to insist that the future stop here.&quot;<br />
<br />
We should accede to the status of sinthomosexuals, identifying with that kernel of our identity which, however perverse, makes us distinctly ourselves and also embracing the stigmatization and abjection that this involves. Only doing so reveals the extent to which each of us is potentially the next victim of violent attempts at ensuring that tomorrow is always only a day away.<br />
Lee Edelman. No Future: Queer Theory and Death Drive. 2004 pp. 149-54<br />
&quot;Cathy, Eppie, Tiny Tim, the constantly multiplying chilren of Eve....beating their wings, and who, like the drive, keep on coming.&quot;<br />

We should institutionalize the lack in political reality that the negative speaks to, not shrug and walk away from democracy altogether. Radical democracy transforms the fantasy of closure which makes violence inevitable. This involves confronting institutions with antagonism, like the affirmative. The alternative is a world of anxious frenzy without any social relationships.<br />
