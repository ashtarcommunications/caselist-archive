Ct 1 Inherency<br />
Current aid to the Palestinian Authority generates aid dependency by giving billions in humanitarian relief while neglecting assistance for economic capacity-building. This, combined with increasing Israeli barriers to movement, puts the PA on the brink of collapse<br />

Now is the key - the West Bank's economy is collapsing rapidly - employment and production are tanking because of aid dependence and lack of investment<br />

Three impacts<br />
1. Hunger - widespread poverty in the West Bank is creating endemic food insecurity - increasing the PA's capacity to trade is key<br />

2. Terrorism - the lack of economic opportunities in the West Bank is causing widespread radicalization - terrorist groups are moving into Palestine and violence is escalating<br />

Ct 3 Anti-Americanism<br />
<br />
Anti-Americanism in the ME is skyrocketing because of the perception of incompetant U.S. policies and our failure to contribute to economic development - this threatens the entirety of U.S. foreign policy<br />
Frum 11-5-07<br />
&quot;why did Karen Hughes so signally fail&quot; &quot;where it could accomplish much&quot;<br />
<br />
The three biggest causes of Anti-Americanism in the Middle East are (1) the perception of unfairly favoring Israel (2) the U.S. failure to promote economic development, and (3) U.S. policies that undermine Arab states' autonomy<br />

PLAN<br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of the Palestinian Authority the approval of tax-free import to the United States of goods produced in the proposed Jenin Industrial Zone and should request that the Palestinian Authority agree to cooperate with the government of Israel in the creation and administration of the proposed Jenin Industrial Zone.<br />
<br />
Cont 4 Solvency<br />
Israel and Palestine have alraedy begun collaborating on an industrial park planned to be built in Jenin - the PA wants the ability to export goods produced there tax free to the US - the plan is the last remaining step. The industrial park would kickstart the PA's economy and greatly lessen violence in the region.<br />
