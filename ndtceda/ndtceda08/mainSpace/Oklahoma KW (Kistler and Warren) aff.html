 <br />
In the current state of our consumption patterns, so many things are interwoven together that we sometimes fail to understand their interconnectedness. The way we eat and the way we travel have an interconnected feature that may now move beyond the wars in the Persian Gulf and Afghanistan. Our dependency on fossil fuels is not something that can be satisfied through replacement, but is something that can only be addressed through a reduction in our personal and national consumption habits. We can sound like such moral actors in our demonization of the &quot;state' as we continue to drive our cars and consume our oil, while at the same time denouncing the war in the Middle East that is a governmental response to our consumption problem. As long as we continue to consume at the present rate, wars will be inevitable.<br />

&quot;Today the average Us citizen...but of humanity and most of the biosphere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our personal decisions of what we consume and how we consume have become non-critical choices, following the lead of government and industry, losing the knowledge and understanding of where are food comes from and how food, energy, and environmental problems are interconnected. Government utilizes its economic power to make us feel we can continue to persue the American Dream of affluence, comfort and mobility. The need to reduce our consumption will not be the message from government and industry. Government actions mask our need for individual change.<br />

&quot;But it work something...and to foster its renewal is our only legitimate hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the recent economic crisis, housing industry bail out and fluctuating gas prices, we have reached a moment in time where our consumption habits should be challenged as we begin to experience the finite nature of our economic transition away from our fossil fuel dependency, the more likely we use force to guarantee our energy addiction. The biofuel transition is the final leg of corporate control over food. Subsidization of biofuels is the bridge to maintain corporate control over good in a time of energy crisis, making us more dependent on energy and masking the need to reduce our consumption.<br />

&quot;The biofuel transition closes... transition to food and fuel sovereignty&quot;<br />
<br />
Power and profits are used for agricultural consolidation, and giving large companies the profits from our energy consumption will wipe out small farmers. Consolidating the power over food and energy to these corporations would be the worst possible world, giving corporate control over the absolute beginning of life.<br />
<br />
Cook, 04 (Diet for a dead planet. p. 6-7)<br />
&quot;How is it that providing humanity's...the absolute beginning of life&quot;<br />
<br />
PLAN: The United States Federal Government should eliminate all subsidies for palm oil biofuel, sugar biofuel, and corn ethanol biofuel<br />
<br />
We don't think we are the USFG, but we do feel that subsidies are a tool the USFG uses to perpetuate bad things in the world. We do not think eliminating subsidies will solve all problems in the world, but we do believe that the subsidies on biofuels serve as a mask to individuals addressing their personal consumption habits, and this use of subsidies is attempting to consolidate control of energy and good into the hands of large corporate power. We can find alternatives in growing our own garden and quit outsourcing our lives. We must quit thinking we can swap food for energy. We need both individual change and policy change. Eliminating subsidies on biofuels is a first step.<br />

What's wrong with environmentalism<br />
&quot;MP: I don't know exactly..that's a healthy way to look at it&quot;<br />
<br />
You need no specific theory of capitalism to understand that once corporations gain control over good, and people become totally dependent on others for good, you are locked into the world of capitalism. This is why an revolution that is needed today will be dependent on using food as the lynchpin to that rebellion. We are the starting point to bringing down &quot;the Whole Horse&quot;<br />
