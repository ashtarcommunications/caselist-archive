Emory HH – Neg vs. Oklahoma CJ, Round 5<br />
Judges: McCartney, Vega, Stevenson<br />
Amendments CP:<br />
1NC-<br />
Text: Congress should propose and three fourths of the states should ratify an amendment to the United States Constitution that declares that the undue burden standard is no longer good law because the state has no compelling interest in promoting potential life.<br />
Congress has to use an amendment to expressly contradict a Court decision to spur legislative deliberation over constitutionalism and challenge judicial supremacy<br />
Neal Devins, 01 – “Congress as culprit: how lawmakers spurred on the court’s anti-congress crusade,” 51 duke L.J. 435<br />
“There are other ways…Courts is likely to approve”<br />
Judicial supremacy is destroying democracy – only an explicit Congressional override of a Court decision can spur a movement for participatory democracy<br />
Robert Lipkin, 06 – 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 1055<br />
“Does any institution…that can be held accountable by it.”<br />
Checking the court is key to restrain statist violence<br />
Kenneth Dolberare, 87 – <em>the case against the constitution</em>, p. 138-40<br />
“Where have all the voters…important public policies”<br />
2NC-<br />
AT: Perm<br />
Involving the Court at all will redirect democratic debate towards legalistic languages that prevent true democracy and prevents the recognition that Congress should be a check on the Court.<br />
Robert Lipkin, 06 – 28 Cardozo L. Rev. 1055<br />
“Even when the court…back to its roots”<br />
The Constitutional fight is the only way to stop judicial supremacy in the long and short term<br />
Robin West, 94 – <em>Progressive Constitutionalism</em>, p. 220<br />
“Therefore, the concluding…conservative Court change paths”<br />
Only court resistance and Congress backlash stops the doctrine of supremacy<br />
Terri Peretti, 03 – 64 Ohio St. L. J. 349, “A Normative Appraisal of social Scientific Knowledge Regarding Judicial Independence”<br />
“Serious attacks on judicial…inherently political process”<br />
AT: Process Focus Bad<br />
Focusing on the process away from judicial supremacy is key to critique the state and prevent alternate perspectives. Withdrawing from the process means conservative interests take over which prevents changing material realities.<br />
Susan Burgess, 93 – “Beyond instrumental politics,” polity, v25 n3, Spring<br />
“If judicial supremacy…conservative values”<br />
The only impact is that it trades off with focus on the product – this is good because the process itself checks authoritarianism and is independently key to democracy<br />
Susan Burgess, 93 – “Beyond instrumental politics,” polity, v25 n3, Spring<br />
“The appeal of the abstract…transnational civil society”<br />
Court action necessitates process focus<br />
Christine Bateup, 06 – 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 1109, “The Dialogic Promise Assessing the Normative potential of Theories of Constitutional Dialogue”<br />
“Rather than telling…to have the final word”<br />
AT: Democratic Assimilation<br />
Don’t let the aff characterize the democratic participation spurred by the CP as a democracy as usual – it’s more radical than the status quo and invites participation by the people without assimilating their identities.<br />
Kate Sandilands, 93 – “Radical democracy: A contested/ing terrainm” sythesis/regeneration 5, winter, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.greena.org/s-r/05/05-13.html" rel="nofollow">__http://www.greena.org/s-r/05 /05-13.html__</a><br />
“First, radical democracy…particular is sacred”<br />
Judicial review is a worse kind of zero sum politics that mystifies the law.<br />
Susan Burgess, 93 – “Beyond instrumental politics,” polity, v25 n3, Spring<br />
“In the public law…programmed players”<br />
Case:<br />
Debates by NGO’s about future crises are critical to social movements – dystopian visions are mobilizing transnational movements that are effectively pressuring governments into preventing everything from nuclear annihilation to slowing the spread of AIDS&gt;<br />
Kurasawa, 04 – Constellations, v11 n4<br />
“In the twenty-first century…human rights violations”<br />
Decades of social activism have been motivated by futurism – this history overwhelms their non-empirical theory.<br />
Kurasawa, 04 – Constellations, v11 n4<br />
“societies emerging from the horrors…appear particularly glaring”<br />
Just because we cannot predict the future with total certainty does not mean that we cannot make educated guesses. And, scenario planning is key to making responsible choices.<br />
Kurasawa, 04 – Constellations, v11 n4<br />
“A radically postmodern line of thinking…on the global stage”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario planning is no longer the product of sterile government number crunching. Debates amongst citizens about future crises have created a global early warning network that has been proven relatively accurate and able to influence government action.<br />
Kurasawa, 04 – Constellations, v11 n4<br />
“Despite the fact that not all…shorter-term responses”<br />
They turn all politics into negativity. Self-fulfilling embrace of the real and unintelligibility is stupid – it makes reactionary politics appear wonderful.<br />
Benjamin Bateman, 06 – “The Future of Queer Theory,” Minnesota Review, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theminnesotareview.org/journal/ns6566/bateman_r_benjamin_ns6566_stf1.shtml" rel="nofollow">__http://www.theminnesotareview .org/journal/ns6566/bateman_r _benjamin_ns6566_stf1.shtml__</a><br />
“Since its inception…will no longer be listening”<br />
Aff reverses utopian fundamentalism – overidentification with culture of death ignores queer successes in changing parenthood and childhood through political interventions. The plan destroys the complex multiplicity of queer politics with the fascism of the culture of death.<br />
Antonis Balasopoulos, 06 – Journal of American Studies v40, Project Muse<br />
:”No Future is a work…politics in the present”<br />
Lesbian Motherhood K:<br />
1NC-<br />
The aff’s conception of queerness obscures the possibilities of the sinthomosexual. By rejecting reproduction, they obscure the entire experience of lesbian motherhood, preventing a paradigmatic shift out of reproductive futurism<br />
Andrea Fontenot, 06 – “Book Review: No Future,” MFS Modern Fiction Studies 52.1 (2006) 252-6, Project Muse<br />
“Edelman’s acceptance of the…within the field and beyond”<br />
Lesbian invisibility replicates heterosexist bias.<br />
Maxine Wove, 92 – “Invisible Women in Invisible Places,” Arch. &amp; Comport. / Arch. &amp; Behav.<br />
“This invisibility reflects and…peoplelenvironment relationships”<br />
Their version of queerness is the gay white male’s consumption of the female body – there is no place for women of the material body in their symbolic order – only the lived experience of men who can commodify women’s bodies with their newfound freedom<br />
Virginia Blum, 02 – “the Liberation of Intimacy,” Antipode v34<br />
“Irigaray asserts…from the memory altogether”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our alternative is embrace queer negativity without tying it to reproduction and to embrace reproductive futures for queers. Affirming the possibility of future queer identities and reproduction is a superior political strategy that avoids alienating queer populations.<br />
Benjamin Bateman, 06 – “The Future of Queer Theory,” Minnesota Review, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.theminnesotareview.org/journal/ns6566/bateman_r_benjamin_ns6566_stf1.shtml" rel="nofollow">__http://www.theminnesotareview .org/journal/ns6566/bateman_r _benjamin_ns6566_stf1.shtml__</a><br />
“Queer theorists more politically…queer-able in children”<br />
AT: Lesbian Motherhood links to futurism<br />
No link – lesbian motherhood isn’t based on futurism<br />
Mario Feit, 05 – “Extinction Anxieties: Same-sex marriage and modes of citizenship,” theory and event 8:3<br />
“To be clear…future gay generations”<br />
Recognition of the queer capacity to reproduce disrupts dominant narratives about queer marriage and prevents reproductive futurism<br />
Rollins, no date – “Defensive Marriage Acts: Rhetorical Strategies in the Debate about same-sex marriage”<br />
“Too often gays…citizens are allowed”<br />
AT: Queer/sex conflation bad<br />
We solve the impact – making lesbian motherhood visible disrupts the symbolic order<br />
Edelman – No Future, p. 26<br />
“In the preface…remains unnamable”<br />
Their author agrees its about sexuality<br />
Edelman – No Future, p. 22<br />
“The structural mandate…is a signifying change”<br />
Conflation is necessary in this instance to end lesbian invisibility – queerness is a symbol with which lesbian mothers can identify<br />
Jacqui Gabb, 01 – Sexualities Vol4(3): 333-52<br />
“The second half of this…family sexuality”<br />
Divorcing lesbian motherhood from sexuality leads to lesbian invisibility<br />
Jacqui Gabb, 01 – Sexualities Vol4(3): 333-52<br />
“however, by reducing…within this vacuum”<br />
Recognizing family sexuality in the context of lesbian motherhood solves the reason queers are excluded from the symbolic order<br />
Jacqui Gabb, 01 – Sexualities Vol4(3): 333-52<br />
“Thus far I have…equal rights”<br />
Ignoring lesbian motherhood and sexuality as queerness denies challenges to heteronormativity.<br />
Jacqui Gabb, 01 – Sexualities Vol4(3): 333-52<br />
“Queer might appear…everyday lives”<br />
