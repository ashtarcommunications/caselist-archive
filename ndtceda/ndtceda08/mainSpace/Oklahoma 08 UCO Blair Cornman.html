ESU<br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We affirm the absent referent in the topic</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The term CAFO is used to mask the realities of those who are victims to this industrial act. This is not a debate about reducing subsidies, but rather a pre-requisite to any debate that would be about subsidies. Absent and understanding of the absent referent, domination and oppression will continue. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Adams in 91 (Carol. The Sexual Politics of Meat pp. 40-42, Through butchering, animals become absent referents……referent its own existence)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Humans are not the only ones who suffer from a denial of subjectivity, The term CAFO is misleading, denies the absent referent within the topic by ignoring the subjectivity of experience as held by the animals in these factory farms.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Stammer 06 (Michael, “Modern Orwellian Doublespeak, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.morris.umn.edu/register/article.php?volume=18&amp;issue=24&amp;section=variety&amp;index=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.morris.umn.edu/register/article.php?volume=18&amp;issue=24&amp;section=variety&amp;index=4</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">, The doublespeak I will…..agenda of suffering)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">This disconnected relationship manifests itself in the factory farm. A nightmarish glimpse of what capitalism is capable of in the absence of any moral regulation.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Pollan, 6 (Michael, Professor of Journalism at UC Berkeley, The Ominvore’s Dilemma, P. 318, A tension has always…….suffering gene was found)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Policy debates will continue to ignore the absent reference as they use policy language to justify the continuation of the pain and suffering inflicted upon the victims of the animals in the slaughterhouses. An affirmation of the absent referent is needed to include the subject beings of the slaughterhouse victims within policy debates. Understanding the absent reference is a gateway to understand the interrelatedness of oppression. There is an absent referent in the discussion of the domination of nature that is the domination of women.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Adams in 91 same book pp 42-44….this chapter posits….supposedly animal condition</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Short term logic of economic progress is used to justify government support of slaughterhouses, masking the reality of devastation that factory farms bring to animals, or the environment, including society.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Herry 03 (Wendell, Scholar and Farmer, Citizenship Papers pg. 127-128, The principle of confinement………”creates jobs” is good.)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">The connection between production and consumption has been obfuscated by a patriarchal binary that disembodies the experience of slaughterhouse animals from the end product of their flesh as meat. This application of the absent referent to justify violence is then extended to all subjectivities involved in the production process that threaten the calculability of the end product. Understanding the absent referent in the topic is key to link maintenance with production.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Adams in 91 (Carol, “Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals” Ecological Feminist Philosophies pp. 118-120 The relationship between…..neither measured or valued)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Eating is a political act and determines how we treat the world. Pollan in 6, same book, p. 10-11 Another theme, or premise really……deepened by knowing.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">We must repudiate the idea that humans and animals exist outside the food chain, this deconstructs human/nature dualisms and creates the ethical basis for opposing factory farms or face a continuation of the instrumentalization of life. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">Plumwood in 2k3 (val, Australian research council Fellow at the Aunstrailian National University, eprints working paper no. 26, Animals and ecology: towards a better integration, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://dspace.anu.edu.au/bitsteream/1885/41767/2/Vegpap6%20%20.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://dspace.anu.edu.au/bitsteream/1885/41767/2/Vegpap6%20%20.pdf</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman">) Human/nature dualism……..sensitive beings for food.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman">This will to instrumentalize reduces all of nature to a stable and always predictable standing reserves. All beings are rendered objects in a steadfast refusal of the revelations of Being, ensuring war and ecocide. </span><br />

</span>We read from Rosset – WTO Out of Agriculture 2006<br />
Then read this statement, then more from the book…………<br />
<br />
Our position in this debate is that we need to re-orient the debate about agriculture.<br />
<br />
Now is the time to say enough is enough, too many peasant farmers are suffering while a minority group of people reap the benefits of the current agricultural policies.<br />
<br />
We stand in solidarity with La Via Campesina, with the farmers across the globe, that we need to change the framework by which current agricultural policies.<br />
<br />
A criticism of subsidies in the northern countries, and specifically the US, is needed because these subsidies help exporting of crops occur below the global market prices. When this happens, millions and millions of farmers across the globe go hungry or commit suicide in the face of the impossibility of competition within that global marketplace.<br />
<br />
Many of these farmers did not choose to lose their basic pillars of life, or becoming dependent on the marketplace. It is part of the larger global agribusinesses attempt to enclose our global commons, working side by side with the World Bank and the IMF to open up communal lands to private property ownership, locking many peasant farmers into the basic contours of capitalism. The goal of these conglomerates is not to feed the world, but control the food for the world.<br />
<br />
Policies that benefit a minority amount of the population on the planet are being used to oppress the majority. Many more are suffering from US subsidies than those that are benefiting.<br />
<br />
There are two reasons subsidies in the north need to be re-oriented towards an ideology of food sovereignty rather than one of trade.<br />
<br />
The first reason is that some of these subsidies intensify and encourage dumping.<br />
<br />
This dumping is the key problem for the global peasant farmers, destroying lively-hoods and cultures.<br />
<br />
The second reason is that this is stigmatizing subsidies that will encourage the elimination of subsidies in multilateral agreements. This would be devastating to the millions of peasant farmers across the globe, and open our world up to having all food controlled by multinational conglomerates such as Cargill and Monsanto.<br />
<br />
These problems are not just local, they are global, and that is why need to build coalitions that can cross borders and cultural barriers. The alternative is only found in such an effort.<br />
