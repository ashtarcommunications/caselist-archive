T - Must be unconditional<br />
Violation: The plan involves a QPQ - This is conditional engagement towards Iran<br />
Daniela Manca, 2003 [“Iran: A test case for EU non-proliferation policy”]<br />
“EU conditional engagement: the ‘soft-cop’ approach... economic relations can be achieved only if progress is reached in the four areas of concern”<br />
<br />
Critique<br />
The Affirmative practice and discourse constructs towards the middle east is a performance of racial power, even though the plan reduces pressure, the aff’s approach legitimizes colonialism and ensures constant intervention.<br />
Morten Valbjorn, 2004 Middle East and Palestine: Global Politics and Regional Conflict, “Culture blind and culture blinded: Images of Middle Eastern Conflicts in International Relations,” 63-4<br />
“From this perspective, it is irrelevant to discuss whether the Middle East should be regarded as a region like all the others.. the world possible, necessary, ad for the benefit of the people of the Middle East themselves.<br />
<br />
These wars are not self evident - the 1AC practice and advantage claims are intimately connected to a racialized, colonial frame - this perspective ensures genocidal annihilation.<br />
Batur, 2007, “The Heart of Violence: Global Racism, War and Genocide,” in Handbook of the Sociology of Racial and Ethnic Relations, eds. Vera and Feagin, pp446-7<br />
“At the turn of the 20th century, the “Terrible Turk” was the image that summarized the enemy of Europe...racist visions such as his actually prove the validity of this position... serve the global racist ideology with dizzying frequency”<br />
<br />
Alternative: Don’t adopt the affirmative’s representations. You should refuse to occupy the position of the imperial problem-solve - criticize the 1AC’s constituting of the world according to orientalist hierarchy.<br />
Pinar Bilgin, 2004, Third World Quarterly, “Is the Orientalist Past the Future of Middle East Studies?” p425-6<br />
“To go back to Little’s argument about American Orientalism, the contrast between...Said’s Orientalism sought to shed light upon.”<br />
<br />
CP<br />
Text: The United States federal government should propose to the government of Iran a guarantee that the United States federal government will not initiate or support the initiation of kinetic military force against the government of Iran if the government of Iran commits to a credible, viable, and verifiable non-proliferation pledge and if the government of Iran agrees to submit to the monitoring and reporting measures of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and it’s optional protocols concerning gender discrimination.<br />
<br />
The CP competes - it severs the plan’s guarantee that the USFG will offer Iran a security guarantee if Iran, only, stops proliferating.<br />
<br />
Monitoring is effective - states wil be required to submit reports<br />
Maryam Javaherian, 2000, [40 Santa Clara L. Rev. 819, “Womens Human Rights in Iran: What can the International Human Rights System Do?,” l/n]<br />
“The Convenants also establish monitoring and reporting... Social and CUltural Rights to monitor the implementation of the ICESCR.”<br />
