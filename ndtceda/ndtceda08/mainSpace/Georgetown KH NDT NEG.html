<strong><em>Judge: Hall, Kirk, Topp</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Case Args:</em></strong><br />
1. Plan won't be enforced b/c it's an offer - Webster '03<br />
2. Egypt scenario empirically denied, Mubarak has been cracking down since '07<br />
3. Hamas presence in Gaza kills any possible deal – Levitt 08 (Matthew, “Hamas in the Spotlight,” 2/27. “But the news has not…these three developments.”)<br />
4. No peace deal - divisions on key issues – Ross ’07 (Dennis, New Republic Online, 11/27. “Annapolis, Analyzed.” “That however, will not…Arab part of Jerusalem?”)<br />

<strong><em>Off Case Args:</em></strong><br />
<u>T - CE = unconditional</u><br />
<u>ASPEC</u><br />
<u>Zizek K</u><br />
<ol><ol><li>Our society lurches forward from crisis to crisis: nuclear, ecological, etc., each time implicitly believing that each crisis is a historically specific situation that requires some minor corrective course of action. This perspective misidentifies the Real as a historically specific situation rather than a feature inherent in the social edifice itself. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, sptability and resolution is a threadt of disorder and chaos. Catastrophe always hovers, such is the nature of our being. Zizek 04 (Conversations with Zizek Slovoj Zizek and Glyn Daly, pg 78-79) “Here I would…self blockade.”</li><li>In order to protect ourselves psychollcally we have all acquiesced to the spell of ideology. Ideology works by constructing a fantasy fo reality in which it is possible to overcome the inevidable crises generated by the Real. We wait anxiously until catastrophe confronts us as “on the brink”, and then we take some corrective measure thereby deferring our reconciliation with catastrophe. This process on constant deferral prevents us from fever fundamentally reordering the world and instead moves us towards a n NOW which selectively constitutes groups of people to eliminate as barriers and risks rather than recongnizing the intrinsically risky nature of the entire symbolic venture. Zizek 04 (Conversations with Zizek Slovoj Zizek and Glyn Daly, pg 12-13) “The central issue…in today’s realpolitik.”</li><li>Vote negative to render the catastrophe of the aff unavoidable: we can learn that the true catastrophe of the status quo is that it comdems us to a life lead under the shadow of the permanent threat of catastrophe. The act of projecting ourselfes into the world of the neg, a post apocalyptic woruld in which we have finally confronted catastrophe dead on, retroactively enables us to think differently about the present. Vote neg as a way to reconfigure the politics of the present by breaking out of the spell of ideology. Zizek 03 (The Puppet and the Dwarf, pp 159-166) “This perhaps…meant its exact opposite.”</li></ol></ol><u>CP</u> – PIC out of the word “the”<br />
Net benefit: “The” is bad – fixes identity, inscriptions of state- makes all wars inevitable.<br />
<u>CP</u> – do the plan after Congress passes the India deal<br />
<u>India Deal:</u> <br />
<ol><ol><li>India deal will pass - just enough room for it on the agenda now - Reuters '08</li><li>Fiat requires delay – Flight ‘99</li><li>Next president won’t pass the India deal – IHT 08</li><li>Not treating India like a nuclear pariah is key to US-Indian relations</li><li>Relations key to the economy – Gobarah</li><li>US economy is key to world economy – Business Week ‘01</li><li>Extinction – Bearden 2K</li></ol></ol><br />

Round # 1<br />
<br />
Vs Team: Los Rios LM<br />
<br />
Judge: Harris. Strange. Chopra<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
<br />
No brightline between priveledged and underprivileged<br />
<br />
Debate about personal beliefs addressed issues that cannot be resolved trhough consensus-building discourse- this destroys the productive potential of their advocacy<br />
<br />
Edwin Bryan Portis. Professor Polisci at texas a and m, 2000 political theory and partisan politics page 2<br />
<br />
Forcing transendence of personal belierfs nurtures democratic deliberation – ther alternative is unending social conflict<br />
<br />
Thomas a. spragens professor of polisci at duke 2000, political theory and partisan politics page 90<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
Vaguness- the aff doesn’t specify a specific plan of action for overcoming socioeconomic inequality<br />
<br />
That’s a voter for gounrd because the neg cant imapt turn discrimination and there is no way to negate an actual policy for implementation<br />
<br />
Framework –<br />
<br />
USFG is actor of resolution, not individual debaters<br />
<br />
Resolved is intent to implement the plan<br />
<br />
Should denotes expectation of enacting<br />
<br />
USFG is government in Washington DC<br />
<br />
Violation- the affirmative affirm the topic as opposing socioeconomic oppression which has nothing to do with the resolution<br />
<br />
Reasons to prefer<br />
<br />
Ground- the aff will always win that the principles of their advocady are good in the abstract- we can only debate the merits of their framework if they defend the specific consequences of political imp[lementation<br />
<br />
Michael ingnatieff, carr professor of human rights at Harvard, 4 [lesser evils page 20-21]<br />
<br />
Without predicable ground debate becomes meaningless and produces political strategy that is wedded to violence and fails to achieve productive chanse<br />
<br />
Ruth lessl shively, assoc prof polisci at texas a and m 2000 political theory and partisan politics<br />
<br />
Topical education- by manipulating the topic to access their political project thye skirt debate about the implementation of policies by the government. Their education is distrusting of institutional study and pragmatic reform. Even if their intentions are nobe, their message results in fascist totalitarianism<br />
<br />
Martin lewis assistant professor at george Washington 1992 [green delusions page 258]<br />
<br />
This argument is an independent reason to vote negative<br />
<br />
Ruth lessl shively, assoc prof polisci at texas a and m 2000 political theory and partisan politics page 186<br />
<br />
This argument provides an aprioi reason to vote negative you must use your ballot to ratify constraints on discourse to preserve a politically enabling discussion<br />
<br />
Ruth lessl shively, assoc prof polisci at texas a and m 2000 political theory and partisan politics page 179<br />
<br />
Limits- there are limitless contextsor avenues trhough which they could puporrt to advocate the plan. Our interpretation liits debates to promote politically relevant dialogue and structured communication<br />
