<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Text: The United States Federal Government should announce that it will prevent the re-authorization of upland cotton payments over 17% of the current allocation beginning in 2010. This cap should reduce export credit guarantees, user marketing payments, and marketing assistance loans. This cap should eliminate counter-cyclical payments, loan deficiency payments, and direct payment.  </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Competes – </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Textually and functionally less – “eliminating” an object must cease activities that have already begun. Prevention is a distinct mechanism that blocks a future action. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Not topical – “eliminating” is a present participle, requiring immediacy.  </span><br />

Obama Afghanistan strategy has the necessary political support<br />
Ibbitson 3/28/09 Globe and Mail LEXIS<br />
The war in Afghanistan is now Barack Obama’s war …. Obama will not have to wage his war at home as well as abroad<br />
Cutting ethanol subsidies kills capital<br />
Political capital is key to overcoming calls for a minimalist approach in Afghanistan that will undermine US stabilization efforts and exacerbate regional insurgency<br />

As the administration finalizes its policy review … he is confident that we can prevail.<br />

<strong>Variable Subsidy CP</strong><br />
The United States Federal Government should make the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tex Credit for starch-based ethanol and the Volumetric Biodiesil Excise Tax Credit for exported soy-based biodiesel variable based on change in the price of crude oil. The no-cost base-line should be set at $40/barrel and increase by 2.5 cents per gallon for each $1 decrease in the price of oil. The United States Federal Government should repeal the Renewable Fuel Standard’s mandates for starch-based ethanol.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This creates an effective variable subsidy<br />
Tyner 7 “Biofuels, Energy Security, and Global warming policy interactions”<br />
We have with biofuels two kinds of market … compared with $4.72/bu under the current policy.<br />
Solves whole case – zero subsidies will be paid out – but variability provides a symbolic safety net to reassure producers.<br />

When would we have zero subsidies? … variable subsidy to the other products</span><br />

OPEC backstopping and flood of oil will inevitable crush the renewable transition – only a variable ethanol subsidy can check this – solving terrorism and poverty.<br />

Text: Through all necessary means, the United States Federal Government should reduce to the point of elimination nearly all its domestic subsidies for biofuels. The United States Federal Government should exempt corn-based ethanol from requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard and expand the Renewable Fuel Standard's definition of “reneable biomass” to include thinning materials and woody residues from federal lands.<br />
