<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">They disclosively look at nature: their authors study it and figure out its causes, they tinker with agriculture to produce desirable outcomes.<br />
<strong>Rojcewicz 6</strong> [Richard, The gods and technology: a reading of heideggar<br />
This is a clear and vigorous…of modern technology<br />
Link—portrayals of environmental harm cause by ag are justifications for management<br />
McWhorter 92 (Heidegger and the Earth, 43)<br />
The picture of the sea…and natural discomforts<br />
Impact-managerial approach extinguishes all other modes of thought<br />
McWhorter 92 (Heidegger and the Earth, 6)<br />
The danger of…may never dream<br />
Nature is dead, replaced by humanity’s artificial simulation of the environment which serves to convert wildlife into standing reserves of natural resources. This culminates in a global grid of mandatory efficiency<br />
Luke 97 [“The (un)wise (ab)use of nature: Environmentalism as global consumerism?” March 18<br />
All of these environmentalizing…the system of purchases.<br />
The environment is chaotic—the Cartesian attempts to understand and predict create a clockwork view of the world causing exploitation<br />
Kwiatkowaska 1 [Teresa, “Beyond Uncertainties: some open questions about chaos and ethics”<br />
Lately, a new language…the preceding stages<br />
Alternative: We should see nature as chaotic and unpredictable </span><br />

Theory – Aff must be grounded in resolution<br />
1. Predictability – run any aff as long as it affirms<br />
2. Debate is a game<br />
3. Clash<br />
Policy debate is good<br />
Even in a world without truth we should still make “should” statements</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Neoliberalism K<br />
The affirmative has fallen into the usual leftist trap – the 1AC is a strike against the power, the state, and our current understanding of politics. This ivory tower masturbation is a tool utilized against us by those who seek domination.<br />
Monbiot 07 (George, “how the neoliberals stitched up the wealth of nations for themselves”, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/aug/28/comment.businesscomment" rel="nofollow">__http://www.guardian.co.uk/ commentisfree/2007/aug/28/ comment.businesscomment__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">)<br />
Theory detached from politics is the enemy – wasting such gifts as a space for discussion and educational growth in the name of fake words created by elitist academics. This apathy has caused history's worst atrocities<br />
Simon 95 (Jon, the Exile of Political Theory: the Lost Homeland of legitimation Politid Sfudies (I 995) , XLIII, 683-687)<br />
And here is one of the greatest impact cards ever utilized in its context<br />
Santos 03 (Boaventura des Souza, “Collective Suicide?”, Bad Subjects, Issue#63)<br />
Every setting is key we students and educators have a unique role to play in defeating neoliberalism – the university is a unique cite of reistance<br />
Giroux 06 (Henry, “Dirty Democracy and State Terrorism: the politics of the New Authoritarianism in the United States”, Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 26.2 2006)<br />
Only through orienting ourselves against economic policies can we mobilize to tear down neoliberalism<br />
Rhoads and torres 2006 (Robert A. Rhoads and Carlos Alberto Torres; “The University, State, and Market: the political Economy of Globalization in the Americas.” Stanford University Press 2006 pp 5-7)<br />
ALT: We should see debate a site for resistance to neoliberalism<br />
Negation K<br />
The affirmative strive for a world that is not this world: they fall into the usual metaphysical trap, craving the better world results in the hatred of this world, only be embracing life “such as it is” rather than “as it should be” is the only way to come to terms with this<br />
Turanli 2003 (Ayden, “Nietzsche and the Later Wittgenstein: An Offense to the Quest for Another World,” The journal of Nietzsche studies 26 (2003), 61-62)<br />
Architecture analogy... building and destruction.<br />
Dienstag 2004 (Joshua Foa, “Tragedy, Pessimism, Nietzsche.” New Literary History 35.1 (2004) 83-101 [muse])<br />
Alt: Vote for the Negative<br />
Negating things is necessary for the love of life: though we say no to all affirmations, this is the only way for us to radically embrace the world as it is<br />
Nietzsche 1888 (Friedrich, Ecce Homo, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/" rel="nofollow">__http://www.geocities.com/ thenietzschechannel/__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">)</span><br />

They are ideology in disguise – only accepting encounters is moralism in disguise to their own aff because they want to purify reality.<br />
