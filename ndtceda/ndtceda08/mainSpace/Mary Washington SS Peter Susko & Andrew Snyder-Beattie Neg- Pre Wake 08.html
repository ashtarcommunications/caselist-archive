<strong>Mary Washington SS Neg  Round #  1</strong><br />
    Vs Team: Emory MS- Critical CAFOs    <br />
    Judge: Watson, Hays<br />
<br />
    Case Args:<br />
<br />
Turn – China<br />
A. Chicken farmers will go to China – this causes bird flu transmission because of worse conditions<br />
Engdahl 2005. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=ENG20051127&amp;articleID=1333" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=ENG20051127&amp;articleID=1333</a><br />
“China is also the dream…got infected easier”<br />
B. This results in extinction for extinction from disease<br />
Greger 2006. http:?/www.birdflubook.com/a.php?id=31<br />
“A pandemic today…worldwide pandemic catastrophe”<br />
<br />
Util :<br />
Ethical policymaking must be grounded in consequences<br />
Issac 2002. “Ends, Means, and Politics,” Dissent Magazine<br />
“Power is not a dirty word…and it undermines political effectivness”<br />
<br />
Ethics must be based contextually – infinite responsibility leads to injustice and incoherence<br />
Balkin ’94. “Transcendental Deconstruction, Transcendent Justice,” 92 Mitch. L. Rev. 1131<br />
“Thus, perhaps, unsurprisingly…while not infinite, is nevertheless indefinite”<br />
<br />
Predictions, like the disad, are essential to inform policy discourse and determine the context for the morality of the aff<br />
Mearsheimer ’01. The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, p. 7-8<br />
“Despite these hazards…hazards of trying to predict events”<br />
<br />
Nuclear War is an a priori concern. Their moral imperatives are self-contradictory in the face of global annihilation<br />
Bok ’88. Applied Ethics and Ethical Theory, Rosenthal and Shehadi, eds.<br />
“Everything changes when it is the world’s…Kant’s moral theory”<br />
<br />
Case stuff about fishing?<br />
<br />
<br />
    Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
T – Substantial<br />
A. Even the broadest definition of substantially reducing agricultural support is 50%<br />
Zaidi 2007. “Resurrecting the Dead”<br />
“Take reforms in agriculture…cuts of 54 percent”<br />
<br />
This requires a $23 billion dollar reduction<br />
Tupy 2005<br />
“In 2004, for example, agricultural…Canada’s and Switzerland’s to $6 billion each”<br />
<br />
B. Violation – the plan isn’t a substantial reduction of agricultural support<br />
<br />
C. Reasons to vote neg – <br />
    1. Precision – the neg should only be prepared to debate across-the-board cuts because that’s the only reasonable, predictable interpretation of the resolution – any other interpretation moots the word “substantial” and is significantly less precise.<br />
    2. Ground – the best and most relevant literature on farm subsidies assumes across the board cuts because that’s what is debated and considered in international trade talks – the best links to core neg positions like the economy, food prices, and food supply disads assume across-the board cuts<br />
    `3. Education – our interpretation is key to learn about more mechanisms for changing ag policy – it’s the only way to debate the merits of across the board cuts vs. individual cuts because an ABC counterplan wouldn’t compete against the plan AND it’s the only way to learn elements of agricultural support other than domestic subsidies.<br />
<br />
D. T is a voting issue for fairness and jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
Restaurant DA:<br />

Uniqueness <br />
A. Economy stable now-consumer, profits, sticks, credit markets, and inter-bank lending are all recovering<br />

B. 1. CAFOs are key to restaurants<br />
Grand Rapid Press 2005. “Public Pulse”<br />
“Our mission is to educate…has more than 200 of them”<br />
<br />
2. Restaurant industry is key to the economy – there’s a massive spillover effect<br />
Grindy ’97. online at “The Restaurant Industry – An Engine of Economic Growth”<br />
“A popular misconception…eating-and-drinking places see a downturn”<br />
<br />
C. This collapses global economy<br />
Sester 2007 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/14781/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfr.org/publication/14781/</a><br />

“As tensions rise in South…functioning economy”<br />
<br />
2. Impact is international nuclear terrorism<br />
Investors Business Daily 2008. “Let Colombia Win”<br />
“Some city in the world…give victory a chance”<br />
<br />
3. This the only scenario for Anti-American nuclear terror<br />
Miranda &amp; Shulman. 2004. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/23/edshulman_ed3_.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/23/edshulman_ed3_.php</a><br />
