OBSERVATION ONE: THE STATUS QUO<br />
CAFOS REPRESENT MORE THAN 50% OF FOOD ANIMALS<br />

<br />
AND, DESPITE THE FACT THAT TEN BILLION ANIMALS WILL BE BRED TO BE KILLED AND ONE MILLION WILL BE SLAUGHTERED EVERY HOUR IN THE UNITED STATES – FEAR OF COMPETITION AND POLITICS ARE BLOCKING ANY INITAITIVES TO PROTECT ANIMAL WELFARE<br />

BILLIONS OF ANIMALS IN FACTORY FARMS ARE LEFT IN A STATE OF BARE LIFE-THEIR LIVES ARE MAINTAINED ON THE EDGE OF DEATH, SEEN AS MEANS TO AN END OF PROFIT. THIS IS PART AND PARCEL OF SOVEREIGN POWER’S ABILITY TO CREATE EXCEPTIONAL STATES OF SUFFERING IN BOTH THE HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN WORLD. THIS IS INTEGRAL TO A BIOPOLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON RADICAL VIOLENCE AND EXCLUSION<br />

<br />
THE BIOPOLITICAL IMPERATIVE FINDS ITS CULMINATION IN ELIMINATION – BIOPOLITICS MAKES NECESSARY THE ELIMINATION OF ALL THOSE OUTSIDE THE BODY POLITIC IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE UTOPIA – THIS IS NOT SIMPLY AN ABERRATION OF THE 20TH CENTRY – INDEED IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE OPERATION OF GOVERNANCE IN THE 21ST CENTURY<br />

<br />
THIS VIOLENCE OF SOVEREIGN POWER LIES PURELY IN ITS ABILITY TO RELEGATE HUMANS TO BARE LIFE-HUMAN LIFE COMES TO BE TREATED LIKE NON-HUMAN LIFE. THIS MAKES THE QUESTION OF ANIMAL ETHICS IMPERATIVE-THE FATE OF ANIMALS IS INEVITABLY ALSO THE FATE OF HUMANS WITHIN SPACES OF EXCEPTION. ONLY BY CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN THE HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN CAN BIOPOLITICAL POWER RELATIONS BE CHALLENGED<br />

THE EXPLOITATION OF ANIMALS WAS THE FOUNDATIONAL FRAMEWORK THAT SPAWNED RACISM, SEXISM, COLONIALISM, GENOCIDE, AND STRUCTURAL OPPRESSION. IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT EVERY SUBJUGATED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FIRST CHARACTERIZED AS ANIMALS.<br />

PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE NEARLY ALL DOMESTIC SUBSIDIES THAT SUPPORT CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS<br />
<br />
OBSERVATION THREE: SOLVENCY<br />
CAFOS ARE NOT PREDOMINANT BECAUSE THEY KEEP PRICES LOWER – THEYARE A DIRECT RESULT OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT US SUBSIDIES<br />

GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF CAFOS<br />

OUR AFFIRMATIVE PROVIDES A WAY TO RETHINK THE WAY THAT TERRITORY, GOVERNANCE, AND THE ECONOMY ARE IMAGINED IN CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL THOUGHT – TO REACH BEYOND THE STATUS QUO DIVISION BETWEEN HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN AND EMBRACE AN INTERTWINING OF THE TWO – THIS ALLOWS US TO ESTABLISH A NEW FORM OF BIOPOLITICS THAT REVEALS STRUGGLES BETWEEN FORMS OF LIFE<br />

THIS MAKES ECOLOGICAL ANIMALISM THE BEST ALTERNATIVE – IT SHOULD BE PREFERRED TO OUTRIGHT VEGITARIAN ETHICS – IT SITUATES ANIMALS AND HUMANS IN A CODEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP – ACKNOWLEDGES DIFFERENT ECOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXTS – AND SOLVES FOR FACTORY FARMS AND ANIMAL RIGHTS<br />

<br />
ECOLOGICAL ANIMALISM SOLVES THE PROBLEM WITH HUMAN MASTERY OVER NATURE – ALL ANIMALS ARE PERCEIVED AS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL, AND CODEPENDENT ON ECOLOGICAL FACTORS – THIS CREATES THE ETHICICAL BASISIS FOR OPPOSING FACTORY FARMS<br />

OUR ETHIC AGAINST SPECIESISM IS THE BASIS FOR CREATING A SYSTEM THAT REJECTS ALL FORMS OF EXPLOITATION. INDIVIDUAL ENDORSEMENT IS KEY.<br />
