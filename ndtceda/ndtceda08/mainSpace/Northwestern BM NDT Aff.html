 The United States Federal Government should substantially increase judicial reform assistance to the government of Afghanistan if the government of Afghanistan closes the amnesty loophole and implements transitional justice processes.<br />
<br />

 Cont 1-politics of impunity<br />
US and afghan politics of nation building have allowed the demand for justice be eclipsed by short-term security concerns. The amnesty provision in the war crimes bill exempts warlords from national reconciliation-closing the loophole is critical to genuine accountability-there can be no peace without justice<br />
J Alexander Their and Scott Worden 3-13-07 CSM “Path to peace and justice in Afghanistan: healing the wounds of the civil war requires both reconciliation and accountability”<br />
“Like every country facing the aftermanth…for reconciliation and peace.”<br />
<br />
The Bonn Conference represents a failure to meaningfully integrate human rights concerns – it is utterly silent on accountability for war crimes – an explicit mandate to confront the aggression of the past is necessary to confront the intertia of a justice-less and short-term peace<br />
AIHRC Report 05 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.aihrc.org.af/Rep_29_1_05ca4justice.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aihrc.org.af/Rep_29_1_05ca4justice.pdf</a><br />
“However, any attempts at building mechanisms…for its citizens.”<br />
<br />
This model of political expediency makes global sacrifice and forfeiture of global justice inevitable – vision of genuine accountability’s prerequisite to sustainable peace<br />
Cherif Bassiouni 2k3 35 Case W. Res. J. Intl’l L. 191<br />
“At the end of the Second World War…enduring human values.”<br />
<br />
Institutionalizing space for human rights discourse in Afghanistan is critical to contest a world where nuclear war and dehumanization are a certainty<br />
Marcus Raskin 99, 9 Transnatl’l L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 513<br />
“Like law itself, international law…not merely to a particular group.”<br />
<br />
Cont 2-Addressing the past<br />
Fear of being too political has hampered efforts to confront complicity in the face of gross human rights abuses. Aid is always implicitly conditional – the plan’s explicit condition creates a coherent stance against impunity<br />
James K Boyce “Aid, Conditionality and war economies” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.umass.edu/economics/publications/2004-05.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.umass.edu/economics/publications/2004-05.pdf</a><br />
“The absence of conditionality…about a more peaceful world.”<br />
<br />
Afghanistan part of global struggle for universal rights<br />
Terry Glavin 1-21-08 “Canada’s future role in Afghanistan: independent panel (manley) report imminent<br />
“We recognize the conflict in Afghanistan…not retreat from that struggle.”<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is the test of our ability to be committed to just principles or political expediency-a stability versus principle based application of justice in Afghanistan undermines international law<br />
Colm Campbell and Fionnuala Aolain, April 2003, 26 Fordham Intl LJ 871<br />
“In the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities…local and global levels.”<br />
<br />
Afghanistan is the test case for long term peace building and human rights promotion<br />
Hilde Frafjord Johnson 2002 Carnegie Council “Afghanistan: the challenges of post-conflict assistance”<br />
“The disaster in Rwanda taught us a great deal…right this time.”<br />
<br />
Karzai must recommit to pledges and the US must give support to reenergize national dialogue over justice<br />
IRIN News 11-21-07 “Afghanistan: revitalize transitional justice system – UN Human rights commissioner” UN Human Rights Organization<br />
“The government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai…transitional justice,” she said.”<br />
<br />
Combination of pressure and aid is critical<br />
Afghanistan Justice Project “Amnesty would jeopardize national reconciliation and security”<br />
“The Afghanistan Justice Project today…victims and perpetrators.”<br />
<br />
Judicial reform assistance is key to transitional justice<br />
ICG Report 03 “Afghanistan: Judicial reform and transitional justice” no 45<br />
“There are as yet no institutions…commission of inquiry.”<br />
<br />
The plan’s condition allows Afghanistan to turn the tables on the US and reinvigorate calls for accountability on the US and Afghanistan<br />
Jonathan Goodhand and Mark Sedra August 06 “Bargains for Peace? Aid, Conditionalities and Reconstruction in Afghanistan” p. 99<br />
“Conditionalities are not a call…maek demands on the state.”<br />
<br />
US driven conditioning is key to empower moderates and prevents the US from thwarting ethical progress in human rights<br />
Goodhand and Sedra<br />
“The failure to make any significant…and transitional justice” CONTINUES “This takes us back…and human rights.”<br />
<br />
Plan<br />
<br />
Plan solves the crisis of confidence in the short-term—vetting mobilizes civil society<br />
AIHRC Report<br />
“The results of the consultations indicate…of security sector reform.”<br />
<br />
The role fo the ballot is to reject the short term security imperatives that subordinate justice to realpolitik—use your ballot to imagine the transformation of global politics through the institutionalization of justice<br />
Bassiouni<br />
“It is my hope that in the age of globalization…repeat our mistakes.”<br />

 The cp posits non threatening women as good and rawa as bad revolutionary outsiders- this justifies preemptive military aggression and the worst forms of divisiveness<br />
Cornell 04 <u>the philosophical challenge of September 11</u> “the new political infamy and the sacrilege of feminism”<br />
Mourning is a political and ethical… others normal and abnormal.<br />
RAWA contextualizes the process of veiling and creates transnational, cross gender activism- avoids spivak;s concern about paternalism<br />
Ayotte and Husain 2005 NWSA Journal 17.3 “neocolonialism, epistemic violence, and the rhetoric of the veil’<br />
The expansion of security…praxis becomes security.<br />
This is the logic of enduring American freedom- it ignores thousands of afghan women have demanded rights<br />
Zillah Einstein ‘feminism in the aftermath of September 11’ 2002<br />
Women in the aftermath…and political transition?<br />
Most of the left think the war in Afghanistan is necessary and legitimate-the plan is critical to expose the ideological underpinnings of the invasion<br />

The cp is not solidarity- support of rawa accesses a critique of both fundamentalism and the west-they are the only channel for proving they come from one and the same source<br />
