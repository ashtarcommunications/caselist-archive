Observation One: Family Planning<br />
President Bush cut AID for the UNFPA and then reneged on his promise to fund family planning services in Afghanistan.<br />
Cohen, Guttmacher Institute, 03<br />
&lt;Susan A., “Bush Administration Isolates U.S. at International Meeting to Promote Cairo Agenda”The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy, March 2003, Volume 6, Number 1 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/06/1/gr060103.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/06/1/gr060103.html</a>&gt;<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement is critical to ensure the stability of family planning<br />

<br />
The plan also sends a global signal that will cause abortion laws to be liberalized across the globe.<br />
Ernst et al, lawyers with the Center for Reproductive Rights, 04<br />
(Julia L., Laura Katzive, Erica Smack, “The Legacy of Roe: The Constitution, Reproductive rights, and feminism: the global pattern of U.S. intiatives curtailing women’s reproductive rights: a perspective on the increasingly anti-choice mosaic,” 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 752 Lexis&gt;<br />

This decreases population growth by 10%<br />
Levine and Staiger, Wellesley College Economics professor and Dartmouth College economics professor, 04<br />
&lt;Phillip and Douglas, Abortion Policy and Fertility Outcomes: The Eastern European Experience, The Journal of Law &amp; Economics, April, L/N&gt;<br />
<br />
Thus the plan: The United States Agency for International Development should provide the government of Afghanistan funding for family planning and enter a constructive dialogue to encourage them to treat reproductive choice as an essential right.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Being Born is Bad<br />
Being born is always bad: The benefits of life will never outweigh the pain because the absence of pain is good even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone whereas the absence of pleasure is only bad if a subject is deprived.<br />
Benatar, associate professor of philosophy University of Cape Town, 97<br />
&lt;David, “Why it is Better Never to Come into Existence.” In Life Death and Meaning: Key Philosophical Readings on Big Questions. Pg 156-158&gt;<br />
<br />
Even if being born isn’t intrinsically bad history shows that on average being born is worse then never being born. Their disads will simply reflect the ongoing agony of existence. Giving birth is playing Russian Roulette with your child’s future.<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06 &lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 88-92&gt;<br />
<br />
Rawlsian justice means we should do our best to bring no people into existence<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 180&gt;<br />
<br />
There is a moral obligation not to bring others into existence that outweighs any possible suffering of those that currently exist.<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 190-191&gt;<br />
<br />
Every child is a generational iceberg of suffering<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 6-7&gt;<br />
<br />
Self deception is the only reason we don’t regret our nonexistence, we have been brainwashed.<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 64-69&gt;<br />
<br />
Given humanities psychological conditioning the intuitive view of life’s worth should be held up to heavy scrutiny<br />
Benatar, University of Cape Town associate professor philosophy, 06<br />
&lt;David, Better Never to Have Been, pg 99-101&gt;<br />

Consciousness is critical to moral standing, 99% percent of abortions occur before fe
