Kritik – Lacan<br />
WHAT IS SAUTHORITY? THE AFFIRMATIVE PRESENTS AUTHORITY AS A SUBSTANTIVE QUALITY OR A POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO SEARCH OR DETAIN PEOPLE. THEIR VIEW OF AUTHORITY IS FLAWED, BECAUSE AUTHORITY IS AN EMPTY PERFORMANCE, ONE THAT IS EFFECTIVE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE ACTS OF ANNOUNCEMENT AND RECEPTION<br />
ZIZEK, 1992, “Enjoy Your Symptom” Rutledge, p. 94-96<br />
“if, however, the truth claim” . . . “wealth of its creator’s personality”<br />
<br />
<br />
IF AUTHORITY IS THIS KIND OF EMPTY PERFORMANCE, WHAT MAKES IT EFFECTIVE? THE IDEA THAT WE CAN DESCRIBE AUTHORITY AS A FACT PREVENTS US THINKING OF AUTHORITY AS A SPECIFIC KIND OF PERFORMANCE. OUR FRAMEWORK ASKS THAT YOU THINK AUTHORITY THROUGH THE ENJOYMENT GENERATED IN PERFORMING A RELATIONSHIP TO THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY, AND THAT YOU THINK DEBATE AS A PROCESS OF SIGNIFICATION THAT HAS MINIMAL CONTACT WITH REAL EVENTS. IT IS THE CONCEPT OF AUTHORITY THAT ALLWS THE MASTER TO DEFINE THEIR PERFORMATIVE SPEECH ACTS AS DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CONTENT OF REALITY<br />
ZIZEK, 1992, “Enjoy Your Symptom” Rutledge, p. 96-99<br />
“As it is clear from” . . . “that things are thus”<br />
<br />
DEMANDS FOR LIBERATION, SUCH AS THAT OF THE AFFIRMATIVE RESULT IN THE OPPOSITE OF THEIR STATED INTENTION. THEY MAKE OUR ADDICTION TO THE STATUS QUO MORE INTENSE, INTERNAL LINK TURNING THEIR CASE<br />
Peter Starr, 1995 Tympanum, Issue 1 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/comp-lit/tympanum/1/starr.html" rel="nofollow">__www.usc.edu/dept/comp-lit /tympanum/1/starr.html__</a><br />
“In short, Lacan’s psychotic” . . . “you will have one”<br />
<br />
SINCE AUTHORITY CAN ONLY FUNCTION BY RENDERING ITS MECHANICS INVISIBLE, BRINGING IT TO LIGHT CAN ROB IT OF ITS UNQUESTIONED POWER. OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO OVERCONFORM TO AUTHORITY AS A WAY OF INDENTIFYING ITS PERFORMATIVE FUNCTION AND HIGHLIGHTING THE STRUCTURES OF ENJOYMENT THAT HAVE CAUSED US TO BECOME INVESTED IN ITS OPERATIONS<br />
Henry Krips, 2004 “Couching Politics: Zizek’s Rules for Radicals,” from Psychoanalysis, Culture and Society, Pg. 126-141<br />
“Zizek argues for a paradoxical” . . . “calls ‘traversing the phantasy”<br />
