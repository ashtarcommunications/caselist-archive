<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">all on wiki Food Safety is under Georgia CS, CAFOs PIC is under pre-wake Georgia Neg disclosure</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Case – no calculation means worse atrocities allowed, rational policy makers can avoid catastrophic risk even if risk unlikely, weigh risk and imapcts as best you can – not impossible to make predictions, plan causes factory farms to go abroad, cutting subsidies wont end CAFOs</span><br />

Framework – policy option best<br />
Disad – Wetlands<br />
Wetland reduction strong now, plan reverses economic incentive, wetlands destroy global ecosystems<br />
