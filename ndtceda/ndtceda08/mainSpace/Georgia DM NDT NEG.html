 <br />
Chernus’ critique of nuclear literalism is an isolated ivory tower endeavor that has no basis in fact and is empirically denied. They lead to ignorance of the social aspects of nuclear weapons which defeast the critique and blocks more productive analysis<br />
Summer 1991 “review of Ira Chernus’ Nuclear madness”<br />
“the logic followed in the” “into these itself”<br />
chernus alternative wont solve and wont translate to a broad audience – theres no way to verify it<br />
elder 1993<br />
“not everyone will be” “about their truth”<br />
Remaking nuclear myth fails – ti can be dangerously redeployed and it backgrounds the real world material issues behind nuclear weapons<br />
Bosmajian 1991 “nuclear age literature for youth”<br />
“by delineating the” “in a nuclear age”<br />
nuclear death images reaffirm the values of human life – the only way to love is to experience nuclear fear<br />
fox 1985 “nuclear war: philosophical perspectives”<br />
“nor can we rid” “to their transcendence”<br />
depecting scenarios for nuclear war creates a fear that drive people to action and arouses anger at injustices – the alternative creates irresponsibility and inaction<br />
Grinspoon 1986 “the long darkness: Psychological and moral perspectives on nuclear winter”<br />
“the lat Archibald” “of the reality”<br />
failure to imagine nuclear war causes denial and makes nuclear conflict more likely<br />
lenz 1990 “nuclear age literature for youth” p. 9-10<br />
“since Americans have” “a psychic toll”<br />
the only way to break free of nculearism and mobilize action is to imagine the end of the world and death<br />
Lifton 1986 “the long darkness” p. 97-8<br />
“I am struck by the” “maintain human existence”<br />
it is better to provoke managed fear, rather than let actual crisis provoke irrational response<br />
Ungar “the rise and fall of nuclearism” 1992 p. 188-9<br />
“resistance by the United” “than irrational responses”<br />
debate is the antidote to state fear mongering – scenario planning by informed groups can counter-act official misinformation. And, the alternative is that the governments will continue to scare us but we will be too apolitical and ill informed to counter act lies<br />
Kurasawa 2004<br />
“state and market” “evaluation, and contestation”<br />
debates from non-governmental actors about futurism and crisis aversion have been critical to forming movements addressing pollution, genocide, aids, racism and war. Decaedes of social activism have been motiviated by futurism – this history overwhelms their non-emperical theory<br />
kurasawa 2004<br />
“societies emerging from” “particularly glaring”<br />
<br />
short-sightedness is what makes life disposable – the techno-strategic logic that they indict is at its worst when we refuse to consider long-term consequences. Future orientation si othe only way to make better decision<br />
kurasawa 2004<br />
“at another level” “of preventive foresight”<br />

1 – “Constructive engagement” K/cp<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2 – Persia PIC<br />
in 1935 the third reich persuaded Persia to change to iran – maintaing this name destroys the history of Persian culture<br />
Yarshater 1989 “when Persia, became Iran”<br />
“in 1935 the Persian” “with Misr”<br />
this is more than a dirty word K – using Iran instead of Persia changes the teaching of history<br />
Motamedi 2001 “bring back Persia”<br />
“in the mid” “know…From iran”<br />
changing the framing of an issue changes its policy outcomes – content and framing are intimately connected<br />
Bales 2001 “a conversation with susan nall bales”<br />
“our content analyses” “of new methods”<br />
using Persia is key to break the connection to the Nazi regime<br />
mordant 2005 “Iran vs. Persia”<br />
“this is the fact” “would be in order”<br />
<br />
We have an intellectual responsibility to challenge imperialist production of culture. The separation of culture from politics is an act of domination which enables violence<br />
Said 1993 “culture and imperialism” p. 54-8<br />
“since my themse here” “territories world-wide”<br />
Language critique solves – challenging unconscious understanding of the world is key to changing policy outcomes<br />
Lakoff “the mind and the world”<br />
“the problem is a conceptual” “frame every issue”<br />

Rnd 1 Case Cites:<br />
<br />
IRGC CP:<br />
<br />
Text: GB, exclude the IRGC<br />
<br />
Solvency:<br />
<br />
1) Designating the IRGC as a terrorist organization is vital in empowering democratic forces inside Iran. Jafarzadeh 9/18/07 &lt;foxnews.com/printer_friendly_story/0,3566,297199,00.html&gt;<br />
<br />
“And long before getting…leader’s of tommorrow’s Iran.”<br />
<br />
2) Iranian democracy is the only way to avert war with Iran and the prospect of Iranian nuclear weapons. Safavi 12/12/07<br />
<br />
&lt;metimes.com/Opinion/2007/12/12/op-ed_ali_safavi/9785/)<br />
<br />
“Thirty years of appeasement…We have no time to lose”<br />
<br />
3) US support for Iranian democracy is key to democratic movements globally. Pahlavi 1/30/08.<br />
<br />
&lt;rezapahlavi.org/media/pdf/222_Georgetown_speech30Jan2008.pdf&gt;<br />
<br />
With Iran, these past several…throughout the Middle East<br />
<br />
4) Global democracy is vital in averting numberous scenarios for extinction. Diamond 95. &lt;wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/fr.htm&gt;<br />
<br />
This Hardly exhausts… popular sovereignty, and openness<br />
<br />
GCC DA:<br />
<br />
A) The US continues to support ongoing Middle Eastern political reform efforts<br />
<br />
Radio Free Europe 1/13/08 (lexis)<br />
<br />
“U.S. President George W. Bush…nations to take up democracy”<br />
<br />
B) Diplomatic bargains with Iran disempower the forces of freedom and reform in the Middle East Donnelly 05 &lt;strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub629.pdf&gt;<br />
<br />
“Throughout the greater Middle East…reversing its post-9/11 policies”<br />
<br />
C) Failure to secure reforms in the Middle East sparks terrorism and internal instability that threatens Saudi oil exports Pollack 03<br />
<br />
&lt;foreignaffairs.org/20030701faessay15401/Kenneth-m-pollack/securing-the- gulf.html?mode=print&gt;<br />
<br />
“Terrorism and internal instability…surely as an Iranian invasion”<br />
<br />
D) The sudden loss of Saudi oil exports would collapse the global economy<br />
<br />
Same cite as point C<br />
<br />
“America’s primary interest in the Persian… economy along with everybody else’s”<br />
<br />
E) Global nuclear war, Mead 92<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Israel Participation Condition CP<br />
<br />
A) US engagement with Iran should be conditioned on Israeli participation in such talks—failure to do so ensures Israel’s isolation in the future Middle East developments Jerualem Post 12/11/07. &lt;jpost.com/servlet/satellite?cid=1196847315306&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter&gt;<br />
<br />
“Highlighting new indications…week in the Middle East”<br />
<br />
B) Perceptions of isolation empower Israeli hard-liners and encourage foreign poilcy recklessness—risks nuclear war<br />
<br />
Halevi 02. &lt;google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Yossi+Klein+Halevi%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&gt;<br />
