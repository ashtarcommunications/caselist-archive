Plan Text: Therefore we advocate the following plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) by ruling that the biased counseling laws upheld in Section 3205 of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 is unconstitutional based under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.<br />
<br />
Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
The 1992 Planned Parenthood versus Casey upheld the idea of “Informed Consent” which bludgens women with biased information meant to manipulate and discourage their reproductive freedom<br />

Advantage One: Freedom of Speech<br />
<br />
State imposed informed consent forces the doctors hand in disclosing treatment options; this destroys their right to free speech and their ethical and legal obligations to the abortion seeker<br />

Abridgement of speech is the root of moral slavery, such policies are justified by dehumanizing a group of people so that it is ok to deny their speech and they prevent the chance of protesting such policies as an expression of their identity further entrenching such dehumanization<br />
<br />
David Richards, NYU Law Professor, 1999<br />

Structural injustice, as earlier …. That is why, in my judgment, abridgment of the basic human rights of conscience and speech so pivotally model the reasonable analysis of structural injustice in all its forms.<br />
<br />
And, the judge has an obligation simulating the supreme court to reject all violations of the constitution<br />

And, the 14th Amendment is the crucial grounds for solving for women’s rights; other grounds narrow the scope of the decision and muddle the clear signal for the equality of sexes<br />

Erin Daly, Widener Law Professor, 1995<br />
(October, “Liberty, Equality and the New Rhetoric of Planned Parenthood v. Casey” American University Law Review, p. Lexis)<br />

Therefore we advocate the following plan: The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) by ruling that the biased counseling laws and mandatory waiting periods upheld in Section 3205 of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982 are unconstitutional based under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.<br />
<br />
Observation Two: Solvency<br />
<br />
Supreme Court action overturning Casey is critical to a broader acceptance of abortion and women’s rights; the plan causes a fundamental shift in the court’s recognition of women as equal members of society<br />

This shift in …done by such laws.<br />
<br />
And, the 14th Amendment is the crucial grounds for solving for women’s rights; other grounds narrow the scope of the decision and muddle the clear signal for the equality of sexes<br />

Removing biased counseling laws and mandatory waiting periods is critical to allowing access to low income women - the alternative is late term and unhealthy abortions<br />

A woman must give her … who remain ambivalent.<br />

Eliminating anti-abortion restrictions are a critical to prevent the right from subjugating women and pushing them out of society – opening the door to a new style of hyper-conservative State politics of control<br />

<br />
This is the situation … But, bad as that is, it is also more than that.<br />
<br />
And the plan’s reasoning re-conceptualizes the debate about abortion by making it about positive rights and an affirmative State obligation to provide abortions for millions of women who exist outside the realm of white and class privileges<br />

A. The other branches of the Federal Government can’t solve – Casey uniquely invited the States anti-abortion forces to ram through anti-choice legislative measures – only the plan can solve this<br />

B. The States can’t solve – Casey’s weak pro-abortion jurisprudence invites the Congress and the President to roll back abortions rights – only having the Supreme court overturn Casey’s precedent can solve<br />

Free Speech<br />
A. State imposed informed consent forces the doctors hand in disclosing treatment options; this destroys their right to free speech and their ethical and legal obligations to the abortion seeker<br />

B. Abridgement of speech is the root of moral slavery, such policies are justified by dehumanizing a group of people so that it is ok to deny their speech and they prevent the chance of protesting such policies as an expression of their identity further entrenching such dehumanization<br />
