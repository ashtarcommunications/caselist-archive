Guzzini 98<br />

The dialectic relationship discussed in Said and other critics of Orientalism forget the fluidity of the form of the other, thus including the West and all tis poplation at the other extreme<br />
James carrier 93, Occidentalism: the world turned upsie-down pp 195-212<br />
“the category that has attracted the most attention is Orientalism… later about anthropological understandings of Western societies”<br />
<br />
Your argument of orientalism falls prey to the same essentializing principle that you critique. Instead of essentializing the orient, you engage in Occidentalism and instead essentialize the west.<br />

1AC: Same Hamas Aff<br />
<br />
1NC: 5 Off w/ No Case (Both CP and K are conditional, will never go for the SQ)<br />
<br />
1 - Implementation/Negotiation Specification<br />
<br />
2 - T (Plan deals w/ Hamas, not the PA, Give conflict mediation to Israel too which is extra topical, include is more than)<br />
<br />
3 - Have the US tell Blair to do the plan - - same cards from before<br />
<br />
4 - Politics - Colombia FTA Good<br />
<br />
5 - K (Orientalism)<br />
<br />
2NC: K<br />
<br />
1NR: read cards on the K, answer theory, kick negotiation spec, went for T<br />
<br />
2NR: Went for T argument that the plan is done between the govs, not offered to them AND Orientalism K<br />
<br />
Topicality 1NC:<br />
<br />
Definitions:<br />
<br />
1. Foreign assistance is defined by the foreign assistance act of 1961. GAO 95<br />
<br />
2. This includes Development assistance, food aid, disaster relief, humanitarian iad, peacekeeping forces and security assistance. Moore 01<br />
<br />
3. Including means containing as a subordinate element - therefore the affirmative must include more than just a security guarantee and foreign assistance - it must also include diplomatic action separate from the aid process, ie the constructive engagement portion of the plan.<br />
<br />
Violations:<br />
<br />
1. Conflict mediation is diplomatic activity, not foreign assistance. We did a search of the 500-plus page foreign assistance act and the phrase conflict mediation doesn’t appear in it - we will enter a screenshot of that search into the record for the debate - and our interpretation establishes that it is the aff’s burden to prove that their plan falls under the provisions of the act - not our burden to prove that it doesn’t - such is the nature of a prima facie burden of proof<br />
<br />
2. the plan says that they give aid between two actors - it doesn’t give it to any actor in the topic - something which is between two objects is not on or towards either of them by definition<br />
<br />
3. The plan gives US assistance to the legislative council, which is controlled by HAMAS, a group the US does not consider to be a government<br />
<br />
4. If mediation is assistance, then they give it to Israel as well as the PA, which means they explicitly provide assistance to actor that was purposefully excluded from the topic.<br />

“In short, democracy and economic integration…different blocs or coalitions in the hemisphere”<br />
<br />
Orientalism 1NC:<br />
<br />
A - Framework<br />
<br />
Rhetorical engagement with the middle east is locked within an orientalist narrative of dualistic identity construction. The affirmative’s epistemological intervention is founded on assumptions that make domination inevitable.<br />
<br />
Munif 06<br />
<br />
“Third, an understanding of the way Islam…foundations of European modernity”<br />
<br />
Diplomacy is warfare. Maintenance of global civil peace is a front in the perpetual war that structures dominating social relations between and within nations.<br />
<br />
Foucault 76<br />
<br />
“Then again, there is a second…once and for all, to the exercise of poser as continual war”<br />
<br />
Outweighs and turns the case. The knowledge apparatus of western thinking is the root cause of middle east instability and places us on the path towards unimaginable violence and global extinction.<br />
<br />
Bilgin 05<br />
<br />
“Thinking about the future from a critical security… complicit in perpetuating regional insecurity in the Middle East”<br />
<br />
Alternative - vote negative to reject the affirmative’s practice of traditional middle east analysis and embrace a critical intellectual approach of radical criticism.<br />
<br />
Rejecting the aff’s assistance framing allows alternative ways of thinking about mediation without literally buying and selling peace on the international market<br />
