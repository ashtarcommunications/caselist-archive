Plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) on Commerce Clause grounds. We’ll Clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Gender Violence<br />
<br />
We have several internal links.:<br />
A. Equality under the law – the civil remedy is a viable solution that produces meaningful individual autonomy for women<br />
Benedict, 2002<br />
[Jennifer. “United States v. Morrison: Progressive Legislation is Down, But not Out” Toledo Law Review, Winter, 33 U. Tol. L. Rev. 411, Pg. L/N]<br />
Contemporary critical theory ….of their goals.<br />
<br />
<br />
AND, courts will be receptive to Civil Remedy cases – plaintiffs will win<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law, 2003<br />
(Sally F., American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251)<br />
In fact, however…. ultimately ended with the provision's defeat. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=739ff795add73e33d64f8785ce1822e3&amp;docnum=3&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkAB&amp;_md5=c2cdd83095bf9e7ac882e623f0e3c868&amp;focBudTerms=kristin%20bumiller&amp;focBudSel=all#n63" rel="nofollow">63</a><br />
<br />
B. Criminalization –<br />
The invalidation of the Civil Rights Remedy turns VAWA into an issue of criminalization<br />
Bumiller, Prof of Political Science and Gender Studies @ Amherst, 2005<br />
(Kristin, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a>)<br />
The invalidation of the ….primarily on volunteers and soft money.<br />
<br />
<br />
The current criminalization approach to sexual violence reproduces violence – criminalization strategies give the state and law enforcement too much power – the result is series of mandatory arrest laws and no drop policies that harm the very women they are intended to protect<br />
Bumiller, Prof of Political Science and Gender Studies @ Amherst, 2005<br />
(Kristin, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a>)<br />
Thus it becomes …intrusion into private lives.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The civil remedy is an important break from the criminalization approach that victimizes women – civil litigation gives women the power over the legal process which dramatically reduces the powers vested in the state<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
[Catherine, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, November, p. 137-138]<br />
The Morrison majority ….value and restore survivors.<br />
<br />
<br />
C. Framing the Issue<br />
The Civil Remedy approach is a powerful medium for communicating equality and shifting social norms of individual and officials – it will change the cultural frame of reference and it will allow women to assert their cause in a collective fashion<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law, 2003<br />
(Sally F., American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251)<br />
Civil rights claims are …task of responding to such violence.<br />
<br />
The civil remedy creates an explicit framework of gender equality that gives women the power over the legal process – it is a productive way to engage the state that frames the issue<br />
Schneider, Professor of Law, George Mason, 2000<br />
[Liz, Battered Women &amp; Feminist Lawmaking, p. 196-198]<br />
What are the implications …state on domestic violence continue.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Civil Remedy will make state efforts better – the national legislation will serve as an educational tool for every court system in the country<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University School of Law, 2002<br />
[Sally. “The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, and the Use and Abuse of Federalism” Fordham Law Review, October, 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57]<br />
Meanwhile, the …of state civil rights legislation. n187<br />
<br />
<br />
D. The localization of violence<br />
The Morrison decision unites the private and the local, treating violence within the home as outside of its power – the focus on violence against women as a local problem allows gender violence to continue unimpeded.<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law at Michigan Law, 2000<br />
[Catherine. “Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison” Harvard Law Review<br />
November, 2000, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, Pg. l/n]<br />
3. Theory. - The controversy over ..in which it is socially exercised.<br />
<br />
<br />
The arbitrary boundary-drawing of what is worth the Federal Government’s time and resources absolves political accountability and justifies patriarchal control<br />
RESNIK, Professor of Law, Yale, 2001<br />
(Judith, &quot;Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,&quot; The Yale Law Journal, 3 (December 2001), pp. 619-680)<br />
My willingness to stray ..a justification for patriarchal control.<br />
<br />
<br />
Violence against women is a systemic impact – it is a mass atrocity that takes thousands of lives – it is an urgent policy consideration<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, and Fellow, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, “Women's September 11th: Rethinking the International Law of Conflict,” 47 Harvard International Law Journal 1. Winter, 2006<br />
Here is the question: …does not protect women within them either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gender violence prevents the self-actualization of life – it is a form of spirit injury that destroys the value to life of the entire community<br />
WING, Pf Law @ Iowa, 97 (Adrien Katherine, Albany Law Review, 60 Alb. L. Rev. 943)<br />
The multiple effect ….an entire culture.&quot; <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=739ff795add73e33d64f8785ce1822e3&amp;docnum=2&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkAB&amp;_md5=c2cdd83095bf9e7ac882e623f0e3c868&amp;focBudTerms=kristin%20bumiller&amp;focBudSel=all#n42" rel="nofollow">42</a><br />
<br />
Structural violence like inequality and patriarchy produce vast physical and psychological effects. These conditions justify war, authoritarian rule, and a nuclear holocaust<br />
Reardon, Director of the Peace Education Program at Teacher's College Columbia University, 1993<br />
[Betty. Women and Peace: Feminist Visions of Global Security, Pg. 30-2]<br />
In an article entitled &quot;Naming …rifts in world politics. (Shelly 1983)<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Terrorism Prevention<br />
<br />
Experts conclude terrorist attack inevitable in the status quo<br />
Jordan, 2006 [Lara. “Another attack just a matter of time” September 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2006/09/07/1811150.html" rel="nofollow">http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2006/09/07/1811150.html</a>]<br />
The threat of terrorism ..of the weakest link.<br />
<br />
AND, the attack will happen in the near future<br />
Nalle, Former Capital Hall Staffer and History Professor, 2006 [Dave. “The Lessons of 9/11” September 12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/09/12/154941.php" rel="nofollow">http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/09/12/154941.php</a>]<br />

Morrison’s Commerce Clause definition precludes integration between the federal and state actors<br />

<br />
Morrison has no consistent interpretation for what constitutes economic and non-economic activity—this subjects decisions to judge’s political and economic philosophy<br />

<br />
And, The recent Raich decision has caused the Commerce Clause jurisprudence uniquely unpredictable and unstable<br />
Kreit, Associate, Morrison &amp; Foerster, 2006<br />

[B] We solve their alternative—The move to recognize that the subject is a function of social discourse is radically liberator our framework restores the notion of pragmatic agency, resistance, and social change by mediating between what language does to us and what we can do to language together.

Plan:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule the decision in United States v. Morrison (529 U.S. 598) on Commerce Clause grounds. We’ll Clarify.<br />
<br />
Advantage One: Gender Violence<br />
We have several internal links.:<br />
A. Equality under the law – the civil remedy is a viable solution that produces meaningful individual autonomy for women<br />
Benedict, 2002<br />
[Jennifer. “United States v. Morrison: Progressive Legislation is Down, But not Out” Toledo Law Review, Winter, 33 U. Tol. L. Rev. 411, Pg. L/N]<br />
Contemporary critical theory intersects … a setback to the realization of their goals.<br />
<br />
AND, courts will be receptive to Civil Remedy cases – plaintiffs will win<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law, 2003<br />
(Sally F., American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251)<br />
In fact, however, these difficulties turned out to be …ended with the provision's defeat. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=739ff795add73e33d64f8785ce1822e3&amp;docnum=3&amp;_fmtstr=FULL&amp;_startdoc=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVlb-zSkAB&amp;_md5=c2cdd83095bf9e7ac882e623f0e3c868&amp;focBudTerms=kristin%20bumiller&amp;focBudSel=all#n63" rel="nofollow">63</a><br />
<br />
B. Criminalization –<br />
The invalidation of the Civil Rights Remedy turns VAWA into an issue of criminalization<br />
Bumiller, Prof of Political Science and Gender Studies @ Amherst, 2005<br />
(Kristin, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a>)<br />
The invalidation of the civil rights … primarily on volunteers and soft money.<br />
<br />
The current criminalization approach to sexual violence reproduces violence – criminalization strategies give the state and law enforcement too much power – the result is series of mandatory arrest laws and no drop policies that harm the very women they are intended to protect<br />
Bumiller, Prof of Political Science and Gender Studies @ Amherst, 2005<br />
(Kristin, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a>)<br />
Thus it becomes imperative to ask …circumstances for state intrusion into private lives.<br />
<br />
The civil remedy is an important break from the criminalization approach that victimizes women – civil litigation gives women the power over the legal process which dramatically reduces the powers vested in the state<br />
MacKinnon, Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School, 2000<br />
[Catherine, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, November, p. 137-138]<br />
The Morrison majority did not contest what Congress … behavior and to value and restore survivors.<br />
<br />
C. Framing the Issue<br />
The Civil Remedy approach is a powerful medium for communicating equality and shifting social norms of individual and officials – it will change the cultural frame of reference and it will allow women to assert their cause in a collective fashion<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law, 2003<br />
(Sally F., American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 11 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol'y &amp; L. 251)<br />
Civil rights claims are intrinsically assertive … charged with the task of responding to such violence.<br />
<br />
The civil remedy creates an explicit framework of gender equality that gives women the power over the legal process – it is a productive way to engage the state that frames the issue<br />
Schneider, Professor of Law, George Mason, 2000<br />
[Liz, Battered Women &amp; Feminist Lawmaking, p. 196-198]<br />
What are the implications …state on domestic violence continue.<br />
<br />
The Civil Remedy will make state efforts better – the national legislation will serve as an educational tool for every court system in the country<br />
Goldfarb, Associate Professor of Law, Rutgers University School of Law, 2002<br />
[Sally. “The Supreme Court, The Violence Against Women Act, and the Use and Abuse of Federalism” Fordham Law Review, October, 71 Fordham L. Rev. 57]<br />
Meanwhile, the attitudes of state and local … possible adoption of state civil rights legislation. n187<br />
<br />
D. The localization of violence<br />
The Morrison decision unites the private and the local, treating violence within the home as outside of its power – the focus on violence against women as a local problem allows gender violence to continue unimpeded.<br />
MacKinnon, Professor of Law at Michigan Law, 2000<br />
[Catherine. “Disputing Male Sovereignty: On United States v. Morrison” Harvard Law Review November, 2000, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135, Pg. l/n]<br />
3. Theory. - The controversy over the scope of the … in the most violent sphere in which it is socially exercised.<br />
<br />
The arbitrary boundary-drawing of what is worth the Federal Government’s time and resources absolves political accountability and justifies patriarchal control<br />
RESNIK, Professor of Law, Yale, 2001<br />
(Judith, &quot;Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,&quot; The Yale Law Journal, 3 (December 2001), pp. 619-680)<br />
My willingness to stray from categorical federalism …as a justification for patriarchal control.<br />
<br />
Violence against women is a systemic impact – it is a mass atrocity that takes thousands of lives – it is an urgent policy consideration<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, Professor of Law, University of Michigan Law School, and Fellow, Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, “Women's September 11th: Rethinking the International Law of Conflict,” 47 Harvard International Law Journal 1. Winter, 2006<br />
Here is the question: What will it take for violence against … not protect women within them either.<br />
<br />
Structural violence like inequality and patriarchy produce vast physical and psychological effects. These conditions justify war, authoritarian rule, and a nuclear holocaust<br />
Reardon, Director of the Peace Education Program at Teacher's College Columbia University, 1993<br />
[Betty. Women and Peace: Feminist Visions of Global Security, Pg. 30-2]<br />
In an article entitled &quot;Naming … order which even defines the major rifts in world politics. (Shelly 1983)<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Terrorism Prevention<br />
Experts conclude terrorist attack inevitable in the status quo<br />
Jordan, 2006 [Lara. “Another attack just a matter of time” September 11, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2006/09/07/1811150.html" rel="nofollow">http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/World/2006/09/07/1811150.html</a>]<br />
The threat of terrorism …always in search of the weakest link.<br />
<br />
AND, the attack will happen in the near future<br />
Nalle, Former Capital Hall Staffer and History Professor, 2006 [Dave. “The Lessons of 9/11” September 12, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/09/12/154941.php" rel="nofollow">http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/09/12/154941.php</a>]<br />
There will be another 9/11… made in the area of excessive reprisals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Morrison’s Commerce Clause definition precludes integration between the federal and state actors<br />
Brook, 2005<br />
[Brian. “Note: Federalizing the First Responders to Acts of Terrorism Via the Militia Clauses” Duke Law Journal, February, 54 Duke L.J. 999, Pg. l/n]<br />
Although federal agencies such … cannot engage in such activity under the commerce power.<br />
<br />
And, reversing Commerce Clause jurisprudence is vital to Congress’ confidence to pass necessary legislation to thwart terrorism threats<br />
Powers, 2002<br />
[Scott. “Case Note: Commerce- A Retreat From Clarity” Temple Law Review, Spring, 2002, 75 Temp. L. Rev. 163, Pg. l/n]<br />
A second feature of the stare decisis …hat require a uniform, national solution. n285<br />
<br />
Overruling Morrison on commerce clause grounds would restore a rational basis standard that would allow broad Congressional powers under the commerce clause<br />
Dral and Phillips, J.D. from UTennessee and Professor of Law, UTennesse, 2001<br />
[Christy and Jerry. “Commerce By Another Name: The Impact of United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison” Tennessee Law Review, Spring, 2001, 68 Tenn. L. Rev. 605, Pg. l/n]<br />
The alternative to the standards … respect restraints imposed by rules of law.&quot; n238<br />
<br />
Morrison has no consistent interpretation for what constitutes economic and non-economic activity—this subjects decisions to judge’s political and economic philosophy<br />
Scott T. Powers, A Retreat From Clarity: The Supreme Court Adds a Wrinkle to the &quot;Aggregated Effects&quot; Doctrine of its Commerce Clause Jurisprudence, Temple Law Review, Spring 2002 (75 Temp. L. Rev. 163)<br />
[*164] Beginning with its 1995 holding in United States … judge's political or economic philosophy. n19<br />
<br />
And, The recent Raich decision has caused the Commerce Clause jurisprudence uniquely unpredictable and unstable<br />
Kreit, Associate, Morrison &amp; Foerster, 2006<br />
[Alex. “Rights, Rules, and Raich” West Virginia Law Review, Spring, 108 W. Va. L. Rev. 705, Pg. l/n]<br />
Raich leaves Commerce Clause jurisprudence … storm to reach the results they think sensible.&quot; n261<br />
<br />
A strong first response deters terrorists in the first place<br />
Davis and Jenkins, Senior scientist and Research Leader at RAND; Senior Advisor to the president of RAND, 2002<br />
[Paul and Brian Michael. Deterrence and Influence in Counter Terrorism : A Component in the War on Al Qaeda, Pg. xiv]<br />
Deterrence depends significantly on … rapid adaptation, and recovery.<br />
<br />
Failure to prevent WMD terrorism causes extinction<br />
Kirkus Reviews, 1999 [June 1, LN]<br />
Terrorism is nothing new… This is simply unacceptable doggerel.<br />
<br />

CP doesn’t solve the Gender Advantage- teh facts in the case when it reached the Supreme Court are reasons why 13981 is unconstitutional Sticking to the facts prevent 13981 from being reauthorized. The impact is gender violence is an urgent policy concern and that gendered violence makes conflict inevitable—that’s our MacKinnon and Reardon evidence.<br />

Doesn’t solve our centralization or judicial predictability advantages- they rule Morrison narrowly and hten make another narrow decision by legitimizing 13981 under the Constitution.

New version of 1AC:<br />
<br />
New USC JJ<br />
Plan: The United States Supreme Court should grant a writ of certiorari to a relevant case and overrule the decision in United States vs. Morrison by ruling that United States Code Title 42, Section 13981 is constitutional under Congress’ Commerce Clause powers. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Historically wives, not unlike slaves, were the legal property of the patriarch. They did not have a social or legal identity separate from their husbands. Even though the husband could not alienate or sell his wife, her person was subsumed in his, and her body was his to control. Her body was the province of others.<br />
<br />
Male privilege and power within the family, protected by conceptions of marriage and familial responsibility, granted to husbands the right to beat and rape their wives. Male intimate violence was justified because the husband was vested with the power to physically control his wife’s behavior. The court presumed the legitimacy of such power. Judicial inquiry started from the point that some physical violence was acceptable to preserve the ‘natural order of things’ of which familial harmony and male hegemony were integral parts.<br />
<br />
In State v. Black, a wife’s accusation of adultery on the part of her husband constituted sufficient provocation to justify a physical attack because her behavior fell outside the bounds of acceptable wifely conduct. The husband was transformed into the abused party because his wife’s conduct was an affront to his power and to social conceptions of order. Use of violence protected not only male hegemony within the family but also the interests of the state in preserving social stability.<br />
<br />
Observation 1 – Gender violence<br />
<br />
The lack of gender animus teaches people that their lives don’t count – life does in fact become meaningless. Legal standing is a reminder individual voices do count.<br />
Robin West, Harvard Journal of Law and Gender, Winter 2006<br />
“Imagine a woman harassed on the street…I have no standing.”<br />
<br />
Observation Two: The Rules of the Game<br />
<br />
The US v Morrison is a vivid instance of categorical federalism: it’s a way for the Supreme Court to naturalize anything which seems like a family or a crime issue into the exclusive property of state governance. The Court’s extension of categorical federalism assumed this division to be natural, bipolar and exclusive<br />
Judith Resnik, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” Yale Law Journal, December 2001<br />
“The Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Morrison provides…damages in federal courts.”<br />
CONTINUES…<br />
“The majority opinion in Morrison…while the second objects to the framework itself.”<br />
<br />
The problem with such neat allocations of power is that it abjures the government from responsibility. The court both hides its own responsibility in buffering away violence as not “national-enough.” The notion of categorical federalism is a way of hiding the way the courts have gendered family relations.<br />
Judith Resnik, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” Yale Law Journal, December 2001<br />
“Categorical federalism has appeal, particularly in a world…security from transnational lawmaking.”<br />
<br />
Categorical federalism undermines the ability to hold actors politically accountable for their decisions. It is a form of institutional essentialization that undercomplicates the process of social change. It is a way of deferring to legal concepts of jurisdiction instead of contesting patriarchal control.<br />
Judith Resnik, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” Yale Law Journal, December 2001<br />
“My willingness to stray from categorical federalism…justification for patriarchal control.”<br />
<br />
Federal responsibility is necessary: we need to understand that men who rape women should not be beyond the reach of federal law. It is these exceptions to federal law which shield slavery, voting restrictions and child labor.<br />
Reva B. Siegel, “She the People: The Nineteenth Amendment, Sex Equality, Federalism, and the Family,” Harvard Law Review, 115:4, February 2002<br />
“States are traditionally responsible…current constitutional commitments.”<br />
<br />
Observation : Criminalization<br />
<br />
The invalidation of the civil rights provisions of the VAWA turns VAWA into an issue of criminalization. All that is left of the vawa are the crime prevention components.<br />
Kristin Bumiller, 2005, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a><br />
“The invalidation of the civil rights provision…volunteers and soft money.”<br />
<br />
The legal discourse of crime control turns intimate violence into just another crime problem<br />
Mark Fondacaro, Violence Against Women and Feminist Criminology: An Analysis of Qualitative and Quantitative Research, 2001, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.new.ufl.edu/~jdouglas/final155811.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://web.new.ufl.edu/~jdouglas/final155811.pdf</a><br />
“Much of the attention on feminist issues in criminology…historical, and cultural context.”<br />
<br />
Criminalization of sexual violence reproduces violence: criminalization strategies give the state and law enforcement too much power in limiting women and regulating homosexuality. It is a glorification of violence that masks itself in the rationalization of the criminal control state. Criminal justice approaches prevent alterate ways of approaching gendered violence.<br />
Kristin Bumiller, 2005, Freedom from Gender Violence as a Human Right: Feminism and Federalism in a Global Perspective, 5th Annual Women and the Law Conference, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjsl.edu/downloads/Kristin%20Bumiller.pdf</a><br />
“Thus it becomes imperative to ask…stepped up in new national contexts.”<br />
CONTINUES…<br />
“Specifically in the American context, breaking…state intrusion into private lives.”<br />
<br />
Current strategies of criminalization are a racist regulation of womens’ lives. Criminalization feeds conservative stereotypes which view women and as irrational and incapable of rational choice<br />
G. Kristin Miccio, Summer 2005, 42 House L. Rev. 237<br />
“The current discourse on mandatory practices…autonomy and resistance.”<br />
<br />
Over-reliance on criminal law strategies invites the racism of law enforcement<br />
Holly Maguigan, 2003, American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; The Law, 11 Am. U. J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 427<br />
“Most likely to be classified as victims of violence…creative ways of community intervention.”<br />
<br />
Criminalization is coercion. It says that women must give up control of their lives when they make a violence claim.<br />
G. Kristin Miccio, Summer 2005, 42 House L. Rev. 237<br />
“Criminalization of male intimate violence…appears to be illusory.”<br />
<br />
Observation <u>_: Another way<br />
<br />
The government’s linking of gender and abuse is critical to influencing social norms. Recognizing that violence is systemic is critical to prevent the denial of violence and distancing.<br />
Mark Fondacaro, Violence Against Women and Feminist Criminology: An Analysis of Qualitative and Quantitative Research, 2001, online: <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.new.ufl.edu/~jdouglas/final155811.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://web.new.ufl.edu/~jdouglas/final155811.pdf</a><br />
“At the same time, the promise of the civil rights remedy…society will not and cannot move forward.”<br />
<br />
Implementation of the VAWA Civil Rights Remedy is the only way to reveal the ongoing link between violence and equality. This move is also key to problematize ongoing feminist engagement with the state.<br />
Liz Schneider, 2000, Battered Women &amp; Feminist Lawmaking, p. 196-198<br />
“Recognition of the range of institutions…possibility of meaningful reform.”<br />
<br />
Section 13981’s civil litigation locates gendered violence within the spectrum of sexist discrimination and dramatically reductes the powers vested in the state the process of criminalization of domestic violence.<br />
Catherine MacKinnon, November 2000, Harvard Law Review, 114 Harvard L. Rev. 135<br />
“To be effective as well…value and restore survivors.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The move to a multi-faceted form of federalism is also an attempt to resist the essentialization of any level of governance. The resistance to institutional essentialization is a way to revolt against patriarchal gender relations.<br />
Judith Resnik, “Categorical Federalism: Jurisdiction, Gender, and the Globe,” Yale Law Journal, December 2001<br />
“Multi-faceted federalism refuses…transitory.”<br />
CONTINUES<br />
“A contemporary account…generative of human growth.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Extra topical – even if they claim to defend their plan they skirt discussion of its merits by arguing the benefits come from their advocacy outweigh<br />
<br />
Bad policy making – the aff subverts discussion of the merits of specific policies which negates our ability to compare the effects of the plan to the status quo. This ruins a critical function of this activity which is to test the desirability of the policy implementation<br />
<br />
Voting issue<br />
If we domenstrate the aff doesn’t meet the best interpretation of the topic they have failed to justify the resolution and should be rejected. This is the best way to preserve competitive equity by ensuring predictable ground for the negative<br />

The us v morrison is a vivid instance of categorical fism: it’s a way for the supreme court to naturalize anything which seems like a family or a crime issue into the exclusive property of state governance. The court’s extension of categorical federalism assumed this division to be natural, bipolar and exclusive<br />
Resnik 2001<br />
“categorical federalism: jurisdiction, gender and the globe” yale law journal; dec 2001; pp 619-680<br />
<br />
the problem with such neat allocations of power is that abjures the government from responsibility. The court both hides its own responsibility in buffering away violence as not “national enough”. The notion of categorical federalism is a way of hiding the way the courts have gendered family relations<br />

categorical federalism undermines the ability to hold actors politically accountable for their decisions. It is a form of institutional essentialization that undercomplicates the process of social change. It is a wy of deferring to legal concepts of jurisdiction instead of contesting patriarchal control<br />
