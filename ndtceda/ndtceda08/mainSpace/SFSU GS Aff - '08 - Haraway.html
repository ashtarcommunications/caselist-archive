<strong>Inherency</strong><br />
The Aliens Have Come<br />
Meyerson ’00 (George, <em>Donna Haraway and GM Foods</em> Pg. 9-12)<br />
<br />
<strong>Advantage One: The Trans</strong><br />
This is the world around us. Science speaks without question making it so that GM foods have infiltrated our food system without us knowing what we are eating or what is running through our bodies<br />
Haraway ’97 (Donna, <em>Modest Witness</em> Pg. 56-57)<br />
<br />
We must recognize the transformative potential of transgenic boarder crossing. Failing to recognize the history of racist and sexist discourses that are tied to these anti-GMO activists ultimately justifies a war against impurity.<br />
Haraway ’97 (Donna, <em>Modest Witness</em> Pg. 59-61)<br />
<br />
<strong>Advantage Two: Knowledge Production</strong><br />
Agriculture discussions are insulated by governments, big corporations and scientists who work collectively to decide what is best for policy.<br />
Engdahl ’07 (William F., <em>Seeds of Destruction</em> Pg. 15-18)<br />
<br />
This is the ultimate form of bio-power. The extermination of bodies are seen not as being legitimate forms of knowledge production destroying their situated knowledge.<br />
Haraway ’97 (Donna, <em>Modest Witness</em> Pg. 24-25)<br />
<br />
<u><strong>PLAN</strong></u><br />
Advocacy Statement:<br />
Felix and I defend the discussion of the resolution, which reads: Resolved: that the United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies, for biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar and/or wheat.<br />
We believe this is a productive form of critical education. Your ballot is a tool to affirm our methodological approach to insulated discourse around agriculture.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Solvency</strong><br />
Communication is the only real political action. The reading of the 1AC connotes values that breach the norms of understanding a world in which GMOs exist with their own agency and conversations about agriculture are insulated fragmenting the public. We disorient orders of power through breaking the boundaries of normative knowledge production.<br />
Brown ’95 (<em>States of Injury</em> Pg. 49-51, Professor at UC Santa Cruz)<br />
<br />
Public Participation solves objectification through a democratization of scientific discourse<br />
Backstrand '03 (Karin, <em>Civic Science for Sustainability</em>, Global Environmental Politics, via Project Muse, Quals: Research fellow on environment and sustainability at MIT)<br />
<br />
Situated knowledge avoids gross error and is the precursor to any solvency allowing for a greater knowledge production.<br />
Haraway '97 (Donna, <em>Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature</em> Pg. 198-199)
