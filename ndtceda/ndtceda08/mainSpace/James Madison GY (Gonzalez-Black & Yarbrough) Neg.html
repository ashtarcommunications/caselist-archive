Gender K<br />
The concept of liberal democracy and community relies on metaphysics of presence and identity that denies difference between subjects- it excludes the other and perpetuates racism and sexism.<br />
Young 90 (“ideal of community and politics of difference” feminism/postmodernism ed. Nichols)<br />
Universal truths create the other<br />
Steans 98 (Gender and International relations)<br />
Rejecting the rhetoric of the affirmative solves. Destabilizing engagement with dominant discourses creates the possibility of an inclusive politics that will give women a true voice.<br />
Kapur, 2002 (the tragedy of victimization rhetoric, Harvard Human Rights Journal, v. 15<br />

Case cards<br />
Pitting mother against fetal rights is a tactic rooted in racist slave practices that reinforces control of black women’s reproductive capabilities<br />
Roberts 97 “Killing the black body: race reproduction and meaning of life” p. 41<br />
Requiring a woman to carry a fetus appropriates her body to the state, ignoring the physical and psychological impacts of childbirth. These policies increase women’s dependency on the state that is oppressing them<br />
Ramsey 2006 (“restructuring the debate over fetal homicide laws” Ohio State Law Journal<br />
Anti abortion laws will put immense pressure on the public health system and will fail in stopping abortions<br />
Paltrow, 2006 “what the democrats should do”<br />

<strong>Research shows that even when women can scrape together funds for their abortion it comes at the cost of their daily living expenses.</strong><br />
<strong>Heather Boonstra and Adam Sonfield,</strong> April 2k<br />

“Studies have also found that women who are able to raise the money…done later in gestation”<br />

“Racism and sexism have been parallel…win the vote for women”<br />

<strong><u>T-Standing</u></strong><br />
<strong>A. The court can only grant standing when there’s a specific injury and not a generalized grievance</strong><br />
<strong>B. Violation—the aff does not specify who the particular litigant that they would use to overrule the previous case is</strong><br />
<strong>C. VI</strong><br />
<strong>1) Ground---no links off specific cases or process counterplans</strong><br />
<strong>2) Moving target---spike da’s and case turns</strong><br />
<strong>3) No Solvency---Failure to mention injury ignores the precedent established by the case</strong><br />
<strong>David M. Driesen, Law @ Syracuse,</strong> May <strong>2k4</strong><br />
(“Standing for Northing: The paradox of demanding concrete context for formalist adjudication” 89 Cornell L. Rev. 808.)<br />
“If injury silently shaped cases where it had no explicit influence, this would raise significant…Clinton rule out all line item vetoes”<br />
<strong><u>T—Overrule</u></strong><br />
<strong>Interpretation: Overrule must express a judgment on the same question of law and must be directly</strong> <strong>opposite of the original case</strong><br />
Black’s Law 1990<br />
“A judicial decision is said…authority as precedent”<br />
<strong>Courts haven’t resolved the question of when life begins</strong><br />
Hollowell, Phd. From Miami School of Medicine, 2k1<br />

<ol><li><strong>The focus on feminism in reproductive rights has overlooked the importance of racism in understanding what it means to have reproductive liberty</strong></li></ol>Dorthy Roberts, Law @ Northwestern, 1997<br />
(“Killing the Black Body: Race Reproduction and the Meaning of Life”) p.5<br />
“While this man felt that the civil rights…women really have”<br />
<ol><li><strong>Race must take center stage in reproductive policy to redefine boundaries making the definition of reproductive liberty inclusive to all women</strong></li></ol>Dorthy Roberts, Law @ Northwestern, 1997<br />
(“Killing the Black Body: Race Reproduction and the Meaning of Life”) p.311<br />
“Thus, I advocate that race take center stage…achieve reproductive justice”<br />
<strong>Alt: As an intellectual the critic must reject the seduction of racist portraits—to ignore the dangers of false representation reproduces authoritative lies</strong><br />
Jenny Edkins, Professor @ Wales and Manchester, 1999<br />
(<u>Sovereignty and Subjectivity</u> p. 17)<br />
“We have tried to show in this introductory chapter…this volume challenges”<br />
<strong>The constitutional right to an abortion is a negative right not extended to minorities, causing a net-increase in state power over minority bodies</strong><br />
Dorthy Roberts, Law @ Northwestern, 1997<br />
(“Killing the Black Body: Race Reproduction and the Meaning of Life”) p.229-230<br />
“Poor women’s inadequate access to reproductive health services is bolstered…receiving government assistance”<br />
<strong>A vision of reproductive liberty that does not begin with an understanding of race inequality is doomed to solidify the structural barriers that deny many individuals basic human rights</strong><br />
Dorthy Roberts, Law @ Northwestern, 1997<br />
(“Killing the Black Body: Race Reproduction and the Meaning of Life”) p.311-312<br />
“Liberals are right in that protecting procreative liberty…improves women’s health”<br />

Dorthy Roberts, Law @ Northwestern, 1997<br />
(“Killing the Black Body: Race Reproduction and the Meaning of Life”) p.102-103<br />
“This is a minority position among those who oppose birth control as a form of racial domination…biological justification of white supremacy”<br />
<br />
<strong>Mainstream reproductive policy may footnote stories from minority women but we need to refocus rights talk around black women’s stories because the policies will look fundamentally different from a minority perspective</strong><br />
Dorthy Roberts, Law @ Northwestern, 1997<br />
(“Killing the Black Body: Race Reproduction and the Meaning of Life”) p.6<br />
“Finally, in light of the first two themes, we need to….not individual choice”<br />
