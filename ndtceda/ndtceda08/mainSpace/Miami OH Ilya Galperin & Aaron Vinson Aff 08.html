Miami GV Lebanon Outline Post-Augustana<br />
<br />
Plan: The United States federal government should offer the central government of Lebanon all necessary economic assistance for postwar reconstruction in south Lebanon contingent on the expulsion of Hezbollah from the ruling coalition until Hezbollah agrees to disarm.<br />
<br />
Contention One: Inherency<br />
<br />
While the US has promised reconstruction aid it has gone to NGO’s instead of the government, allowing Hezbollah to win over the public and use south Lebanon to launch attacks while the aid we do give goes to military projects in the north<br />

<br />
The US effort to bolster…those services.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now is vital to fund Lebanonese Reconstruction – otherwise Hezbollah will be unstoppable and the US will be unable to stop Iran’s growing hegemony and nuclearization<br />

<br />
The second major change according…I answered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Two: Harms<br />
<br />
Advantage One is Hezbollah<br />
<br />
First note that the central government’s failure to lead reconstruction in south Lebanon is the single greatest factor that allows Hezbollah to exist<br />

<br />
If good governance and enhancing…lack of unity<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, US inaction and unpopularity has increased Hezbollah’s influence and their ability to push for more political power which risks unseating Siniora<br />

<br />
Joshua Landis, an expert…Syria’s too powerful right now.<br />

And a new Hezbollah conflict risks total Middle East war and closure of the Suez Canal<br />

<br />
Here is one possible course of events…everyone else for decades.<br />
<br />
<br />
A new Israeli-Hezbollah war will include full-blown missile strikes against Tel Aviv and Israel will respond with nuclear weapons at Hezbollah and their allies<br />
<br />

<br />
And closure of the Suez Canal shuts down the world economy<br />

Fifty years after its nationalization…privatise it any time soon.<br />

<br />
“History bears out that…at least for many decades.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage Two is Hegemony<br />
<br />
First, failing to help Lebanon pissed off American Allies, damaged global US perception, and increased regional anti-Americanism – only by providing reconstruction assistance to the central government can we regain lost leadership<br />

<br />
As Israelis and Arabs…in the Middle East.<br />
<br />
<br />
US failure to disarm Hezbollah after the 2006 war has eroded US influence in Lebanon, in the region, and globally putting US hegemony at serious risk<br />

<br />
Along with the apparent shift on…has begun.<br />
<br />
<br />
The world is waiting for the US to accept responsibility and fund reconstruction in Lebanon. Failure to do so results in counterbalancing alliances that risk great power conflict and nuclear war<br />

Contention Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
Conditioning future reconstruction aid on the expulsion of Hezbollah from politics until they disarm will give the central government the political cover to crack down on Hezbollah<br />

Even many members of…ethnic commu nities in Lebanon.” [2]<br />

Hezbollah will disarm and moderate if its base evaporates and it has a force choice over political legitimacy because it knows it cannot keep its weapons forever<br />
