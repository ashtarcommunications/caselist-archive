Nuclear terrorism would not cause extinction<br />

Nuclear weapons clearly deserve the….. threaten the end of civilization<br />

High food prices spur investment in better production practices. The world bank estimates about poverty are wrong. There will be a massive reduction in the amount of poverty in a world with high food prices<br />
Homi Kharas, Senior Fellow, Global economy and development, July 29 2k8 “Rising Food Prices- An Upside?”, The Brookings Institute<br />
The good news is that higher food prices are…..from today’s high food prices<br />

T<br />
A. Agricultural support is tariffs export subsidies and domestic subsidies<br />
Park and Jensen<br />
B. Plan no longer requires compliance with biofuels mandates in general which is a larger set of politices than biofuel related ag support<br />
C. This is a voting issue<br />
1. Extra t- proves the resolution alone is insufficient<br />
2. Fairness- allowing non topical parts of aff plans steals our cp ground and gives them unpredictable advantages<br />
3. 2AC is too late to clarify or sever our 1nc is already irreparably skewed, allowing this would encourage sandbagging<br />

Gendertivity K<br />
Ag policymaking ignores gender as a salient component of analysis<br />
Garcia 06 (Zoraida, FAO Gender and Population Division, “Agriculture, trade negotiations and gender”, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0493e.pdf" rel="nofollow">ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0493e.pdf</a>)<br />
Multiple economic, social and political initiatives….. shocks and market reforms.<br />
<br />
The 1ac works within the patriarchal state system without questioning its gendered nature, reconstituting the structural violence hallmark of this system<br />
Prof Peterson 92 (V. Spike, pol sci @ UAZ, Gendered States, ed Peterson)<br />
<br />
Quite simply, and with deadly monotony……… we identify with --- shape political possibilities.<br />
<br />
The impact turns the case- failure to integrate gendered analysis into the debate makes hyper masculine destruction inevitable<br />
<br />
Marysia Zelwski and Jane Parpart 98 ( The ‘Man’ Question in International Relations, Westview Press, Boulder, p 86<br />
<br />
Whereas we think it important…….. signs of imminent catastrophe<br />
<br />
The Alternative is to vote negative; Rethinking the gendered nature of policymaking opens space for radical change<br />
Peterson and Runyan, professor of political science at the University of Arizon and professor of Women’s studies at Wright State University, 1999 (V.Spike and Anne, Global Gender Issues 2 edition p 236-237<br />

THE DEMON ENGINE<br />
<br />
The modern agricultural system is bankrupt—mechanized production and slavery to the notion of “progress” have lead to all sorts of ills, from the destruction of the biosphere to the emptying out of meaning from our lives—liberation is impossible without the dissolution of agriculture itself!<br />
<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/%7Ekaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
“Food has been one of our most direct contacts with the natural<br />
environment … is impossible without its dissolution.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The modern American agricultural system is particularly indefensible—this is the same industry that the affirmative attempts to “correct”—this is in fact impossible, because the harms of the status quo are rooted in something much deeper than subsidies, but the technological imperative of civilization itself<br />
<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/%7Ekaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
“Today the organic, what is left of it, is fully mechanized … accelerating the crime against nature.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Civilization only exists because we have come to believe in its inevitability—this is tragic because civilization was a mistake. It is bound to collapse, and our critique is necessary to begin readapting to the way that humans lived for 99% of their existence, otherwise we can just be ignorant of the coming universal biological holocaust<br />
<br />
Heinberg 1995 (Richard, “The Primitivist Critique of Civilization, presented at the 24th annual meeting of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm</a>)<br />
“Isn't civilization simply the inevitable expression of the evolutionary urge … think of this process as &quot;getting back on track.&quot;”<br />
<br />
There is no universal social model for primitivism—we can only hope to build momentum towards the end of civilization, because every manifestation of civilization is a usurpation of freedom!<br />
<br />
Willful Disobedience 2005 (Vol 3, No 3, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/destroycivilization.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/destroycivilization.htm</a>)<br />
To put it another way, what all civilized societies have in common … journey into the unknown that is freedom.”<br />
<br />
ANTI CAPITAL KRITIK<br />
<br />
Capitlist growth is the root of the evnrionmental crisis – it necessitates widespread sacrifice of ecology to the ever-rpesent drive toward accumulation and cannot be reformed<br />
Kovel, 2002 (The enemy of nature: the end of capitalism or the end of the world?, p. 82)<br />
<br />
Capitalism bestrides the world because … as the prospect may be.<br />
Economic growth gollapse the biosphere<br />
Booth, 1998 (The Environmental Consequences of Grwoth, p. 10-11)<br />
<br />
With its continuous creation … the human species.<br />
Solving food crises only delays the rev<br />
Adewale 8 (Peluola, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://socialistworld.nt/eng/2008/04/28wolrda.html" rel="nofollow">http://socialistworld.nt/eng/2008/04/28wolrda.html</a>)<br />
A Guinean told IRIN...of global capitalism.<br />
<br />
Cap = zp of the hc<br />
Dillon, 99 Political Theory<br />
“Otherness is born(e) within the self … constitutive of the human way of being.”<br />
<br />
The drive for hegemonic imperialism is inevitable according to the logic of capitalism--only the alternative avoids multiple scenarios for inevitable extinction.<br />
Foster 2005 (John Bellamy, Monthly Review, September, Vol 57, Iss 4, &quot;Naked Imperialism&quot;)<br />
From the longer view...the new naked imperialism.<br />
<br />
Out alternative is to not do the aff--capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital<br />
Herod '04 (James, Getting Free, 4th Edition, January<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/indes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Strate/GetFre/indes.htm</a> GAL)<br />
It is time to...of their social world.<br />
<br />
<br />
REGARDLESS OF OUR ALTERNATIVES SOLVENCY, WE HAVE AN ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO GET OVER CAPITALISM<br />
MARSH 95<br />
(JAMES L, CRITIQUE, ACTION, AND LIBERATION P. 334-335)<br />
The basic question concerning the possibility of socialism … The prevailing rationality is profoundly irrational.12<br />
<br />
Try or die – capitalism necessitates extinction<br />
Marko 2003 (May 14, Indymedia UK, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://www2.indymedia.org.uk" rel="nofollow">https://www2.indymedia.org.uk</a> /en/.2003.05/68173.html)<br />
Bertrand Russell throughout his … accidental nuclear war.<br />
<br />
Utilitaranism means you vote neg – structurally impossible to achieve greatest happiness for the greatest number under capitalism<br />
Meszaros 95 (Beyond Capital, www.marxists.org/archive /meszaros/works/beyond-capital /ch03-2.htm<br />
A great deal has been written about the so-called ‘naturalistic fallacy’ … in the long run’.
