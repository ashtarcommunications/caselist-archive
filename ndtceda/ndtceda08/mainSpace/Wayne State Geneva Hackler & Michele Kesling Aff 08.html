 IN 2001, WE BEGAN A MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN AFGHANISTAN WITH THE EXPRESSED INTENT OF OVERTHROWING THE TALIBAN REGIME, THE LIBERATION OF WOMEN SERVED AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR OUR INTERVENTION. SOON AFTER, WE CLAIMED VICTORY AND DECLARED FREEDOM FOR THE WOMEN OF AFGHANISTAN. OUR ANNOUNCEMENT CAME TOO SOON HOWEVER. THE OPRESSION AND DEGRADATION OF WOMEN CONTINUES UNDER THE NORTHERN ALLIANCE. AS WE DETAIL IN…<br />
<br />
CONTENTION 1: THE SITUATION<br />
<br />
THE CURRENT US APPROACH IN AFGHANISTAN LACKS A LONG-TERM FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL COMMITMENT- THIS STRATEGY WILL INEVITABLY BREAK DOWN AND RESULT IN WIDESPREAD INSTABILITY<br />

CURRENT RECONSTRUCTION FAILS TO INCLUDE WOMEN. INSTEAD THEY ARE TOKENS USED AS RHETORICAL FIGURES TO JUSTIFY US STYLE INTERVENTION.<br />

ADVANTAGE 1: SYSTEMIC VIOLENCE<br />
<br />
As war has torn AFghansitan apart in an endless cycle of violence, 12 million women suffer the worse of the consequences. They livein abject poverty and are subject oabuse, violence and prostitution<br />
<br />

ADVANTAGE 2: VICTIMHOOD<br />
<br />
WOMEN ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE POLITICAL. USED BY THE US AS OBJECTS TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS, AFGHAN WOMEN WERE ABANDONED TO NEW FORMS OF OPPRESSION<br />

Back in 1935, before… aims had been achieved”<br />
<br />
THIS NARRATIVE OF VICTIMHOOD UNDERWRITES PERPETUAL VICTIMHOOD. CURRENT AND FUTURE INTERVENTIONS ARE MOBLIZED AROUND THE US AS A NEUTRAL ACTOR AND AFGHAN WOMEN AS VICTIMS. THIS CREATES WOMEN AS NOTHING OTHER THEN BARE LIFE.<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE 3: PATRIARCHY<br />
<br />
CURRENT APPROACH TO RECONSTRUCTION LOCKS IN GENDER ROLES THAT SUSTAIN PATRIARCHAL DOMINATION<br />

<br />
“Economics as a vehicle… and their families desire.”<br />
THIS PATRIARCHAL DOMINATION IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF VIOLENCE AND WILL LEAD TO EXTINCTION. ONLY BY EXPOSING THESE EXCLUSION AND GENDERED STRUCTURING OF SOCIETIES CAN WE SOLVE.<br />
<br />

<br />
“The notion of patriarchy… regional, national, and global contexts.”<br />
<br />
THUS WE OFFER THE FOLLOWING PLAN-<br />
<br />
THROUGH ALL NECESSARY MEANS THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNEMTN SHOULD INCREASE ITS CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN INCLUDING AN OFFER FOR A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN ASSISTANCE BY GUARANTEEING FUNDING AS NEEDED FOR RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THROUGH THE AFGHAN RECONSTRUCTION TRUST FUND AND EXPANDED OVERSIGHT AND QUALITY CONTROL OF US CONTRACTORS ON THE CONDITION THAT THE GOVERNEMTN FUND AND INCLUDE THE REVOLUTIONARY ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN OF AFGHANISTAN IN RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION 2: THE SOLUTION<br />
<br />
OUR ROLE IS NOT TO INTERVENE AND PICK SIDES- ONLY INCLUDING WOMEN IN THE RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS IN AFGHANISTAN WILL ALLOW THEM TO CREATE REAL CHANGE FOR THEMSELVES<br />

Contention 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
The Bush administration will not seriously pursue a comprehensive deal with Iran<br />

Contention 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
A grand bargain would solve, but must include the following components:<br />

<br />
Iran will agree—they want a comprehensive bargain and have accepted the El Baradei plan. The alternative is extinction.<br />

Advantage 1: US Attack<br />
<br />
The US will attack Iran before Bush leaves office<br />

<br />
An attack on Iran means at least 4 scenarios for destruction: global depression, massive terrorism, Iraqi chaos, and Israeli nuclear escalation<br />
Hedges, 2006<br />
Chris Hedges, former Middle East bureau chief for The New York Times, Bush’s Nuclear Apocalypse, October 9, 2006 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/200601009_bushs_nuclear_apocalypse/" rel="nofollow">http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/200601009_bushs_nuclear_apocalypse/</a><br />
<br />
Each of these scenarios risks global conflict and extinction.<br />
First, global depression risks global nuclear war<br />
Walter Mead, fellow, Council on Foreign Relations, New Perspectives Quarterly, Summer 1992, p. 28.<br />
<br />
Second, massive terrorist attacks risk extinction<br />

<br />
Third, an escalation of the Iraqi conflict risks nuclear miscalculation with Russia and global nuclear war<br />
