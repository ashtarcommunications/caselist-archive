The facts finally broke into the mainstream with Jimmy Carter's book, 'Palestine: Peace not Apartheid,' which elicited a torrent of abuse and desperate efforts to discredit it.<br />
While now in a position to crush Gaza, Israel can also proceed, with US backing, to implement its plans in the West Bank, expecting to have the tacit cooperation of Fatah leaders who will be rewarded for their capitulation. Among other steps, Israel began to release the funds - estimated at $600 million - that it had illegally frozen in reaction to the January 2006 election.  </span></span><br />

What seems like our invasive representation of their interests is in fact nothing but the principle of universal good speaking for them but through us. The possibilities ruled out are: that in their context, democracy could lead them into a different macropolitical world; that democracy could result in the formation of a hybrid and multivoiced sovereignty that could well seem wrong and sound cacophonous to us; and that democracy could form part of a different articulation of populist sovereignty. Years ago, I remember a group of journalists asking Yasser Arafat how anyone could believe in something called a Palestinian blueprint, when Palestine had so many different spokes- persons. His answer was that the contestation among the different perspectives was nothing but democracy at work. It was precisely because Pales- tine was not already a nation that the different voices were being read as divisive and pathological, whereas postnational dissonances and discords would automatically be read as signs of a flourishing national democracy.</span></span><span style="font-size: 8pt"> </span><span style="font-size: 16pt"> </span><br />

Zionism was not entirely convinced that its colonial settler project would be sufficient to transform Jews into Europeans. Its higher objective was that Jews would be normalized only when they have become European anti-Semites, when they began to view diaspora Jewishness through the eyes of anti-Semitism. Examples of this abound. In line with Zionism's contempt for the Jewish diaspora, as well as for Jewish victims of the holocaust as passive weaklings, is the popular modern Hebrew term for &quot;sissy&quot;: the word &quot;sabon&quot; or soap. The term appeared in the wake of World War II when stories circulated about Jews being turned into soap by the Nazis.<span style="color: black; text-decoration: none"><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v059/59.1massad.html#FOOT61" rel="nofollow">61</a></span> Even holocaust survivors were seen through the spectacles of anti-Semitism.

<span class="reduce2"><span style="font-size: 5pt">There are ecologists who would frankly opt for the future in these dilemmas. Their commitment is to the long-term, and they are willing to accept the death of many contemporaries to make a better future possible, or as they would say, to make any future possible. Perhaps their policy might be justified in the language of general utilitarianism as serving the greatest good for the greatest number, where the greatest number obviously means future generations, who in the aggregate will infinitely outnumber us, the living. But of course such ecologists would not accept their own death to bring about this future, and that is the rub. The intended victims are the poor and powerless, already the wretched of the earth—and they are not interested in dying miserably so that future unknowns may live happily. Asian, African, and Latin-American participants in the international and ecumenical study conferences quite understandably showed considerable hesitation in accepting the idea of future obligation when they saw the concept being used against the lives of their own countrymen. </span></span><br />

THE CONTENTION THAT SOMETHING HAUNTING FROM THE OUTSIDE—I.E. AMERICAN PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST—IS THE CAUSE OF VIOLENCE IS FLAWED. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THE DEFERRED, STRUCTURAL CHARACTER OF THE ANTAGONISM.<br />
