At the end of the millennium…. use of nuclear weapons. <br />
<br />
Eroding this taboo sets a dangerous precedent that ensures the use of strategic nuclear weapons <br />

At a fundamental level… own commitments. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Geneva Conventions prevent the development and use of chemical and biological weapons. <br />
GCSP, 5 <br />
[Geneva Centre for Security Policy, “Biological and Chemical Weapons Seminar,” June 2005, &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.gcsp.ch/e/meetings/Security_Challenges/WMD/Meeting_Conf/2005/BC%20Weapons%20Seminar/summary.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gcsp.ch/e/meetings/Security_Challenges/WMD/Meeting_Conf/2005/BC%20Weapons%20Seminar/summary.htm</a>&gt;] <br />

<br />
<br />
Bioweapons use risks extinction – nuclear war can’t compare <br />
Steinbruner 98 – Senior Fellow at Brookings Institution <br />
[John D., “Biological weapons: A plague upon all houses,” Foreign Policy, Dec 22, LN] <br />
More than 70 years… not necessarily its outer limit.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus, the plan: <br />
The United States Federal Government should offer the government of Afghanistan a guarantee that it will cease use of weapons containing depleted uranium in Afghanistan and that it will disclose the depleted uranium content of weapon systems used in Afghanistan. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contention Six: Solvency <br />
<br />
Banning DU use issential to address its harmful effects. And making full disclosure of DU weapons used in Afghanistan will enable effective environmental remediatin to occur. <br />
