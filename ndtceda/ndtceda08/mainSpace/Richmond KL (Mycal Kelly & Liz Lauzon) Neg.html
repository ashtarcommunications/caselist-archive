Regime change is the same as not regime change. It gives recognition to the fact that regime change was once a possibility.<br />
Burke in 2007<br />
Beware of the rhetoric of a hand out. The offer of the aff is dangerous.<br />
Mistuk in 2007<br />
Banning regime change is a joke. There is no difference between policy of regime change and non regime change.<br />
Campbell 2003.<br />
Vote negative on presumption.<br />
Leveritt 2005.<br />
Banning regime change reifies state policy regime. Reject the aff in the name of radical democracy.<br />
(Churchill or Kurkle)? 2007<br />
Foucault is enough to turn case - we will pursue regime change elsewhere and in the same location under a different label. Aff is nothing but official rhetoric.<br />
Gewitt, 2003.<br />

Der Derian—Securitization<br />
Fear and Love alternative (same cites as their affirmative case)<br />
<br />
<br />
Gifting Kritik—the affirmative is conditional hospitality—a gift that takes the method of gifting that should be rejected—Derrida 03 (“Philosophy in a time of terror: Dialogues w/ Jurgen Habermas &amp; Jacques Derrida) <br />
<br />
Gift is a forced bargain, masked in benevolence and reconstructs dominance/subordination binary <br />
<br />
Alternative is unconditional hospitality—giving w/o expectations of receiving is the only way to escape the aff’s double bind to solve the case <br />
<br />
