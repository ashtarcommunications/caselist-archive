THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN A GUARANTEE THAT THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES FROM THE UNITED STATES AIR STRIKES IN AFGHANISTAN. THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD COORDINATE WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN ON OPERATIONS THAT MAY PRODUCE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.<br />
<br />
Contention One: The Politics of Risk<br />
The Conduct of the U.S. Bombing Campign in afghanistan renders the bodies of Afghani civilians unworthy of moral consideration. U.S. planners make the political choice to hide the stories, perspectives, and importance of civilians with the rhetoric of mistakes and necessity.<br />
Marc Herold, economics and women’s studies @ New Hampshire, 2002<br />
[“US Bombing and Afgan Civilian Deaths: The Official Neglect of ‘Unworthy’ Bodies” International Journal of Urban and Regional Research 26.3 p629-633]<br />
“On 13 February, Peshawar’s daily newspaper, The Frontier Post, got it more right than all the US media war pundits...Chechan victims of Russian atrocities, which depicted the Rusian war on Chechnya as seen through he drawings of children in Chechnya.”<br />
<br />
US Bombing tactics in Afghanistan systematically massacre civilians. we must reject an immoral strategy that weighs US lives a thousand times more important than Afghanis.<br />
Martin Shaw, IR @ Sussex, 2002<br />
[“Risk Transfer Militarism, Small Massacres and the Historic Legitimacy of War” International Relations 16(3) 349-355]<br />
“The risk of repeated small massacres of civilians is an understood feature of the way the West fights its wars...We could conclude that even if the aims of the ‘war on terrorism’ are just, its methods are insufficiently so.”<br />
<br />
Simple probability times magnitude risk calculus erases afghani civilians. we must confront the hidden politics of risk that condemns civilians to massacre for the sake of political expediency.<br />
Martin Shaw, 2005 [The New Western Way of War, 96-97]<br />
“The roles that soldier- and even civilian-protection play in the new Western way of war amount therefore to... Looking at global society a a risk society, it is dificult not ot be impressed chiefly by gross inequalities of life-risks, and it is sobering to recognize these as artefacts of power.”<br />
<br />
A utilitarian paradigm encourages the use of fantastic scenarios to justify the immorality of bombing.<br />
Brian Orend, Ethics @ Waterloo, 2000<br />
[Michael Walzer on War and Justice, 83-85]<br />
“This abstraction from reality is graphically revealed in Brandt’s general principle, applicable to all types of war...Can Walzer offer an account which improves on each of these three alternatives to his brand of just war theory?”<br />
<br />
Contention TWO: Engendering Security.<br />
Our existing narrative of the Afghanistan war relies on masculinized security discourse. The need to appear tough and masculine means suppresing the horrors of war under the language of cold rational precision.<br />
Eric Blanchard, Grad Student USC politics and IR, 2003<br />
[“Gender, International Relations, and the Development of Feminist Security Theory” Signs 28(4)]<br />
“Jean Bethke Elshtain’s rich blend of political theory, personal narrative, and history...Cohn suggests that the task ahead is a revaluation of gender discourse (1993).”<br />
<br />
Masculinized security privileges crisis over the everyday suffering of civilians. Our moral framework should prioritize justice for marginalized civilians over traditional security issues.<br />
Laura Sjoberg, poli sci @ Duke, 2006<br />
[Gender, Justice, and Wars in Iraq: A feminist reformulation of Just War Theory, pp51-53]<br />
“It is appropriate to theorize security on battlefields, airplanes, and tankers... the everyday life impacts of global political conflicts; this isolation helps obscure those impacts.”<br />
<br />
Our plan shifts from rationalized massacre to empathetic war-fighting. Prioritizing reductions in civilian casualties empathizes with those abstracted away by masculinized strategic discourse.<br />
Laura Sjoberg, 2006<br />
[“Gender Realities of the Immunity Principle: Why Gender Analysis Needs Feminism, International Studies Quarterly 50(4)]<br />
“The gendered just war narrative is about moral superiority through heroic protection...Empathetic war-fighting is an ethical and practical improvement for the noncombatant immunity principle.”<br />
<br />
The plan holds political leadership to a higher standard of due care for Afghani civilians. A change in bombing tactics can reverse our existing immoral risk calculus.<br />
Nicholas Wheeler, senior Lecturer of IR @ Aberystwyth last modified in June 2007<br />
[“Protecting Afghan Civilians from the Hell of War” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/wheeler.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ssrc.org/sept11/essays/wheeler.htm</a>]<br />
“An alternative answers to this moral dilemma is to accept the necessity of fighting just wars... an important share of responsibility for placing Afghan civilians in the hell that is war.”<br />

2A A2 CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT T<br />

Crocker politically biased<br />

<br />
Constructive Engagement – A diplomatic phrase for maintaining political and economic ties with regimes with which a nation has many disagreements in the hope that the ties will gradually lead to changes in the regime’s objectionable policies and practices<br />
<br />
Conditioning should be negative ground – otherwise there is no answer to the add conditions counterplan – Give neg condtion CPS, appeasement, and since we maintain ties any diad to quid pro quo also links to unconditional carrots – rogues topic proves – eliinating sanctions sill gives the neg ground<br />
<br />
No right to specific ground anyway<br />
<br />
Constructive engagement is unconditional<br />
Robert I Rotberg 1986 “Constructive Engagement: United States Foreign Policy Towards Africa.” P.132-3<br />
To engage South Africa constructively…not positive performances.<br />
<br />
They cause aff shiftiness – bidirectionality argument<br />

The criticism is a charecticture of IR scholarship and empties the Middle East of meaning outside the West, resulting in self-centeredness instead of empathy<br />

Ken Booth, 2005, Critical Security Studies and World Politics, p. 22<br />
The best starting point….the merely biological.<br />
<br />
Case is prior. Evaluating the effect of the plan versus the alternative for reducing violence is more important than establishing philosophical truth and framework. There’s never a deficit of theory-actions are the only way to test abstraction.<br />

McCarthy finds it ironic that…view them as indispensable.<br />

Immanent kritik more effective than their alternative. Realistic political options are better than their imaginary Archimedean position<br />

Our scenario evaluations are crucial for ethically responsible politics. Purely theoretical kritik is insufficient-we need as if stories to generate concrete counter-practices.<br />

Saul Newman, fall, 2000, universalism/particularism, new formations, 104-105<br />
Moreover the focus of a poststructural critique…visage of humanism.<br />

Exposing ideology only serves to prop it up. Traversing the fantasy is nothing but another fantasy.<br />
