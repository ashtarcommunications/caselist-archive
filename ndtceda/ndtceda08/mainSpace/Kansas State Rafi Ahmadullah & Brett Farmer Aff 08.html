The 1AC is a puppet show, we say that a state of war is impending and we should respond whimsically.<br />

Satirical cartoon about war on terror, war in Iraq, and policy in Afghanistan from www.mnftiu.cc<br />
<br />
The cartoon occasionally cites news reports:<br />
1. Iraq = 3700 deaths, Washington Post, 11/20/06<br />
2. US operations not working in Iraq, NYT 4/29/07<br />
3. Status Quo in Afghanistan is failing, NYT 11/7/05<br />
Ends with Bush quotes “you’re either with us or against us” with the banner “mission accomplished”<br />
<br />
<br />
CX: what’s your advocacy: war policy in Afghanistan is totally fucking on and its fucking people up; we won’t defend policy implications<br />
<br />
If you win, what is your advocacy; does it have implications other than reading a cartoon off of a screen? The way we talk about the world and wars “over there” after Sept 11th, is like “totally fucked” to use language from the comic. We are “fucked” and language is totally is fucked, and fuck as well, and the war is totally fuckin’ on because it rocks!<br />
<br />
How do you solve: we don’t…you can’t. Our interrogation is more important than trying to “solve.”<br />
<br />
How is language “fucked”: its been fucked for a long time, but we argue that in the post Sept 11 context, the way we describe the good Muslims from the bad brown Muslims is fucked.<br />
<br />
How do you reclaim language: the mockery points out the vacuous nature of language, like operation enduring freedom, and forces us to question the static nature of language and how it is fucked. We don’t need to change the way we think; the goal is just to expose the fracture, to make sense of the topic. We show that the language used by the elites is doublespeak. We expose the nature of this crack. It is so ridiculous what we let our leaders get away with. We say fuck that and make fun of it.
