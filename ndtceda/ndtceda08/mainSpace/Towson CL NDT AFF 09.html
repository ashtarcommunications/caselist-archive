Q: Your Shaw card says traditional policy debate. I am confused about how your advocacy will affect broader policy debate?<br />
A: You’ll hear at the banquet how we change policy analysis.<br />
Q: If we allow critical race pedagogy, will they go on to policy?<br />
A: Yes.<br />
Q: why should we vote for you?<br />
A: Because we have a pedagogical framework, we isolate harms, and we attempt to solve these harms.<br />
Q: Do you claim all four reasons for your framework?<br />
A: We don’t kick out of them.<br />
Q: Why are the rules bad?<br />
A: Because the traditional policy makers made the rule. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Case:</strong><br />
CRP K’s the fairness, brightline. That epistemology is the same which allows white supremacy. Rodriguez. Read the round on who has best challenges.<br />
Their interp is flawed: we shouldn’t talk to government. Our critical reflexivity.<br />
We use the framework: we are a better one because.<br />
They camouflage the whiteness.<br />
Racial cover and comfort – empty superficial ways to cope with deeds.<br />
Their example of people who made it.<br />
They don’t solve Systemic harms of poverty.<br />
Shaw k’s the switch-side debate because it leads to prevailing power forces to maintain their authority.<br />
That type of agency does not address who we are.<br />
<strong>Framework</strong><br />
Group fairness theory: Education is before the round.<br />
Instances of how debate change<br />
Basketball – jumpshots and thress pointers weren’t accepted now they are. We shouldn’t commodify into a system that has set rules.<br />
Giroux evidence says we need to look at debate about power relations.<br />
Critical reflexivity is a way to look at both sides of the debate.<br />
Discussion outside the debate round doesn’t change – Lousiville focus disad. They talked about topic and the mechanism of debate. Those racial conversation won’t happen effectively. These ivory tower schools that benefit from traditional debate.<br />
Decreased funding happening now.<br />
The disengagement causes decrease in funding.<br />
We need to have a specific pedagogy that people can work within .<br />
They don’t allow us to deal with white supremacy.<br />
Their framework is in direct competition with eachother: With them you allow the squo to be masked. With us it doesn’t happen. </span><br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Overview:<br />
The debate is what political framing allows us to understand oppression. Their form of CRP would disagree that our relationship through USFG. Cultural hegemony is allowed to happen with dominant people in class and society.<br />
The way we engage the topic and relate in this debate. We can talk about the resolution in the way that ag subsidies affect society. But not through USFG.<br />
PICS – proves that there is a solvency for what we do pedagogically. Oftentimes when people go for this argument which proves that people recognize the importance of the argument.<br />
Disconnected Narrative – Their framework positions debate. Their evidence is what we’re critiquing is the dominant discourse we are critiquing.<br />
Resolution As Starting Point: Overlimiting for us.<br />
Switch side debate argument: Tradeoff disad. If you force affirmative to tie with plan, people will attack the policy aspect.<br />
The type of research is better, but the requirement for social justice is something that not only. Giroux evidence talks about importance for us.<br />
They concede McGee evidence – actually have affect. CP and K’s were not always around but by introducing them into the activity they succeeded. They have no examples of how change outside the round changed debate.<br />
White supremacy – none of their evidence talks about the necessity of those who are oppressed, which means we have a methodology. The way we are situated is key. Our impact is not just the relationship to the USFG but also how we intereact within those pedagogical paradigms. </span><br />

<span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><u>Capitalism</u></strong><br />
Permutation solves best. It’s about how white supremacy orders. Rodriguez evidence talks about how everything is social political and economic.<br />
They don’t have a method or alternative that is real. How do you tell a single black mother not to go to work?<br />
Identity is a prerequisite – it shapes how we see reality.<br />
Even if it is a root cause it does not assume the status quo.<br />
Universal struggles is exactly what Rodriguez is criticizing.<br />
Cannot change institutional pedagogical practices.<br />
We are controlling the culture argument.<br />
Identity is a part of culture and Whiteness will not be a part of their alternative.<br />
Sullivan evidence – Whites need to be accountable and Blacks should use that culture to do it.<br />
<strong><u>Framework</u></strong><br />
Excludes debate about debate. Rodriguez evidence.<br />
A permutation isn’t radical enough.<br />
Visualizing and universality is used by white people to maintain whiteness. They just want to talk about nuclear war, economic collapse, etc.<br />
Material priviledge allows for that type of exploitation. Subsidies was part of that and we are a prerequisite to break it all down.<br />
Shaw is talking about technocrats and policy makers. It links to their framework.<br />
If they want to leave and embrace whiteness then they deserve to leave.<br />
Big schools are the status quo. They don’t debate the topic.<br />
Spanos is qualified and right. Resource disparities hurt people of color.</span><br />

 <br />
<span style="font-family: Calibri;">When the elites make the rules they control debate/life. Their framework is done to maintain the dominant order, the status quo, the bad pedagogical practices. Then, whiteness is allowed to fill in.<br />
Only our framework that challenges that practice can solve.</span><br />

Townson 1AC is the same as normal. They said it was on the wiki.<br />
Townson’s 2AC had two cards in it.<br />
Wise ’06 “Paleness as Pathology: The Future of Racism and Antiracism in<br />
<br />
America”.<br />
White Supremacy at the root of war and the eco-crisis.<br />
Bell Hooks ’96. “Killing Rage: Ending Racism”.<br />
Perm is a commodification of blackness that expands subtle white supremacy.
