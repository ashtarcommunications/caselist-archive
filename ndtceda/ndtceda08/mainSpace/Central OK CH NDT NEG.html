<span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>Round 8 – Dartmouth AH Aff vs UCO CH Neg</strong></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Judges: Lundeen, Congdon, Jordan </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1NC: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Desire K</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong><u>Neg Cites:</u></strong></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Desire is an active force rather than..a reactiver response to unfulfilled need. Desire produces real connections, investments and intensive states within and between bodies..produces intensities and the consumption of intensities, wherever and in whatever form these may be found, subjectivity is an effect of this process. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Patton 00</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The 1ac is an expression of desire—the world which they posit is both objective and real..This is precisely the problem—in the very act of speaking the 2ac they have brought that world into existence—they have plugged themselves into a social word which is not revolutionary but a continuation of the same, Deleuze and Guattari explain: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(D and G 1983, 165-166</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The ideology of the aff or the belief of what their plan “ought to be” is irrelevant because they are merely preconscious investments or thoughts that can come to be known through a subject, which is already a repression of desire. D&amp;G </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The unconscious investment…fucked by the socius</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">(347)</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">look at the horrors that the 1ac exposes us to—why do we desire a world where this is possible..they desire it because they get off to it..</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Deleuze and Guattari further indicts the affirmative for being just another capitalist axiom—let us hold off on impact turns just yet, Capitalism is both productive and destructive –it is schizophrenic which creates a site of permanent revolution as it deteritorializes reality : </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is why the politics of the affirmative fail because while tending to state politics which d and g would call the molar level, they ignore the molecular level (intrapersonal connections) that are giving rise to micro fascism </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Martin Marinos argues that: </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Microfascisms can…of pure destruction </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This group fantasy is informed by the molecular levels of fascism that produces pure destruction. All benign yet all violent—</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">D&amp;G 87</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Nazi’s were…of pure destruction </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is indicative of the reading of the 1ac—they demonstrate the extermination of the planet..just so they can be proven as true..this presentiment of catastrophe is the desire for it </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">D&amp;G 214 at a certain level..recognize or identify </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The bureaucracy is perfected when all the unites think the same. This just highlights the vastness of fascism at work </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">D&amp;G </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">“Fascism is inseparable from a proliferation…personal and collective (214-215</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The affirmative is a paranoiac fascizing type..that invests in the formation of central sovereignty; overinvests it by making it the final eternal cause for all the other social forms of history; counterinvests that periphery; and disinvests every “free” figure of desire—yes, I am your kind, and I belong to the superior race and class. We are schizorevolutionaires following the lines of escape of desire; breaches the wall and cases flows to move; assembles its machines and groups-in-frustration in the periphery. Proceeding in an inverse fashion from that of the other pole. I am not your kind, I belong eternally to the inferior race..good people say that we must not flee, that to escape is not good that it isn’t effective, and that one must work for reforms. But the revolutionary knows that escape is revolutionary..withdrawal, freaks…I make take flight, but all the while I am fleeing, I will be looking for a weapon!</span><br />

1NC<br />
Mixed Scanning is the Overall Argument- the idea is that the negative needs to engage the aff from multiple viewpoints, then they read a wreck of offcase arguments, which are all basically kritiks of the aff.<br />
In this debate they read a bunch and said that they were all areas where we should reject enchantment (a specific link to Idaho’s aff):<br />
1.) Return of the Bison<br />
A.) the united states has a legacy of colonialism, slavery, racism and genocide – we must face this honestly<br />
<strong><u>Jensen in ‘1</u></strong><br />
[Robert, Professor of Journalism at UT Austin, “Don’t Deny the Brutality of History,” Published in the Dallas Morning News, Feb 6, 2001, </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0206-05.htm" rel="nofollow">__http://www.commondreams.org/ views01/0206-05.htm__</a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">]<br />
(Both of these holocausts…in which systemic injustice remains.)<br />
B.) THE LEGACY OF THE UNITED STATES IS MURDER, SLAVERY, COLONIZATION AND RACISM- MUST BE REFLEXIVE<br />
<strong><u>Zinn in ‘6</u></strong><br />
[Howard, Prolific Author, “America’s Blinders,” Published in the <u>Progressive</u>, March 21, 2006]<br />
(These facts are embarrassing…common cause of peace and justice)<br />
C.) US MILITARY HAS KILLED OVER THREE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE EAST CARRYING OUT GNOCIDAL VIOLENCE<br />
<strong><u>Coodner in ‘7</u></strong><br />
[David, University of Iowa, “American Genocide in the Middle East: Three Million and Counting,” Common Dreams, August 8, 2007]<br />
(Deaths directly and indirectly attributable to the U.S. invasion…<em>the politics of aggression</em>.)<br />
D.) THE LEGACY OF AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS NIGHTMARE. THE HISTORY OF ATTROCITY IN THE ‘WILD WEST’ WHERE THE SAVAGE INDIANS AND THE WILD BUFFALO STOOD IN THE WAY OF MANIFEST DESTINY. THIS LED TO THE EXTERMINATION OF THE BUFFALO TO BE REPLACED BY CATTLE. SUBSIDIZATION OF THE CATTLE INDUSTRY BEGAN AFTER THE INDIAN HAD BEEN SUBDUED AND THE WEAKENED NATIVE PEOPLES WERE PLACED WITH THE CHOICE OF EITHER EATING BEEF OR DYING<br />
<strong><u>Rifkin in ‘92</u></strong><br />
[pgs 81-83 (sorry there was no cite)]<br />
(Indian tribes had lived in a symbiotic and sustainable relationship…for feeding at the public trough.)<br />
2.) GREGORIAN CALENDER<br />
A.) COUNTERADVOCACY- WE ADVOCATE THE ENTIRE 1AC SANS THE DATES IN THEIR CITATIONS<br />
THE 1AC’S USE OF YEAR DATES SUSTAINS THE HEGEMONIC GREGORIAN CALENDAR. THIS FORM OF TIME IS PATENTLY UNWORTHY.<br />
<strong><u>Jorges in the Year of the Dragon</u></strong><br />
[Bernward, a professor at <u>Technical University of Berlin</u> and director of the Metropolitan Research Group, Berlin, “Metropolitan Time: <em>Reflections on the Millenium, Calendars and Gregorian Hegemony</em>]<br />
(It may seem that…from optimal week-system)<br />
B.) USING A DIFFERENT CALENDAR WOULD AVOID THE VIOLENCE AND WARS ENDEMIC TO THE USE OF THE GREGORIAN CALENDAR.<br />
<strong><u>Argüelles &amp; Argüelles in the current year of the Dragon</u></strong><br />
[Dr. Jose and Lloydine, “Calendar Reform and the Future of Civilization: Preparatory Reflections for the World Summit on Peace and Time,” University for Peace, Costa Rica, Crystal Moon 24-Cosmic Moon 1, Sixth Year of Prophecy]<br />
(The very notion of an unbroken…reform seemed remote and irrelevant.)<br />
3.) ILLUMINATI<br />
A.) THE AFFIRMATIVE IS TOO EMOTIONAL. THE ILLUMINATI IS ABLE TO CONTROL ALL OF THE WORLD AND SPARK ALL WARS BASED OFF OF ITS MAIN ENERGY SOURCE OF HUMAN EMOTIONS.<br />
<strong><u>Icke in ‘5</u></strong><br />
[David, <u>Infinite Love is the only truth: everything else is illusion</u>, isbn: 0953881067, pg. 32-34]<br />
(Another reason for the rituals…as I will come later.)<br />
B.) OUR ALTERNATIVE IS TO BE INFINITE POSSIBILITY<br />
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE AFFIRMATIVE THIS MEANS TO DO NOTHING, TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE POSITIONS OF THE AFFIRMATIVE. ULTIMATELY THE AFFIRMATIVE’S BASIS IN POLARITY GAURANTEES A REPLICATION OF THEIR IMPACTS, THEY BECOME WHAT THEY FIGHT.<br />
<strong><u>Icke in ‘5</u></strong><br />
[David, <u>Infinite Love is the only truth: everything else is illusion</u>, isbn: 0953881067, pg. 190-192]<br />
(What keeps us in the illusion…Multi-millions of genuine people who want to stop)<br />
4.) CAPITALISM<br />
CAPITALISM COMMODIFIES THE ENVIRONMENT- EXPLOITS THE BIOSPHERE<br />
<strong><u>Foster in ‘2</u></strong><br />
[John Bellamy, Associate Professor of Sociology at the U of Oregon, <em>Ecology Against Capitalism</em>]<br />
(This failure of economists to understand that…unlimited growth of capital.)<br />
5.) ENVIRONMENTAL REGS<br />
EVERY CARD THEY READ ON THIS DEBATE ASSUMES THAT THE SYSTEM IS USING THESE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS TO STOP DESTRUCTION, BUT THEY ARE JUST ATTEMPTING A REFORM UPON THEMSELVES THAT IS NEVER EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION.<br />
<strong><u>Foster in ‘99</u></strong><br />
[John Bellamy, Associate Professor of Sociology at the U of Oregon, <em>The Vulnerable Planet</em>]<br />
6.) BIOPOWER<br />
BIOPOLITICS MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH WAR FROM EPIDEMIC: BOTH ARE LEGITIMATE REASONS TO ENGAGE IN WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER<br />
<strong><u>Thacker in ‘5</u></strong><br />
[Eugene, Assistant Professor in the School of Literature, Communication and Culture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, <em>Nomos, nomos and bios in the body politic</em>]<br />
(No one will deny the real threats posed…will all be used in this biopolitics)<br />
7. IMPERIALISM<br />
A.) WESTERN IMPERIALISM KILLS CULTURES<br />
<strong><u>Ilps in ‘4</u></strong><br />
[“Intensify Cultural Resistance against Imperialism Join the Waves of Cultural Resistance in MR”, International League of Peoples’ Struggles, 2004]<br />
(Imperialism implored its own artificial…created by the MNC’s)<br />
B.) CULTURE KEY TO SURVIVAL<br />
<strong><u>Clech Lam in ‘00</u></strong><br />
[Maivan, Prof. @ U of Washington Law, <u>At the edge of the state</u>, p 205-206]<br />
(Nevertheless, as anthropologists know,…can lead to violence.)<br />
8.) VIRAL DISCOURSE<br />
VIRAL DISCOURSE ALWAYS RESULTS IN REPRESENTATIONAL CONFLATION OF DISEASE WITH THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM IT- THE VICTIMS BECOME DANGERS TO THE HEALTH POPULATIONS<br />
<strong><u>Schell in ‘97</u></strong><br />
[Heather, PH. D. Candidate, literature, Standford, “Outburst! A Chilling True Story about Emerging-Virus Narratives and Pandemic Social Change,” <em>Configurations</em>, 5.1, pg. 93-133]<br />
(Being immobile pathogens,…engenders the rest of us.)<br />
9.) DEATH OF THE AUTHOR<br />
ACTING AS ACOLYTES TO AN AUTHOR CEMENTS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WHICH IS CAPITALIST AND SHOULD BE REJECTED- DO THE AFF MINUS THEIR AUTHORSHIP OVER IT. THE CARD IS WRITTEN BY “ANDY AND AVERY” AND IS OBVIOUSLY NOT CITED.<br />

They then read a play from Artaud “To have done with the judgment of God” and argue that the plan is problematic in that it relies on subjects acting upon objects. They isolated the following links in CX:<br />
-The plan is syntactically formatted in a particular way<br />
-The plan ends with a period<br />
-The use of the term “barbaric” in the 1AC upholds the animal/human dichotomy<br />
They then claimed to solve the aff by doing the aff in a different form. They say that their breakdown of language is critical breakdown capitalism by deterritorializing it.<br />
<strong><u>Block</u></strong><br />
Alternative forms of thought in language have the power to alter institutions and resist domination<br />
Bleiker 2K Popular dissent, human agency and global politics p236-237<br />
Writing styles are issues… resistance to domination.<br />
The affirmative displays a group fantasy that concentrates and controls the individual fantasy. This construction of a pseudo-destiny represses desire subordinating the molecular individual into the goals of making the current apparatus seem inevitable.<br />
Deleuze and Guattari in 1983 (anti-oedipus, p 53-53)<br />
The affirmative’s assessment lures us into believing the issue is one of ideology, ultimately however, the masses are not fooled by ideology’s illusions; but rather, by their unconscious libidinal investments. Consequently, the ballot is not a question of what ought be, rather, it is an issue of why are we aroused by the very things we hate.<br />
This is Deleuze and Guattary in 1983 (anti-oedipus, p 104-105)</span>
