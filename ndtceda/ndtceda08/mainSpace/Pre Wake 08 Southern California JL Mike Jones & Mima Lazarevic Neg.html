WE SHOULD RESIST THE PRIVATIZATION OF LIFE AT ALL COSTS. GIVING OURSELVES UP TO THE FREEDOM FROM MARKET REGULATION IS AN IDEOLOGY THAT PRIVATIZES EVERYTHING: SOCIAL CONTRACTS BECOME MEANINGLESS AS LIFE, DEMOCRACY AND MORALITY ONLY MAKES SENSE WITHIN THE NARROW LANGUAGE OF THE MARKET. THIS IS THE JUNGLE, A FORM OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE SLICKEST AND A BRUTAL FORM OF LIFE<br />

BEEF IS JUST A SYMPTOM OF THE MARKET. ABSENT CATTLE AS COMMODITY, NATURE WILL STILL BE EXPLOITED FOR PRIVATE GAIN<br />

Personally, I'd prefer to do away with the market all together… There must be more to it than Rifkin's bovine maths.<br />

COMMODIFICATION IS THE PROBLEM. INCREASING THE PRICE OF MEAT BUYS INTO CAPITALIST LOGIC. MONSANTO WILL SIMPLY SWITCH TO SELLING TOFU.<br />

THE USFG SHALL DECLARE THAT FARM ANIMALS ARE NO LONGER EXEMPT FROM THE LABORATORY ANIMAL WELFARE ACT, STATING THAT THE CONFINEMENT OF FARM ANIMALS ROBS THEM OF THEIR DIGNITY AS LIVING, SENTIENT BEINGS.<br />

The animal agriculture industry should implement ameliorate many ifap animal welfare problems<br />
<br />
FIRST, RUN-OFF. THE PLAN GUTS CONSERVATION SECURITY PROGRAM SUBSIDIES -<br />
<br />
TOPICALLY THEY HAVE TO. ANIMAL WASTE SUBSIDIES RECEIVE 179 MILLION OF CURRENT SUBSIDIES BUT CONSERVATION SUBSIDIES REPRESENT 338 MILLION OF THE CURRENT PACKAGE TO CAFOS. AT MOST, ANIMAL WASTE SUBSIDIES REPRESENT ONLY 35% OF CURRENT SUBSIDIES TO CAFOS. TOPICALLY YOU’D HAVE TO REDUCE CONSERVATION SUBSIDIES GIVEN TO CAFOS<br />
<br />
AND EQIP MONEY IS CRITICAL TO PREVENT RUNOFF, SAFE GRAZING AND LESS SOIL EROSION<br />

SECOND – GLOBAL SMALL FARMERS<br />

A. BIG AG WILL BENEFIT FROM SUBSIDY REDUCTIONS<br />

<br />
B. SMALL FARMERS ARE MORE SUSTAINABLE.<br />

Here again, there is a vast array of solid proposals… we will definitely get more “business as usual”.<br />

FOURTH, LAND GRABS. ENDING US SUBSIDIES CAUSES LIVESTOCK COMPANIES TO BUY UP LAND IN MEXICO, KILLING THE ENVIRONMENT AND CAUSES MASS MIGRATION TO THE CITIES<br />

FIFTH, AG LIBERALIZATION – THE US WILL USE SUBSIDY CUTS TO PUSH LIBERALIZATION OF CHEMICALS AND INDUSTRIAL PORK<br />
<br />
PHILPOTT, farms at Maverick Farms, a sustainable-agriculture nonprofit &amp; small farm in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, 08 (Tom, GRIST, Farm-subsidy shenanigans, 7/25, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/7/25/85049/4649" rel="nofollow">http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2008/7/25/85049/4649</a>)<br />
<br />
Among sustainable-food advocates, there's a reflexive tendency.. including ecologically devastating products like industrially produced pork.<br />
<br />
AG LIB TURNS THE CASE. ENDING SUBSIDIES WON’T MAKE CAFO’S UNPROFITABLE.<br />
<br />
PHILPOTT, farms at Maverick Farms, a sustainable-agriculture nonprofit &amp; small farm in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, 07 (Tom, Subsidies and the agony of modern farm policy, GRIST, 11/14, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2007/11/14/94324/885" rel="nofollow">http://gristmill.grist.org/story/2007/11/14/94324/885</a>)<br />
<br />
Subsidies, I argued, do not cause the ravages of industrial agriculture… the big grain-trading firms support an end to subsidies.<br />
<br />
<u><strong>COUNTERPLAN VS. CAFOS – USE SUBSIDIES TO MANAGE SUPPLY</strong></u><br />
FARMERS WILL NO LONGER RECEIVE ANY SUBSIDIES THAT THE PLAN REMOVES UNLESS THEY USE THESE SUBSIDIES TO END OVERPRODUCTION. FARMERS WILL NO LONGER BE PAID ON THE BASIS OF UNITS OF OUTPUT.<br />

<br />
Understanding that profit potential, and also realizing that doing away with subsidies… ecologically devastating erosion of soil's ability to store carbon.
