<strong>Rd 6 Kentucky GT Aff</strong><br />
v Fullerton CP<br />
<strong><u>1AC</u></strong><br />
Quirin – on the case list.<br />
Liberty, democracy, int’l law<br />
<strong><u>2AC</u></strong><br />
Framework<br />
Debate should be about the question of the resolution and its consequences.<br />
A bunch of reasons why ontology is bad, precludes discussion of security policy, we don’t exclude them, etc.<br />
They don’t solve the case, they just leave people to die and be hurt, they take a step away from public policy and it causes isolationism. That causes nuclear war (ferguson). Realism good and realism inevitable.<br />

Observation One: Status quo<br />
Will not overrule Planned Parenthood v. Casey.<br />
DESPITE AN INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE STANDARDS FOR REVIEW, THE COURT WON’T OVERRULE ITS DECISION IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY<br />
FORSYTHE AND PRESSER<br />
10 TEX. REV. LAW &amp; POL. 301, SPRING 2006<br />
“BASED ON DECISIONS IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD…TO DO FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES”<br />

A1: Baby Killers<br />
Casey’s reaffirmation of Roe has entrenched a right to abortion in American Law<br />

The liberty interest identified in Casey facilitates the destruction of “potential life” for purposes of therapeutic cloning.<br />

7 MICH. ST. J. MED. &amp; LAW 37<br />
“THE HOUSE BILL AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION…PRESERVE THE LIFE OR HEALTH OF THE PATIENT UNDER THE REASONING OF CASEY. 69”<br />
Creating the possibility of altering the genetics of future generations in search of the “perfect baby” guarantees the elimination of population characteristics that are socially marginalized.<br />
KASS, FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE, 2001<br />
“DEAF TO MOST OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, THE REAGARD…PRODUCE THE PERFECT BABY”<br />
We are en route to a post human future where we have sacrificed our humanity for wholesale human redesign.<br />

Root cause of genocide and war.<br />
BERUBE, 1997, ONLINE<br />
“THIS MEANS-END DISPUTE IS AT THE CORE…EVIL’S MOST POWERFUL WEAPON”<br />
Positive and negative eugenics are currently used to control the genetic makeup of ones descendents, we will soon “order” children with predetermined traits based on the aesthetic value of popular culture.<br />

GRAY, “THE UNSTOPPABLE MARCH OF THE CLONES,” 6/24, 2002<br />
“THIS IS FAITH, NOT SCIENCE. BY INSISTING THAT WE CAN USE OUR POWERS…WORST FEATURES OF UNREGENERATE HUMANITY.”<br />
Only the Supreme Court can determine the plausibility of a state’s interest in fetal life – overruling Casey by conferring personhood on the fetus will result in the protection of fetal life by constitutional decree.<br />
WALEN, 22 CONST. COMMENTARY 161, 2005<br />

Cloning<br />
A ban is narrowly tailored to interests.<br />
AT: FDA Will block<br />
-FDA has no access to limit them – Kass<br />
AT: countries won’t ban cloning<br />
irrelevant<br />
don’t need to win cloning to win eugenics – individuals will be selected<br />
Extend wang – it implicates their logic in malthus – makes extinction inevitable.<br />

Grey – means its the way we use nanotechnology.<br />

Abortion<br />
AT: not popular<br />
not true – 1ac ev<br />

it’s a question of philosophy<br />

CP<br />
Perm – do both<br />

POLITICS<br />
Congress doesn’t backlash against controversial decisions<br />
&lt;x&gt;<br />
Only risk it links to CP<br />
Only a propesnsity for backlash<br />
Court action allows politicians to avoid blame<br />
&lt;x&gt;<br />
Bush has no capital<br />
&lt;x&gt;<br />
Both sides have already taken an issue on immigration --&gt; no spillover<br />
No GOP unity now<br />
