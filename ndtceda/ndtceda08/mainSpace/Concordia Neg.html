Wizard of Oz K<br />
<br />
The affirmative takes on the position of expertise, playing like a doctor for the body of the law. This use of expert discourse is the example of the discourse of the university, a trope that disguises a desire for mastery and power through expertise. The affirmative projection is a masked manipulation of the split subjects of language.<br />
Jeanne Schroeder Prof of Law @ Cardozo, 44 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 263 2002<br />
“Specifically Lacan developed . . . freedom of its members.”<br />
<br />
How would Dorothy get back to Kansas?<br />
<br />
If Dorothy becomes the best technician, does the machines bidding best, then perhaps she could return to her tea totaling dirt farming family in Kansas.<br />
<br />
By the time Dorothy was done unleashing the Tin Men upon the world and scarecrows had finished their various scaring, the Lullaby League was more pedantic then ever and the level of violence and hatred in the land of Oz had reached an all time high. Faith in the big other as the source of solutions ends in totalitarian violence.<br />
Jeanne Schroeder Prof of Law @ Cardozo, 44 Wm and Mary L. Rev. 263 2002<br />
“I have made the university … be a forced one.”<br />
<br />
The goal of the critique is to produce a rupture in the Big Other. The position of the critique suggests that we end our investment in these structures for a moment, favoring critique instead. We have no new solutions for mastery or power, however the unique transgressive possibilities that the alternative offers can reconfigure knowledge.<br />
<br />
Although we have none of the concrete certainty of a hegemony disadvantage, we should take this step toward something better.<br />
Jeanne Schroeder professor of Law @ Cardozo, 79 Tex. L. Rev. 15 2000<br />
“As I have stated … whatever it may be.”<br />
<br />
In time Dorothy became just as green and stilted as her old victim, the wicked witch of the west. And a house came flying down on her. The task of relentless critique of the fantasy of the big other will produce new narratives that will need to be criticized as well. Really we best end up like Toto, barking and biting and critiquing every political ideology we find. Basically, THE ROLE OF THE BALLOT SHOULD BE THAT OF A DOG BARKING AWAY….<br />

Against Quirin Affs<br />
First, we note that the status of bare life is not conferred exclusively upon those in the camp, but on the wider society as a whole, we are all bare life.<br />
Jenny Edkins professor of politics at Abertswyrth and Veronique Pin-Fat lecturer in international relations at Manchester. “Introduction: life, power, resistance.” Sovereign Lives. 2004 p. 9-11<br />
“Agamben, of course … becomes questionable.”<br />
<br />
Second, the affirmative strategy for resisting the violence of the war on terror is doomed from the outset; calling for an end to violence within classical politics is just nostalgia, it’s a rigged game.<br />
Jenny Edkins professor of politics at Abertswyrth and Veronique Pin-Fat lecturer in international relations at Manchester. “Introduction: life, power, resistance.” Sovereign Lives. 2004 p 12-13<br />
“Either way … zones of indistinction.”<br />
<br />
The terminal impact is extinction.<br />
Michael Dillion professor of politics at Lancaster. “Correlating sovereign and biopower.” In Soverign Lives, ed Edkins. 2004 p. 41<br />
“Power is commonly … promise of politics.”<br />
<br />
We advocate that the United States Federal Government declare through the Quirin precedent that all individuals are in fact enemy combatants including all United States citizens.<br />
<br />
Our counter advocacy uncovers the reality that we are all always already bare life, the Edkins and Pin-Fat evidence is quite clear on this point. This also makes our advocacy mutually exclusive with the affirmative case, as the Quirin precedent is strategically redeployed by our advocacy while the affirmation gives up this chance.<br />
<br />
Resistance to power is best accomplished from the position of bare life, solving better then the affirmative.<br />
Jenny Edkins professor of politics at abertswyrth. Trauma and the memory of politics. 2003 p. 214<br />

Broken Dreams<br />
<br />
The idea of harmony in the aff is one that is based on a harmonious vision that ignored the fundamental antagonism that is involved in human relations and democracy . This destroys the reality of power this is constitutive of the social creating a false view of the political that can never be achieved<br />
<br />
Mouffe 00 ( The Democratic Paradox)<br />
<br />
The impact is the collapse of the fantasy—this is inevitable as the affiarmtive moes towards its utopian imagry and reaslized that this is impossible, resulting in extermination of a scapegoat<br />

This particularistic system will collapse under its own weight as individuals will not be able to deal with the multiplicity of indentities becoming fearful and creating a fauz democracy leading to totalitarianism<br />

Schlagg<br />
<br />
The affirmative ascribes to the legal system, engaging it without knowing that it will lead to footnoting of the aff. The impact is erasure of the affirmative – rejection of the law solves.<br />

Badiou<br />
<br />
The affirmative has no way to coherently defend their ethics – they start calue judgments from the macro, precluding the formation of ethics. Ethics comes from a persons relationship to an event, good and evil are the results of practices of this event. Conventional ethical frameworks rely on universalized prescriptions of value and other axiomatic forms of truth which deny the single person their own individual ability to create their own truth.<br />
<br />
Micheal Rothburg, U of Illinois, 2001, Criticism 43.4 , project muse<br />
<br />
The attempt to fix the evil in the 1ac is symptomatic of a far larger problem, the nihilism at the core of modern ethics…the wound is far deeper than a mere kiss of the boo boo can resolve, the power of money and destruction go unchecked in the affirmative way of thinking.<br />
<br />
Badiou 2002 (interview)<br />

<br />
We create a new truth. THINK BIG although we many not change the world at a stroke we are activists of truth! Ethics can only exist on the level of the personal, start the change here and now!<br />

Constitutional Amendment Morgan Powers Counterplan<br />

Text: The United States Congress should pass legislation guaranteeing an equal protection based guaranteed for a quality education as a fundamental right to all individuals in the United States. This legislation should explicitly repudiates the judicial decision in Rodriguez v San Antonio as a failure of the judiciary to provide for the equal protection of the law under the Morgan powers doctrine<br />

Rodriguez was the ending point of education reform through the courts, curtailing the scope of the14th amendment regardless of educational quality<br />

Finally, the CP's guarantee of education trumps any solvency deficit or DA – even in war and violence our firsty priority should be guaranteeing education to children<br />

We begin our critique of the affirmative by noting that the left has become fundamentally conservative... In the post socialist era the left has been splintered into a series of rival groups attempting to monopolize the public attention to deploy a version of identity that is entirely devoted to maintaining the status quo. This use of juridically established identities has eliminated any true transformative vision for the left.<br />
Wendy Brown, “Resisting Left Melancholy.” Boudnary 2 26:3 1999 Project Muse<br />
“Traditionalism is hardly new in left politics... undersides of putatively progressive political aims.”<br />

Second, Regardless of how identity categories are deployed, they are always undergrided by the historical construction of these systems. The common sense assumptions that make categories intelligible reproduce far more systematic oppression then can be resolved by their strategic deployment<br />
