As a physician I content that nuclear technology threatens… be affected unless we bring about a dramatic reversal of the world’s pro-nuclear choices<br />

<strong>Iraq add on</strong><br />
Tehran has the ability and motive to stabilize Iraq- but only if it has security guarantees from the US- the alternative is civil and regional war<br />

<br />
In 1993 Moscow even threatened …. war there higher than almost everywhere else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus the plan: the United States Federal Government should guarantee not to threaten Iran’s sovereignty or territorial integrity if Iran agrees to end significant production of enriched uranium and agrees to rotor speed limits on all centrifuges.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation Three: Solvency<br />
<br />
Iran’s pursuit of nuclear power is creating a crisis- unless the US offers concessions to Iran the issue will be irresolvable- Iran will pursue weaponization and miscalculation guarantees pressure will escalate to war<br />
Abrahamian, 07<br />
[Ervand, interviewed by David Barsamian, Targeting Iran, written by David Barsamian, 71-75]<br />
<br />
I would say the present crisis … military strikes if necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
Compromising on rotor speed is the perfect deal to prevent proliferation- it saves Iran face, appeals to global and Iranian opinion and allows effective monitoring<br />

Similar creative compromises … Iran’s nuclear program.<br />

<br />
The negotiations between the European … Iranian nuclear policy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Engagement is key- pressure strengthens hardliners by allowing them to appeal to nationalism- security incentives will strengthen pragmatists who advocate rapprochement<br />

<strong>GSU Round 1</strong><br />
Case: Bargain - Security guarantee for centrifuge compromise<br />
Plan: The United States Federal Goverment should guarantee not to threaten the government of Iran's sovereignty of territorial integrity if the government of Iran agrees to end significant production of enriched uranium and agrees to rotor speed limits on all centrifuges.<br />
