A Links - The system of rights established by the 1ac is dangerous and violent one - the affirmative does not take a negative action but rather actively expands the scope of governmentality while excluding those who are not deemed proper political subjects<br />
<br />
Pickett 2000 (Brent L., Professor of Poly Sci @ Chardon College, &quot;Foucaultian Rights?&quot;, Social Science Journal, 37:3, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science" rel="nofollow">__http://www.sciencedirect.com /science__</a>)<br />
<br />
The 1AC mirrors the status quo conflation with sex and rape in the law- This conflation allows sex to be used against women in rape trials as a reason as to why the deserve what they got- the exceptions to rape law become tantamount to government-sponsored gender violence<br />
Butler 92 <u>Feminist theorize the political</u> 17-19<br />
<br />
The autonomous subject constructed by the affirmative is the basis of a form of power that is no longer purely juridical but instead is capillary and disparate throughout society. This results in the classification and management of life on the scale of entire populations<br />
<br />
Fraser 1985 (Nancy, Professor of Poly Sci @ The New School University, Ethics, vol. 96, iss. 1, p. 174)<br />
<br />
B. Impact - The state's ability to control and manage life is not benign. The flipside of the ability to guarantee life to whole populations is that it necessitates the destruction of life on an equal scale. The affirmative's world is one in which massacres have become vital as the only means at which the health of one's own populace can be guaranteed<br />
<br />
Dean 2001 (Mitchell, Professor of Sociology @ Macquarie University, Ethnographic Explorations of the Postcolonial State, ed. Hanson and Stepputat, pg. 53-54)<br />
<br />
C. Vote Negative - refuse the affirmative's call to become a legislator of grand solutions - instead endorse the political act of the 1nc. Only by situating ourselves as specific intellectuals is it possible to become thinkers who do not fall back into the dangerous role of managers of life<br />
<br />
