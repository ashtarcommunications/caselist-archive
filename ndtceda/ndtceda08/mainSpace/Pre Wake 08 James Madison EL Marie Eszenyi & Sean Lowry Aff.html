Observation 1: Inherency<br />
<br />
1) U.S. agricultural support is rising at a rapid rate<br />
OECD 08. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, &quot;ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE OF AGRICULTURE IN OECD COUNTRIES SINCE 1990: United States Country Section.&quot; {SAL 8/5/08}<br />
Agricultural support...export subsidies<br />
<br />
2)The Farm Bill forces corn into the market<br />
PBS, 2008<br />

You don't...government policy<br />
<br />
3) Corn subsidies are 10 billion a year<br />
Morgan, 2008<br />
(Dan, The Washington Post, May 21, P. A2)MKD<br />
The Agricultural...a year<br />
<br />
Thus we offer the following plan: The United States Federal Government should eliminate nearly all counter-cyclical payments, direct payments, and marketing assistance loans for corn.<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Harms<br />
Advantage 1: Soil<br />
First, Corn overproduction is for profits by subsidies This in itself has led to soil degradation<br />

Our soil resource....environmental quality<br />

Furthermore, This form of Monoculture alone has jacked Biodiversity, the beginning of new diseases, the elimination of Small Farms, depleted the soil of key nutrients and led to Runoff.<br />

<br />
If all agriculture land....the loss of future species.<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Corn Production's reliance on fertilizers and pesticides creates water pollution, cancer, and endocrine disruption<br />

And, That's Extinction<br />

<br />
For at least some....with human populations<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Soy<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: Deforestation<br />
<br />
U.S. corn subsidies cause a shift away from soy – bumping prices and destroying the Amazon<br />
States News Service 2007, 12-17-07, U.S. CORN SUBSIDIES PROMOTE AMAZON DE FORESTATION, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute released this information<br />
<br />
American taxpayers...get to a smoking gun.<br />
<br />
Amazon collapse leads to extinction<br />
Takacs, 1996 - teaches environmental humanities (history, ethics, justice, politics) in the Institute for Earth Systems Science and Policy at California State (David, &quot;The Idea of Biodiversity: Philosophies of Paradise,&quot; 1996, pg. 200-201)<br />
<br />
So biodiversity keeps the world....but a whisper.<br />
<br />
And, Amazon destruction risks life on earth – we're nearing the tipping point<br />
Timothy V. Gatto, 4-25-08, LiberalPro, The &quot;Tipping Point&quot; and &quot;Critical Mass&quot; in America and the World<br />

Just how many issues are....there is no second chance.<br />
<br />
And, Qualified sources agree – oxygen levels are already collapsing<br />

<br />
Low body oxygen levels....carbon dioxide into oxygen.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: Pakistan<br />
<br />
First, Increased diversion of land to corn comes at soy's expense – causing global cooking oil shortfalls<br />

<br />
Advantage 3: Canada<br />
<br />
First, Corn subsidies have triggered the beginning to a US-Canadian trade conflict-This is just the beginning<br />

On May 13, in apparent confirmation… carries a heavy burden.<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 3: Solvency<br />
<br />
Eliminating corn subsidies is the most effective way to curb overproduction while benefiting farmers throughout the world – curbs excesses of industrial ag in move to organic production<br />

<br />
Using a carbon…..said the researchers<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore Subsidies are a key component to fast food industry<br />

<br />
Much of the…putting warning labels<br />
<br />
<br />
Observation 2: Harms<br />
<br />
First is Patriarchy<br />
The Fast Food Industry has taken advantage and benefited off the low wages Women Usually Receive compared to males. They then have women do their “Traditional” Responsibilities…..Cooking, Cleaning, and Child Care. Schlosser 98. Rolling Stone magazine (USA), Issue 794, September 3rd 1998 . Fast-Food Nation: The True Cost Of America's Diet . By National Magazine Award winner Eric Schlosser <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/rollingstone1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcspotlight.org/media/press/rollingstone1.html</a><br />
<br />
Americans now spend…need of extra income.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Sexual harassment cases are especially prevalent in the fast food industry as young workers are often exploited<br />
Sanchez 03. Mary, “Trouble at work Fast-food industry introduces some young women to sexual harassment” Kansas City Star, The (MO) - Tuesday, May 6, 2003 {AccessWorldNews}<br />
<br />
Some of the young….company door.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, This means Young women are forced to live in fear as they are subjected to rape and then fired if they file complaints<br />
Sanchez 03. Mary, “Trouble at work Fast-food industry introduces some young women to sexual harassment” Kansas City Star, The (MO) - Tuesday, May 6, 2003 {AccessWorldNews}<br />
<br />
One offhand comment….$150,000<br />
<br />
<br />
Don’t discard these lives in favor of a constructed disadvantage. To label the status quo as &quot;peaceful&quot; denies the sexual horror inflicted on women through Sexual Harrassment every day. We must challenge this domination and objectification wherever it occurs.<br />
Ray, 97<br />
(Law Clerk to the Honorable Clyde H. Hamilton, United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Feb46 Am. U.L. Rev. 793)<br />
<br />
because, as…..silence women.<br />
<br />
Rejecting this trivialization is essential to the broader struggle against gendered violence – concerns for political consequences assure the continued erasure of violence.<br />
Enloe, 04<br />
(Research Professor – Clark University, The Curious Feminist, Google Book)<br />
<br />
Thus we need….(lesbian).<br />
<br />
<br />
Advantage 2: Racism<br />
<br />
The Fast Food industry targets black communities-This Outweighs ALL Alternate Causalities<br />

Even so, the actual numbers are shocking ... are clearly worried.<br />

5) Loss of heg &gt;&gt; economic collapse, nuke war, terrorism, disease<br />

ADV 2 - FACTORY FARMS<br />
1) Half of all corn production goes to CAFOS<br />
Philpott 2007. Tom, www.grist.org (1/30)<br />
more than half...are breathtaking<br />

Biomass feedstocks such as corn grain... application rates for soybean are about half those for corn. The native grasses compare highly favorably to corn and soy for both fertilizers and pesticides, with order-of-magnitude lower application rates.<br />

2) Nitrogen from subsidized corn creates oceanic dead zones<br />

3) Increased corn production is a disaster for US water supplies<br />
Geiselman, 2007<br />
(Bruce, Waste News, October 15, Pg. 39)MKD<br />
As a result, production of biofuel crops, especially corn, is on the rise. A National Research Council panel concluded that as farmers begin growing corn ... other bodies of water. To reduce those concerns, farmers could reduce nutrient pollution by injecting fertilizer below the soil surface, use con-trolled-release fertilizers that have water-insoluble coatings, and optimize the amount of fertilizer applied to the land.<br />
