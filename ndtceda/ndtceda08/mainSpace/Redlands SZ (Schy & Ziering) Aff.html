<strong><u>Redlands SZ Affirmative</u></strong> – round 6 vs Texas TW<br />
<strong><u>1ac</u></strong> – <em>same as the casebook</em><br />
<strong><u>2ac</u></strong> –<br />
<u>AT: BIOPOWER KRITIK</u><br />
We = resistance from the state. We allow women to go places like free clinics for pregnancy tests instead of buying them.<br />

<u>AT: CASE ARGS</u><br />
Just extensions of 1AC evidence. The education that the aff provides about abortion and alternate methods for getting abortion allow us to resist the state.<br />
<strong><u>1ar</u></strong> –<br />
<u>AT: FRAMEWORK</u><br />
Frameworks of external authority violent<br />
We’re close to the topic<br />
Call on definitional authority is facist.<br />
Debate is better when it is spontaneous<br />
Fairness is not unique – we are all privelaged – that’s how we got to the ndt<br />
Our education is great – we focus on the substance not the actor<br />
<u>CASE</u><br />
Our education allows people to educate themselves about their own bodies instead of relying on external authority<br />
Even if we can never be completely free, but we should strive for freedom<br />
We don’t defend the affirmative as the only truth<br />
<u>AT: BIOPOWER K</u><br />
<br />
All power is not located in the government<br />
Piracy à constant reterritorialization<br />
Alternative d/n solve case –<br />
perm<br />
technostrategy should be rejected – don’t let them explain cards later<br />
<strong><u>2ar –</u></strong><br />
You actually have to perform your alternative, not just suggest performing it<br />
Pirates operate within power relations – the ocean is freer than the squo<br />
Technostrategy is bad – offense/defense bad – explanation and dialouge should come first<br />
Permutation – put our aff in terms of foucauldian resistance<br />

No link- not changing debate but don’t want to debate in a conventional way<br />
Profound v. situational boredom doesn’t make sense<br />
‘90s disproves argument because ppl were bored<br />
Alt doesn’t solve- women forced by gov to have abortions<br />
We don’t preclude profound boredom<br />
Certain types of debate create boredom- don’t need an epiphany<br />
Neg is situationally boring<br />
Doesn’t assume acting as pirates- pirates aren’t bored, try to escape power and only Aff can create active energy to solve<br />
Ulrike Klausman, Marion Meinzerin, and Gabriel Kuhn, <u>Women Pirates: The Politics of the Jolly Roger</u>, 1997 pg. 234-235<br />
“there are few people ….and vice-versa.”<br />
Exclude the ability of some people to communicate through comedy- create hierarchy in literature and pop culture<br />
Either we have to stop sitting on the grass and incorporate into our lives, or we remain sitting in the grass<br />
1AC is act of education to inform about abortion – fight against economic restrictions on women<br />

<br />
Aff based on active, not reactive principles<br />
Based in belief of freedom and choice<br />
Resistance is not end in itself<br />
We pondered boredom before Aff-they didn’t think about the Aff<br />
Neg is a technostrategic performance trying to win the round- they are the discourse of control and violence their Theile evidence is talking about<br />

<strong>Our affirmative decree:</strong><br />
Pirates are pathologically anti-authoritarian, questioning rules, guidelines, and laws to the point of exhaustion. As pirates, we will affirm the topic but only that which we can justify as being ethically appropriate. We will not defend federal government action, we will not board the Imperial Navy’s ship, because that would make us cowards, submitting to our own slavery.<br />
<br />
Standard debate practices set up the resolution as a regulated market of commodity exchange; evidence is produced, amassed, stored, and traded for the win. We will adopt some of this commerce; piratical tactical engagement with debate is a nomadic affirmation that preserves our freedom<br />
Ulrike Klausman, Marion Meinzerin, and Gabriel Kuhn, <u>Women Pirates: The Politics of the Jolly Roger</u>, 1997 pg. 271-274<br />
“To this day ‘revolutionary morality’ is a subject of much discussion.<br />
Everything else will follow from that.”<br />
<br />
The history of Caribbean piracy is a women’s history; women left the stratified order of the land to live as pirates because the social and economic options that they were offered, well, sucked. Reproductive options of the status quo work in the same way; the current status of reproductive knowledge creates a paternalistic culture that presents women with similarly unsatisfactory choices. The State has an incentive to perpetuate these current options, including the way that abortion is presented, in order to gain power over women. However, there are other non State-centered options. Inga Muscio talks about her choices:<br />
<u>Cunt: A Declaration of Independence</u>, 1998 “Reproductive Rights for Cunts”<br />
“Just because I don’t envision myself in a romantic, sexual relationship… not men and not their machines – can take that away.”<br />
<br />
This knowledge is systematically excluded from the options presented by the State. However, the Supreme Court doesn’t have the power to decide the laws governing women’s bodies. Therefore, we ask you to affirm the reproductive freedom of cunts, outside of sovereign lawmaking. We tie ourselves to a history of men and women fleeing the limits of the land in favor of the infinite ocean. Take it or leave it; if you want to tell us why we’re wrong, we’ll listen and argue with you. But be warned that if you try telling us we aren’t allowed to be here, that some law or mandate prevents our speech from conforming to your rules, we may well leave the debate after the end of the final cross-examination. We’ve been in enough of those battles to know they are a waste of time, and if you want to engage in it, go talk to yourself (or mike jones).
