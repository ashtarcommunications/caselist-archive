Initially note that the Bush administration has declared war on refugees in Lebenon identifying them as ‘radicals’ whose destabilizing effect on sovereignty and security must be extranged with violence<br />
<br />
Lee, Matthew Associated Press Worldstream. August 12th 2007 US to add Lebanese group to terrorism blacklist<br />
<br />
The US is working to stabilize Lebanonn through sanctions…targeting Lahoud and his supporters as well as Syrian officials<br />
<br />
In response to the attacks of 9/11 the US sought to secure itself against the threat of an Islamic other. The ensuring violence defined the boundaries of those deemed worthy and unworthy of existence. No one stopped to mourn Arab lives brutally destroyed by violence. They died because they are already dead. They were killed even before the 1st bombs fell- murdered by indifference<br />
<br />
Butler, Judith University of California Berkeley 2004 (precarious life: the powers of mourning 36-8) <br />
<br />
Dehumanization emerges at the limits of discursive life…when it comes to considering as dead those the US or its allies have killed<br />
<br />
Consequently, while the lives of those lost in the attacks and subsequent war on terror are mourned, others are ignored entirely. The plight of refugees in Lebanon exemplifies this situation They live in camps without access to basic services under a blanket of permanent invisibility. <br />
<br />
Nada Bakri, The New York Times, May 6th 2007 (Invisible Palestinians exist in legal limbo in Lebanon, Lexis- Nexis)<br />
<br />
400,000 Palestinians live in Lebanon…they have melted into the background for too long. <br />
<br />
Invisibility is the antecedent of genocide. Once individuals are marked out of the frame of human existence, they become targets for physical violence. Infinite paranoia against this spectral enemy spurs an endless war against the excluded other. <br />
<br />
Judith Butler, Precarious Life: The powers of mourning 33-345<br />
<br />
If violence is done against those who are unreal…it is already the unburied, if not the unburiable. <br />
<br />
The refugee is a causality of this war by the liveable against the unliveable. Defined at the boundary of sovereignty, they become targets for the dual logics of inclusion and exclusion<br />
<br />
Michael Dillon University of Lancaster, 1999 (Moral Spaces: Rethinking Ethics and World Politics ‘The Scandal of the Refugee’ 109-110<br />
<br />
The scale of the politically instrumental…insists on a preoccupation with the inter anterior to the national<br />
<br />
These dual logics of inclusion and exclusion require escalating acts of violence. Refugee camps are created as raw material to be consumed and annihilated. The flip side of this violence against the other is the securitization of life which ends in nuclear annihilation. Our only possible response is to reformulate politics in a wway that recognizes and promotes political existence. <br />
<br />
Duarte 2005- Thinking the shadow of the rupture: politics and philosophy in Hannah Arendt http:// hannaharendt.net/research/biopolitics.html<br />
<br />
When politics is reduced to…hospitality and solidarity towards each other<br />
<br />
The plan opens up new political space for the recognition of others. Rather than appealing to traditional claims of sovereign rights, affirming the naked existence of the refugee opens up space for a new conceptualization of subjectivity that escapes the exclusive definitions of sovereignty<br />
<br />
Ranciere The South Atlantic Quarterly 103.2/3 (2004) 297-310 Project Muse<br />
<br />
The strength of those rights…the rights of others<br />
<br />
To vote affirmative is to acknowledge the refugee to accept responsibility for the wellbeing of another in the face of insecurity. This acceptance of the stranger is essential to destabilize hegemonic conceptions of the self which enable the categorigazation of those worthy and unworthy of life. <br />
<br />
Michael Dillon, University of Lancaster 1999 Sovereignty and Subjectivity “Whatever the Name of the Article is” Edkins, Jenny and Pin-fat<br />
<br />
The stranger is inscribed…of human being to be made welcome politically. <br />
