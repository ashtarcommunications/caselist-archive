THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD OVERRULE THE DECISION IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD V. CASEY (505 U.S. 833) THAT THE CONSTITUTION PROTECTS A RIGHT TO ABORTION, ON THE GROUNDS THAT FETUSES POSSESS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO LIFE AS PEROSNS UNDER THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT. WE’LL CLARIFY<br />
<br />
<h3 id="toc5"><a name="x-Michigan FK Aff-1ac w/ cites"></a><em>1ac w/ cites</em></h3>
Advantage One: Personhood<br />
<br />
First, the Casey decision reaffirmed Roe’s holding that personhood under the fourteenth amendment doesn’t extend to fetuses<br />
Armstrong, 2006, A Bad Birthday, Eagle Forum, V. 8 N. 8 june 28, online<br />
“Law professor Michael stokes Paulsen has labeled casey…specifically by the amendment.”<br />
<br />
This decision by the Casey court enshrines the constitutional status of un-person to fetuses – all legal scholars agree the congress and states lack any power to change this definition<br />
Kende, 1996, 5 am. U. j. gender and law 247<br />
“The two leading U.S. supreme court cases discussing whether a fetus can be…legislation defining a fetus as a person.”<br />
<br />
This logic allows the state to designate any undesirable human being as a non-person – making legal personhood a whim of the state rather than an inherent attribute of human life is at the heart of the genocidal process<br />
Lugosi, 2006, 4 Geo. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 361<br />
“Judge Burke strongly disagreed with the majority that the conferring of legal…whose lives are devalued by operation of law.”<br />
<br />
The plan is the crucial step towards dignity and rights for all humanity – the starting point of social justice and peace is an expansion of the moral community through the right to life<br />
Payone, no date, justice, peace, and the right to life, online, priests for life<br />
“Efforts of social justice and peace affirm that all human beings…handicapped, rich or poor” (Christifideles laici, #38)”<br />
<br />
An overrule of the Casey decision is needed to challenge this totalitarian conception of freedom – only fourteenth amendment personhood can restore the dignity and value of every human life by enshrining intrinsic worth of every human being under the law<br />
Lugosi, 2006<br />
“Linkage of the rule of law and the supremacy of God…law imbued with moral principle.”<br />
<br />
Abortion kills millions<br />
Brownback, 2004, Human life review, v. 30, issue 3, proquest<br />
“As reagan so eloquently noted…may be-should be esteemed and valued.”<br />
<br />
The overwhelming medical and legal evidence shows that human life begins at conception<br />
Alcorn, 2000, Prolife answers to prochoice arguments”, 50-52<br />
“Medical textbooks and scientific reference works consistently…no one can tell when life begins.”<br />
<br />
Overruling Casey on fourteenth amendment grounds would increase court legitimacy<br />
Lugosi, 2006<br />
“Justice O’Connor suggested the Supreme Court’s legitimacy would be seriously…pressure or exercising personal predictions.”<br />
<br />
Overruling inevitable – the court will overrule Carhart<br />
Houston Chronicle 11-9-06<br />
“The oral arguments heard Wednesday could prove a turning point for the Supreme Court…disputed procedure as “not medically necessary.””<br />
<br />
Finally, legal abortion treats the female body as a diseased object to be controlled and violated for male pleasure – this ethic of control is thoroughly anti-feminist<br />
Maloney, 1995, Cassandra’s Fate, Edited by Rachel MacNair, p. 268-269<br />
“Some women’s rights advocates react with incredulity…the threshold of their own bodies?”<br />
<br />
Advantage Two: Death Penalty<br />
The plan is key to restore a natural law jurisprudence rooted in higher morality and objective principles<br />
Hollowell, 2001, 14 Regent. U. L. Rev. 67<br />
“To examine the fundamental rights and liberties, which are “objectively and deeply rooted…Constitution generally, it warrants a closer examination.”<br />
<br />
Institutionalized natural law jurisprudence would lead to death penalty abolition<br />
Merz, 2004, 29 Dayton L. Rev. 305<br />
“In any event, most Catholic social teaching purports to be based…case-by-case slogging which is our present lot.”<br />
<br />
And strong constitutional right to life would make the death penalty unconstitutional<br />
Bird, 2003, 40 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1329<br />
“The fate of a substantive due process challenge…dominant objective of criminal law.”<br />
<br />
Recognizing the right to life as fundamental creates huge burdens to the death penalty – it would be functionally impossible<br />
Bentele, 1998, November, Back to an International Perspective on the Death Penalty as a Cruel Punishment<br />
“The United States Constitution contains no explicit justification provision…any state could satisfy this burden.”<br />
<br />
The death penalty opponents are always making new arguments – they will exploit the plan<br />
Jewish World Review, 2000, june 30, online<br />
“The claim that DNA evidence has proved hordes of…the conclusion is always the same.”<br />
<br />
Atkins v. Virginia proves our argument – new court reasoning will lead to death penalty challenges<br />
Dunn, 2004, New York Law Journal, 12-9, online<br />
“As the death penalty has unraveled in New York, dramatic developments have…seeks to capitalize on that approach.”<br />
<br />
The death penalty destroys the sacred value to life rendering it expendable and malleable – the impact is extinction<br />
Riga, 1981, 5 U. Puget Sound L. Rev. 23<br />
“It is often pointed out that when a group takes human life…presuppose but cannot create.”<br />
<br />
The death penalty crushes international anti-terrorism cooperation which is key to defeating terrorism<br />
McDonnell, 2004, 37 Vand. J. Transnat’l L. 353<br />
“September 11 changed the political and strategic landscape…citizens and governments of Europe.”<br />
<br />
Impact is extinction –<br />
Sid-Ahmed, 2004, Al-Ahram Weekly, online<br />
“What would be the consequences…we will all be losers.”<br />
<br />
The death penalty turns terrorists into martyrs – life imprisonment is a better deterrent<br />
Roth, 2001, 41 Catholic Law 187<br />
“I think it is also useful to look at the alternatives…ther are many Americans around who are easy targets.”<br />
<br />
Terrorists have access to nuclear weapons<br />
Plate, 2004, South China Morning Post, 12-17<br />
“Graham Allison jauntily refers to North Korea…ocean of hatred and insanity.”<br />
<br />
The death penalty crushes US/EU relations and cooperation – the court can send a powerful signal of change by moving away from the death penalty<br />
Rohatyn, 2006, NYT, 1-26<br />
“During my four years as the American ambassador to France…that is a sign of enlightenment.”<br />

Framework<br />
Defend the plan are based on why it is ethically good to vote for the plan – then they should have the argument<br />
<br />
Overrule<br />
1. w/m – question of law is the constitutionality of abortion and abortion bans – plan reverses that<br />
<br />
2. extend the Lugosi evidence – it contextually defines the plan as an overrule – this independently is a reason we are topical because it solves all your research and predictability arguments<br />

3. Counter-interpretation<br />
Overrule means to void the holding by rendering an opposite decision<br />
Barron’s 1998<br />

From the decision<br />
“On certiorari, the United States Supreme Court affirmed…notice violated the due process clause.”<br />
<br />
A. Fair limits – we mandate a change in holdings which means generic strategies defending current policy always apply<br />

The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, et al. v. Casey, Governor of Pennsylvania, et al. (505 U.S. 833), holding that any government burdens imposed on those seeking abortions for nonconsensual pregnancies are unconstitutional under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. We’ll clarify.<br />
<h3 id="toc15"><a name="x-Michigan FK-1ac w/ cites"></a><em>1ac w/ cites</em></h3>
<br />
Contention 1: The Advantage is “Rolling Back Roe”<br />
<br />
First, Casey’s undue burden standard pushes indigent women to the margins by refusing to acknowledge financial strain as a legitimate obstacle to accessing the right to abortion – the result is the creation of an institution of class privilege within the feminist move for reproductive liberty<br />
<br />
Karst 2K2<br />
(Kenneth L., David G. Price &amp; Dallas P. Price Prof. of Law Emeritus @ UCLA, “Poverty and Rights: A Pre-Millennial Triptych,” Nortre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics &amp; Public Policy, 2002, 16 ND J. L. Ethics &amp; Pub Pol'y 399, Lexis)<br />
Within a decade, the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade<br />
Each of the abortion restrictions allowed post-Casey uniquely target under-privileged women…<br />
<br />
A. 24-hour waiting periods unfairly punish disadvantaged women by placing insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to get abortions – and then bombards them with false information in an attempt to “persuade” them to give up on the abortion<br />
<br />
San Antonio Current 2K3<br />
(Laura M. Fries, “The Texas legislature is trying to make it impossible for women to recieve abortions. Surprise: They've almost succeeded. Aborting the right of choice,” August 6, 2003, GenderWatch)<br />
It has been 30 years since Roe v. Wade, and the right to an abortion seems a<br />
<br />
B. Informed consent laws are uniquely sexist and dangerously misleading – they insult women and then feed them lies forcing women to go through with the pregnancy<br />

(Cynthia Tucker, “Can’t trust women to think clearly on issue? That’s crazy,” Feb. 2, 2005, Lexis)<br />
Despite their accomplishments in<br />
<br />
C. Parental Notification laws force young girls in violent homes into desperate situations where they give themselves abortions resulting in death – any States CP doesn’t solve because those laws aren’t enforced and the Congress is going to implement the Child Custody Protection Act, preventing underage girls from being able to go across state lines to get an abortion without their parents<br />
NARAL 2K5<br />
(“Mandatory Parental Notice and Consent Laws Burden the Freedom to Choose,” NARAL Pro-Choice America, December 19, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/Abortion-Access-to-Abortion-Young-Women-Parental-Consent.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/Abortion-Access-to-Abortion-Young-Women-Parental-Consent.pdf</a>)<br />
Ideally, loving parents should always be involved when their daughters<br />
<br />
And, PICing out of one of the regulations is useless – the Right will use the exemption as a political football to keep the flood of anti-abortion restrictions coming – targeting poor women is an easy political tactic<br />

Kolbert 2K5<br />
(Kathryn, Famous Lawyer who Argued Casey, Annenberg Public Policy Center, “Interview: Kathryn Kolbert,” The Last Abortion Clinic, PBS FRONTLINE, Nov. 8, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/Abortion-Access-to-Abortion-Science-Safety-of-Legal-Abortion.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/Abortion-Access-to-Abortion-Science-Safety-of-Legal-Abortion.pdf</a>)<br />

The impact is that free, functional, and accessible abortion rights to all women is critical to preventing patriarchal, white-supremacist, classist domination of society<br />

All in all, women are being made to feel shame and<br />

Calling attention to these politics of domination is key – dehumanization, famine, ecological devastation, oppression, and nuclear annihilation are all inevitable absent the creation of a more inclusive feminist politics – making your DA impacts inevitable<br />
<br />
hooks 1989<br />
(bell, Distinguished Prof. of English @ City College, talking back: thinking feminist, thinking black, Pg. 19-22)<br />
We live in a world of crisis – a world governed by politics of domination<br />
<br />
Even if no one gets an abortion the point of eliminating anti-abortion restrictions is that they are an integral component of the Christian Right’s attempts at subjugating women and pushing them out of society – opening the door to a new style of hyper-conservative State politics<br />

Greenberg in ‘98<br />

This is the situation we face. And we have to take it on. Rather than viewing the abortion issue<br />
<br />
And, the plan’s “consent-to-pregnancy” reasoning transforms the undue burden standard and reconceptualizes the debate about abortion by making it about positive rights and an affirmative State obligation to provide abortions for millions of women-of-color who exist outside the realm of white and class privilege<br />

Ignoring this systemic racism means being complicit with Spirit Murder – Spirit Murder flips presumption in favor of the affirmative – identifying Spirit Murder as a tangible “impact” is necessary to preventing the annihilation of humanity<br />

(PATRICIA WILLIAMS, Associate Professor of Law, The City University of New York Law School at Queens College, University of Miami Law Review, 42 U. Miami L. Rev. 127, September)<br />
There are certain societies that define the limits<br />
<br />
And, hampered abortion rights force low-income women to do anything to get funds for an abortion – this pushes them into a cycle of poverty, unstable psychological and physical strain, and even suicide<br />

Contention 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
Using a consent basis for abortion makes women constitutionally and socially empowered – consent deconstructs traditional gender roles, creating constitutionally and socially empowered agents<br />
<br />
McDonagh in ‘99<br />

Similarly, some may think that it disempowers<br />
<br />
And, a consent-to-pregnancy justification compels the State to provide funding for abortion; only the plan names the injustice of unconsensual pregnancy, negating the silence surrounding the issue and transforming the gendered nature of the law and society<br />

And, the Supreme Court’s confrontation with Casey’s undue burden standard is key…<br />

TOPICALITY<br />
<br />
1. We meet: casey was decided on due process – plan reinterprets due process to change the outcome of the case regarding what is constituional.<br />
<br />
2. Counter interpretation – rule on a holding in the opposite direction where the reasoning is intrinsically connected to that holding<br />
a. decision means holding<br />

b. Casey’s holding was the undue burden standard<br />
Brooklyn Law Review, in 1994 (Carolyn rose, Put your body on the line, 59 Brooklyn L. Rev., 1497)<br />
Since 1973, the Supreme Court… an undue burden<br />
<br />
3. We meet – plan says the undue burden is unconstitional – it reverses the central hodling of Casey<br />
<br />
4. This is a better interpretation<br />
A. Negative overlimits – it is substantially more difficult to be affirmative on this topic, etc.<br />
<br />
B. Four cases terrible<br />
<br />
C. substantial educational benefit to including this affirmative – pro choice literature provides two different bases: sex equality under 14th amendment and due process under the 14th amendment. These affs are key to education<br />

The plan:<br />
<br />
The Supreme Court of the United States should overrule its decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, et al. v. Casey, Governor of Pennsylvania, et al. (505 U.S. 833), holding that any government burdens imposed on those seeking abortions are unconstitutional under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, guaranteeing that an individual has the right to end a nonconsensual pregnancy. We’ll clarify.<br />
<br />
Contention 1: The Advantage is “Rolling Back Roe”<br />
<br />
First, Casey’s undue burden standard pushes indigent women to the margins by refusing to acknowledge financial strain as a legitimate obstacle to accessing the right to abortion – the result is the creation of an institution of class privilege within the feminist move for reproductive liberty<br />

Within a decade, the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade<br />
Each of the abortion restrictions allowed post-Casey uniquely target under-privileged women…<br />

Parental Notification laws force young girls in violent homes into desperate situations where they give themselves abortions resulting in death – any States CP doesn’t solve because those laws aren’t enforced and the Congress is going to implement the Child Custody Protection Act, preventing underage girls from being able to go across state lines to get an abortion without their parents<br />

We live in a world of crisis – a world governed by politics of domination<br />

This is the situation we face. And we have to take it on. Rather than viewing the abortion issue<br />

Similarly, some may think that it disempowers<br />

Contention One – Inherency<br />
<br />
The US Supreme Court invalidated the Congressional ability to pass the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act under their Section Five power of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment<br />
<br />
Erin Rosen 2002 (J.D. Candidate, School of Law, University of California, Berkeley (Boalt Hall), California Law Review, 90 Calif. L. Rev. 573)<br />
In United States v. Morrison, ... Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment (&quot;Section 5&quot;). 5<br />
<br />
Plan: The Supreme Court of the United States, at its first opportunity, will overrule its decision in United States v. Morrison, holding that the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act was an acceptable Congressional use of its Section Five power under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<br />
<br />
Advantage One – Gender<br />
<br />
The most recent and comprehensive national survey on violence against women explains massive systemic impacts occurring annually in the United States against women<br />
<br />
Tjaden &amp; Thoennes 2000 (Ph.D + Ph.D, Center for Policy Research, US Department of Justice, Full report of the prevalence, incidence, and consequences of violence against women: Findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey.

And, while it is true that violence is committed against men as well, the much larger incidence is against women as the study continues<br />
Specifically, 24.8 percent ... should be considered first and foremost a crime against women.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the whole concept of violence can be productively considered through the concept of gender<br />
<br />
Angela P. Harris 2000 (Professor of Law, University of California, Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall), Stanford Law Review, 52 Stan. L. Rev. 777)<br />
Feminist legal theorists, of course, are well ... vulnerable to the violence of other men.<br />
<br />
Additionally, Congress found that attempts to pass state laws will not be enforced because of massive under-enforcement at the state and local level<br />

Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. 2000 (fifth-term United States Senator and member of the Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees. From 1987 to 1994, Senator Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Harvard Journal on Legislation, 37 Harv. J. on Lexis. 1)<br />
During its four-year inquiry, Congress generated ... state officials invited Congress to pass the Violence Against Women Act. 30<br />

<br />
Advantage Two – The Words Our Laws Speak<br />
<br />
The Morrison case was a unique reaffirmation of the “State Action Doctrine.” In particular, the Morrison decision was a confirmation of the legitimacy of several precedents that explicitly condoned racist violence, and communicates the message that gender discrimination and racial discrimination are not a subject for federal civil rights regulation<br />
<br />
Francisco M. Ugarte, Association Attorney, Summer 06, Leonard Carder, LLP. J.D., CUNY School of Law, “Reconstruction Redux: Rehnquist, Morrison, and the Civil Rights Cases”, 41 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 481, p. L/N<br />
In 2000, the Supreme Court in United States v. Morrison ... would turn a blind eye to gender violence.<br />
<br />
And, this official statement requires us to intervene in each instance – the alternative is condoning the message of inferiority, hatred, and contempt. Only the plan removes this statement of racism<br />
<br />
Lee C. Bollinger 1990 (Dean of the Faculty of Law, University of Michigan, Columbia Law Review, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 979)<br />
It is reasonable to care how people think, and ... and to put a stop to the cruelty.<br />

Plan: The Supreme Court of the United States, at its first opportunity, will overrule its decision in United States v. Morrison, holding that the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act was an acceptable Congressional use of its Section Five power under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.<br />
<br />
Advantage One – Gender<br />
<br />
The most recent and comprehensive national survey on violence against women explains massive systemic impacts occurring annually in the United States against women<br />
<br />

<br />
Moreover, the whole concept of violence can be productively considered through the concept of gender<br />

<br />
Advantage Two – The Words Our Laws Speak<br />
<br />
The Morrison case was a unique reaffirmation of the “State Action Doctrine.” In particular, the Morrison decision was a confirmation of the legitimacy of several precedents that explicitly condoned racist violence, and communicates the message that gender discrimination and racial discrimination are not a subject for federal civil rights regulation<br />

ADVANTAGE 1 GENDER<br />
<br />
The most recent and comprehensive national survey on Violence against Women explains massive systemic impacts occurring annually in the United States against women.<br />

And, the whole concept of violence can be productively considered through the concept of gender.<br />
Harris 2000, Stanford Law Review 777, “Feminist legal theorists…violence of other men.”<br />
<br />
And, this story reconfirms the terrible national story told to the Senate during the hearings on the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence against Women Act – Violence against Women is endemic in the United States and is targeted at women because of their gender. Sadly, in addition, this legislative history found that attempts to pass state laws will not be enforced because of massive under enforcement at the state and local level.<br />

ADVANTAGE II – The words our laws speak<br />
<br />
The Morrison case was a unique reaffirmation of the State Action Doctrine. In particular, the Morrison decision was a statement to the nation of the legitimacy of several precedent that explicitly condoned racist violence. This is a shockingly un-reflexive statement by the highest Court in the land of the acceptability of racism. The court is communicating that gender discrimination and racial discrimination are not a subject for federal civil rights regulation. The end result is both a statement of what our government reperesents and the empty promise of federal equal protection for people of color or at risk from gender violence.<br />
Ugarte, Summer 2006, “Reconstruction Redux:Rehnquist, Morrison, and the Civil Rights Cases,” “In 2000, the…eye to gender violence.”<br />
<br />
This official statement requires us to intervene in each instance – the alternative is condoning the message of inferiority, hatred, and contempt communicated. Only the plan removes this statement of racism.<br />

OBSERVATION 2 SOLVENCY<br />
<br />
First, only the plan solves – seriously, the plan pretty much rocks it<br />
Hallock 1993 Indiana Law Journal, “Adoption of Title III, civil rights claims”<br />
<br />
The 14th amendment defense of the Civil Rights remedy allows the law itself and those who have been subjecy to gender based violence to communicate and transform the national understanding about what is acceptable and normal behavior in gerags to gender<br />

<br />
Initially note that the Morrison decision invalidated a civil rights remedy which allowed victims of gender-based violence to bring civil rights action against their attackers in federal court. This action marginalizes the issue of gender violence in the court system and underscores the need for a starting point for legal reform<br />
<br />
Deborah M. Weissman Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law. , 2001 September Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly: Between &quot;The Truly National and the Truly Local&quot; Boston College Law Review 42 B.C.

needed to transform the legal culture as it relates to violence against women.<br />
<br />
The inability of the court systems to deal with gender-based violence is that it as seen as a private matter and thus the province of state courts. This type of violent dichotomizing obscures violence against people who are attacked because they are considered women as a class- not individuals- and forcloses the possibility of exposing patriarchal power relations<br />
<br />

Weissman Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law. , 2001 September Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly: Between &quot;The Truly National and the Truly Local&quot; Boston College Law Review 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081 [l/n]<br />
2. Domestic Violence as Private Matters<br />
Domestic violence cases suffer as a result of the courts' general dislike for matters involving personal problems. n187 Courts equate domestic<br />
<br />
This view of women as participants solely in the private sphere is the modern-day incarnation of coverture; the doctrine by which women received no legal identity separate from their fathers or husbands. The refusal of the state to act in stopping violence against women maintains the structural subordination of women within the family unit<br />
<br />
Isabel Marcus &quot;Reframing &quot;Domestic Violence&quot;: Terrorism in the Home; The Public Nature of Private Violence 11, 20-23 ( M.A. Fineman and R. Mykitiuk, eds.) 1994<br />
coverture was a designation of limitation and exclusion. it encoded<br />
beliefs regarding women's capacity and competence to act in the world.<br />
<br />
The Morrison decision has symbolic ramifications as well- just like the Confederate flag, the symbols of political expression can serve to legitimize the views they represent<br />
<br />
Alberto B. Lopez 2001 (J.S.D. Candidate, Stanford Law School, J.S.M., Stanford Law School, J.D., Indiana University School of Law-Indianapolis, M.S., University of Notre Dame, B.S., Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, The George Washington Law Review, 69 Geo. Wash. L. Rev. 251)<br />
In addition to throwing out the written law embodied in the VAWA, the Morrison decision diminishes the symbolic value of the law - a crucial aspect of the law in general.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan:The United States Supreme Court should overrule US v. Morrison on the grounds that it violates section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Clarification could occur.<br />
<br />
The refusal of the courts to intervene in gender-based violence only legitimizes the abuse. Civil litigation allows women to gain access to the crucial resources needed to make choices about ending abusive relationships and facilitates a transformation in legal culture<br />
<br />

Weissman Associate Professor of Law and Director of Clinical Programs, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law. , 2001 September Gender-Based Violence as Judicial Anomaly: Between &quot;The Truly National and the Truly Local&quot; Boston College Law Review 42 B.C. L. Rev 1081 [l/n]<br />
&quot;Individual women,&quot; as James Ptacek observed, &quot; are assaulted by individual men, but the ability of so many men to repeatedly assault, terrorize, and control so many women draws on institutional collusion and gender inequality.&quot; n409<br />
<br />
Only the federal court system is able to challenge the notion that women are solely private actors— the plan is a necessary step to rewriting the law to critically examine what has always been considered as solely &quot;family law&quot;<br />
<br />
Judith Resnik, Arthur Liman Professor of Law at Yale Law School , Excerpts from &quot;'Naturally' Without Gender: Women, Jurisdiction, and the Federal Courts,&quot; New York University Law Review , 66 (December 1991), pp. 1682-1767<br />
Second, this less visible relationship between women and the federal courts is supported by pervasive ideological, legal, and sociological assumptions and actions. Women, seen as actors in private rather than public life, are assumed primarily to interact with law as wives, mothers, and victims of violence, some of which occurs inside homes but does not deserve the gloss of the word &quot;domestic.&quot;<br />
<br />
The civil rights remedy provided by the plan is comparably superior to all legal alternatives- it avoids the gender bias inherent in most police work and prosecution by putting the victim in control of the litigation, it avoids the common prejudice of state and local legal systems by allowing the suit to be presented in federal court and it sends a societal signal about the seriousness of gender-based violence.<br />
<br />
W. H. Hallock 1993 (J.D., 1992, Indiana University School of Law at Bloomington, Indiana Law Journal, 68 Ind. L.J. 577)<br />
Adoption of Title III of the VAWA would help address the inequalities faced by women in state court systems by providing a civil rights action with federal court jurisdiction.<br />
<br />
The civil rights remedy is able to challenge the notions that violence against women is essentially private and that it is a trivial social matter<br />
<br />
Sarah F. Russell Yale Law School, J.D. 2002 COVERING WOMEN AND VIOLENCE: MEDIA TREATMENT OF VAWA'S CIVIL RIGHTS REMEDY 9 Mich. J. Gender &amp; L. 327 2003 [l/n]<br />
Much of the violence that women experience is in the home or by people they know. n385 Historically, states defined this violence as a &quot;private&quot; or &quot;interpersonal&quot; problem that was beyond the law's reach. n386<br />
<br />
Ruling on the Fourteenth Amendment is uniquely key to restoring Congress' potential to craft civil right legislation for women<br />
<br />
Catharine A. MacKinnon, 2000 (Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law, The University of Michigan Law School , Harvard Law Review , 114 Harv. L. Rev. 135)<br />
Part of the doctrine of the Civil Rights Cases fell when Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. 135 held that private racial discrimination in housing could be constitutionally actionable under 42 U.S.C. 1982 on the authority of the Thirteenth Amendment.<br />
<br />
Recognizing Morrison as an equal protection issue is crucial to ability to transform the way society views violence against women and women as social actors<br />
<br />
Sally F. Goldfarb 2000 (Associate Professor, Rutgers University School of Law-Camden; Visiting Associate Professor, Harvard Law School, Spring 2001. B.A. 1978, J.D. 1982, Yale University , West Virgina Law Review, 102 W. Va L. Rev. 499)<br />
A. The Unique Value of a Federal Civil Rights Remedy<br />
What was at stake in Morrison was nothing less than the recognition that [*538] gender-motivated violence is not merely an individual crime or a personal injury, but an assault on a publicly shared ideal of equality . 309<br />
<br />
Ruling on Equal Protection recognizes the prevalence of sexual violence to those who have membership in the group &quot;women&quot; and corrects many of the enforcement and prejudice problems endemic to state action<br />

Pol. &amp; Civ. Rts. L. Rev. 707 Spring, 2004<br />
Rehnquist's opinion in Morrison concluded by stating that if the allegations were true, &quot;no civilized system of justice could fail to provide [Brzonkala] a [*719] remedy ... . But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia ... .&quot; n54 Yet Congress had reviewed the difficulties that rape victims found in bringing successful rape claims in state courts. Prosecutors might be reluctant to file charges.<br />
<br />
We do not claim to solve all gender violence but rather that our plan takes a stance against the current exclusion and marginalization of women and especially battered women from the legal sphere. Only by embracing the transformative potential of the law can we create a starting point for wider social change<br />

Our affirmative is a radical dissent against conventional social norms in the form of a Supreme Court decision. This form of dissent is comparatively better than a theoretical alternative crafted by university professor dissenting elites because it forces people to reconsider their preconceptions about the issue even if they disagree with it<br />
<br />
Heather K. Gerken, Assistant Professor of Law, Harvard Law School. &quot;Dissenting by Deciding&quot; Stanford Law Review 57 Stan. L. Rev. 1745 May , 2005<br />
Acting radically versus speaking radically. The more interesting question is whether acting radically is different from speaking radically . Is dissenting by deciding different from publicizing a dissenting view, the other choice available to a conventional dissenter? After all, there are many avenues for making disagreement public that do not involve rendering a decision.<br />

<h2 id="toc25"><a name="x-Michigan Abortion Aff"></a>Michigan Abortion Aff</h2>
<br />
Michigan: Casey Aff<br />
<br />
Contention 1: The Advantage is “Rolling Back Roe”<br />
<br />
First, Casey’s undue burden standard pushes indigent women to the margins by refusing to acknowledge financial strain as a legitimate obstacle to accessing the right to abortion – the result is the creation of an institution of class privilege within the feminist move for reproductive liberty<br />
Karst 2002 (“Poverty and Rights: A Pre-Millennial Triptych,” Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics &amp; Public Policy, 2002, 16 ND J.L. Ethics and Pub Pol’y 399, Lexis)<br />
<br />
“Within a decade, the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade… who claims to believe in ‘equal justice for poorand rich, wake and powerful alike.’”<br />
<br />
Each of the abortion restrictions allowed post-Casey uniquely target under-privileged women…<br />
A. 24-hour waiting periods unfairly punish disadvantaged women by placing insurmountable obstacles in their attempt to get abortions – and then bombards them with false information in an attempt to “persuade” them to give up on abortion<br />
San Antonio Current 2003<br />
(Laura M. Fries, “The Texas legislature is trying to make it impossible for women to receive abortions. Surprise: They’ve almost succeeded. Aborting the right of choice,” August 6, 2003, Genderwatch)<br />
“It has been 30 years since Roe v. Wade… How do they have the credibility?’”<br />
<br />
B. Informed consent laws are uniquely sexist and dangerously misleading – they insult women and then feed them lies forcing women to go through with the pregnancy<br />
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution 2005<br />
(Cynthia Tucker, “Can’t trust women to think clearly on issue? That’s crazy,” Feb. 2 2005, Lexis)<br />
“Despite their accomplishments in fields dominated by men… too hysterical to make reasoned decisions about their health.”<br />
<br />
C. Parental Notification laws force young girls in violent homes into desparate situations where they give themselves abortions resulting in death – any States CP doesn’t solve because those laws aren’t enforced and the Congress is going to implement the Child Custody Protection Act, preventing underage girls from being able to go across state lines to get an abortion without their parents<br />
NARAL 2005<br />
(“Mandatory Parental Notification Notice and Consent Laws Burden the Freedom to Choose,” NARAL Pro-Choice America, December 19, 2005, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/Abortion-Access-to-Abortion-Young-Women-Parental-Consent.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/files/Abortion-Access-to-Abortion-Young-Women-Parental-Consent.pdf</a>)<br />
“Ideally, loving parents should be involved… able to affect all women.”<br />
The impact is that free, functional, and accessible abortion rights to all women is critical to preventing patriarchal, white-supremacist, classist domination of society<br />
Greenberg 1998<br />
(“25th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade Choice and Women’s Liberation: Abortion Rights and the Fight to Defeat the Reactionary Agenda An Open Letter to the Pro-Choice Movement,” January 18, #940, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rwor.org/a/v19/940-49/940/mlg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rwor.org/a/v19/940-49/940/mlg.htm</a>)<br />
“All in all, women are being made… beating back this larger reactionary program.”<br />
<br />
Calling attention to these politics of domination is key – dehumanization, famine, ecological devastation, oppression, and nuclear annihilation are all inevitable absent the creation of a more inclusive feminist politics – making your DA impacts inevitable<br />
hooks 1989<br />
(talking back: thinking feminist, thinking black, Pg 19-22)<br />
“We live in a world of crisis… to which she will have the power to dominate.”<br />
<br />
Even if no one gets an abortion the point of eliminating anti-abortion restrictions is that they are an integral component of the conservative Right’s attempts at subjugating women and pushing them out of society – opening the door to a new style of hyper-conservative State politics<br />
Greenberg 1998<br />
(“25th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade Choice and Women’s Liberation: Abortion Rights and the Fight to Defeat the Reactionary Agenda An Open Letter to the Pro-Choice Movement,” January 18, #940, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.rwor.org/a/v19/940-49/940/mlg.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rwor.org/a/v19/940-49/940/mlg.htm</a>)<br />
“This is the situation we face. And we have to take it on… go up against this movement and everything it stands for.”<br />
<br />
And, the plan’s “consent-to-pregnancy” reasoning transforms the undue burden standard and reconceptualizes the debate about abortion by making it about positive rights and an affirmative State obligation to provide abortions for millions of women-of-color who exist outside the realm of white and class privilege<br />
Roberts 1997<br />
(“NOW Reframing Abortion Rights Briefing on “Breaking the Abortion Deadlock, From Choice to Consent”” January 21, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.now.org/issues/abortion/mcdonagh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.now.org/issues/abortion/mcdonagh.html</a>\)<br />
“Well, I think Eilleen is the best person… And that is what I hope this conversation will initiate.”<br />
<br />
Ignoring this systemic racism means being complicit with Spirit Murder – Spirit Murder flips presumption in favor of the affirmative – identifying Spirit Murder as a tangible “impact” is necessary to preventing the annihilation of humanity<br />
Williams 1987<br />
(University of Miami Law Review, 42 U. Miami L Rev. 127, September)<br />
“There are certain societies that define the limits of life and death… what precious little humanity we have left.”<br />
<br />
And, hampered abortion rights force low-income women to do anything to get funds for an abortion – this pushes them into a cycle of poverty, unstable psychological and physical strain, and even suicide<br />
Kay 1994<br />
(“If Men Could Get Pregnant: An Equal Protection Model for Federal Funding of Abortion Under a National Health Care Plan,” Brooklyn Law Review, Spring 1994, 60 Brooklyn L. Rev. 349, Lexis)<br />
“The hardships which low-income women encounter as a result of the government’s refusal… face more of the hardships caused by a denial of federally funded abortion services.”<br />
<br />
This forced choice of poverty denies personhood and dignity – it is corrosive to the very being of those who suffer it and destroys their possibility of meaning within society<br />
Williams 1997<br />
(“Hegel’s Ethics of Recognition,” p. 245-247)<br />
“Hegel presents an important portrait of what… and the general Anerkanntsein is thereby undermined.”<br />
<br />
The Plan: The Supreme Court of the United States sould overrule its decision in Plaaned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania et al. v. Casey, Governor of Pennsylvania, et al. (SOS U.S. 833), which established the “undue burden” standard for abortion regulations, holding that restrictions on abortion are unconstitutional under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, guaranteeing that an individual has a right to abort a fetus in the event of a nonconsensual pregnancy.<br />
<br />
Contention 2: Solvency<br />
<br />
Using a constant basis for abortion makes women constitutionally and socially empowered – consent deconstructs traditional gender roles, creating constitutionally and socially empowered agendas<br />
McDonagh 1999<br />
(Albany Law Review, “MY BODY, MY CONSENT: SECURING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION FUNDING,” 62 Alb. L. Rev. 1057, L/N)<br />
“Similarly, some may think that is diempowers a woman to depict her as a victim… in the ongoing struggle for women’s rights. n239”<br />
<br />
And, a consent-to-pregnancy justification compels the State to provide funding for abortion; only the plan names the injustice of unconsensual pregnancy, negating the silence surrounding the issue and transforming the gendered nature of law and society<br />
McDonagh 1996<br />
(“Breaking the Abortion Deadlock: From Choice to Consent,” p. 177-178)<br />
“While many people labor to obtain autonomy and self-reliance for women… An abuse cannot be fought until it is understood as an abuse.”<br />
<br />
And, the plan’s confrontation with Casey’s undue burden standard is key…<br />
<br />
A. The other branches of the Federal Government can’t solve – Casey’s undue burden standard uniquely invited the States anti-abortion forces to ram through anti-choice legislative measures – only the plan can solve this<br />
Cavendish 2002<br />
(“Unburdening the Right to Abortion: Casey’s Undue Burden Standard Casey Reflections,” American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 2002, 10 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 305, Lexis)<br />
“State legislatures have accepted Casey’s invitation… such crimes are especially egregious harms to the woman herself.”<br />
<br />
B. The States can’t solve – Casey’s weak pro-abortion jurisprudence invites the Congress and the President to rollback abortion rights<br />
Cavendish 2002<br />
(“Unburdening the Right to Abortion: Casey’s Undue Burden Standard Casey Reflections,” American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law, 2002, 10 Am. U.J. Gender Soc. Pol’y &amp; L. 305, Lexis)<br />
“The Future For Choice… these states would likely support such restrictions. n49.”<br />
<br />
And, even if “woman” is a cultural construction we still need to push forward with our criticism because it attempts to deal with the individuals who are AFFECTED by this construction<br />
Dalton 1993<br />
(“Where We Stand,” Feminist Legal Theory: Foundations, 1993, Pg. 36-37)<br />
“For, as helpful as it is to be remind… in which we have a special competence, and a special stake.”<br />
<br />
The construction of new norms can be empowering – brown’s desire to engage in politics independent of metaphysics is a utopian pipedream that undercuts the effectiveness of any feminist political strategy guaranteeing the continuation of oppressive conditions<br />
Schwartzman 2002<br />
(“Feminist analyses of oppression and the discourse of “rights”: A response to Wendy Brown,” Volume 28, Issue 3, Proquest)<br />
“The second reason that Brown seems to have for rejecting feminist attempts… and constructing less oppressive more egalitarian norms, practices, and institutions. 47”<br />
<br />
The Court is key to changing cultural attitudes – a social signal for equality can only be sent by the cultural attitude of the court – it is as important as legal reasoning<br />
Bhagwat 1998<br />
(Connecticut Law Review, “Hard Case and the (D)Evolution of Constitutional Doctrine,” 30 Conn. L. Rev. 961, L/N)<br />
“Perhaps the most substantial problem with the modern Supreme Court’s… has a responsibility to articulate those values with clarity and vigor.”<br />
<br />
Forced pregnancy is ethically bankrupt – it severs the connections between pleasure and free choice – creating a uniquely amoral institution that hinders personhood<br />
West 1997<br />
(Caring For Justice, 1997, Pg. 106-107)<br />
“there is, consequently, a psychic dimension… Pregnancy thus undermines personhood.”
