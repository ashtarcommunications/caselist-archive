Pitts FM Neg<br />
Round 7 NDT<br />
Vs Team: Weber State CD<br />
Judge:<br />
<br />
Case Args:<br />
1. Turn: The system of eschatology at the heart of belief in religion justifies suffering – our focus on the end of history and a time of ultimate redemption allows us to accept injustice now, stripping meaning from life as treat our lives as temporary gifts that are beyond the scope of our responsibility. This turns back their impact calculus arguments as well as their nihilism claims.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Their impact calculus argument is false – individual autonomy gives us a justification for morality because we accept as a corollary of our own freedom that others must be free as well – in other words, a respect for autonomy is a prerequisite for ethics because any act presupposes it. Assuming that we can take action from a universal starting point is self-referential.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Religion is no longer a universal point for action – it has become fragmented and individualized<br />
<br />
Rebecca French 2003 Professor, SUNY Buffalo School of Law] “Shopping for Religion: The Change in Everyday Religious Practice and its Importance to the Law” 51 BUFFALO L. REV. 127<br />
<br />
The sphere of religion has been equally… This religion is invisible because it is personal.<br />
<br />
4. Religion is commodified within capitalism now, turns the case<br />
<br />
Rebecca French 2003 Professor, SUNY Buffalo School of Law] “Shopping for Religion: The Change in Everyday Religious Practice and its Importance to the Law” 51 BUFFALO L. REV. 127<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, religion itself can become a commodity for sale on the market…sound system and giant TV screens. n207<br />

Pittsburgh FM Neg<br />
(vs. Morrison Samford Aff)<br />
Same off case as before on caselist (legal k, must rule on test case procedural argument, judicial salaries, judicial capital)<br />
Collapsed most of block (all of 2nc) on legal k (vawa excludes lesbians, law excludes minorities, justifies heterosexist social norm, justifies state violence)<br />
1NC<br />
-legal enclosures undermine opposition to law – law is a hegemonic instrument<br />
- Identity politics as expressed in law are mapped ideologically<br />
- the aff is reformist – the alternative is to affirm the affirmative outside the framework of the law and position the judge as an organic intellectual<br />
-organic intellectualism solves major social problems<br />
2NC overview<br />
Law is constitutive and repressive and constructs our social relations. We understand ourselves as “married, “living in Allegheny county,” etc. We have several specific VAWA links to the legal exclusions of sexual minorities, poor women, and expecting women to act as victims to gain remedy. Identity politics in the courts leads to state hegemony. 2 impacts. 1. their harms are a farce and are inevitable features of legal violence. 2. law makes us all slaves and outweighs their impacts. The organic intellectual affirmation of the plan outside the legal framework solves and increases social dissent.<br />

JUDICIAL CAPITAL:<br />
We’ve run two scenarios, EPA v. MA and EPA v. Defenders of the Wildlife<br />
<br />
<br />
Judicial Capital 1NC – EPA V. MA<br />
<br />
A. Uniqueness<br />
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear Massachusetts v. EPA. A decision in favor of the states is key to federal emissions regulations. The court is currently favoring the states<br />
<br />
Washington Post 2006 (June 27, “High Court to Hear Greenhouse Gas Case; States, Groups Push for Regulation,” L/N) <em>Pitt- MF</em><br />

<br />
&quot;The Supreme Court took the case… affect every sector of the U.S. economy.&quot;<br />

C. Impacts<br />
1. A ruling in favor of the states is key to solve global warming- it will classify CO2 as a pollutant, sending a signal to state and international governments<br />

History bears out that desperate… at least for many decades.<br />
<br />
2NC:<br />
Minimalism is key to democracy- leaves issues open for deliberation<br />
<br />
Sunstein 1999 (Cass, professor of law at UChicago, One Case at a Time, p. 4) pitt-mf<br />
There is a relationship between judicial minimalism… unthinking hatred or contempt.<br />
<br />
Minimalism demands adherence to the passive virtues of narrow decisions and avoiding controversies<br />
<br />
Bateup 2006 (Christine, JSD Candidate at NYU School of Law, “The Dialogic Promise Assessing the Normative Potential of Theories of Constitutional Dialogue,” 71 Brooklyn L. Rev. 1109, p. lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
In contrast to the theories examined above… the issue of principle &quot;remains in abeyance and ripens.&quot; <a name="r75"></a><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://web.lexis-nexis.com/universe/document?_m=8bb532192264674d0ed9780612a7d80b&amp;_docnum=13&amp;wchp=dGLzVzz-zSkVb&amp;_md5=675cb35dc01e987b84f455860d2c1ed7#n75" rel="nofollow">75 </a><br />
<br />
Media/academic commentary is exaggerated- court’s overrules this term will not be controversial- overrules will only occur when precedent has already been weakened<br />
Sedler 2006 (Robert A., professor of law at Wayne State University, “The Supreme Court Will Not Overrule Roe v. Wade,” 34 Hofstra L. Rev. 1207, p. lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
The most important component in Supreme Court… been on the Court at the time of the decision.<br />
<br />
Roberts will lead the court to decided PBA case on narrow grounds<br />
<br />
Rosen 2006 (Jeffrey, professor of law at GWU, Dec. 11, The New Republic, “Partial Solution,” p. lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
In his questions on November 8, Roberts seemed… Roberts embraced in his confirmation hearings.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUIRIN CONGRESS CP:<br />
Case-by-case nature of Supreme Court rulings means they can’t provide an overarching and specific policy for Guantanamo and as such do not send a signal that the US is complying with international law. Congressional legislation provides the best blueprint for protections afforded to detainees and sends a strong international signal<br />
<br />
Rooney 2006 (Heather L., JD Candidate at Drake University Law School, “PARLAYING PRISONER PROTECTIONS: A LOOK AT THE INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SUPREME COURT DECISIONS THAT SHOULD BE GOVERNING OUR TREATMENT OF GUANTANAMO DETAINEES,” 54 Drake L. Rev. 679, L/N)</em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
<br />
Will this question of whether the status… cooperation both at home and abroad.<br />
<br />
<br />
MORRISON 13TH AMDT CP:<br />
<br />
13th amendment counterplan solves the public/private divide, frames domestic violence as a human rights abuse, and cannot be struck down under Morrison’s Commerce Clause and 14th amendment holdings<br />
<br />
<br />
Tsesi 2004 (Alexander, visiting professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, “Furthering American Freedom: Civil Rights &amp; the Thirteenth Amendment,” 45 B.C. L. Rev. 307, p. lexis) <em>pitt-mf<br />
<br />
Contemporary civil rights initiatives… Thirteenth Amendment even more important. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="https://sslvpn.pitt.edu/universe/,DanaInfo=web.lexis-nexis.com+document?_m=d018d515db9adfa90cc49985e63f5950&amp;_docnum=1&amp;wchp=dGLbVzz-zSkVb&amp;_md5=6ba63c124204795a2ddd8224e304e22a#n12n12" rel="nofollow">12</a><br />
<br />
Re-enacting VAWA through the 13th will not be struck down- Morrison precedent does not threaten the CP<br />
<br />
Perone 2006 (Angie, JD Candidate at UC Hastings, “Unchain My Heart: Slavery as a Defense to the Dismantle of the Violence Against Women Act,” 17 Hastings Women’s L.J. 115, p. lexis)</em> pitt-mf<br />
<br />
Finally, the civil rights remedy encountered… the Violence Against Women Act.<br />
<br />
MILLIKEN BAN CARS CP:<br />
Text: The United States Congress should pass legislation that bans the use of personal automotive transportation use in all urban and suburban areas of the United States. All federal funds used to subsidize automotive manufacturing and urban transportation infrastructure should be reallocated to develop heavy rail metro services or other comparable public transportation systems. Enforcement guaranteed. Future speeches will clarify.<br />
<br />
<br />
Competition: The counterplan does not link to any of the disadvantages or other criticisms by refusing to endorse Supreme Court action.<br />
<br />
Solvency:<br />
<br />
1) Freedom of movement offered by the automobile is the root cause of the need to push school integration as a partial remedy. Our counterplan solves the entire impact of your case AND the reason that school desegregation needs to happen<br />
<br />
Rae – 2001 (Douglas W., “VIACRATIC AMERICA: Plessy on Foot v. Brown on Wheels,” <em>Annual Review of Political Science</em> 4, June, p. 417-38)<br />
At the twenty-first century's dawning, <u>the very limited efficacy… perpetuation of advantage.</u><br />
CP solves racism better by confronting racial profiling in addition to school segregation<br />
<br />
Meehan and Ponder – 2002 (“Race and place: The ecology of racial profiling African American motorists,” <u>JUSTICE QUARTERLY</u> 19 (3): 399-430 SEP 2002)<br />
In this article, we present data… blacker area of the same community.<br />
<br />
CASEY PRO-LIFE ABROGATE STARE DECISIS CP:<br />
THE NECESSARY AND PROPER CLAUSE GIVES CONGRESS THE POWER TO ABROGATE THE STARE DECISIS EFFECT OF CASEY—YIELDING THE SAME RESULTS AS OVERRULING THE CASE<br />
<br />
Paulsen, University of Minnesota law prof, 00 [Michael Stokes, “Abrogating Stare Decisis by Statute: May Congress Remove the Precedential Effect of Roe and Casey”, Yale Law Journal, May, lexis nexis<em>wpdu cw]<br />
<br />
By virtue of the Necessary and Proper Clause… rationale of the earlier precedent.<br />
<br />
<br />
CASEY PRO-CHOICE STATES CP:<br />
After Casey, the best strategy for protecting reproductive rights is in state courts- not federal constitutional protection<br />
<br />
O’Neill [law prof @ Cleveland-Marshall] 1993<br />
(Kevin Francis, also the State Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, “The Road Not Taken: State Constitutions As an Alternative Source of Protection for Reproductive Rights,”</em> New York Law School Journal of Human Rights<em>, Fall, page Lexis) /Pitt-MPB.<br />
<br />
Lawyers seeking constitutional protection… that may be applicable to abortion regulations. n11<br />
<br />
“THE GIFT” K:<br />
A) Link: The plan’s extension of rights to the disempowered is a ruse. Laws intended to empower minorities are narcissistic gifts.<br />
<br />
BRUCE A. ARRIGO and CHRISTOPHER R. WILLIAMS 2000 “The (Im)Possibility of Democratic Justice and the 'Gift' of the Majority”</em> Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice, <em>Vol. 16 No. 3, August 2000 321-343</em>wpdu-jmm<br />
<br />
Derrida’s explication of the gift provides an insightful metaphor… furtherance of a cultural politics of difference and recognition.<br />
<br />
<br />
B) Impact: ONE – This inauthentic gift of rights engages in an economy of calculation that makes true justice impossible<br />
<br />
BRUCE A. ARRIGO and CHRISTOPHER R. WILLIAMS 2000 “The (Im)Possibility of Democratic Justice and the 'Gift' of the Majority” <em>Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice,</em> Vol. 16 No. 3, August 2000 321-343<em>wpdu-jmm<br />
This is the relationship between the gift and justice… . have anything up my sleeve” (p. 149).<br />
<br />
TWO – the economy of calculation is the zero-point of the holocaust<br />
<br />
Michael Dillon [Univ. Lancaster] 1999 “Another Justice”</em> Political Theory <em>27.2 (April) pg 155-175</em> wpdu.jmm<br />
<br />
Economies of evaluation necessarily… bringing an end to the requirement for decision.<br />
<br />
C) Alternative: “ Reject the narcissistic gift of rights and embrace a cultural politics of difference rooted in contingency.”<br />
<br />
BRUCE A. ARRIGO and CHRISTOPHER R. WILLIAMS 2000 “The (Im)Possibility of Democratic Justice and the 'Gift' of the Majority” <em>Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice,</em> Vol. 16 No. 3, August 2000 321-343//wpdu-jmm<br />
This re-presentation of equality, this justice… forever deferred, displaced, fractured, and always to come (Derrida, 1997).
