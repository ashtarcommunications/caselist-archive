<h2 id="toc0"><a name="x-Texas State – KCKCC, Round 5"></a>Texas State – KCKCC, Round 5</h2>
Tournament: KCKCC<br />
Division (Varsity/JV/Novice): Varisty (but really JV)<br />
Round: 5<br />
Affirmative Team: KCKCC BT<br />
Negative Team: TSUSM CP<br />
Judge: Carolyn, Vandy<br />
<br />
Affirmative Read: Milliken<br />
<br />
1NC Offcase Arguments:<br />
Be as detailed as possible. Just saying &quot;Topicality&quot; isn't particularly helpful. There needs to be some indication as to what the violation is. Try to include an outline of each argument that includes a tag for every card. Whenever you hear an argument that you have not previously heard, you should get complete cites for that argument and include them here.<br />
D-SPEC: docket spec – when will it be heard<br />
Delay CP (after midterms):<br />
Hollow Hope: overview – this is all discourse, Milliken doesn’t get overturned, so these DAs won’t happen. Not trying to solve for all racism, just start something with the ballot (one brick, one stone); this is just a slap in the face to all the victims of racism; Rosenberg is an idiot<br />
Midterms-Santorum: cross apply overview from HH about discourse<br />
<br />
<br />
1NC Case Arguments:<br />
List all the arguments that the negative makes on inherency, each advantage, and solvency.<br />
Lots of it came down to case args about education cirricula being racist/based on white normativity (I’ve got these cites and will add some stuff to my K)<br />
<br />
Negative Block Went For:<br />
D-SPEC: docket spec – when will it be heard: they did have good block answers &amp; there was some stuff about Barron ’86 playing by your own rules is narcissitic &amp; that leads to violence<br />
Dropped CP<br />
HH just to keep the impacts<br />
Midterms-Santorum: they met the discourse framework, called the 1NC their advocacy &amp; when hog wild on the impacts to not cleaning up Chesapeake Bay (somehow the efforts are modeled by Russia and stopping leads to nuc war)<br />
<br />
2NR Went For:<br />
Midterms<br />

The affirmative’s use of visual metaphors in legal discussion upholds a privilege of vision.<br />
<br />
Hibbitts 1994 (Bernard, “Making sense o metaphors: visuality, aurality, and the reconfiguration of American legal discourse.” 16 Cardozo L. Rev. 229. Lexis)<br />
<br />
While Amerian legal discourse has embraced a range of figurative expressions evoking all sorts o sensory experience…………”black letter” rules.<br />
<br />
The linguistic privilege of vision in lw is the root and justification of all forms of oppression and marginalization<br />
<br />
Hibbits 1994 (same)<br />
<br />
The traditional visuality of ……in their own images.<br />
<br />
Reject the affirmative’s ue of visual metaphors in legal discussion. Instead, embrace a shift towards aural metaphors, which focus on the other senses and remoe the predominance of the visual. Our change in the composition of metaphors is necessary to change the conditions and value of society as a whole.<br />
