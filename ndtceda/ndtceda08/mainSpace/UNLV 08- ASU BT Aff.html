 Contention 1: The Omission of Gender<br />
<br />
U.S. agricultural policies obscure, devalue and strip womyn voices on the international stage- while subsidies continue to put womyn at a disadvantage in the cotton industry it also provides a catalyst for war and ethnic conflict. <br />
<br />
Sciullo 2006 (Nick, B.A., University of Richmond; J.D., West Virginia University College of<br />
Law “This Woman’s Work” In a “Man’s World”: A Feminist Analysis of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002”, 28 Whittier Law Review 709)<br />
<br />
Several structural barriers, … persons in many respects <br />
<br />
Additionally, this devaluation equates to invisibility- while furthering the framework power relations of the patriarchal agenda- subsidies render gender, particularly the feminine, invisible and thus visits acts of violence upon them <br />

<br />
The 2002 Farm Bill … aspects of womynhood.<br />
<br />
And, we control your objectivity claims, by rending gender invisible you obscure reality– this makes it impossible to determine what is actually true or not<br />
<br />
Peterson and Runyan, 1999 (V. Spike and Anne professor of political science at the University of Arizona and professor of women’s studies at Wright State University,, Global Gender Issues, 2iid edition, p. 39-41)<br />
<br />
The dichotomies of sovereignty-anarchy… are produced by.<br />
<br />
Additionally, masculinity dictates current knowledge forms- you have to be supremely suspicious of all their claims- wither it be based in data or other empiricist methods we’ve already indicted their epistemology <br />
<br />
Sylvester 1994 (Christine, Professor of Politics and International Relations at Lancaster University, Feminist Theory and International Relations in a Postmodern Era, p.10)<br />
<br />
Feminist empiricist epistemology…gendered canon is cleared. <br />
<br />
The ultimate impact is extinction—the dysfunctionality of patriarchy guarantees continued violence, war, and environmental destruction, making any impact inevitable. Only moving away from this system can create opportunities for survival.<br />
<br />
Warren and Cady 1994 (Karen, Duane Professors of Philosophy at Macalester College and Hamline University. “Feminism and Peace: Seeking Connections.” Hypatia. Vol. 9, Iss. 2; pg. 4 Spring) <br />
<br />
Proquest The notion … national, and global contexts.<br />
<br />
Thus the plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its agricultural support, at least eliminating nearly all of the domestic subsidies for wheat, rice and corn by all necessary means. <br />
<br />
Contention 2: A Gender Lens<br />
<br />
First, now is the key time-failure to rescind grain in agricultural subsidies will only further the domination of women-critical analysis must take place<br />
<br />

Law “This Woman’s Work” In a “Man’s World”: A Feminist Analysis of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002”, 28 Whittier Law Review 709)<br />
<br />
Now more so …oft-discussed in the legal literature.147<br />
<br />
Overcoming gender inequalities in the economy and analyzing gender in IR will allow a reconceptualization of security –This challenges power relations which are the causes of injustices existing in the status quo <br />
<br />
Tickner 1992 (J. Ann, Professor of International Relations at USC. Gender in International Relations: Feminist Perspectives on Achieving Global Security, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciaonet.org/book/tickner/</a>) <br />
<br />
If, as I have argued, … has been defined. <br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, incremental reforms are necessary to undercut the advancement of patriarchy and lead to the betterment of feminist policy making<br />
<br />

Law “This Woman’s Work” In a “Man’s World”: A Feminist Analysis of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002”, 28 Whittier Law Review 709)<br />
<br />
Policy … must start somewhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, examining grain commodities under the umbrella of subsidies allows us to bridge international feminism - it allows us to reframe our politics and understand the intersectional ties of gender in other issues like sexuality, race and economic lines<br />

<br />
The 2002 Farm Bill … investigates their intersections.<br />
<br />
Additionally this uniquely allows us to understand the political- reality is opened when we interrogate such intersectional ties and opens new alternatives for individual security <br />
<br />
Peterson and Runyan 1999 (V. Spike, Professor of Political Science at University of Arizona and Anne Sisson, Director, Center for Women’s Studies at University of Cincinnati, Global Gender Issues, p. 50-51)<br />
<br />
Politics itself has … other important realities.
