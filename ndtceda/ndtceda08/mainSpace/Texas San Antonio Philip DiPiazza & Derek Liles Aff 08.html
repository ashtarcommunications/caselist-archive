 Sing O muse of the tragedy of Afghanistan, and of the sacrifice of his beloved Iphigenia <br />
<br />
Ovid Metamorphoses, Humphries, 1955, Pg 285-287 <br />
<br />
The narrative surrounding diplomatic and international relations is the story of sacrifice. Where the very construction of an international order is dependent upon the ability to choose. The International community’s daily smooth functioning is based on the calculative logic that chooses which sovereign entitles to recognize aid ally with which to ignore what countries should be destroyed <br />
<br />
Derrida explains in ’95, The Gift of Death, Pg. 84-87 <br />
<br />
The concept of responsibility…part nothing more than a murderer? <br />
<br />
How much of international relations have changed since the days of antiquity? Stuck without wind, unable to help his brother Menalaous-Agamemnon couldn’t leave for troy. In order to set sail and gain favorable winds he offered his daughter, Iphigeni, up as a sacrifice. When the ships finally sailed to Troy it was assume that the God’s were appeased. By this economy of sacrifice doesn’t end here. When Agamemnon returned home his wife, Clymestra and her lover Aegisthus killed Agamemnon to avenge Iphigea. Later, Orestes (Agamemnon’s son) killed his mother and her lover in order to avenge his father. Perhaps this all started with a boast, hubris, the killing of one of Arthemis’ dears, of the rape of Helen, but the idea that the economy of sacrifice is unending as long as the sacrifice is able to be justified and moralized. Agamemnon’s actions served as a sort of way to moralize morality- that in order to fulfill his ethical duty to his bother a sacrifice is needed and is justified by the overall good. It is this unproblematized idea of morality that facilitates war.  <br />
<br />
Tracy Strong comments on this moralizing of morality in 2003, Nietzsche and Legal Theory Part I- Where are we when we are Beyond Good and Evil, Cardozo Law Review, January 2003, 24 Cardozo L. Rev. 535 <br />
<br />
Thus, Nietzsche’s opposition to a faith in morality…..and then an eternity of deadly silence. <br />
<br />
In light of this revelation it is necessary to recall another story of sacrifice.  <br />
<br />
Genesis 22:1-19 <br />
<br />
Some time later, God tested Abraham’s faith…..continued to live. <br />
<br />
In deciding how to act it is important to recognize that every decision is locked into an economy of sacrifice. What then is needed is action that sacrifices the very sacrifice of ethics, of an immediate action that demands no condition and calculation. This is the difference between Agamemnon and Abraham. Agamemnon’s sacrifice of his daughter is calculative-her life is weighted against the lives that can be saved by sailing to troy sooner. Agamemnon’s action is invariably caught up in the sacrificial logic of ethics where as Abraham sacrifices ethics in his action and accepts responsibility for the possible sacrifice of Isaac. When go calls upon him to act, Abraham responds by saying “I am here”. <br />
<br />
This year’s resolution calls upon us, the individual debater to make a similar sacrifice. We can choose an ethic that is in line with Agamemnon or Abraham. In answer to the hail of the resolution. (Insert Resolution) We respond with “yes.” This unconditional affirmation is a gift of death that accepts responsibility for all other actions that could possibly be taken, that the prefer ability of ends is impossible to know before an action is important. Instead of calculating and choosing a why to our affirmation- we choose to affirm the resolution such and sacrifice any ethical determinations. <br />

Dennis Keenan builds on this sacrifice in 2005, The Question of Sacrifice, Pg. 150-152. <br />
