 <strong>Imminence K</strong><br />
The calls of the affirmative to the ideal morality or community reduce agency to a deal letter<br />
Smith 2007 (Daniel W., <em>Deleuze and The Question of Desire: Toward and Immanent Theory of Ethics</em>, Parrhesia, 2007, pg. 68)<br />
<u>What an ethics of</u> … <u>raise to infinity</u>.<br />
Desire is always motivated by our social location. To appeal to the systems of the 1ac is to fool yourself into thinking a rational choice is possible. This very call to action is mediated by the system that we operate in – we are debate machines<br />
Smith 2007 (above, 68)<br />
First, there is … <u>fresher than fresh</u>.<br />
Their action is actually a reaction to importance. Their advocacies are underpinned by acts of self-deification. This reversal of the self god slave master relationship is the distinctive mark of the humaistics atheist. Actions predicated on this reversal will always fail to subvert the logic of repression and will continually reify the economy of domination.<br />
Taylor 1984 “Erring: A postmodern a/theology.” 23-25<br />
Though assuming multiple guises…the emergence of modern technologies.<br />
We prevent the very technological thinking of “means-ends” thought and provide space for an alternative thinking beyond utility. Nazi Germany made all of Europe into means toward the end of “Liebensraum”<br />
George Therel Epslin 2004 (Beating off Teleology: A defense of Non-productive Thought, Filiment, volume 3)<br />
However, too simply … <u>profligate purposelessness</u>.<br />
Our impact is the logic of utility – the logic of the aff is one of utility- to love the cow for its milk is to colonize the other<br />
Seulemonde Undated (http:/www.cas.usf.edu/journal /taylor/works.html)<br />
Both <u>economies</u> … <u>otherness colonized</u>.<br />
It is not a question of What <em>must</em> I do but what <em>can</em> I do. Exploding limits is a necessary gesture for granting agency through immanent ethics<br />
Smith 2007 (above, 67)<br />
In Spinoza…<u>”can do”?</u><br />

Round # 3<br />
<br />
Vs Team: Denver MW<br />
<br />
Judge: Nielson, Foy, Pang<br />
<br />
Off Case Args:<br />
<br />
Very Few Cards - Read a K about the positioning of the 1AC in relation to the ballot. Their argument is just that the aff conflates desire with truth. They think the ballot should be a question of true or false. In order for a debate to occur we need to question how we relate to history and then use it to relate to the discussion the first place.<br />

<br />
You say you want a revolution, well you know we all want to change the world – your rev however is bullshit. Masters and Slaves are simply inverted<br />
<br />
Deleuze 1962 (“Nietzsche and Philosophy”) 9-10<br />
<br />
Furthermore, we must ask…find the slave.<br />
<br />
Looking for self in other is the manifestation of a need for pure presence, however, an existence without loss is concomitant with death and results in weak nihilism<br />

NDT Round the First<br />
Bard HL Neg v. Cal BP (Syria Golan Aff)<br />
<br />
1NC:<br />
Rapture DA - The rapture is coming now. CE stops it. Rapture solves eternal damnation.<br />
<br />
Metaphysics K (very few cards)<br />
Aff's conception of policy action is rooted in dogmatic metaphysics<br />
Taylor 84<br />
(Mark C., Erring: a postmoder a/theology, Univeristy of Chicago Press, pg. 23-5)<br />
Though assuming mulitple guises...the birth of the soverign self.<br />
<br />
Utilitarianism should be rejected - death is and should be evaluated as a personal experience.<br />
Seulemonde No Date<br />
(www.cas.usf.edu/journal/taylor/works.htm)<br />
Both economies...its otherness colonized.<br />
<br />
Liberate from truth and desire - Role of the ballot is to evaluate the 1AC in terms of truth and false.<br />
Aff can't prove that their 1AC is true, therefore vote Neg.<br />
<br />
Block Cards:<br />
Looking for the self-in-other is the manifestation of a need for pure presence, however, an existence without loss is concomitant with death and results in weak nihilism<br />
Taylor 84<br />
(Mark C., Erring: a postmoder a/theology, Univeristy of Chicago Press, pg. 29)<br />
We have seen that... appears to be nihilism<br />
<br />
Knowledge oriented rhetoric allow us to use the acquisition of knowledge as a way to respond to our most pressing questions of actions. It opens up more options than the naive and nihilistic Eristic<br />
Hikins 95<br />
(James W., Nietzsche, Eristic and the Rhetoric of the Possible, Quarterly Journal of Speech, pgs 353-377)<br />
In the twentieth century we have...more robust than for the Eristic<br />
<br />
More Hikins ev<br />
These questions characterize...availability of other options<br />
