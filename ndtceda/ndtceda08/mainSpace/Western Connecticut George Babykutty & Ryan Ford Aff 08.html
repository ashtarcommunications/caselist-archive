<strong>AFF:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Contention One: Inherency</strong><br />
<br />
Currently seven billion dollars in subsidies are given as marketing loans that need to be paid back with interest<br />

<br />
And, Commodity loans are among the most major farm subsidies in the US and are increasing in importance<br />

<br />
<strong>Contention Two: The Ethics of Recognizing the Other</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
The kind of moneylending and demanding interest back exemplified by Federal Commodity Loans is the root cause of our current economic failure, inflation, unemployment, and of all wars.<br />

<br />
And moneylending promotes an absolutely unethical relationship with the Other because it is an uneven exchange—banks take without giving and producing something on their own.<br />
Van Dyck in 2008 (Christopher , Essayist and Philosopher, www.christophervandyck.com/o/node/174)<br />

<strong>Contention Three: Avoiding Eternal Damnation</strong> <br />
<br />
Moneylending for profit is the most insidious and evil practice of capitalist societies and leads to perpetual poverty and sinfulness <br />
Courtenidge in 1999 (John, British Labour Party Member, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.interestfreemoney.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.interestfreemoney.org/</a>)<br />

And, those who lend money for interest will be condemned to eternal damnation <br />

<strong>UNDERVIEW: FRAMEWORK</strong><br />
<br />
College debate values empirical argument over religious values, which it presumes to be non-rational, teaching debaters to reject claims of damnation as &quot;non-verifiable&quot; while accepting the cult of science by not recognizing that claims about extinction and nuclear war are equally based in an unverifiable prediction of a future outcome. We argue that the judge should recognize the other by privileging religious arguments.<br />
The only way to have an ethical policy decision is to use convictions based in religious faith<br />
Cauthen in 2001<br />
<br />
Religious arguments are key to democracy; they ground political discussion in a public sphere<br />
