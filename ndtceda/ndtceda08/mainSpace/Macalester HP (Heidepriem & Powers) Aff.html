Case: Morrison (Federalism)<br />
<br />
Structural Necessity CP<br />
<br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should grant certiorari to an appropriate test case and clarify its holding in United States v. Morrison by replacing the substantial effects test with a four-prong structural necessity test to determine the scope of Congress’ authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution.<br />
<br />
1. The Supreme Court Should establish a Four-prong necessity test, remedying the vagueness of a current case law that makes federalism declines inevitable and allowing congress to act when necessary<br />
<br />
New Mexico Law Review 321, Spring, l/n)<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately, Commerce Clause cases… which actually drive Commerce Clause.”<br />
<br />
1. Merely allowing VAWA will justify future destruction of federalism… only the four part test will enable the problem to be solved while a federal balance is preserved<br />
<br />
Harsch 99 (“Brzonkala, Lopez, and the Commerce Clause Canard: A Synthesis of Commerce Clause Jurisprudence,” 29 New Mexico Law Review 321, Spring, l/n)<br />
“VAWA poses serious concerns… substantial limitation on the power of the federal government.”<br />
<br />
1. Plan destroys court legitimacy by creating the perception of politicization… only the counterplan’s firm standard restores credibility<br />
<br />
Harsch 01 (“Finding a Sound Commerce Clause Doctrine: Time to Evaluate the Structural Necessity of Federal Legislation,” 31 Seton Hall L. Rev. 983, l/n)<br />
“The Court’s inability to find… tarnishes the reputation of the Court.”<br />
<br />
1. Court legitimacy is key to stop expansion of executive powers<br />
<br />
Moe and Howell 99 (“Unilateral Action and Presidential Power: A Theory,” PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY v. 29 n. 4, December, pg. 850)<br />
“If Congress cannot stop presidents… it can set these boundaries as narrowly as it likes.”<br />
<br />
1. Unchecked executive power inevitably leads to a global nuclear war<br />
<br />
Ball 87 (Weber Studies, Fall 1987, Volume 4.2, Review Essay of To Chain the Dog of War: The War Powers of Congress in History and Law)<br />
“Left unchecked by voices arguing… America in a calamitous, nuclear war.”<br />

Extensions:<br />
<br />
1) Overturning Morrison Destroys the Federal Balance<br />
Glendon 99 (“Brief Amicus Curiae of Women’s Freedom Network on Behalf of Respondents,” On Writ of Certiorari to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, December 19, l/n)<br />

<br />
2) Plan opens the floodgates for any federal legislation, infringing on all areas of state law<br />
