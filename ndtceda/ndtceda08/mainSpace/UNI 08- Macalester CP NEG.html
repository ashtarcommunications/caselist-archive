<strong>Courts Counterplan</strong>:<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), on the grounds that the decision violates the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, holding: (1) that agriculture is an exclusively state issue, and (2) that biofuels, Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, corn, cotton, dairy, fisheries, rice, soybeans, sugar, and wheat subsidies are illegal.<br />
<br />
Court should eliminate with Wickard, key to substantive federalism.<br />
Jim Chen, James L. Krusemark Professor of Law, university of Minnesota Law School, “Filburn’s Legacy,” Emory Law Journal, v. 52, 2003, p. 130-133<br />

Wickard is the key precedent for agricultural subsidies.<br />

<br />
Extension of the commerce clause over agriculture is a landmark of deference, reversal is a shift.<br />
Jim Chen, James L. Krusemark Professor of Law, university of Minnesota Law School, “Filburn’s Legacy,” Emory Law Journal, v. 52, 2003, p. 150-151<br />

<strong>Elections DA:</strong><br />
The Economic Crisis has shifted the election momentum back to Obama, who leads in the polls and all the important factors. Absent a significant event to shift momentum, he will win.<br />

<strong>Psychoanalysis K:</strong><br />
The Affirmative’s direction towards food supplies and hunger addresses a root question of subjectivity- criticizing the failure of farm policy to achieve universal abundance is not only structurally impossible but makes the idea of ending hunger into an object which stands in the way of our fantasy of wholeness.<br />
Jenny Edkins, Lecturer at University of Wales, Whose Hunger? Concepts of Famine, Practices of Aid, 2000, p. 123-124<br />
<br />
This creation of lost wholeness is ultimately responsible for the possibility of violence. Those who stand in the way of our fantasy become worthy of destruction and elimination.<br />
Slavoj Zizek, “Ideology between Fiction and Fantasy,” Cardozo Law Review, 1995, p. lexis<br />
<br />
Our criticism also reveals why they cannot access their impacts. The affirmative assumption of a simple cause and effect function of subsidies is not only wrong, but reflective of a general ideology which ignores the necessity of evaluating our justifications and methodologies. The affirmative is guaranteed to fail on its own account. We must not be afraid to focus on theory.<br />
Nick Srnicek, “Complexity and the Food Crisis,” The Accursed Share, May 13th, 2008 (<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://accursedshare.blogspot.com/2008/05/complexity-and-food-crisis.html" rel="nofollow">http://accursedshare.blogspot.com/2008/05/complexity-and-food-crisis.html</a>)<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to reject the idea implicit in the affirmative that one must identify within the boundaries of the system, Instead we make the impossible choice of the act, which recognizes the lack inherent in the false choice of our subjectivity and reorganizes the coordinates of the world. Only this impossibility can deal with the fact that within the current structure revolution will never occur.<br />
Zizek 2000, [Slavoj, “Class Struggle of Postmodernism? Yes, Please!” Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contermporary Dialogues on the Left, New York City: Verso, 2000]<br />
