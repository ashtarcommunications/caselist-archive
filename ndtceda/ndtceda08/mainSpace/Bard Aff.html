Args about totality are non-responsive- failed to address analysis- calculations are only bad when they’re not in a specific form<br />
<br />
Contradicts their capitalism K<br />
<br />
Solve for calculation idea-denies our need to calculate<br />
DO not deal with supreme court definition<br />
<br />
Marxism argument- no correlation between explanation of capitalism- need to analyze the state within the context of our own lives- net benefit to the permutation<br />
<br />
Rely on notions of race- sex- and gender-<br />

Capitalism is synonymous with calculation and they don't solve<br />

<ol><li>Extra T – plan text is actually topical- just is the resolution- does not directly stem- just exclude portions- fail to run a severance test- did not prove how abusive in the round- no lack of fairness in the round- if they concede standards no reason to vote on T. Drop their GSpec arguments- make 2 stare decisis args- stare decisis is bad because it decreases calculatability – reasonability standard Extra T- drop standard for what plan is – plantext is what you say it is- essential for fairness- more than actual topic to link off of. Could just pic off of extra-t args- conceded that they violate own voter abuse story by running contradictory arguments</li><li>K- bright line wasn't articulated- drop perm</li><li>Case- cross apply solvency and 2AC overview with symbolic framework- Baudrillard says symbolic operation ought to be preferred ethical interpretations are preferred- Bevere proves severance from court in the 1ac.</li></ol><br />

*It is not enough to assume the legitimacy of an ethical claim. Any ethical claim is not fact and thus depends on the existence of some metaphysical conception of morality or human virtue. If this does not stem from the existence of some form of God then we must question from where our belief in ethics stems.<br />
