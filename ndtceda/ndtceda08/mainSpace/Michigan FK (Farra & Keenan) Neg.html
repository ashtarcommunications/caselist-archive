Michigan FK – Neg vs. Georgia State, Round 8<br />
Judges: Frappier, Blank, Gonzalez<br />
T 1NC:<br />
The Facial Neutrality/Disparate impact part of your aff was not a holding of the Morrison decision – it was one paragraph at the end of the 27 page decision – it is purely dicta and not part of the Court’s Section 5 holding<br />
Erin Rosen, 02 – 90 Calif L Rev 573<br />
“In United States…response to these questions”<br />
State Action DA:<br />
1NC:<br />
First, Morrison’s fourteenth reasoning is key to upholding the state action doctrine<br />
Francisco Ugarte, 06 – 41 Harv CR-CLL Rev 481<br />
“The Civil Rights cases…as in Morrison”<br />
Holding VAWA constitutional under equal protection would transform the state action doctrine, subjecting state inaction to scrutiny for failure to protect rights.<br />
Melinda Renshaw, 98 – 47 Emory L J 819<br />
“As noted above…of the Fourteenth Amendment”<br />
And, the state action doctrine is a key check on positive rights – without it equal protection cases would force total wealth equality, positive rights to everything and strike down all government policies with disparate impacts.<br />
Mark Tushnet, 04 – 92 Geo L J 779<br />
“this discussion leads to…is not responsible for them”<br />
Causes economic collapse – no incentive to work or invest.<br />
Christopher Coyne, 02 – “Inequality serves a social and economic purpose,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.mises.org/story/1090" rel="nofollow">__www.mises.org/story/1090__</a><br />
“Initially, we must ask…unique and unequal individuals”<br />
Growth solves multiple scenarios for war, disease spread, and famine – it is a pre requisite for solving any global problems<br />
Leonard Silk, 93 – Foreign Affairs 72:1<br />
“Theoretically there is no reason…economies and societies”<br />
2NC:<br />
The chief equal protection issue with VAWA is lack of state action – plan would remove this as a barrier to equal protection<br />
Marcellene Hearn, 98 – 146 U Pa L Rev 1097<br />
“There are legitimate state…refused to arrest him”<br />
Specifically VAWA remedies challenge this negative conception of the state<br />
G Kristian Miccio, 98 – 29 Colum Human Rights L Rev 641<br />
“The DeShaney decision…goodwill of the batterer”<br />
State action doctrine checks inaction suits – these would lead to redistribution of all social resources.<br />
Gary Goodpaster, 97 – 82 Iowa L Rev 645<br />
“Substantive equality…constitutes state action”<br />
Overturning state action means any policies which have disproportionate impacts on minority or gender wealth would be struck down. Free trade is such a policy.<br />
Karla Jackson, 02 – 4 Scholar 307<br />
“NAFTA proponents believed…divides within this country”<br />
Case:<br />
You can’t win uniqueness for your immunity advantage – numerous post-morrison decisions have decreased sovereign immunity<br />
a. Katz and Georgia<br />
Simon Lazarus, 06 – 56 Depaul L Rev 1<br />
“The two other…Justice O’Connor”<br />
b. Hibbs and Lane<br />
Erwin Chemerinsky, 06 – 21 Touro L Rev 787<br />
“Recently, however…courts is implicated”<br />
You can’t win a link – Morrison was not a sovereign immunity decision<br />
Michael Dorf, 02 – 88 Va L Rev 951<br />
“In assessing the…congressional authority”<br />
We’ll win a link turn – by not allowing remedies that target individuals the Morrison decision upholds the state action doctrine, which encourages congress to erode state sovereign immunity.<br />
Sally Goldfarb, 02 – 71 Fordham L Rev 57<br />
“The weakness of the Court’s…federal and state governments”<br />
Even if you win a link, your plan doesn’t solve it – numerous other cases that your plan doesn’t overturn have upheld sovereign immunity.<br />
Lori Buschbaum, 02 – 7 Mich St J Med &amp; Law 1<br />
“Parmet also posits that revent…Alabama v. Garrett”<br />
Independent Judiciary 1NC:<br />
War has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East – the risk of Shiite unification is high – the result would be widespread sectarian conflict<br />
Vali Nasr, 06 – “When the Shiites rise,” Foreign Affairs<br />
“The war in iraq…Sunni-dominated middle east”<br />
An independent Iraqi judiciary is vital to checking Shiite dominance.<br />
Alec Walen, 2003 – “Federalism for Postwar Iraq: How Federalism May Make Democracy Work,” Writ<br />
“The one faction that those…others in the region”<br />
US Judicial independence is key to Iraqi modeling<br />
Ruth Bader Ginsberg, 06 – 85 Neb L Rev 1<br />
“Essential to the rule…signals from other lands”<br />
Morrison is vital to judicial independence<br />
Bradley Joondeph, 01 – 62 Ohio St L J 1781<br />
“The Rehnquist Court’s decision in…plays the principal role”<br />
Shiite dominance leads to full scale civil war throughout the middle east<br />
Vali Nasr, 06 – “When the Shiites rise,” Foreign Affairs<br />
“Iraq’s troubles today offer…Shiites and Sunnis”<br />
Global nuclear war.<br />
Graham, 07 – “Beyond Quagmire,” Rolling Stone<br />

…ALL THAT IS LEFT IS DIFFERENCE, DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, DIFFERENT CULTURES, DIFFERENT STROKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS. THESE DIFFERENCE DON’T HAVE TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH DEBATE ABOUT WHAT IS TRUE OR FALSE, INSTEAD WE CAN JUST APPLAUD PLURALISM AND TOLERANCE. THIS IS THE LOGIC OF POST-HISTORICISM, THE END OF HISTORY, AND IT IS HERE THAT OUR KRITIK BEGINS.<br />
FIRST, THEIR MISTAKEN EMPHASIS ON DISCOURSE AND PERFORMANCE EMPHASIZES THE EFFECT OF THE SPEECH ACT ON TH ELISTENER – ACCORING TO THEIS FLAWED NOTION OF PERFORMANCE, EVERYONE WILL UNDERSTAND THE SPEECH ACT IN THEIR OWN UNIQUE LITTLE WAY, EVERYONE UNDERSTANS A TEXT DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT PEOPLE – DIFFERENT STORKES FOR DIFFERENT FOLKS<br />

“So why do many think Russia’s” … “indeed a worrying development.”<br />
<br />
<u>5- CP [Cites all taken from other people’s lower courts CPs on the casebook]</u><br />
All of the courts of appeal should overrule Casey on same grounds as the aff<br />
Underruling the SC by lower courts will increase legitimacy of the courts<br />
Denning and Reynolds 03 (Brandon and Glen, 55 Ark. L. Rev. 1253, Lexis)<br />
“While proposing a remedy for what” … “shortage of promising candidates.”<br />
<br />
Lower court underruling solves the case- it is effective judicial rethinking<br />
Caminker 94 (Evan, April, 46 Stan. L. Rev, 817, Lexis)<br />
“One argument against” … “interpretation of the Constitution.”<br />
<br />
<u>CASE</u><br />
Medicalize fetus- have to look at the gender lens it is more thorough interrogation in revealing moral status of fetus<br />
Katherine Lusby 92 (Toledo Law Review, “Self-Identification and the morality of Abortion”, Lexis)<br />
“If the woman’s view” … “informed by this knowledge.”<br />
<br />
Even if we lose that abortion is good fetal personhood reduces women to mere vessels and upholds patriarchy<br />
Rosalind Patchesky 90 (“Abortion and Woman’s Choice”, p. 345-346)<br />
“The doctrine of fetal personhood” … “human personhood of women.”<br />
<br />
Casey solves this- allows women’s voices to provide moral insignificance of the fetus<br />
Lusby, same as above<br />
“The woman-centered view” … “afforded a woman’s choice.”<br />
<br />
Psychoanalytic framework is bankrupt- you should reject it as a critic<br />

<u>Counterplan</u><br />
Went for the counterplan- read a lot of cards that the lower courts can overrule the supreme court. Casebook.<br />
<br />
<u>Court Politics</u><br />
Conceded the link- bell will win in the status quo, causes econ collapse and turns case. Prefer our specific scenario. Ethics not relevant to supreme court either.<br />
<br />
Capitalism good<br />
Growth good<br />
<br />
<u>Packing</u><br />
<br />
Didn’t go for it- counterplan solves.<br />
<br />
They link to enjoyment arguments- based on trying to control and eradicate for the purpose of human freedom. Still trying to impose freedom on others.<br />
<br />
No link between gay rights and human rights is not offense for them.<br />
<br />
Public right wing will have a massive victory<br />

Citizenship Clause CP<br />
Text: The United States Supreme Court should rule that the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment authorizes congress to pass the civil rights remedy of the violence against women act<br />
<br />
The CP solves the case – citizenship clause avoids all the legal pitfalls of Section 5 and the Commerce Clause but also is a perfect way to justify the civil rights remedy<br />
Rebecca E. Zietlow, 2000 (Associate Professor, University of Toledo College of Law. Yale Law School, University of Pittsburgh Law Review, 62 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 281)<br />
<br />
What civil rights … of federal citizenship. 292<br />
<br />
The CP solves your congressional power arguments – gives Congress power to legislate civil rights<br />
Rebecca E. Zietlow 2003 (Professor of Law, University of Toledo College of Law, Akron Law Review, 36 Akron L. Rev. 717)<br />
<br />
In the Twentieth … enforceable by Congress.<br />

State Courts CP<br />
Text: The supreme judicial body of each of the fifty states should rule that:<br />
<br />
State constitutions are a powerful vehicle for challenging abortion restrictions<br />
Vanzi in ‘96<br />
(Linda, J.D. from New Mexico School of Law and Clerk for the US District Court in New Mexico, New Mexico Law Review, “FREEDOM AT HOME: STATE CONSTITUTIONS AND MEDICAID FUNDING FOR ABORTIONS”, 26 N.M.L. Rev. 433, L/N)<br />
The challenges to … state constitutional guarantees.<br />
<br />
State courts dissenting from Supreme Court rights restrictions sustain a powerful social critique that stands as a bulwark against tyranny and shapes public and legal opinion<br />
Gardner in ‘03<br />
(James, Professor of Law at SUNY Buffalo, Georgetown Law Journal, “State Constitutional Rights as Resistance to National Power: Toward a Functional Theory of State Constitutions”, 91 Geo. L.J. 1003, L/N)<br />
Part II fits state … governments to suppress.<br />
<br />
Right Wing Moment D/A<br />
Liberals control the judiciary in the status-quo – they’ll use it to expand sexual rights and promote a liberal cultural agenda<br />
Brennan in ‘05<br />
(Phil, Trustee of the Lincoln Heritage Institute and a member of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers, “Judicial Activism = Judicial Tyranny”, January 6, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/1/6/91631.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2005/1/6/91631.shtml</a>)<br />
In his article … with judicial activists.<br />
<br />
Link – Overruling abortion rights would open the floodgates to the worst conservative nominees – Bush would pack the federal courts overruling decades of liberal predent<br />
Balkin in ‘05<br />
(Jack, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment at Yale Law School, Legal Affairs, “Should Liberals Stop Defending Roe?”, November 28, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://legalaffairs.org/webexclusive/debateclub_ayotte1205.msp" rel="nofollow">http://legalaffairs.org/webexclusive/debateclub_ayotte1205.msp</a>)<br />
Fourth, giving up … other constitutional questions.<br />

Impact<br />
Sexual privacy laws are key to check creeping totalitarianism<br />
Rubenfeld in ‘89<br />
(Jed, Associate at Wachtell, Rosen &amp; Katz, Harvard Law Review, “The Right Of Privacy”, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 737, February, L/N)<br />

Totalitarianism renders individuals docile subjects of state management – the impact is nuclear statism causing extinction<br />

Congress CP<br />
Text: Congress should deny the president authority to try enemy combatants by military tribunals<br />
<br />
The counterplan solves the case – after the Hamdan decision Bush needs congressional authorization for the use of military tribunals<br />
Sunstein in ‘6<br />
(Cass, Prof. Law @ Chcago, The New Republic, “THE COURT’S STUNNING HAMDAN DECISION”, 6-30, Google Cache)<br />
For much of … a genuine emergency.<br />

Disparate Impact D/A<br />
A. Uniqueness: The Court currently interprets equal protection claims under discriminatory intent – disparate impact is irrelevant<br />
Sezer in ‘95<br />
(L. Kent, General Counsel for the Illinois Human Rights Commission, in “Perspectives on the Politics of Abortion”, Edited by Ted Jelen, p. 158-159)<br />
The equal protection … of equal protection.<br />
<br />
B. Link and internal Link: The affirmative abandons the intent requirement which will be replaced with a disparate impact test. This test will be easily expanded to invalidate social programs.<br />
Yoav Sapir, Clarke Byse Fellow,LLM, and Teaching Fellow, Harvard Law School, 2003<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol19/sapir.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/vol19/sapir.pdf</a>.<br />
The main reason … proof of dis- crimination<br />

1. Specifically, Social security would be struck down<br />
Benson in ‘05<br />

Under the antidiscrimination … up the ante.<br />
<br />
2. Social security is key to economic growth<br />
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and Wealth in ‘99<br />

As shown in … stability and growth.<br />

3. The terminal impact is extinction<br />

b. Health Care DA w/ an Equal Protection Link<br />
c. Rule on 13th Amendment Grounds CP<br />
d. Federalism DA<br />
c. Case Defense<br />
<br />
We read a FT add-on that the 2NC felt the desire to spend quite along time impact turning. They had six or seven seperate scenarios.<br />
<br />
In the Quarters of Northwestern, We again rain our CIL Morrison affirmative.<br />
<br />
They went for a CP that ruled the preemtpion doctrine against CIL to solve that advantage. Went for Defense against our treaty powers advantage and a Judicial Federalism DA.<br />

The 1NC was:<br />
<br />
a. Topicality New Grounds<br />
b. Health Care DA (see above)<br />
