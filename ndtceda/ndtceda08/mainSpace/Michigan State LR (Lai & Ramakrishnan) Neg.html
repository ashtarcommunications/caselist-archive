“Because in it’s decision…considering the question for the first time.”<br />
The DOJ is pushing the court to reverse the lower court ruling and rule against Atlantic research<br />

Opposing the DOJ’s solicitor general requires court capital<br />

Pics Theory<br />
Counterplan<br />
The United States Supreme Court should uphold its decision in Ex Parte Quirin on the basis that overruling would undermine judicial deference to reliance interests. Deploying the technique utilized in the Great Northern Railway Company v. Sunburst Oil and refining company the United States supreme court will hold that a new rule is established dictating that in all future cases Courts should hold that persons who owe allegiance to the united states should be granted a writ of habeas corpus. The united states supreme court will announce that ex parte quirin precedent is no longer reliable and that relevant parties should be on notice that the reliance interests which cause it to uphold the decisions in this case will not apply to future challenges on the issue. The United States Supreme Court will not deny centiori in challenges on the issue.<br />
For all cases except for Ex parte quirin the United States Supreme Court will not overrule any of its prior decisions for the duration of the term. The United States Supreme Court will use the technique of “sunbursting”, explained above for all decisions which conflict with a prior supreme court precedent. The counter plan competes it does not overrule quirin it merely prospectively declares its intention to do so in future comparable matters.<br />
Cp solves the whole case the new standards set up by out counterplan will be applied by the court in future solves all their uncertainty and confusion arguments better than plan and results in the plan in a future case without undermining stare decisis. Auerbach 91 “Overruling” refers to retroactive…than it would otherwise be”<br />
The counter plan spurs a quick test case to test the new rule and the court will uphold the new rule in that test case. Rogers 68<br />
Stare decisis good stuff<br />
