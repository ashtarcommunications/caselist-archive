People’s Court<br />
<br />
The legal discourse employed by the affirmative is completely devoid of the immediacy and contingency of truly lived encounters – it severs the intersubjective link between self and other that is constitutive of authentic social existence.<br />
<br />
Gabel 84 Texas Law Review<br />
“The first point to be emphasized”…”the alienated role-performance”<br />
<br />
The Aff is nothing more than the performative rehearsal of empty social roles that allow us to hide from the pain of alienation – it is through the regular repetition of these performances that alienating ideology is reproduced.<br />
<br />
Same Cite<br />
“How can a group haunted by”…”proclamation of correct thought”<br />

CONGRESS CP<br />
Congress can use morgan powers to create legislatin pursuant to the 14th amendment. Legislation is necessary to solve racism, sexism and inequality. Judicial action has and will undermine the separation of powers and the constitution while precluding solvency<br />

“were congress to once again take up its sections….and aspirational purpose of congressional action”<br />

robin west, professor of law at Georgetown university law center, 1994. (progressive constitutionalism: reconstructing the fourteenth amendment p. 285)<br />
“by way of conclusion, let me briefly…rampant social and private in equality”<br />
<br />
A progressive congress would spark public discussion and dialogic exchange<br />
Robin west<br />
“second, if progressives were to reorient…audience of constitutional discourse”<br />
<br />
dialogic exchange in the public sphere is critical to social change and democracy—the counterplan solves the case better because it fosters understanding through discussions.<br />
Sonja K. Foss, professor of communication at the university of Colorado, 2002 (contemporary perspectices on rhetoric, 3rd edition, waveland press p.251)<br />
“for habermas, then communication action is the ultimate…decision making in the public sphere”<br />
