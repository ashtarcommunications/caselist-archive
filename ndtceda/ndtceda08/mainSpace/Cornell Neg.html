how their rationalie is within the ambit of the controversy they rule on<br />

“The nature of litigation”<br />
<br />
3 reasons to vote<br />
1) Fairness-forcing the affirmative to act on current cases and controversies is the only way to limit the topic<br />
2. Takes out solvency-without a case or controversy, the Supreme Court can’t take any action. The plan never goes into effecit—vote neg on presumption<br />
3. Sua sponte-if the court takes action without a case or controversy it acts sua sponte-this destroys the fabric of civilization and leads to anarchy<br />

Vacate and Void CP-<br />
The USSC will vacate/void the decision the plan overturns<br />
-Rule 60b is one means a decision can be vacated<br />
-vacate means void the decision<br />
-SC can render a decision void<br />
<br />
<br />
Topicality-<br />
Casey V Planned Parenthood set a judicial standard for what an<br />
overrule must entail.<br />
-each overrule must challenge the legitimacy of the holding<br />
-overrule must place a new standard<br />
-overrule must prove prior precedent is unworkable<br />
-overrule must clarify societal understanding<br />
<br />
Judicial Activism<br />
-supreme court has legitimacy now<br />
-overruling precedence kills legitimacy and stare decisis<br />
-activism destroys rights and snowballs<br />
