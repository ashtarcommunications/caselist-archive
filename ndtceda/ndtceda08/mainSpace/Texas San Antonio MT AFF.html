<span style="font-size: 11pt">We live in a world of technological growth-a quarter mile at a time, too fast too furious. But the technology we are concerned with is more than just a T9 calculator. It is fundamentally an essence, a way of disclosing the world to the human ego. “I think therefore I am” is the founding act of Cartesian subjectivity which enframes the world into an objective reality. The manipulation of the environment through contemporary agricultural practices reveals the earth as standing reserve; a resource to be exploited. As such, the problem of technology is the need for efficiency, productivity and sustainability.  </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt">Current agricultural practices are only used for managerial strategies. Technological enframing does not see the resolution as a way of returning ecosystems back to its natural state but instead as a way of sustaining the yields of production. Instances of rehabilitation for commodities only redirect and empower managerialism to regulated and rationalized containment of other commodities. Subsidies are only seen useful as much as they produce. This resourcification that subsidies abide to are cast in corporate administrative frameworks that seek to deliver supplies feeding the economy, governmental environmentalism and security.  </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt">As standing reserve, the natural world is reduced to abstract potential. In the end, humanity is absorbed within this technological ordering. This logic is essentially the same as that displayed in Nazi concentration camps. Driven by the need to control reality, technological thoughts enframe the world such that reality exists for the self. Exploitation and devastation invariably follow.  </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt">This is not a problem for which we must find a solution- rather it is an onotological conditions that requires a transformation of our understanding of being. What we need is not another change in our agricultural policy, but a revolution in how we understand and dwell within our world. Our affirmative is a precondition that enables the possibility for a paradigm shift toward a new way of being in the world, rejecting the compulsive will to act so as to question the structure of technological ordering and reveal previously unavailable paths of thinking </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt">Being totally free to question our existence is what allows us to achieve our destiny in life: Daseign or human being. Far from our fated mastery and domination of the planet, questioning who we are enables a new understanding of how to act in the world so as to not technically master existence.  </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt"> </span><br />
<span style="font-size: 11pt">As “rational” agency we are driven by pure utilitarian survival and calculative thought, seldom contemplating the mysteries of existence. But Daseign is a meditative being. Only through reflecting, questioning, and philosophical thought can we preserve that essence of humanity that makes our material existence truly meaningful. </span><br />

<span style="font-size: 11pt">Our Affirmative doesn’t reject technology as such, nor does it preclude certain political programs designed to help the earth. The problem is the technological thought and representation of the world as standing reserve, when mastery and management become the means to some human end. This does not mean that we simply think before we act, nor does it posit reflecting as a strategic prerequisite for politics. The goal is to integrate contemporary agriculture and environmentalism within a worldly dwelling that is not always already subordinated to human interests of technological mastery. </span><br />
