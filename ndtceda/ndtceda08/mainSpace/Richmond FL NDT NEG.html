Their Advocacy fails, it conceptualizes this, the university, the space in which it is situated as a sight for meaningful criticism. It is realty the modern university that makes that impossible, making all of their energy work against change and not for it.<br />

“Cal.1870. In an action0.majority of the present board”<br />
Commodified Dissent:<br />
The aff’s so-called radical act finds its underlying motivation in an outdated narrative from the 1960’s about who we need to fight and how we need to do it. The enemy is “the man” and the solution is to refuse to play their poltical game-to refuse, revolt, and beak all the rules. Their counter-culture ideal may have been radical in the 1960’s but no longer. Global capitalism is what we need to fight, and capitalism has noticeably changed. The logic of radical dissent that underwrites the affirmative I the exact same logic that allows globalized capitalism to thrive.<br />
Thomas Frank. 1997. “Commodity Your Dissent”.<br />
“the structure and thinking of American...prudes out in the heartland”<br />
the pathos of radical dissent and the method of cultural kritik that underwrite the aff comprise the exact same logic that allows globalized capitalism to thrive.<br />
