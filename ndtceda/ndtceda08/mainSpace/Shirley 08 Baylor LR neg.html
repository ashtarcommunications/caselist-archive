Off Case Args (Baudrillard K):<br />
<br />
The realms of the political and representation have failed. What good is liberation and freedom that are impossible to exchange? We no longer need to recognize ourselves as such to be what we fundamentally are. Your politics leads to a self despair that is violently suicidal and yet never redeemable.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 01 (Jean, “The Impossible Exchange.” Translated by Chris Turner. Pgs. 107-108)<br />
“Not only do people no longer want to be represented… any cause for which to sacrifice their lives.”<br />
<br />
The perfection of the subject is a subject with no other. The aff limits destiny only to a violent encounter with radical otherness. This means your life sucks.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 01 (Jean, “The Impossible Exchange.” Translated by Chris Turner. Pgs. 47-48)<br />
“In the final stage of his ‘liberation’… reference stage of the human being.”<br />
<br />
Your ethics operates outside the principle of duality. Attempts to ground the Other in a dialectic of the resolution with the One fails and destroys alterity, leaving only a mere phantom.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 01 (Jean, “The Impossible Exchange.” Translated by Chris Turner. Pgs. 100-101)<br />
“Similarly, you have to choose: either Heaven or Hell… the banal exchange of Good and Evil.”<br />
<br />
There is much more radical freedom in our equality before the rule than democratic equality before the law – only ours preserves the negativity that gives us psychological pleasure of any kind<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 01 (Jean, “The Impossible Exchange.” Translated by Chris Turner. No page number given)<br />
“Yet the idea of a society governed by chance… For reality is democratic, and illusion is aristocratic.”<br />
<br />
Rules are distinct from laws, based on constraints, not obligations. This is a distinction the aff does not understand, if you don’t like the rules, go home.<br />
<br />
Baudrillard 1990 (Seduction)<br />
“Ordinarily we live within the realm of the Law… obedience to the Law, or its transgression.”<br />
