<br />
Kritik—<br />
The concept of diplomacy has become over-determined by the over-arching control of legal institutions—the urge for diplomacy is built on the necessity of violent institutions to intervene and exert violence against the other<br />
Rozo, 2004, Forgiving the Unforgivable: On Violence, Power, and the Possibility of Justice, p. 24<br />
The importance of these…every solution of conflicts<br />
<br />
The affirmative makes ethics impossible and violence inevitable—externalizing ethics onto institutions is the worst form of violence because it exonerates individuals of responsibility for their relationship with the other which allows institutional violence across the board<br />
Rozo p. 19-21<br />
Within the legal…our most private conflicts.<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to reject the affirmative in favor of strategies outside the boundaries of the law<br />
Rozo, p. 25<br />
We have already…venture to say decontstructs it.<br />
<br />
EU CP—The neg affirmed the EU as the actor of the resolution<br />
<br />
Framework—aff must defend a plan—read some Shivley cards<br />
<br />
