Overruling is a punitive action aimed at reconstructing the way psychology and consciousness is related to the law. This combination of law and psychology inhibits a much needed reorientation toward the globe—Unique instances of reform won’t happen.<br />

“Well-,meaning efforts.. mystification of legitimacy.”<br />
<br />
The 1AC’s reliance on generosity and extension of legal rights results in total comination and control. Self-hatred is internalized resulting in the impetus of violence and war by devastating alliance-building.<br />
Khan ’94 “Lessons from Malcolm X: Freedom by Any Means Necessary” 38 How LJ 79<br />
“Malcolm identified two… of the entire group.”<br />
<br />
The affirmative argument that the political is not the focus of the 1ac is the premise of our whole argument. Their belief thath the political must remain in the background in order to generate change is the ultimate ethical sell-out.—admits their ethical posture is insufficient to create change. Only taking a leap of faith via the alternative solve sthe aff.<br />
Thurschwell ‘3 24 Cardozo L Rev 1193<br />
“Thus, as Derrida puts is… resembles pure faith.”<br />
<br />
There is no rule of law. The idea that the court precedent can create an improved world resultis in the destruction of the self and creares a dangerous form of ordering. Our kritik is a demand to resist the call to law as ethics. Only the denial of this call can avoid domination. The admission of rights allows them to be destructed.<br />
Litowitz ’97 “Postmodern Philosophy and the Law” p. 46-50<br />
“Nietzsche’s thoughts on… theory often fails to do.”<br />
<br />
Rights rhetoric will not break down the public private dichotomy—women may prefer the violence of their private relationships to liberal autonomy because it provide sthem nothng to connect to<br />

Victims and violence are not the only productws of our increasingly traumatic modern world. Indeed, the process of speaking out and speaking against the sources of violence may very well be he defining theme of our age. These discussions, however, continually circulate toward the discussion of particular institutional practices and their mediation of our relationships. The Aff poses question of ethics only insofar as it relates to the domain of politics. Tying ethical reorientation of ourselves wiht the reorientaiton of our collective political spheres takes precedence and in the process produces these ethics and our relaitonship with others merely as a background for political transformations. The aff makes the question not how much we can change ourselves but instead how we can change our institutions to change ourselves. This process produces mediated relationship that maeks genuine ehical engagement makes impossible Zupancic 00 ETHICS OF THE REAL: Kant and Lacan, pp. 10=11 , March 2000 &quot;In other words, one cannot attain the realm of the ethical. . . faculty of desire as a priori.&quot;<br />
<br />
affirmative focus on the material conditions that create oppression and suffering presupposes that we are inherently alienated from each by these conditions. this forecloses all possibility of ethical relationships to ohers not mediated by violence Oliver 01 Hypatia, 16.3 (2001). &quot;Martin Jay in his comprehensive study of vision. . . light, air, and touch in vision&quot;<br />
<br />
the impact to the affirmative's conception of ethics is the imposition of violence ordering upon the globe. Oliver 01, Hypatia 16.3 (2001) The Lacanian gaze is not the look of another person or another subject . . . do not recognize that makes recognition possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
our problem with liberal notion of justice is genealogy of evil emaciated bodies. Cheapen life. Language of moral wrong seemingly reject all ethical ideology. Abstract suffering Cooppression demonic figures bureaucracy enables us to persevere<br />
aff use of legal reasoning and instuttions of argument are in and of themselves violent. Second, the affirmaive use of pressure and depictions of violence are in and of themselves violent. By overshadowing individual responsibility for ivolence the Aff enacts a form of ideological violence that weaves violence into the very fabric of our consciousness. by Kappeler, THE WILL TO VIOLENCE 95, pp. 6-7 &quot;This means engaging also with the discourses. . . pressure and blackmailrefuing to fight back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our alternative is to divorce our ethical and political relationship to life and ohters from one that is premised on negation. This very process of our alternative enacts transofrmation that is integral to a reodering of the way global politics is made &amp; operates. The act of expanding the boundaries of Global compassion is a process of critical self-examination that is necessary complete challenge to domination and hierarchy. In short our alternative is the practice of freedom Oliver 01 Hypatia 16.3 (2001) Irigaray's suggestions about the possibility of loving looks. . . without giving up on one side or the other.&quot; love looks; posing love outside of domination.<br />

Our perception of the world does not come to us innocently from the mere facts of events. Instead, something we call the real mediates this perception. The real is not the reality lurking beneath representation of the world, but instead an excess or lack introduced in the very act of representation, and indeed the very act of forming the social order. Our society lurches forward from crisis to crisis: communities in decline, poverty, nuclear weapons, environmental destruction, etc., each time implicitly believing that each crisis is a historically specific situation that requires some minor corrective course of action. This perspective misidentifies the real as a historically specific situation rather than a feature inherent in the social edifice itself. Lurking beneath every fantasy of peace, stability, and resolution is a threat of disorder and chaos. Catastrophe always hovers; such is the nature of our being.<br />
Zizek 04, conversations with Zizek, p. 78-79<br />
“Here I would agree … inherent, self-blockade.”<br />
<br />
In order to protect ourselves psychologically from the traumatic effects of this ever-present Real, we have all acquiesced to the spell of ideology. Ideology works by constructing a fantasy of reality in which it is possible to overcome the inevitable crises generated by the Real. As a result, we have entered into a cycle of distance and proximity to the Real in which we wait anxiously until catastrophe confronts us as “on the brink,” and then we take some small corrective measure thereby deferring our reconciliation with catastrophe until the next time the threat emerges. This process of constant deferral prevents us from ever fundamentally reordering the world, and instead moves us toward a new world order which selectively constitutes groups of people to eliminate as barriers and risks rather than recognizing the intrinisically risky nature of the entire subjective venture.<br />

“The central issue is one of … supplement in today’s realpolitik.”<br />

The affirmative attempts at reform will fail. They are not radical enough to remain caught in the coordinates of the current system and stuck in the constraints of capitalism.<br />
Zizek 99 (The Ticklish Subject, p. 71-2)<br />
“In States of injury, Wendy … is the ultimate Oedipal myth…”<br />
<br />
The Alternative is an absolute withdrawal from the plan – this negative gesture wipes the slate clear of the real which is a precursor to any positive gesture. This acknowledgement is key to opening the absolute contraction of subjectivity.<br />
