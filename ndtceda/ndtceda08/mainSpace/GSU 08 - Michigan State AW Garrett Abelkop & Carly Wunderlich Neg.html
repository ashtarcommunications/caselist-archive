In a narrow ruling, the United States Supreme Court should hold that:<br />
state production taxes on Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations do<br />
not facially discriminate against interstate commerce because they are<br />
constitutionally equivalent to the severance taxes upheld in<br />
Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana.<br />
<br />

should enact binding policy establishing uniform taxes on Concentrated<br />
Animal Feeding Operations production, requiring that the rate of these<br />
taxes:<br />
&lt;&gt; be set, at a minimum, as the percentage of the value of production<br />
equivalent to the amount of federal Concentrated Animal Feeding<br />
Operations subsidies;<br />
&lt;&gt; rise or fall, at an equivalent rate, alongside changes in the<br />
amount of federal subsidies.<br />
