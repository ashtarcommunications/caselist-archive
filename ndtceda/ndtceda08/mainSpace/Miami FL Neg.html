LAT CRIT K<br />
The affirmative presents a distorted view of desegregation by failing to discuss latino segregation that shaped the movement their focus solely on telling Milliken narrative is a practice of academic colonialism that rewrites the history in black an white<br />
Perea 97 California Law Review<br />
The Stone Book contains absolutely no discussion…struggle for civil rights<br />
<br />
Their attempt to apply the black white model to achieve progress for other racial minorities destroys racial coalitions and disenfranchises all minority groups by forcing division based on identity<br />
Michigan Law review 06<br />
“an emerging racial paradigm…unable to recover”<br />
<br />
We should recognize the architecture of race that surrounds society and equality jurisprudence only such an examination can allow for multifarious identities to participate in discussions of race to allow for progress toward preventing racism<br />
Perry 05<br />
“ lat crit scholars have critiqued on the black white binary…not exclusively regarding race”<br />

AT: LINK BACK TO K – FOCUS ON LATS<br />
Only focus on lats because I’m latino<br />
K represents all minorities<br />
AT: WE RECOGNIZE LATS<br />
The mere recognition that latinos oppression doesn’t mean they don’t perpetuate black white paradigm<br />
“paradigms of race shape…slight concession to demographics<br />
<br />
Slight but significant acknowledgement is the underlying force behind the dominant b/w paradigm of race<br />
“this paragraph warrants further…in the black community”<br />
<br />
our critique is f the black white binary we use latinos as an example of a highly visible yet excluded group our critique is the only possibility for inclusion of all minority groups<br />
“another objective that critics…every racialized groups”<br />
