CONTENTION ONE: CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS<br />
<br />
THE MODERN POLITICAL STATE IS FOUNDED ON THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS – IN THAT THE IDEA OF MEAT CREATED THE NEED FOR STATE REGULATIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT THE HEART OF BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
YOUNG, 6 (UC Berkeley, ‘6 Katherine, Ph.D. Candidate Political Science Department Colorado State University, “Animal Politics: Sovereignty and the Animal Body,” Annual Meeting of the Western Political Science Association Albuquerque, New Mexico March 16-18, 2006, Http:<em>www.allacademic.com</em>meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/0/9/7/2/6/pages97264/p97264-1.php)<br />
<br />
“In Chapter VII… substantiate its power”<br />
<br />
INDEED – THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN ANIMAL AND HUMAN IS WHY WE ALL – BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN – LIVE AND DIE IN THE CONFINED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATION THAT IS BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
WADIWEL, 4 (Joseph W., doctorate candidate @ Univ. of Western Sydney, “Animal by Any Other Name? Patterson and Agamben Discuss Animal (and Human) Life”, Borderlands, 3:1)<br />
<br />
“14. It is perhaps… humanity or animal”<br />
<br />
BIOPOLITICS ROOTED IN THE ANIMAL-HUMAN DICHOTOMY ENSURES THE INEVITABLE EXTINCTION OF BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ANIMALS.<br />
<br />
COULTER, 5 (Gerry, Bishops Univ. Canada, “Intersections and Divergences in Contemporary Theory: Baudrillard and Agamben On Politics And the Daunting Questions of Our Time” International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 2 (July 2005)<br />
<br />
Agamben’s essay anticipates… Agamben’s earlier writings<br />
<br />
THE CONTINUAL FAILURE OF HUMANITY TO LIVE UP TO ITS NON-ANIMALITY ENSURES THE STATE OF EXCEPTION AT HEART IN MODERN BIOPOLITICS WILL ALWAYS EXIST – MEANING THERE WILL ALWAYS BE DEATH, EXCLUSION, AND WAR UNTIL WE GIT IT TO THE ROOT OF BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
OLIVER, 7 (Kelly, “Stopping the Anthropological Machine: Agamben with Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty”, PhaenEx 2, no. 2 (fall/winter 2007): 1-23)<br />
<br />
Agamben’s relation to… hope to stop it.<br />
<br />
PREFER OUR STRUCTURAL IMPACTS TO THEIR SPECIFIC DISADS – EACH LINK, INTERNAL LINK, AND IMPACT CLAIM IS ENFRAMED AND ROOTED IN THE RISK ANALYSIS OF BIOPOLITICIANS – THIS ENSURES EVERY QUEST FOR SECURITY OR LIFE ALWAYS ENDS UP WITH INSECURITY AND DEATH. MAKING DISADS INEVITABLE.<br />
<br />
DILLON, 5 (Michael, Lancaster Univ., “Cared to Death: The Biopoliticised Time of Your Life”, Foucault Studies, No 2, pp. 37-46, May 2005)<br />
<br />
Contra Ojakangas, then,… and disturbs you<br />
<br />
INDEED – TRYING TO AVOID A SPECIFIC EXTINCTION EVENT LIKE THEIR DISADS ENSURES ANOTHER ONE WILL POP UP – UNTIL ONE ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE – BIOPOLITICS.<br />

It might have… any other house<br />

PLAN: THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE SUBSIDIES FOR CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS BY ELIMINATING ALL SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.<br />
<br />
CONTENTION TWO: THE BALLOT<br />
<br />
OUR INTERPRETATION OF ANIMAL IN CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS INCLUDES BOTH HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ANIMALS - THIS THE BEST WAY TO FORCE OUR COMMUNITY TO CONFRONT THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL MACHINE BY TAKING DEBATES AWAY FROM HIGHLY TECHNOLOGIZED EMORY OR DARTMOUTH STYLE EQUIP ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT DISEASE OR MECHANIZED AGRICULTURE AFFS – SHIFTING IT TO AN ONTOLOGICAL FOCUS ON THE HUMAN-ANIMAL DICHOTOMY.<br />
<br />
STARBUCK, 6 (Jennifer P., Senior Lecturer in the Department of Drama, Theatre, and Performance Studies at Roehampton University, Theatre Journal 58.4, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v058/58.4starbuck.html0" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/v058/58.4starbuck.html0</a><br />
<br />
Revisiting the expansiveness… a becoming-animate<br />
<br />
THE ONLY WAY TO ESCAPE THE MODERN DAY CAFO THAT IS BIOPOLITICS IS TO REFUSE TO DRAW LINES OF ANY KIND BETWEEN ZOE AND BIOS – NOT ONLY MUST THIS REFUSAL TAKE PLACE ON THE TERM ANIMAL, IT MUST ALSO HAPPEN OVER THE TERM SUBSIDY MEANING WE MUST REFUSE THE SOVERIEGN IN TOTALITY OR NOT AT ALL.<br />
<br />

Relations in Centre for International Politics @ Univ. of Manchester, “Through the Wire: Relations of Power and Relations of Violence” Millennium: Journal of International Studies, 2005. ISSN 0305-8298. Vol.34 No.1, pp. 1-24)<br />
<br />
One potential form… or bare life<br />
<br />
CONFRONTING THE HUMAN-ANIMAL DICHOTOMY IN RELATIONSHIP TO SOVEREIGNTY IS THE BEST WAY TO RADICALY RUPTURE BIOPOLITICS.<br />
<br />
WADIWEL, 2 (Joseph W., doctorate candidate @ Univ. of Western Sydney, “Cows and Sovereignty”, Borderlands, 1:2)<br />
<br />
16. To the extent… by both entities<br />
<br />
MAKE NO MISTAKE VOTING AFF DOESN’T PASS OUR PLAN, DOESN’T PUT YOU ON THE PETA PICKET LINES, NOR DOES IT BRING AN END TO THE STATE. AN AFFIRMATIVE BALLOT IS PRECISELY HOW WE AS A DEBATE COMMUNITY ESCAPE THE MORAL REGULATION AT HEART IN BIOPOLITICS AND PRECISELY HOW WE FOSTER AN ETHICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR ANIMALITY. SOCIETY DOES NOT CHANGE FROM PLEES TO THE MASTER TO PULL OR STOP PULLING THE LEVER, BUT FROM LOCAL INTERROGATIONS OF THE HUMAN-ANIMAL DICHOTOMY.<br />
<br />
SMITH, 2 (Mick, Division of Sociology Univ. of Abertay, Dundee, Scotland, “The Ethical Space of the Abattoir: ON the (In)human(e) Slaughter of Other Animals”, Human Ecology Review, Vol. 9, No. 2, 2002)<br />
<br />
What does it… of animal Others<br />
<br />
IT IS THIS VERY ETHICAL COMPONENT OF OUR 1AC THAT CAN END THE ANTHROPOLGICAL MACHINE FROM WITHIN – PUTTING ABSTRACT NOTIONS OF FIAT, AGENT COUNTERPLANS, OR POLITICS PROPER FIRST ENSURES BIOPOLITICS WILL RECONSTITUTE ITSELF IN EQUALLY HORRIFIC WAYS.<br />
