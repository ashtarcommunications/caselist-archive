<br />
Text: The United States federal government should initiate negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran.<br />
<br />
In the negotiations, the initial move of the United States federal government’s negotiating strategy should be the offer of normalization of diplomatic relations, including a pledge not to pursue regime change, between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States in return for verifiable agreement from the Islamic Republic of Iran that they will not produce nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
If Iran agrees, the United States federal government should further offer the Islamic Republic of Iran a security guarantee and the possibility of lifting all or nearly all economic sanctions currently maintained on the Islamic Republic of Iran by the United States if Iran pledges to cooperate with the United States in efforts to address Iraq’s security and reconstruction needs, and if Iran ends its military and financial support to militias and criminal gangs.<br />
<br />
Status: Conditional<br />
<br />
Starting off by taking regime change off the table allows for the spillover in negotiations, ensuring cooperation with Iran on other issues.<br />
Mark Edmond Clark 04, Columbia International Affairs Online, December, “A Possible Path to Change in US-Iran Relations”<br />
“This past September, I visited Iran for two weeks….resolving issues must be explored”<br />
<br />
Its Net Beneficial—only the counterplan solves, since Iran won’t come to the negotiating table unless regime change is the <em>first issue</em> discussed.<br />
Jaap van Wesel, 11/13/2006, Washington Correspondent, The Jerusalem Report<br />
<br />
“In December 2003, one day after American troops in Iraq captured…Libyan case, but that is totally absent in U.S.-Iranian relations.”<br />
<br />
Taking regime change off the table means they cooperate on Iraq<br />
Dunn ‘07<br />

A2: Permutation—Do Both (Two for Two in One Exchange)<br />
<br />
1. severance<br />
<br />
Severance is bad<br />
<br />
2. Doesn’t solve<br />
a. sequencing is key—the two rounds of negotiations are key to getting two concessions from Iran. Packaging everything into one move means no progress<br />
Michael Watkins, Associate professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School and faculty member of the Program on Negotiations at Harvard Law School and Susan Rosegrant, 2001, casewriter at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard (<em>Breakthrough International Negotiation</em>, p. 22-23)<br />
<br />
“Will the process proceed issue by issue, or will multiple issues be dealth with…agree can help to seal a winning coalition.”<br />
<br />
b. This is especially true when it comes to Iran—they will try to get everything they can out of the negotiations<br />
Colin Dueck, assistant professor of political science @ university of Colorado, and Ray Takeyh, senior fellow in Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Summer 2007, [Political Science Quarterly, volume 122, number 2, summer “Iran’s Nuclear Challenge”]<br />
<br />
“The Concept of engagement through integration in relation to Iran has received growing attention in U.S. Foreign policy…Iran’s nuclear program well predates the current administration.”<br />
<br />
3. Moral Hazard-<br />
a. offering too much too soon incentivizes Iranian Aggression—it creates a moral hazard<br />
David Cortright, Fellow at Carnegie Institute 1997, (“Incentive Strategies for Preventing Conflict,” in <em>The Price of Peace</em>)<br />
<br />
“The greatest concern about incentives is that…appeasement and encouraging wrongdoing can be diminished.”<br />
<br />
b. This would make Iran confrontational, turning the case<br />
Patrick Clawson, senior editor of the Middle East Quarterly, is director for research at Washington Institute for Near East Policy, Middle East Quarterly, Winter 2007, Vol. 14, Issue 1<br />
<br />
“Such inducements will not lead Iran’s leaders to change their nuclear…the Islamic Republic should be confrontational rather than cooperative.”<br />
<br />
A2: Perm do the CP:<br />
<br />
1. Severs the strategy of the plan—plan is a strat of single condition,, cp is a strategy of reciprocal, multi-round Tit-for-tat strat. Doesn’t just add a move, but changes the order of linkages and uses a different opening move.<br />
<br />
Strategy matters—effects planning and implementation and different strategies are analytically distinct.<br />
<br />
2. Severs certainty of the plan<br />
<br />
3. Opening move dictates the mindset of the negotiation and controls the outocome—can only be one thing<br />
P. Terrence Hopmann 95, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences, Vol. 542, Flexibility in International Negotiation and Mediation, Nov, pg 24-47)<br />
“In short, whether the outcome of a particular negotiation reflects…between relative and absolute gains”<br />
<br />
4. Opening move is the most important part of a negotiation—they have to defend the strategy of the plan<br />
Christophe Dupont, and Faure 91, International Negotations, pg. 46<br />
“Another type of move is openers. The first offer is critical in creating …lead to agreement at a satisfactory level of profit.”<br />
<br />
A2: Say No<br />
<br />
1. Means plan solves less than CP—they’d say no to plan too, regime change is the most important issue.<br />
<br />
2. Iran says yes—regime change is the most important issue. Taking it off the table changes their security calculations, making cooperation beneficial, and empowers moderates to reclaim the debate (Aslan)<br />
<br />
3. They would say yes to both conditions—renouncing regime change spills over to cooperation on other issues.<br />
General William E. Odom 07, Foreign Policy<br />
“The policies designed to halt the spread of nuclear weapons…in the Middle East than U.S.-Iranian cooperation”<br />
<br />
4. Taking it off the table leads to comprehensive talks, agreemnt on iraq, nuclear, terror<br />
Scott Ritter 06<br />
“The solution to this problem is clear….something sadly lacking in Washington today”<br />
<br />
5. multi-step is key to middle eastern culture<br />
Ilai Alon and Jeanne M. Brett 07, Negotiation Journal 23 (1), 55-73<br />
“From a Western culture point of view…relationships, and gathering information”<br />
<br />
b. Culture and communication are essential to good negotiating<br />
Dupont and Faure, 91, (International Negotiations, pg 47-48)<br />
<br />
“Communication Variables. Communication and culture represent…throw light on these often neglected aspects.”<br />
<br />
c. Not changing the style causes negotiations to fail<br />
Stark and Flaherty 2003, Professional Negotiation Instructors, 2003<br />
<br />
“Successful negotiators have a positive vision of their…behavior style and the needs of their counterparts.”<br />
<br />
A2: Single Issue talks bad<br />
<br />
1. Dealing with specific issues, especially non-proliferation is a prerequisite to broader rapprochement – if we win the counterplan solves better for the nuclear issues, we solve their other advantages better.<br />
H.P. Goldfield, Vice Chairman of Stonebridge International, L.L.C. an international strategic advisory firm based in Washington, D.C. 2004, [Council on Foreign relations report, “Iran: Time for a New Approach,”]<br />
<br />
“We have had considerable experience, over…attempt to cement their political position long term.”<br />
<br />
2. Nuclear program outweighs—nuclearization tanks relations and exacerbates Iranian intransigence on all other issues<br />
Kenneth M. Pollack, Senior Middle East Fellow at the Brookings Institutions, <u>The Persian Puzzle</u>, New York, Random House 2004, page 381<br />
<br />
“Last on this list are Iran’s human rights violations. Amnesty…the other problematic elements of Iranian behavior.”<br />

Harvard Game K Cites<br />
<br />
First the Thesis: The outcome of any interaction between states is determined by the assumptions each side brings to the table—a context emerges because of how each side interprets the rules.<br />
<br />
Rational choice approaches which assume non-cooperation and divergent interests will create conflict; instrumental rationality required states to treat each other as enemies.<br />
<br />
The most important question is how the assumptions of the plan generate a conflictual interaction—out of which a certain context is guaranteed to emerge.<br />
Alexander Wendt 99 (Social Theory of International Politics pg. 331-332)<br />
Power relations play…anarchy they will make<br />
<br />
The link- The plan’s mechanism of diplomacy—negotiation and conditioning—relies on the assumption that the international arena is constituted by actors with the divergent interests who naturally do not want to cooperate. Not only is this assumption a construction—but it ensures conflict between states, even to the point where nuclear conflict becomes thinkable<br />
KM Fierke 98 Lecturer, School of Politics, Queen’s University (Changing Ganes, Changing Strategies p. 135-138)<br />
“Taylor (In Dallmayr…would be dismantled)”<br />
<br />
<br />
The impact: The assumption of divergent interests guarantees war and conflict—it institutionalizes violence in the relationship between the two actors.<br />
Bagshaw 2 (Director, Conflict Management Research Group, Univ. of South Australia, 2001 [Dale, “Challenging discourses on violence,” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.conferences.unimelb.edu.au/flagship/abstracts/bagshaw.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.conferences.unimelb.edu.au/flagship/abstracts/bagshaw.pdf</a>]<br />

Alt: The United States federal government should route a substantial posrtion of future distributions of its foreign assistance for Afghanistan directly to the government of Afghanistan in order to promote effective reconstruction of Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
Alt solves- The alternative changes the rules of the game for international relations—using the language of dialogue rather than of negotiation can shift how nations interpret each other<br />

<strong>CP text:</strong> <br />
the usfg should substantially increase its foreign assistance for Afghanistan and allocate it directly to the government of Afghanistan contingent on the use of funds to fulfill effective reconstruction in Afghanistan. No aid currently given to NGOs will be diverted or decreased. All new assistance will be provided by new appropriations.<br />
<br />
The usfg should require that any NGO receiving assistance from the united states for reconstruction in Afghanistan coordinate its programs and activities with the government of Afghanistan, and be subject to certification for accountability and efficiency. <br />
