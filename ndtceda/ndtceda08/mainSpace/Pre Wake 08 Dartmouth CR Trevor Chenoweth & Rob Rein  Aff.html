Contention One is Antibiotic Resistance<br />
Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations requires antibiotic use that is quantitatively and qualitatively unprecedented—it leads to the development of massive antibiotic resistance<br />
Stuart B. Levy, M.D., Professor of Medicine and of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance @ Tufts University School of Medicine and Staff Physician @ England Medical Center, President of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics, Fellow of the American College of Physicians, Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American Academy of Microbiology, President of the American Society for Microbiology, 1992 The Antibiotic Paradox: How Miracle Drugs Are Destroying the Miracle, Penguin Press<br />

PLAN:<br />
THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ELIMINATE AT LEAST NEARLY ALL OF THE SUBSIDIES FOR CONCENTRATED ANIMAL FEEDING OPERATIONS.<br />
<br />
Contention Four is Solvency<br />
Subsidies are key—there’s no other economic rationale for CAFO<br />
Union of Concerned Scientists , 4-24-7 “Confined Animal Feeding Operations Cost Taxpayers Billions, New Report Finds” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/cafo-costs-report-0113.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/cafo-costs-report-0113.html</a></u><br />
Misguided federal farm … the American public.&quot;<br />
