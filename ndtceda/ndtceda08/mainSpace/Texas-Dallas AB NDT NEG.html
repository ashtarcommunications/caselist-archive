<br />
<ol><li>Constructive engagement is a series of concessions or inducements with no states quid pro quo</li></ol>Davies 2007, Constructive engagements?: Chester Crocker &amp; American Policy in South African, Namibia and Angola<br />
<br />
Although constructive engagement was frequently… A failure to respond to the increasing number of concessions being offered by Washington was not going to be met by any tangible negative alternative.<br />
<br />
There’s no scholarly consensus that engagement is non-coercive and precludes conditions<br />
Resnick 01’ “defining engagement.” Journal of international affairs <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.allbuisiness.com/government/3493252-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.allbuisiness.com/government/3493252-1.html</a><br />
<br />
One serious flaw in scholarly conceptualizations of engagement… Cha claims that engagement occurs when “non-coercive” and non-punitive” means are employed.<br />

Olmert DA<br />
Olmert has secured the political support of the SHas for now – upsetting Uishai will push the party out and topple the government<br />
