<span style="display: block; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><strong>NDT Round 7 – Georgetown FK vs. Wake CC</strong></span></span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Scout: Pavan Krishnamurthy – Northwestern</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1AC: New Dairy South Dakota Court Precedent --- Fiscal Discipline and Federalism</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Plan: The United State Supreme Court should adopt Justice O’Connor’s dissent in South Dakota V. Dole to rule that nearly all dairy subsidies are an unconstitutional form of conditional spending that violates the 10th amendment. </span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Advantage 1 --- Deficits</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The spiraling budget deficit is the number one threat facing the country --- demographic trens and rising spending ensure a fiscal disaster that will erode the basis for our government and culminate in extinction.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Walker 9/28/5</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Today, America is at a similar crossroads…save our collective future</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The most qualified economic analysis confirms that the current path makes drastic action inevitable after a hard landing --- wholesale budget cuts and tax hikes will happen but making cuts now can acoid having to do it in the midst of a global depression.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Walker 9/28/5</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Clearly, a crunch is coming, and eventually every…and future generations of Americans</span><br />
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Don’t evaluate the budgetary impact of subsidies in a vacuum—the principle of budget management is the key—the philosophy that a single program doesn’t matter is the root cause of the budget crisis.</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">These claims night come as news to most…longer could afford to maintain its primacy</span><br />

<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The precedent established in South Dakota v. Dole allows the federal government to circumvent all 10th amendment protections by using conditional spending that directs state policy by making funding contingent on certain actions – signals an era of unchecked national power and a complete unraveling of federalism – judicial clarification of south Dakota v dole to impose a restriction on conditional spending is necessary to revive federalism</span><br />
