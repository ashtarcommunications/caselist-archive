Rashid Khalidi the foremost US historian and professor of Arab studies at Columbia U wrote, <br />
Khalidi, 2006 (Rashid) Iron Cage: The Story of the Palestinian struggle for Statehood <br />
<br />
“The one dimensional and ahistorical approach to the conflict through the prism of terrorism that is prevalent in the US obscures thoroughly the specificity of Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, and other regional actors, like Syria and Iran, and how these relate to one another. The Palestinian quest for independence is only one of many elements that must be grasped in order to understand the causes of conflict in the Middle East. But because for nearly a century this quest has been so central to events there, willfully ignoring it leads to the kinf of reductive, partial and misguided American official thinking that has helped produce the profound problems that afflict the region.”<br />
<br />
Why does American thinking contribute to the problems in the Middle East? This question can only be answered by conducting a genealogy of US involvement in the peace process. Geneaology has the capability to expose past flaws in the peace process and find new alternatives to this conflict. Foucault argues that while genealogy might not cover all aspects of history from all sides, it still has the ability to challenge traditional knowledge production. Without questioning the status qup the conflict will continue to rage and peace will be impossible. To prevent perpetuating the conflict, we need to have a critical understanding of the situation and the history behind it. This is the only way to prevent the reproduction of the status quo. We must understand that this conflict precedes the War on Terror and therefore needs a different solution. It is no secret that for most of Bush’s term, he has turned a blind eye to the on going violence. Thinking of this conflict in terms of the War on Terror, as opposed to occupation, skews reactions to events and possibilities for cooperation and efforts towards peace. <br />
<br />
Foucault, Michel <em>Society must be defined</em> 2003<br />
<br />
Tony Judt, historian and professor at NYU, argues that American knowledge production about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is flawed because knowledge is formed in the framework of the War on Terror. The heavy political and media bias towards Israel also contributes to flawed knowledge about the situation. This flawed knowledge keads to what Khalidi points out as a one dimensional and ahistorical account of the situation where one side is forgotten. Genealogy in conjunction with debate gives us the tools to depict the error in our knowledge production and generate new alternatives. <br />
<br />
Khalidi goes on to say the middle east is a region where history matters a great deal, and whose peoples have a very long history, with which they are quite familiar. The United States is deeply entangled in the affairs of this region today, as Americans concerned for our country, we should pay careful attention to that history. We ignore it at our common peril. Therefore, it is essential that we conduct a genealogy of the peace process in order to find an end to the conflict. <br />
