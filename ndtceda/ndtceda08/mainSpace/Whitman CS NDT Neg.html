Funding should come from all European Union states except the French Republic, The Federal Republic of Germany, and the United Kingdom.<br />

Cap K<br />

They theorize power wrong – their project shuts down a Marxist approach to politics. Focus on micropolitics renders capitalism invisible as violence continues unfettered<br />
Adam Katz, 2000, Postmodernism and the Politics of Culture, pg. 104-5<br />
Contemporary attempts to conceptualize … material production<br />
<br />
Embracing a methodology of anti-capitalism is a precursor to all action – without declaring war on capitalism, all forms of praxis are bankrupt and all revolutionary politics stifled<br />
Katz 2000 (above, pg. 127-8)<br />
Virno does recognize…genuinely “new” politics.<br />
<br />
Capitalism renders whole populations standing reserves, making widespread extermination inevitable, culminating in the destruction of the planet<br />

Rnd 2: Whitman (Neg) CS vs Texas TW:<br />
Compassion Fatigue Kritik:<br />
A) Violent imagery becomes a part of our social experience, making trauma a commodity to be essentialized through the media's dismay of images—the 1AC is an example of the deployment of violent representations, and as noble as the cause may be, the attempted good of the 1AC is overwhelmed by these representations<br />
Kleinman 2000. V<em>iolence and Subjectivity</em>. pp. 231-33<br />
“A second form of the violences...and for purposes of cultural control”<br />
B) Endorsing the affirmative's representations feeds into a rigged game in which each story has to outdo its predecessors, making coverage formulaic, sensationalist, and Americanized. this militates against caring , action, and memory, and perpetuates the cycle of compassion fatigue.<br />
Moeller, journalist. 1999. C<em>ompassion Fatigue.</em> pg. 53.<br />
“Compassion Fatiuges's passivity...understanding of global events.”<br />
Capitalism Kritik:<br />
A) They theorize power wrong— their project shuts down a Marxist approach to politics. Focus on micropolitics renders capitalism invisible as violence continues unfettered<br />
Katz, 2000. <em>Postmodernism and the Politics of “Culture”</em> pg 104-105<br />
“Contemporary attempts to conceptualize...processes of material production”<br />
B) Embracing a methodology of anti-capitalism is a precursor to all action—without declaring war on capitalism all forms of praxis are bankrupt and all revolutionary politics stifled<br />
Katz, 2000. <em>Postmodernism and the Politics of “Culture”</em> pg 127-128.<br />
“Virno does recognize the danger...genuinely 'new' politics”<br />
C) Capitalism renders whole populations standing reserves, making widespread extermination inevitable, culmination in the destruction of the planet<br />

Khorosan CP:<br />
<strong>Text:</strong> The United States Agency for international Development's Famine Early Warning System Network program should provide early warning of transitory food insecurity to the government of Khorasan using very high resolution satellite imagery and regional market prices to statistically verifiably estimate wheat yields to forecast middle upper arm circumference measurements.<br />
<strong>Solvency:</strong><br />
<strong>1)</strong> The alternative is the term “Khorasan” which represents the diverse identities of people in “Afghanistan” better.<br />
Tajikam Team 2/5/08. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fravahr.org/spip.php?article424" rel="nofollow">fravahr.org/spip.php?article424</a>&gt;<br />
“Before the invention...a need for a country”<br />
2) The term 'Afghanistan' is an imperial term that only recognizes the Pashtuns as legitimate citizens—the impacts are an extension of colonialism and civil instability.<br />
Nazary. 9/28/06. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://citynoise.org/article/5471" rel="nofollow">citynoise.org/article/5471</a>&gt;<br />
“even to this day...and sectarian violence”<br />
<br />
3) Colonization destroys natural evolutionary processes, the environment, and human life. the process of destruction culminates in extinction<br />
Porter 1998.<br />
“Nonetheless, this otherwise...the point of extinction”<br />
4) Afghanistan is the wrong term—it was changed from Khorosan as part of the British colonial project<br />
Cheragh, 2/17/07 “Afghan paper slams Karzai's team” BBC via lexis-nexis<br />
“Afghanistan is a country...name was changed”<br />
5) The term “Afghanistan” erases the ethnic identities of non-Pashtun peoples in Khorosan—reject this linguistic violence<br />
Afghan Mirror, no date given. &lt;<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://afghanmirror.tripod.com/id19.html" rel="nofollow">afghanmirror.tripod.com/id19 .html</a>&gt;<br />
“A national identity...have proven the opposite”<br />
Development CP<br />
<strong>Text:</strong> The United States federal government's Famine Early Warning System network should provide early warning of transitory food insecurity to the government of Afghanistan using very high resolution satellite imagery and regional market prices to statistically verifiably estimate wheat yields to forcast middle upper arm circumference measurements.<br />
<strong>Solvency:</strong><br />
1) 'Development is a loaded word which is inseperable from the web of meaning it imparts. Incanting the term enslaves two thirds of the earth's inhabitants by implying <em>favorable change</em>. Turns their LDC advantage as it re-inscribes the idea that the development West is superior to the undeveloped third world means that there will continue to be an ideological basis for undermining the access to full WTO membership<br />
Esteva, The Development Dictionary, p. 9 1993.<br />
“Development cannot delink...experiences and dreams”<br />
2) Implication is unintended global conflic and turns the case. naming actinos development is always counterproductive. Only by abandoning the term can we aviod our own destruction.<br />
Cleaver, JR. May 3, 1995.<br />
