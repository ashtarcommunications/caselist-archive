The A subpoint is: The US Supreme Court decision authorizing the federal government's ability to provide wheat subsidies in Wickard v. filburn is the basis of congressional power to dominate states rights. Wickard is the foundational decision by the supreame court that enables the federal government to provide wheat subsidies to farmers. With these words the Supreme Court gave Congress the power to crush the state beneath its regulation because states are no longer able to regulate the flow of subsidies as well as the price of wheat. The federal government took that power back in wickard and solitified it's ability to regulate interstate commerce under the commerce clause.<br />

<br />
Wickard v. Filburn revolutionized the consitution by authorizing the destruction of states' rights in favor of the federal government. by authorizing the federal government to provide wheat subsidies, the court gutted state oversight creating the basis for federalism, which is the federal government's ability to regulate the states.<br />

<br />
Wickard v. Filburn may have created the basis of federalism, but its basis as a justification for wheat subsidies is key to understanding its power<br />

<br />
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT SHOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE UNITED STATES' AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT FOR WHEAT BY OVERULING THE DECISION IN THE CASE OF WICKARD v. FILBURN, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), HOLDING THAT DOMESTIC SUBSIDIES FOR WHEAT ARE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.<br />
WE'LL CLARIFY.<br />
<br />
ADVANTAGE ONE IS THE COMMERCE CLAUSE<br />
<br />
Wickard v. filburn is the pivotal decision in the basis of commerce clause jurisprudence and federalism.<br />
Chen 03 [Emory Law Journal, Professor of Law, University of Minnesota Law School, &quot;Filburn's Legacy&quot;]<br />
<br />
Wickard v filburn laid the foundation for the appication of the commerce clause to legislate human rights restricts. the commerce clause is the concept that federal government has the right to regulate commerce across interstate line. This ensures gender and racial oppression, and any injustice that doesn't impact the economy is considered irrelevant.<br />
Pope 02<br />
(James Gray, Professor of Law at Rutgers University Law School, &quot;The Thirteenth Amendment Versus the Commerce Clause&quot;, Columbia Law Review, 102.1, January)<br />
<br />
The belief that we can use economic markets and the commerce clause to solve all our problems is called neoliberalism. It reduced life to bare consumerism and is responsible for corporate corruption, environmental destruction, and the commodification of life.<br />
Giroux 05<br />
(Henry A., Professor at McMaster University, &quot;The Terror of Neoliberalism: Rethinking the Significance of Cultural Politics&quot;, College Literature, 32.1, Winter, pg. 1-19)<br />
<br />
THE CASE SOLVES THE FAIRYTALE OF REGULATION THAT THE COMMECE CLAUSE JUSTIFIES. BY OVERRULING WICKARD THE CASE IS ABLE TO EXPOSE HOW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF STATE COMMERCE IS USED TO JUSTIFY TURNING BLIND EYE TO OPPRESSION, RACISM AND VIOLENCE. THE PLAN LIBERATES US FROM THESE SHAKLES AND ALLOWS US TO BREAK FREE FROM THE MANAGEMENT AND REGULATION OF FEDERALISM WHICH CAN LEAD TO GROSS HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.<br />

<br />
Additionally, the affirmative takes a specific stance against the human rights abuses that are justified and are permitted to be carried out under the regulation of the commerce clause. This impact is the root of violence that underpins the endless cycle of war and degridation we see in the status quo.<br />

<br />
ADVANTAGE TWO IS FEDERALISM<br />
<br />
The concept of federalism, or the federal governments ability to regulate the states that is upheld and spelled out in wickard v filburn, is a biopolitical tool that allocates the government's power to regulate the population despite the protests of the states.<br />
Parry 05<br />
(John T., Associate Professor at University of Pittsburg School of Law, Lewis and Clark Law Review, &quot;Paper Symposium: Federalism After Gonzales v. Raich&quot;, Rev. 853, December)<br />
<br />
The concept federalism has solidified the administrative federal power and the government's ability to exercise biopolitical control over states and their populations.<br />

(John T., Associate Professor at University of Pittsburg School of Law, Lewis and Clark Law Review, &quot;Paper Symposium: Federalism After Gonzales v. Raich&quot;, Rev. 853, December)<br />
<br />
The power of the federal government to regulate and engage in biopolitics has increased dramatically with the ruling in Wickard v Filburn. Only by reversing this decision is liberation and a reslease form this managerial control possible.<br />
