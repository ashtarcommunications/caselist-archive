US president George W. Bush was set to use...that attack US forces and Iraqis.<br />
<br />
Cuba is deterred by Credible US threats of regime change against &quot;rogues&quot;<br />
Wickham '04 USA Today April 19th<br />
Ricardo Alarcon believes the Bush administration has Cuba...and are preparing for--the worst.<br />
<br />
Cuban perception of US weakness against Rogues allows it to export BioWeaps to Iran<br />
Dodd '04 (center for Defense Information www.cdi.org/pdfs/factfiction.pdf )<br />
Secretary Bolton is not the first government official...we had weak leadership in this country.<br />

EU CP, (offer EU economic assistance to do the aff)<br />

Lebanon Neg<br />
We have had 1 Lebanon debate all year. Against Miami GV, we ran the following CP: The United States federal government should offer the central government of Lebanon all necessary economic assistance for postwar reconstruction in south Lebanon. And went for Big case defense and case turns. case defense included Hezbollah won't moderate, Hezbollah won't go to war any worse than the SQ, and Lebanon won't agree to force Hezbollah to moderate. The offense was the Hezbollah backlash turns, Hezbollah lashes out when kicked out of the government, Hezbollah lashes out when their money is cut off, and Hezbollah lauches terrorist attacks when isolated.<br />
<br />
Afghanistan Neg<br />
Karzai Cred<br />
Case defense<br />
Consult NATO<br />
<strong>Afghanistan is a bad word K</strong><br />
Afghanistan is an imperialist term that the British forced upon the Khorasanis. The 1AC’s support for Afghanistan praises the genocide that was committed against the entire non-Pashtun majority. Violence in Afghanistan is inevitable unless we recognize Khorasan.<br />

 K of framework that says the judge space is disappearing, we can’t make a decision outside of the hyper-real world of debate, so we should embrace the fact and push debate to its death. Also read a Kritik of death by Baudrillard. Aff’s way of viewing death makes it irreversible. We should speak the dual nature of reversible history, good, and evil life and death.<br />
<br />
<br />
We say the following things that are on obie and halli's wikispace.<br />
We also say various combinations of borders, agamben, and baudrillard, and an iraq withdrawal bad politics disad. I'll get some cites up here soon.
