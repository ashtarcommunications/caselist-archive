From the ancient tribes until the 1800’s Dine culture was able to thrive in Southern Utah. They existed as spiritual peoples that were tied greatly to the Earth. They believed wind from Earth Woman imbued land and animals with life. Out of the Earth’s dirt, naadaa [corn], turquoise and white shell, Earth People were created. They were told to kill only what they needed and harvest only what they could eat &amp; to kill and eat in humility because another being gave its life to help you live. Should this spirituality not be observed, and proper rituals and respect not be followed in harvests and hunts, deer would leave, naadaa would fail, and misfortune would befall the tribe. For centuries agriculture flourished and hunts were fruitful in the San Juan Valley. Apart from minor skirmishes the Dine lived in peace with other tribes in there area.<br />
In the late 1800’s Mormon colonization had begun to spread to the farthest corners of Utah. Mormons had fled oppression and persecution in the eastern US to find sanctuary in the Wasatch Front. In the name of God and the Church of Latter-Day Saints pioneers, many of whom were Danny’s own family, spread from their sanctuary into territory that was occupied largely by Ute, Dine, Paiutes, Hopi, Comanches, and Apaches. This plays an interesting role in traditional LDS doctrine. As University of Utah LDS writer David Miller (1966) explained, Mormons believed that “Indians are a part of the House of Israel and will eventually embrace the gospel and become a white and delightsome people. This doctrine and mission program certainly tended to dictate a friendly policy, and underlying the whole program of the San Juan Colonization was the basic idea of bringing the Gospel to the Laminates.” Mormon colonization also found roots in seizing farmland. A study of LDS policy reveals the colonization program was to occupy all available farm and grazing land, because the chief activity of Utah pioneers was farming. The pioneers declared this expansion was natural and inevitable because they looking on the horizon for more and better land were a major motive of westward expansion. The land occupied by the Dine was thought to be part of Zion, a land promised to the Mormons by God.<br />
These thoughts are one expression of Judeo-Christianity theology. Colonization happened for a multitude of intertwined reasons that were all ultimately justified as being under the grace of God. In the search for perfection of a “white and delightsome” world the God complex created in monotheistic and especially Christian doctrines, and gave disciples the right to rule the earth and its people in the name of God.<br />

<span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: AGaramond-Regular">God is killed off in all but name, replaced by Humanity as God. <u>It is</u> perhaps <u>no accident that the Enlightenment, which sought to replace</u> ignorance, superstition, and to a large extent <u>religion</u>—all one and the same according to some—<u>with learning and reason, first flourished in the Christian nations of Western Europe.</u> <u>Christianity, as pointed out</u> earlier, <u>surpasses the other monotheistic religions of the occident in blurring the</u> <u>distinction between God and humans by introducing the God-human or</u> <u>human-God figure of Jesus Christ. It is my position that once the concept</u> <u>that God can assume human form is established, the next logical (psychological?)</u> <u>step is that a reverse process can also occur—that humans can</u> <u>assume the power, authority, and role of God. Consistent with this assertion</u> <u>is Jon Meacham’s recent observation that “The promise at the heart of</u> <u>the [Christian] faith [is] that God, as the fourth-century church father Athanasius said, ‘was made man that we might be made gods’”</u> (Meacham 2005, 48; from Athanasius’s </span><em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">De Incarnatione Verbi</span></em><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: AGaramond-Regular">, 54). <u>I further maintain</u> <u>that in Western civilization this conceptual transition helped pave the road</u> <u>to the Enlightenment and modernity, in which the traditional Judeo-Christian</u> <u>concept of God was largely jettisoned and replaced by a belief in the</u> <u>perfectibility of humans and their societies, or “progress.”</u> In the words of Terry Eagleton, “<u>God [was] killed off in all but name, and human beings hoisted into His place at the apex of creation</u>” (2005, 92). Thus the Enlightenment resulted in a “secular religion” in which humans took the place of God and progress became a substitute for Christian salvation.</span><br />
This God and control complex gives control on almost every level to willing disciples of the church. With this control Christian epistemology becomes a hegemonic force entwining itself in the ability to control other peoples such as those dubbed lamanites by the LDS.<br />
The landscape and people of the San Juan Valley have become much different since the Mormon settlement. Dine were pushed onto a reservation south of the San Juan River. Many of them converted to LDS or else assimilated to the paternalism of dominant Mormon culture. The missions established in the San Juan Valley received some resistance from Dine. But after ten years Mormon culture maintained and strengthened. Shadows of Dine culture remained and some devoted to the earth and old methods of ritual farming. There were others who created a culture of mixed myth, incorporating Dine and Mormon belief.<br />
Capitalist markets that were a secondary product of Mormon contact decimated the land. To keep ahead financially, old ritual and humility seen previously in hunts and harvest were not used. The deer and elk were brought next to extinction to support the fur trade. An independent food supply disappeared and there was increasing dependency on outside sources (i.e. the Mormon settlement.)<br />
The problem of Judeo-Christian monotheism is that the necessity of a singular God results in dualistic thinking seeking to eliminate antagonism. This approach is distinct from Dine culture’s non-dualistic approach. The Dine create an ever inclusive approach traversing the need to search where evil resides or judge and scapegoat an other to project the self on.<br />

A society driven by an Old Testament ideology that is constantly in search of the places where evil resides in order to punish it cannot easily accommodate those who believe that good and evil, freedom and constraint, co-exist and devolve into the other. Non-dualistic thinking, though, by its very nature, must accommodate dualistic thinking, for to reject it, to attempt to subvert it, would simply instigate another set of binaries.</u> <u>To accept means that the process of transformation has begun (again).</u> Unfortunately, <u>few if any modern societies have what the Navajo have: effective rituals for traversing, working through, the consequences of structural and historical trauma and loss. This destitution involves the implicit embracement of the psychotic core as a positive possibility of being, of insight and guidance, that can counterbalance Western society's obsession with rationality and science, and its perpetual creation of Apollonian responses to the perceived terrors of Dionysus.</u> The privileging of the psychotic (the shamanic trance, the state of prehuman flux) is, as the Evilway ceremony, the Coyote Transformation story, and the Hoop rite dramatize, a recognition of the essential collision and collaboration of cultures on the way to a transformation that finally allows the interdependence of opposites. <u>This therapeutic process</u> also, temporarily at least, <u>eliminates or dissolves the ego</u> (surrenders it to the ecstasy of the trance)—<u>of a person and, by extension, of a (parochial) nation</u>—<u>and its need to create conflict and enemies, to acquire and accumulate, and to judge, rationalize, and defend.</u><br />
In times of trouble Dine gather at different points around the reservation to hold their ceremonies. Sings, Sand paintings, and dances were all held at hogans to provide healing for ill individuals and sometimes the tribe as a whole. The place where they were to be held was rarely determined, there were no directions, telephone calls, messages, maps, and a vague date was set. Yet all across the reservation (the main body being the size of Belgium) hundreds of Dine are able to gather without spreading the time or date or address that tribal ceremonies happen. Outsiders may look upon what happens as coincidental, supernatural or related to premonitions. This is known by most Anglos (and many Dine) as the Moccasin Telegraph. Barre Toelken, a Dine adoptee, describes it as an unspoken bond through culture and --the cultural set of assumptions within which some signal or event may be said to attain obvious validity. Toelken refers to these set of assumptions as cluster logic in which all things that are seen to be functionally related are recognized for their reflexivity and intertextuality—regardless of the sequence of particulars.<br />

“In any case, I believe that the kind of <u>cluster logic</u> used here which <u>assumes</u> that <u>relationships are more important than sequence and lineal causation represents the thought process out of which the moccasin telegraph and other</u> similar <u>ways of knowing may grow.</u> <u>This way of thinking looks more like a spider web than like a calendar, and its coordinates are not usually taken seriously by “Western”</u> <u>culture</u>—while the calendar grid pattern is viewed with more reverence than it probably deserves, <u>which is why we feel we are operating in the Unnatural when we</u> start <u>talk</u>ing <u>about Native thought</u>.”<br />
Many Dine believe it is too late to have a total reversal of colonization to the way the land and culture existed. But what is important is how some interactions can strengthen what remains in the colonized culture. Taking Dine cluster-logic seriously in our forum of debate is a way to open an intercultural dialogue about new forms of epistemology. Intercultural dialogue is a way of opening options to the dine reservation on issues like returning to traditional methodologies of farming, self-determination of Dine land, and opening space for better relations with Mormon/monotheistic communities. My own ancestors were a colonized people, and it is important for me to remember not just their colonization but to integrate indigenous ways of thinking into how I debate.<br />
Subsidies enforce a monotheistic dualism that eliminates the Dine. The aff embraces a cluster logic that removes dualistic protectionist barriers in favor of creating opportunity for exposing new ways of understanding.<br />
Our framework is that debaters must acknowledge they are not objective but make subjective decisions that makes debate what it is. Traditional debate over-privileges an epistemology that stems from an almost entirely White-Anglo culture and in that epistemology our identity as debaters has become complicit in the production of white knowledge. [A key objection to their framework is that it presents a false objectivity.] Eliza and I validate alternate forms of knowing, such as Dine-cluster logic, by using our social location and lived situations as a starting point. The exposure of incompleteness of one’s own culture opens space for better alignment to the Dine. Toelken continues:<br />

Clearly any <u>understanding</u> of these events <u>is shaped both by our own experiences and</u> by <u>cultural factors which encourage us either to assume certain events have occurred in connection with each other or to assume they were entirely coincidental.</u> This means that <u>either interpretation is based on assumptions about relationships and on our need to see, register, and interpret meaningful codes among these assumptions.</u> Admittedly I now “process” these codes far differently than I would have had I not had several years’ experience living with—and forty years experience studying—the Navajo. Does this mean, however that I have simply become more gullible or soft-headed when it comes to being objective about the events described? I think not. I also do not believe that I have become in any way Navajo (for example my encounters with the coyotes interest but do not panic me, while my Navajo friends are visibly shaken by them). What I have learned through personal experience is that <u>my own culture</u>—however fond or critical of it I may be—<u>does not provide all the possible ways of processing events of everyday life, much less to define and understand events which lie outside the domain of physical data.</u><br />
To the Navajo skinwalkers are not supernatural for they are believed to be constituents of everyday life –perhaps even our neighbors. <u>To Anglo Americans</u> <u>they seem supernatural because their rituals seem magical or out of the norm, out of the realm of everyday possibility.</u> Who is correct in this? Is a question which is impossible to resolve, however, <u>for each culture looks at the phenomena described with its own very natural, very common, very normal “eyeglasses”</u>. One of the reasons <u>we have difficulty discussing the supernatural is that we have no vocabulary for it, and that probably stems from our unwillingness to acknowledge its validity unless it has been codified for us in language which</u> suggests <u>that someone</u> (the clerics, the theologians) <u>has the issues under <em>control</em>.</u> In short, we see pretty much what we are encouraged to see; or as a student of mine once reshaped an old phrase, “If I hadn’t believed it, I never would have seen it.” <u>Intercultural explorations into such unlikely but widely used concepts as the moccasin telegraph or cluster logic have value of at least exposing us to other quite valid ways of organizing, and thus understanding, what happens in the</u> often confusing <u>world around us.</u><br />
