 Advocacy Statement:<br />
We Affirm the potentiality for the space of Palestine to exist.<br />
<br />
The US has fueled Israel’s ability to deploy imaginitve geographies to separate Palestinians and frame them as barbaric and outside the normal sphere of existence, these kinds of generalized abstaractions degrade the life and deaths of palestians and justifies a constant state of war and violence<br />
Gregory 4 [Derek, Distinguished University Scholar and prof. of Geography at U of British Columbia, Vancouver, “Palestine and the ‘war on terror’,” Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East 24.1 (2004) 183-195 p. Muse]<br />
&lt;There were, of course, compelling geopolitical reasons……cantonization institutionalized the siege of Palestinian towns and villages.&gt;<br />
<br />
Status Quo geographies of space rely on a grotesque gendered and sexualized Orientalism-justifying the colonizers constant occupation of the Other<br />
Moallem 2k2 [Minoo, Shattering Stereotypes “Am I a Muslim Woman? Nationalist Reactions and Postcolonial Transactions.” P. 53-54<br />
&lt;We are still justifying our civilizing mission….between good and evil as well as normal and abnormal&gt;<br />
<br />
The Palestinian People are caught in an abstract space where they exist only as ‘homo sacri’ justifying the worst atrocities of colonial domination and oppression<br />
Gregory 4 [Derek, Distinguished University Scholar and prof. of Geography at U of British Columbia, Vancouver, The Colonial Present, p. 133-5]<br />
&lt;the IDF’s spasm of destrion had created a landscape of devastation….led away for more to the place of concentration&gt;<br />
<br />
The current politics of security surrounding Palestine is framed to create a sense of anarchism and insecurity to isolate us from the ‘Other’. This form of dominant control must be challenged.<br />
Diken and Lausten 2 [Bulent, Lancaster U. and Carsten, U of Copenhagne, ‘Zones of Indistinction: Security, Terror, and Bare Life,’ Space and Culture p. Sage]<br />
&lt;Discipline establishes sovereignty….tehy become nomads because they refuse to disappear”.<br />
<br />
Israel and Palestine become a metaphore in which we create an island of security surrounded by the insecure—but this is a trap used to institute fascist ideology and control that turns geographical and political space into the gated communities of the elite<br />

Advocacy Statement:<br />
We Affirm the potentiality for the space of Palestine to exist.<br />
<br />
Its time to step off the treadmill of Colonialism and create the potential for new spaces—only then can we truly engage with and breakdown the notion of the ‘other’<br />

State of Exception is now the paradigm that allows for violent exclusion and extermination—theres intrinsically tied to justification based on emergency to secure spaces<br />

Any political act has an underlying ontology that drives thought and action—there is no event of violence but only a way of being permeated by violence—examining ontology is a priori<br />
