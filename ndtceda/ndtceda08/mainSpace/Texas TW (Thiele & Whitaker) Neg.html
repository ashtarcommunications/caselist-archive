<strong><u>Texas TW Negative</u></strong> – round 6 vs Redlands SZ<br />
<strong><u>1nc</u></strong><br />
<u>FRAMEWORK:</u><br />
Standard must defend supreme court<br />
<u>CASE:</u><br />
<strong>Demand for reproductive rights reinforces gender and racial categories.</strong> Higgins, 1995, 80 cornell Law review 1536. “significantly, it is in” …. “for those consequences”<br />
<strong>The affs inaccurate dichotomy between pirates living free and the imperial state denies liberatory possiblity by covering up the relational constitution of the individual and society</strong> – Ibanez 1997. “why a critical social psychology?” <u>Critical Social psychology</u>. P 33. “for whatever reason” … “dexcription of it”<br />
<u>BIOPOWER CRITIQUE:</u><br />
<strong>They misunderstand power relations – their centralization of power in the big other of medicalization necessarily confines resistance to it as outside of that power relation</strong> – kennedy, 1991, “the stakes of law, or hale and foucault!” Legal Studies forum. “the notion of” … “kinds of ordering as well”<br />
<strong>The aff presents authoritative control as responsible for violence as if there is a total system logic that conditioned and caused life. This centralized notion of power misunderstands power relations</strong> – kennedy, 1991, same as above. “foucault is also undoing” … “forces and bodies”<br />
<strong>The strategy of strengtening control of the body ignores how the discourses of control increase domination</strong> – diamond, 1998. <u>Feminism &amp; Foucault</u>, p 194-5. “yet as a number of” … “has a very short span”<br />
<strong>ALTERNATIVE: RESIST THE DISCIPLINARY IDENTITIES IN THE 1AC. Progressive struggle lies not in proposing grand schemes for reform, but instead in breaking down the assumptions, institutions, and identities that make our lives intolerable –</strong> Halperin, 1995. <u>Saint Foucault</u>. P 52-6. “in his political work” … “and the same struggle”<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><u>2nc</u></strong><br />
<u>BIOPOWER CRITIQUE:</u><br />
Reads no new evidence<br />
Proposing solutions without recognizing the power of the state just leads to co-optation.<br />
Piracy is another form of power<br />
Affirmatives citation of doctor/science recommendations relies on the external authority that they criticize<br />
<strong>Equality disad – universality from the point of excluded, ie we are all pirates, occurs against the backdrop of material inequality – replicating violence and imperialism –</strong> Bill Readings 2000. <em>Posthumanism</em>. “pagans, perverts, or primitives”. “the aborigines” … “getting it right”<br />
<strong>Right to choose rhetoric kills feminist strategies. A. justifies counter-claims like right to life. B. excludes those who are forced to chose abortion from debate</strong> – Smart, 1989. <u>Feminism and the Power of Law</u>. P 150-2. “in the two decades in which” … “not rather hollow”<br />
<u>FRAMEWORK:</u><br />
Standard framework args – you have to defend the supreme court<br />
<strong><u>2nr –</u></strong><br />
Goes for the biopower K<br />
Externalization of power à objectification / cooptation<br />

International Court of Justice C/P<br />
Text: The United States federal government will file a declaration with the International Court of Justice submitting the Supreme Court’s decision in Ex Parte Quirin and the question of whether absence of uniform forfeits a citizen’s Article III, Section 3 protections for binding adjudication by the International Court of Justice.<br />
<ol><li>Solvency: Here’s what article 3 section 3 says:</li></ol>“Section 3. Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.”<br />
The ICCPR mandates witness testimony<br />
Crowley, Prof of Intl Human Rights at Fordham, March 2001 (Fordham International Law Journal)<br />
The Human Rights Committee… was violated.<br />
Several countries will challenge US ICCPR violations in the ICJ ensuring Quirin is overturned.<br />
Howland, JD at Denver, Fall 1997 (Denver Journal of International Law and Policy)<br />

<ol><li>ICJ Credibility</li></ol>The US does not submit potential treaty violations to ICJ adjudication and has hampered the development of the international judiciary by refusing to accept ICJ rulings as binding<br />
Quigley, Prof of Law at Ohio State, 2003 (Ohio State Journal on Dispute Resolution)<br />
At the same…Court of Justice.<br />

WTO domination of international dispute mediation undermines international environmental law and will invalidate the Montreal Protocol and the South Pacific Convention prohibiting driftnet fishing<br />

The Montreal Protocol is key to avoid extinction from ozone depletion<br />

The thesis of this AND dispute with a State<br />
Dispo Good<br />
-no neg fiat<br />
-kritik education<br />
-straight turns increase ground<br />
-time skew inevitable<br />
-neg flexibility good<br />
-all args are functionally conditional<br />
-err neg on theory at the NDT<br />
US not balanced, group, CP solves, these are SQ indicts<br />
Immediately allows jurisdiction, FIAT solves<br />
A/T Process CP Bad:<br />
-we are an agent, not a process CP<br />
-we have UN ambassador file<br />
-increases agent ground of topic<br />
-point is courts, not miliken or Morrison<br />
-all cp are textually pics<br />
-cp key to balance neg ground<br />
-we don’t fiat entirety of plan<br />
Perm minus enforcement- we do not fiat entirety; not really apply, not solve any of the cp because without enforcement and US ignore becomes true<br />
We are not consultation, just submit to a different court, not a part of NATO or jurisdiction claims<br />
No link- we’re not future fiat<br />
Perm- rules one direction; fiat in the future is bad, or do immediately which proves why not accept case<br />
Perm after consultation- we’re not a consult<br />
Conceded that evidence entire 1ac is reason why violate norms<br />
Montreal protocol impact leads to extinction- conceded comes first<br />
ICJ link turns free trade<br />
