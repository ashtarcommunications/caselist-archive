 <br />
Plan: The United States federal government should increase its constructive engagement with the government of Afghanistan by offering to support licensing of poppy production in Afghanistan, and providing necessary foreign assistance for the creation of a domestic morphine production industry in Afghanistan, if the government of Afghanistan agrees to implement the program to create a domestic morphine production industry in Afghanistan.<br />

In August, the Bush administration announced its new counter-narcotics policy Afghanistan, which includes the military-led eradication of the vast poppy fields of southern Afghanistan that now provide 95% of the world’s heroin<br />
Baltimore Sun 8-10-07<br />
“American combat troops … currently based in Afghanistan.”<br />
<br />
And, predictably, this policy of eradication is hopelessly stupid—It doesn’t eliminate the flow of drugs and simply alienates the population from the Karzai government, boosting support for the Taliban.<br />

“However, it is important to recognize … Afghanistan and the International Community.”<br />
This insurgency has been the cause of over 6,000 deaths in a year and a half and continues to drive down support for coalition forces<br />

“Nearly 6,000 people have been killed in Afghanistan…fall of the Taliban, are starting to wear thin.”<br />
And, Afghan stability is key to central Asian security and prevents spillover of the Taliban into other bordering countries. All the major Asian nations need Afghanistan to have a stable regime<br />

“The Asian states neighboring Central Asia have…a stable Afghanistan is critical to their own security interests.”<br />
Central Asian instability leads to terrorism and thermonuclear war<br />

Observation Two: Global Pain Crisis<br />
Millions are dying in pain because medications are not being fairly distributed on a global level<br />

“In parallel, a global crisis of another nature … signs of a system in deep crisis.”<br />

“Thomas Jefferson was a drug criminal… power no amount of money can buy.”<br />
Observation 3: Solvency<br />
It is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of Afghanis—the creation of a domestic painkiller industry would meaningfully increase economic development and strengthen the rule of law while at the same time strangling the Taliban’s funding sources<br />

‘It is not too late to win back the hearts and minds … farmers sever ties with the insurgency.”<br />
unlike unrealistic crop substitution and eradication programs, licensing poppies would eliminate the economic advantage that growing illegal poppies. All of this is possible within existing Afghani and International law.<br />
Righter in 2007 (Rosemary, Assitant Editor and U.N. Expert, The Times, 6-28, l/n)<br />
“How then to escape this Catch-22? … It would be folly not to try.”<br />
Plan solves the chicken and egg dilemma between security and development that has plagued Afghanistan—it is in every way better than the status quo morass where neither security nor development are achievable<br />

GIVE IRANIAN NUKES A CHANCE! AFF<br />
<br />
Americans dream about the sublime Thing: a global catastrophe that<br />
would shatter their lives. Why? This is psychoanalysis: to explain why<br />
we are haunted by nightmarish visions of catastrophes. The spectacle of<br />
language, producing film-like representations of reality and<br />
catastrophe, is part of an active imagination that connects the subject<br />
with a very real mental world in which fantasies come to life through<br />
the language of images.<br />
Zizek 01. (On Belief, p. 31-32)<br />
<br />
The logic of this…something effectively new.<br />
<br />
The nightmarish Thing has manifested itself in the status quo Iranian<br />
nuclear situation, fueling the death drive for the fantasy of control<br />
over the international order. The true threat is the pre-emptive death<br />
grip of the neo-liberal order – the perpetual destruction of the<br />
antagonistic Other of democracy.<br />
Zizek 05. (Give Iranian Nukes a chance, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizekiranian.htm" rel="nofollow">www.lacan.com/zizekiranian.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
On August 2nd,…be the real criminal<br />
<br />
Plan is key to repoliticize ethics, only plan abolishes the distance<br />
between agonistic and antagonistic competition.<br />
Zizek 02. (Revolution at the Gates, 269-70)<br />
<br />
From this point…discredit the enemy?<br />
<br />
Resolved: the United States Federal Government should increase its<br />
constructive engagement with the government of Iran, and by offering<br />
them all necessary nuclear technology to create nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
Our plan is a critical blow to the false choice offered by the<br />
geopolitical interests of the international system. Only a nuclear<br />
armed Iran can carve out space for resistence.<br />
Zizek 05. (Give Iranian Nukes a chance, <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.lacan.com/zizekiran.htm" rel="nofollow">www.lacan.com/zizekiran.htm</a>)<br />
<br />
This background allows…the United States.<br />
<br />
Our specific interrogation of how the fantasy of deflecting the Thing<br />
manifests itself within the Iranian situation allows us to unties the<br />
ideological knot that tethers together the entire international order.<br />
Zizek 99. (The Ticklish Subject, p.176)<br />
<br />
Single unemployed mother…addressing the sinthome.<br />
<br />
Recognition of the fantasy abolishes the source of totalitarian<br />
temptations. Our attempt to articulate a new way of living is the only<br />
hope to break away from our violent international order.<br />
Zizek 99. (The Ticklish Subject, p.390-92)<br />
<br />
So we not…you to dare.<br />
Cynical distance from the system is actually crucial to it’s ability to<br />
succeed. We must instead overidentify, which creates a situation of<br />
ambiguity that forces us to confront our desire for domination.<br />
Zizek 5.<br />

<br />
It is against…upon our desire.<br />
<br />
The most crucial task lies in marking the impossibility of the symbolic<br />
order.<br />
Edkins 99. (Poststructuralism &amp; International Relations, pg.142<br />
<br />
The remembering involved…lulled into forgetfulness.
