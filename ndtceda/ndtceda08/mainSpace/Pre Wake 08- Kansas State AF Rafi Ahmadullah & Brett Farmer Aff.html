This is the same aff we have been reading all year here are the cards+tags<br />

Agriculture is now a motorized food industry<br />
heidegger quote from '49<br />
It ihas become impossible, or to say the least, futile, to chain the above words to a conceptual singularity of Evil...This obsession to return to past events in order to inject some sort of truth and set the historical record straight is symptomtic of a culture that is still not thinking, a culture in decline where we have become indifferent to our own present day experiential situation and are forced to perpetually reenact the crimes of history, the hell of the same, ad infinitum.<br />
Baudrillard '93 transparency of evil<br />
the vain quarrel over heidegger has no philosophical significance...are the only way we have left to feel alive.<br />
<br />
Thinking itself is a way. we respond to that way by remaining underway And our response is one of affirmation--affirmation of that which calls us forth to respond--affirmation of the topical strangeness of this year's resolution, &quot;the strangeness which lies in the matter itself:&quot;<br />
<br />
Then the resolution<br />
<br />
This affirmation takes place on the path of thinking itself, always remaining resolved, underway, and attentive to that which provokes thought--carefully listening and heeding to the resolutional guidewords from which the topical hale is issued and heard.<br />
<br />
At this point, &quot;let us pause for a moment to consider a possible misunderstanding&quot; Urges Professor Dalle Pezze, for...it could appear, from what we have been saying...to remain open towards the openness itself. 2006 Heidegger on Gelassenheit.<br />
<br />
And yet within our modern society, which appears no longer able to think, such a momentary pause seems almost profane. we have become a society chained to singularity - which places the values of progress, perfection, and pragmatism above all else. we strive to maximize the production of everything...our world has become governed by enframing -the earth our minds transformed into a standing reserve of subsidized monocultures cultivated in sterile laboratories and cloned worldwide. .....this threat is not a problem for which we must find a solution but an ontological condition that requires a transformation of our understanding of being.<br />
Gail stenstad 2006<br />
in a short presentation to his neighbors...the precision of technological process<br />
<br />
Our affirmation is one in which strays away from this dominant tract of thinking. Our embracement of the resolution, the path affirmation we remain underway, offers a possibility of transformative experience with language, which refuses to fall prey to the violence of metaphysics, subjectivity, and their dialectical modes of resistance in which technological domination is founded upon<br />
