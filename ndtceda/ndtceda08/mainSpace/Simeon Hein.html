In the interim, here's the text of the email<br />
interview. I believe his email address is on the<br />
website in the footer:<br />
<br />
Hi Michael:<br />
<br />
I'm going to answer some of your questions below.<br />
I'm also curious<br />
how<br />
you got interested in the topic and how you found my<br />
website. Most of<br />
my<br />
traffic comes from radio interviews and some Google<br />
ads. Also, is this<br />
debate topic just for your school or for others as<br />
well? Now to your<br />
questions. Of course you can quote anything in our<br />
email discussion.<br />
It's<br />
funny, but I never thought I'd end up on a debate<br />
card. When I was<br />
involved<br />
in the 70's and 80's everything was about facts, and<br />
only facts, so I<br />
glad<br />
some other criteria have been added to the process.<br />
<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>1. Frequently, policy discussion revolve around the</li><li>implementation of a policy by a given agency. Thus,</li><li>for example, an Open Contact policy could be put</li></ul>into<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>effect by an act of Congress, by an Executive Order,</li><li>or, alternately, through a court ruling if the</li></ul>Supreme<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>Court, say, applied a ruling on enemy noncombatants</li></ul>to<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>strike down current regulations on contact.</li></ul><br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>Which of these approaches seems most effective? Do</li><li>unique features of the Open Contact issue</li></ul>necessitate<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>a legislative approach? Which one seems like the</li></ul>best<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>strategy for individual activists to pursue?</li></ul><br />
I think the best approach to Open Contact would be<br />
through<br />
congressional<br />
legislation. This is because such a law would<br />
necessitate congressional<br />
hearings, which would go a long way in getting the<br />
facts out to the<br />
American<br />
people. How long has contact been going on? With<br />
whom? What federal<br />
agencies are involved? Are they doing this legally?<br />
And where are these<br />
ETs<br />
coming from (if they exist at all)? With a great<br />
educational process<br />
intended to inform our entire society, we could go a<br />
long way in<br />
bringing<br />
Americans up to speed politically and scientifically.<br />
And it would<br />
raise our<br />
standing in the world community to show that we have<br />
opened up the<br />
closets<br />
of secrecy and started to clean our political house.<br />
It would show that<br />
we<br />
care about the truth. America could once again take<br />
the lead as the<br />
most<br />
democratic, scientifically advanced, and educated<br />
country in the world.<br />
The status quo right now is that all official<br />
knowledge of the UFO<br />
phenomenon is held in secret black budget programs to<br />
which the public<br />
has<br />
no access. Legitimate researchers are ridiculed and<br />
targeted for<br />
disinformation campaigns. Military and intelligence<br />
witnesses to the<br />
phenomenon are harassed, threatened, and intimidated.<br />
They are told<br />
that<br />
their chances for promotion would end, the pensions<br />
could be revoked,<br />
and<br />
their families could be harmed. Understandably, only a<br />
few hundred<br />
witnesses<br />
have publicly come foward, with the Disclosure Project<br />
<br />
(disclosureproject.org) for example.<br />
The UFO situation now is like a disease the cuts off<br />
our flow of<br />
information and expression. The secrecy surrounding<br />
the whole<br />
phenomenon<br />
dampens scientific progress, curiousity, and economic<br />
development.<br />
Obviously, there is a lot at stake here. And in my<br />
view, open<br />
Congressional<br />
hearings and legislation are the best way the cure<br />
this illness of<br />
ignorance. There were Congressional hearings about<br />
UFOs in the 1960's<br />
but<br />
testimony was limited to a handful of people and the<br />
whole subject was<br />
forgotten. This time, hundreds should testify openly<br />
and in front of<br />
the<br />
news media. With 40 to 80 billion dollars a year going<br />
into these<br />
secret<br />
projects, the public has, at a minimum, the right to<br />
know how its money<br />
is<br />
being spent. So far, none of the Congressional budget<br />
commitees, like<br />
Senate<br />
Appropriations, have been able to get any information<br />
about these black<br />
projects.<br />
<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>2. What literature would you recommend in order to</li><li>tout the symbolic value of such a law? We would</li></ul>like<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>to argue that it's a good idea to repeal the law</li><li>regardless of the actual presence of EBEs. We would</li><li>argue that the extra-terrestrial has a symbolic</li><li>significance that transcends actual contact: the</li><li>figure of the alien stands in for our attitudes</li></ul>toward<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>the Other generally.</li></ul><br />
There have been several excellent books on the<br />
subject including<br />
Richard<br />
Dolan's &quot;UFOs and the National Security State:<br />
Chronology of a Coverup,<br />
1943-1971.&quot;<br />
(www.amazon.com/exec/obido<br />
<span class="word_break"> </span>s/ASIN/1571743170/themount <span class="word_break"> </span>baldysto),<br />
<br />
Timothy Good's &quot;Above Top Secret&quot;<br />
(www.amazon.com/exec/obido <span class="word_break"> </span>s/ASIN/0688092020/themount <span class="word_break"> </span>baldysto)<br />
and &quot;The<br />
Missing Times: Media Complicity in the UFO Cover-up&quot;<br />

(<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738836125/themountbaldysto" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec</a> <span class="word_break"> </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738836125/themountbaldysto" rel="nofollow">/obidos/ASIN/0738836125/th</a> <span class="word_break"> </span><a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738836125/themountbaldysto" rel="nofollow">emountbaldysto</a>).<br />
As you mention above, the symbolic significance of<br />
this issue is very<br />
important, as the United States is not supposed to be<br />
a country that is<br />
afraid of aliens of any type. Xenophobic attitudes are<br />
destructive in<br />
many<br />
ways, regardless of the existence of ETs. The books<br />
cited above show<br />
the<br />
negative effects of extensive government secrecy in a<br />
democratic<br />
society.<br />
The official attitudes we currently have towards the<br />
ET phenomenon are<br />
contrary to the values of openess, transparency, and<br />
fairness: the<br />
political<br />
values that we profess to believe in and live by.<br />
<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>3. How would the political reprecussions of passing</li></ul>an<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>Open Contact law be? Would it adversely affect the</li><li>President or members of the Congress who voted for</li></ul>it?<br />
<br />
There is no doubt that the UFO question has created<br />
the equivalent of<br />
a<br />
cosmic Watergate. This is issue has been withheld from<br />
public view for<br />
50<br />
years. But one could argue that such a disclosure is<br />
necessary and<br />
healthy<br />
for the body politic. The easiest way for any<br />
President to be<br />
remembered for<br />
centuries is to be the President that makes an<br />
official announcement<br />
about<br />
the existence of ETs on or near Earth. Both Presidents<br />
Carter and<br />
Clinton<br />
tried to get the truth, but were stopped. Harvard<br />
educated attorney,<br />
Daniel<br />
Sheehan worked for Carter in this respect, and found<br />
evidence,<br />
including<br />
photos, in the classified section of the Library of<br />
Congress. Clinton,<br />
through deputy attorney general Webster Hubbell, also<br />
tried to find out<br />
about UFOs but was rebuffed by NORAD at Cheyenne<br />
Mountain, CO and told<br />
that<br />
no such information existed. If the President cannot<br />
get access to this<br />
information, who can?<br />
I think members of Congress who supported an Open<br />
Contact law would<br />
certainly be considered controversial, but after such<br />
open hearings,<br />
they<br />
might be seen as brave people who did the right thing.<br />
Afterall, if<br />
members<br />
of Congress only concern is their day- to-day<br />
popularity we will never<br />
make<br />
any progress with any legislation. Civil rights<br />
legislation in the<br />
1960's<br />
wasn't popular in many parts of the country either.<br />
<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>4. What would the international consequences of such</li></ul>a<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>law be? Could the United States expect other</li></ul>nations<br />
<ul class="quotelist"><li>to model such a law? Would such a law affect our</li><li>standing in the world?</li></ul><br />
The rest of the world expects the U.S. to come clean<br />
about its<br />
knowledge of<br />
UFOs. A influential and respected French committee of<br />
retired military<br />
officers and scientists made such a statement in the<br />
COMETA report in<br />
the<br />
late 1990's. An Open Contact law is consistent with<br />
what the U.S.<br />
stands for<br />
politically and morally. So I expect the rest of the<br />
world would be<br />
very<br />
impressed.<br />
