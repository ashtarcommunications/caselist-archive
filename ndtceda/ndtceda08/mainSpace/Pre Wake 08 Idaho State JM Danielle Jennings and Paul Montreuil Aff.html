1ac w/ cites: Mundane!: Magical!: The land… AH THE LAND! The power of agriculture shifting, the poor, excluded African farmers, gaining their rightful place in the discussion, the buffalo the buffalo, reducing ethanol subsidies is a grand shift away from guns to butter, a million relationships to the economy, a brilliant display of political economies: mundane, magical: Switching their place on the map, no more lost credibility, no more trade disputes, resource wars averted and ontologies reconciled, the aquifers, clean and purified, the giants mass of interconnected waterways purged of giant festering pools of shit, all the while haunted by the real, Lacan would be shocked, all utopas, all lacks, all desiring practices for the perfected economy to fall, elimination, reduction “the taking apart of something through the use of concepts,”: just imagine it: 13 ways to avert extinction! The Doha bones connected to the trade bone, the trade bones connected to the land bone, the land bones connected to the desire bone, the desire bones connected to the McCain bone, so heed the word of the – the worst possible scenario for the price of the barrel, and grain, solving food riots and averting the collapse of the entire civilization, but at the same time: mundane, magical: elimination of subsidies also ushers in the grand collapse of all civilization, all the castles and cities crumbling, and then building themselves up again, with a flick of imagination, with a flick of our wrist, 1ac’s created in a matter of hours, ongoing nuclear wars on the poor avoided, lessened, or related to ethically, even ghosts, haunting us at every turn, everywhere the silenced being anti-silenced, race, class, and orange being brought across the border, endless relationships to political discourse – THE HUMAN, imagine it, meat tearing blood sucking altered, technological abstraction rocked, the great divide, like a great AGAMBEN style grand canyon, the chasm of human shattering and breaking, like the cotton slave trade, overcome, the animals, human and non, finally considered in the biopolitical states, endless standpoints of various shapes and sizes, the wheat from the chaff, all passing each other on the imaginative crossroads, the hail of personal responsibility, the chosen people of America, Thomas Jeffersons everywhere, you know, the part of the debt that each of us carries in our pocket, namely our neo-imperialist neo-liberal club membership cards, endless fucking wars, can’t you see it, the near brink of a dream, but not like Bush, oh no, not like bush, no, no, Thomas Jefferson, YES, nor more runoff, YES, green box, orange box, blue box, whatever, AFFIRM, Obama! Colorado key, land price, investment, the crossroads, resolved, “right this way cotton,” “CLEAR the way for wheat,” “out of the way dairy” sorry Russia, not your day, you thought it was but it just wasn’t your day, 13 ways to avert extinction! – save the world, we practice it over and over, YES, and it dreams again, YES, on the crossroads, possibility, the scope of the thinkable, imaginative crossroads: JUST when it seems like the status quo seems totally lost, the shit pools are encroaching and the pain vats are overflowing, we arrive at this year’s imaginative crossroads, a vibrant illumination of imagination, we see the text flickering on the screen for the first time and immediately they pass through our imaginations, cafo’s crushed, Foucault pleased, subsidies removed, allies appeased, trade harmonized, a crossroads of imagination: a relaxation of tensions, finally a broad and deep sigh of relief, extending across it all: mundane, the routine return to global bliss, magical, its existence could possibility avert it, just simply a picture of the calculative risk… Yes… Yes. We are enchanted by the topic, it is a wondrous imaginative crossroads. Debate produces its universe through ritual imaginative acts, magical acts. We make the world according to the lectures we form of it. This world producing optic too often ignores the mystical and awe inspiring imagination upon which it rests, too many are quick to tell stories of disenchatment, from the preoccupation with death and fear, to the obsession with refusal, rejection and cynicism, in our search to both define and destablize the foundations of debate we ignore its inherent beauties, its imaginative potential, Jane Bennett (The enchantment of modern life: attachments, crossings, ethics) writes “the very characterization of the world as disenchanted ignores and then discourages affective attachment to the world” it is time to see how the mundane in the debate is also magical, we see this topic as something to be affirmed for its amazing capacities for possibility, by its very nature, affirming this topic is an act of re-imagining politics, Dillon writes (Politics of Security: Towards a political philosophy of continental thought. 1996 p 1-2) “In making its contribution … human being’s freedom as possibility”<br />
<br />
Debate is a practice of producing and contesting knowledge, through language, the topic: a text which mobilizes and ignites the mystery and imagination of all of us, each of us, via the mystical formation of letters into syllables into words, when we first read the topic, imaginative horizons opened, and each of us come away with different interpretations, each in our own magical way, this is what allows us to debate, the gap between our two perspectives, the truth about the status quo always remains a secret, this mystery allows clash, the secret, the unknowable is what makes debate beautiful, Bennett writes (Unthinking faith and enlightenment; nature and the state in a post-Hegelian era. 1987 p. 10-11) “Knowledge consists of an approximate recovery… (human or divine), that commentaries tirelessly seek.”<br />
<br />
The topic illuminates the world, kaleidoscopically, opening histories, focusing on subsidies, the topic illuminates agrarian principles in fascinating ways to us, subsidies seem to be founded in large part by the paradoxical combination of Christian transcendence and enlightenment rationality. After Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit, The Lord God said: “Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for you are and to dust you will return.” And they left the garden and toiled in the earth, to wrestle with the inevitability of their own death. Later Christians would associate farming with the transcendence of our worldly condition, separating the wheat from the chaff, the god of the new testament could have only been described as the shepherd of men, later, whole societies would be founded on this agrarian Christ-like purity, Thoreau wrote, We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christiantiy merely as an improved method of agriculture. The transcendent god of this form of Christianity knew all, and through divine inspiration revealed the answers to the sin and chaos of the world, the transcendent god stoof above the world and chose who would be worthy of protection, Thomas Jefferson wrote: “Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever he had chosen people, whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue.” Some say that the enlightenment killed Christian belief, but actually all the enlightenment accomplished was stripping Christiantiy of its sense of enchantment and endowing humans with the belief that they too could be gods, with enlightenment came the biopolitical assumption that we could control and eliminate what we disliked about the world, with its obsession with control and overcoming, the enlightened foster a christianity which literalizes its spirituality into a code of disenchantment, rather than celebrating the ambiguity of god and awe inspiring experience of world agrarian Christian politicians searched for solutions which could separate the sinners from the saints, this required a disenchanted and calculable reading of all that fell outside of this mode of thinking, the enlightened turned their focus on correcting the world because of its inability to measure up to some transcendent divine, now fully separated from the garden and endowed with rationality humans made themselves into gods, allowing humans to transcendently stand above the world to become its omniscient managers, Bennett writes that (Unthinking faith and enlightenment; nature and the state in a post-Hegelian era. 1987 p. 34-35) “The turn towards finite reality marks the final defeat… Thus, it does not fully confront the problematic moral and political consequences of utilitarianism.”<br />
<br />
And so the subsidy stood as a recognition of the chosen ones, the perfect god trick to bring two disenchanted stories together, the shepherd-like protection of the Christ-like American farmer, the backbone, the American farmer, turning this world into something worthy, more like the garden, measuring it up and casting off the world that actually exists, alienation, they believed they had figured out the secret, enlightenment belief in controlling the market in favor of our highest ideals, a project of purity, all along the way, the world is transformed into a disenchanted space, only worthy of correction, a world objects in a standing reserves fully calculable and reducible, the world never conforms and neither can the topic. We must take this closer look, at the very practice of imagination, the imaginative crossroads, the topic, and the possibilities for enchantment provided by it, but we must not fall prey to a purely cynical vision, in order to be truly engaged in the world, in order to truly engage debate and this year’s resolution, we must allow ourselves to be enchanted by the topic, we must not literalize the secret about the world, rather leave secret as secret, it is a site for imaginative possibility, it magically ignites thoughts in all of our heads, the resolution: mundane and magical: Jane Bennett writes (The Enchantment of Modern Life: Attachments, Crossings, Ethics. 2001. P. 111) “Picture a world where wondrous events compete… actual world to its virtual possibilities.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes affirm the resolution! Yes, Yes Bennett continues (The Enchantment of Modern Life: Attachments, Crossings, Ethics. 2001. P. 3-4) “Enchantment is something that we encounter, that hits us … it is a state of interactive fascination…”<br />
<br />
And so when faced with this year’s imaginative crossroads, we say YES, and affirm it without equivocation.<br />
<br />
<br />
2ac Tricks, Add-Ons, <br />
<br />
Meaning is always hidden – we can only mystically interpret<br />
<br />
Bennett 87 (Unthinking faith and enlightenment; nature and the state in a post-Hegelian era. 1987 p. 11-12)<br />
“Historians have had difficulty explaining… family resemblances than efficient causes.”<br />
<br />
Rationalization leads to disenchantment and an existence without meaning<br />
<br />
Murphy 94 (Raymond, “Rationality and Nature: A Sociological Inquiry into a Changing Relationship,” Chapter 1: Rationalization Under the Premise of Plasticity, accessed through Questia, August 5th, 2008)<br />
“Central to the dynamic of formal rationalization… (or perhaps very old) meaning ) (see Chapter 4).”<br />
<br />
Framework is all about constraining knowledge. We need to engage what is thinkable from multiple perspectives, particularly as fiction. The negative constrains this. Fouculat writes that the way to get to a correct understanding of knowledge is to investigagte different approaches. This is not a stand against class; it is a way to progress to a more effective education.<br />
<br />
Foucault 80 (Michel, French Theorist “Question of Method,” Published in Michel Foucault: Power ed. James D. Faubion p. 235-236)<br />
“But paralysis isn’t the same thing as anesthesia… not when reformers have realized their ideas.”<br />
<br />
To vote on potential abuse to protect the debate community you must first conceive the debate community as a unified whole, but the debate community is fractured, this is what makes it beautiful (that it is strong enough to contain multiple contradicting understandings of politics), Founding community based on a linguistic commonality or a set of appropriate agreements destroys difference, their framework requires homogeneity and the destruction of all perspectives that are deemed outside of it<br />
<br />
Secomb 2000 (Linnell, a lecturer in Gender Studies at the University of Sydney, “Fractured Community,” Hypatia – volume 15, Number 2, Spring 2000, pp. 138-139)<br />
“The reformulated universalist model of community would be founded… that assume homogeneity and transparency.”<br />

Then there is a long and crazy story involving buffalos, maps, race, class, oranges, Ahh-Mh-Dee-n-a-jad, Russia not getting elected for the topic, imagination, calculation bad… I’m not typing that out – what follows is pretty much verbatim for what they read.<br />
<br />
We are enchanted by the topic, it is a wondrous imaginative crossroads. Debate produces its universe through ritual imaginative acts, magical acts. We make the world according to the lectures we form of it. This world producing optic too often ignores the mystical and awe inspiring imagination upon which it rests, too many are quick to tell stories of disenchatment, from the preoccupation with death and fear, to the obsession with refusal, rejection and cynicism, in our search to both define and destablize the foundations of debate we ignore its inherent beauties, its imaginative potential, Jane Bennett (The enchantment of modern life: attachments, crossings, ethics) writes “the very characterization of the world as disenchanted ignores and then discourages affective attachment to the world” it is time to see how the mundane in the debate is also magical, we see this topic as something to be affirmed for its amazing capacities for possibility, by its very nature, affirming this topic is an act of re-imagining politics, Dillon writes (Politics of Security: Towards a political philosophy of continental thought. 1996 p 1-2) “In making its contribution … human being’s freedom as possibility”<br />
<br />
We must take this closer look, at the very practivce of imagination the imaginative crossroads, the topic, but we must not fall prey to a purely cynical vision, in order to be truly engaged in the world, in order to tryly engage debate and this year’s resolution, we must allow ourselves to be enchanted by the topic, it is a site for imaginative possibility, it magically ignites thoughts in all of our heads, : mundane and magical: Jane Bennett (Same site as above, pg 111) “Picture a world where wondrous events compete … the actual world to its virtual possibilities”<br />
<br />
Yes affirm the resolution! Yes, Yes Bennett continues (same site p 3-4) “Enchantment is something that we encounter, that hits us … it is a state of interactive fascination…”<br />
<br />
And so when faced with this year’s imaginative crossroads, we say YES, and affirm it without equivocation.
