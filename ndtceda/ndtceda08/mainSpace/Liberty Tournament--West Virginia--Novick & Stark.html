<strong><span style="font-family: 'Sabon','serif'">This is extremely problematic. In our present political climate, rural areas are regarded as the location of food production and farm subsidies are cast as the federal government's attempt to spur economic growth in such areas. However, when the very subsidies aimed at helping rural areas actually function to the detriment rural residents those people are stigmatized as backward and rendered politically invisible.</span></strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman"> </span><br />

<strong>Liberty Round 5 v Richmond FL<br />
judge Pam Bowman</strong><br />
<strong><em>Among the myriad subsidies in the 2007 Farm Bill were subsidiezs to concentrate animal feeding operations. These operations have uniquely contributed to the demise of the small rural farm as they encourage corportatization and hyperspecialization in the agriculture sector.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Wise 05</em></strong>  <br />
<em>(Unlike most crop farming…of low feed prices)</em> <br />
<strong><em>Farm subsidies are an embodiment of the unrecognized practice of ruralism where resident of rural areas are the victims of discrimination in both a governmental and cultural capacity.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Bassett 03</em></strong> <br />
<em>(Over the past thirty eight years…dwellers are farmers)</em> <br />
<strong><em>Ruralism is endemic to modern</em></strong> <strong><em>America</em></strong><strong><em>. Rural poverty and suffering are distanced to the point of political invisibility leaving many to suffer and die as a result.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Bassett 06</em></strong>  <br />
<em>(In fall 2005…rural poverty)</em> <br />
<strong><em>Such practices exist as a consequence of neoliberal economics. Such a system prioritizes the functioning of large businesses and corporations within the global market regardless of its societal or human costs. As such, it allows and even demands deviations from the pure market regardless of its societal demands deviations from the pure market system – like CAFP subsidies – when they facilitate the operations of large corporations.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Martinez</em></strong> <strong><em>and Garcia 1996</em></strong>  <br />
<em>(“Neo liberalism” is a set…if they fail, as “lazy.”)</em> <br />
<strong><em>Neoliberalism glosses over varying particularities across spatial cultural and racial dimensions leaving it incapable of grappling with economic development problems in these areas.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Brohman 95</em></strong>  <br />
<em>(In order to understand and explain…indebtedness in</em> <em>Latin America</em><em>)</em> <br />
<strong><em>Neoliberalism selective employment of radical free-market ideologies solidifies urban western-capitalist domination and functions as a tool for neocolonial expansion.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Brohman 95</em></strong>  <br />
<em>(Given the prominence of economics …most</em> <em>Third World</em> <em>governments)</em> <br />
<strong><em>The logic of neoliberalism results in the ongoing process sacrificial destruction manifested in things like widespread starvation and death and violent wars in order to preserve the functioning of the global market.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Santos</em></strong> <strong><em>03</em></strong>  <br />
<em>(According to Franz Hinkelmmert…countries for four years)</em> <br />
<strong><em>Plan: The</em></strong> <strong><em>United States</em></strong> <strong><em>Congress should pass legislation and the President of the</em></strong> <strong><em>United States</em></strong> <strong><em>should sign legislation eliminating commodity subsidies for all animal feeding operations with over 1,000 head of livestock.</em></strong> <br />
<strong><em>Neoliberalism should be rejected in favor of a theory that takes into account the differing identities and structures that vary across demographic lines.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Brohman 1995</em></strong>  <br />
<em>(In recent years analysts …economic and environmental conditions)</em> <br />
<strong><em>The plan is critical first step. While no singular piece of legislation can end the neoliberal rural practice of marginalization policy makers must begin with the recognition that the problematic practices of ruralism exist.</em></strong>  <br />
<strong><em>Bassett 03</em></strong>  <br />
