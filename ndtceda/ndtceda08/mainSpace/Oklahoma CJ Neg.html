Our contention is at the roots of the exceptionalist attitude can be traced backed to the desire to deny personal, cultural and national responsibility for the atrocities committed against indigenous peoples at home. This attitude is necessary to for the continuation of imperial slaughter, and should be avoided and disavowed.<br />

The indigenous people of this land are the quintessential American other. Their control by the government is an exercise of plenary power that is responsible for 500 years of genocide and exploitation. This same power is now invoked to justify the detainment and torture of thousands at Guantanamo bay and other secret secret prisons<br />

CP: different grounds<br />
The United States Supreme Court should overrule Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey by ruling that the parental consent, informed consent, waiting period, and record keeping requirements are unconstitutional because they violate a woman’s right to avoid being forced into an identity.<br />
Abortion should not be seen as a “fundamental” right that women exercise in defining their identity, but rather as the refusal of identities that are forced onto women as a result of pregnancy. The aff’s politics reinforces the same “fundamental” conception of women that posits them as baby makers. Only the CP solves.<br />
Rubenfeld, 89 [“The Right of privacy,” 102 Harv. L. Rev. 737]<br />
“We must reject the personhood…privacy advanced in what follows.”<br />
In the quest to achieve an “explicitly defined civil identity” for women, the affirmative misunderstands the potential of privacy to guarantee the reproductive rights the 1AC seeks. The extension of rights based on sex falls prey to what Foucault called the repressed hypothesis. It assumes that oppression of women is based on upon them being an “Other” in masculinist society and that by attaching rights to sex, we can adequately address the unique situation of pregnancy and female sexuality. This approach is a strategy of power that categorizes and essentializes the sexes, justifying control.<br />
Rubenfeld 89<br />
“Foucault’s History of Sexuality…which personhood lays claim.”<br />
And we’ll pre empt the spin they’ll give in the 2AC about how they are a new &amp; different form of selfhood. Caldwell assumes that we can avoid the liberal notion of the autonomous self by recognizing that “social relationships shape subjectivity.” However, both the liberal conception of selfhood &amp; their republican conception fail to account for the multiplicity of identities inherent in the self. The aff’s sexuate rights impose stable identity categories upon women, facilitating biopolitical control.<br />
Rubenfeld 89<br />
“It is for this reason…embraces neither alternative.”<br />
The right to privacy refers to reproductive liberty as simply a matter of choice, which obscures the socioeconomic realities of women, masking the denial of access to aborrtiion for poor women and women of color. The aff confines abortion rights to the individual.<br />
Solinger, 2k1 [<u>Beggars and Choosers: How the Politics of Choice Shapes Adoption, Abortion, and Welfare in the United States</u>, p. 21-2]<br />
“Poor mothers caught…cost of that shortsightedness.”<br />
This turns the case.<br />
Walker 98 [Philosophy and the Maternal Body: Reading Silence]<br />
“If women’s resistance to patriarchal…potential female difference.”<br />
Their conception of the self is hijacked by the right for law &amp; order &amp; medical interventions. Also, affirms the Cartesian mind body split<br />

Reinscribing difference reaffirms the hierarchy &amp; alienation that root the aff harms, while CP, enabling a challenge to all social hierarchy, attacks the systemic causes of sex/gender bias by radically confronting the ability of law to define experience<br />
Gabel 84 [62 Tex. L. Rev. 1563]<br />
“The kind of disalienating experiences…constituted as social beings.”<br />
Their use of Irigaray’s radical conception of gender difference presumes a foundational oppression that actively erases other oppressions<br />
Felski, 2k [<u>Provoking Feminisms</u>, p. 77-78]<br />
“To equate ‘difference’…class and race hierarchies.”<br />
The aff will never arrive at Caldwell’s ‘fluid politics’ or ‘politics of becoming.’ Irigaray’s desire for an alterity within the law not predicated on binary logic is defeated by her own equally strong desire for a positive, ontologically stable site for ‘woman’<br />

Desegregation makes people of color commodities in the marketplace.<br />

<u><strong>Stanfield,</strong></u> Journal of Negro education v. 51 #2 p.97 <strong><u>1982</u></strong><br />
<br />
&quot;The desegregation and resegregation...it does not disappear&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The narrative of the coherent nation continues today in desegregation debates. The urban area is seen as unpredictable and unstable---an area of fractured and subjugated identities that do not contribute to the vitality of the nation. As the nation continually faces the threat of incoherence and instability, it moves to include the urban area, primarily at the level of the local school. Here, national leaders are able to transform these various identities into “American” ones and once again, save the nation from certain doom.<br />

<br />
Our argument is called the Fox News Exclusive<br />
<br />
The modern age is characterized by a disavowal of tragedy. The triumph of Socratic reason manifests in our attempt to resolve the chaotic aspects of life and avoid suffering. This requires the construction of an ideal “Real” world toward which our apparent world aspires. Enter the affirmative. In the modern drive toward certainty and security and in an attempt at renouncing disorder and insecurity, the plan labors to mold and order the world ot make it dupilicate our idealized image of order<br />

According to Nietzsche, the philosophical foundation…philosophical principle of modernity<br />
<br />
The affirmative will always be able to locate some external threat to world order. It is not a coincidence that Breaking News occurs every fifteen minutes because einternational politics are unpredictable. The insecurities cited by the affirmative are not unique; international terrorism is an neighborhoods and there might just be poison in our children’s Halloween candy. The uncomfortable yet irresistible truth is that uncertainty and risk art part and parcel of human life. Rather than coming to terms with this, the affirmative encourages us to stay glued to the television screen, stocking up on duct tape and water. At issue here is not just life itself but what makes life valuable. We encourage indifference and carelessness in a world inherently characterized by insecurity in an attempt to reclaim joy from the affirmative’s world of paranoid tiptoeing.<br />

The aff substitutes moralizing for true change. Their effort to establish racism as morally heinous in the law fixes the identities of both the perpetrator and victim, legitimizing law and cleansing it of its role in subordination. This fails to contest overall regimes of domination.<br />

The aff’s privileging of the public sphere effaces spatial and temporal differences of modern poltics. Disenfranchised people are not looking for some place to engage in democratic politics, but are responding in their own life-worlds to the pressures of normalization of economic exploration.

Visual metaphors invest the law in a phenomonology of sight. This turns the case. Visuality alienates and abstracts, it is ahistorical and objective. It presumes a detached, timeless and static law which governs universally and occludes particularity. In other words, the law’s association with sight is responsible for its inflexibility and its distance from all things human.<br />

We call our argument antigone’s tomb<br />
Antigone is sentenced to death by her brother and is locked away in a tomb to await such a fate. This is how the aff understands the terrorist – kept out of sight and under the radar, detained without reason to the law’s private underbelly<br />
Compelled by compassion’s compulsion, the aff is determined to rescue Antigone from her tomb, to claim the terrorist for American liberalism. Though seemingly radical, the politics of the affirmative remain conservative insofar as the aff is justified in terms of a future wherein the human is expanded to include in the public sphere those previously restricted access. This logic of inclusion and the future to which it pledges allegiance only replicate the same social structures of intelligibility which, but virtue of their nature, must continue to identify and eliminate queerness<br />
EDELMAN, lee, no future: queer theory and the death drive, 2004 [p. 103-105]<br />
<br />
Such a strategy on the part of the excluded may well gain them access to the public sphere, but it does so only by shifting the burden of figuring queerness onto some other identity. Furthermore, the liberal sentimentality of the aff suggests that there exists a place in society for queers, so long as they sacrifice their queerness, demystifying their identities, and assuming their proper place in the social order. In any case, the fantasy of the a future that animates the aff’s politics necessitates the sacrifice of the queer<br />
EDELMAN again [27-28] assimilation and displacement argument<br />
<br />
It is easy, in the midst of the brutality and lawlessness of the bush administration to call for law to restore some sense of stability. This call, however, is precisely what makes torture and concentration camps acceptable. The extension of token constitutional rights only dresses up the war on terrorism and the rights themselves become tools in further panoptic control.<br />
ROSS, Daniel, violent democracy, 2004 [p.142-143]<br />
<br />
The aff may resurrect antigone, however the tomb itself remains as a repository for whatever that which remains unintelligible. Their faith in the politics of inclusion seemingly transforms the social order but it does so while reaffirming the idea that the social must be ordered in the first place. In seeking legitimacy from the public sphere, the aff legitimizes the authority of institutional legitimation. This implicitly sanctions violence against those who persist outside of public recognition<br />
EDELMAN 105<br />
<br />
The alternative is to refuse the affirmative’s call to be integrated into the social order. Instead, we should accede to the figure of the queer as the limit of intelligibility. Doing so displaces the fidelity to the future that requires the elimination of difference in order to survive. Furthermore, it exposes the violence which sustains the social and shatters the fantasy which maintains it.<br />

<br />
1. Omission is deadly—in their effort to publicize the deaths of victims of US imperialism abroad they omit any consideration of the lives made unlivable tht they might be able to speak to us today. The aff devotes itself to a pet project while leaving more fndamental questions unresolved. Where are we? How did we get here? The 1ac fails to answer these questions and the question posed by Quirin. This abandonment of politics betrays a fundamental complicity on the part of the affirmative. They theorize identity, discourse, relationality but fail to come to terms with a prior material issue: we are and remain occupants of stolen land. Complicity guarantees that the aff can only reaffirm existing colonial structures.<br />
<br />
Ward Churchill, <em>From a Native Son</em>, 1996, p. 520-521<br />
<br />
2. The patterns of abuse documented by the aff in the WOT are only extensions of domestic experiments in imperialism gone horribly correct. The violence of the Bush administration is informed by the logic of colonialism that began in 1492 and continues in the hearts and minds of even seemingly radical political projects like the aff so long as they remain indebted to a system of colonialism which privileges academics at the expense of natives.<br />

<br />
3. Given the aff’s negligence, our alt is to prioritize land return 1st. this must come before engaging the aff, which abandons political questions in favor of theoretical gestures which only comfort cushions on which colonialism rests. Liberation of native land makes possible all other political struggles. Absent this priority, those other struggles only remake structures of domination which make possible the conditions the aff criticizes. The focus of social energy must be first and foremost “US off the planet.”<br />
<br />
Ward Churchill, <em>From a Native Son</em>, 1996, p. 524-525<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The aff is not a revolutionary rethinking of political conditions but the same old tired theorizing of identity and relationality which conveniently omits any consideration of the material forces that write people out of existence. The aff is a false start—their analyses of the discourses surrounding the WOT obscure a criticism of material conditions which makes war on differences inevitable.<br />

<br />
Only such a reprioritization is capable of addressing, in any material way, international violence waged by the U.S. The violence done by the American nation state demands of us real political interventions that require real sacrifices. In a world where Bush declares openly that you are with us or against us, we should take him at his word. There is no third option—Americans may take up their historical responsibility for coming to terms with and preventing the violence carried out in their names, or they can remain complicit with the privilege that that violence affords them, trivializing politics to a matter of media analysis so as to ensure that the system remains the same.<br />
