A Guinean told IRIN...of global capitalism.<br />
<br />
The drive for hegemonic imperialism is inevitable according to the logic of capitalism--only the alternative avoids multiple scenarios for inevitable extinction.<br />
Foster 2005 (John Bellamy, Monthly Review, September, Vol 57, Iss 4, &quot;Naked Imperialism&quot;)<br />
From the longer view...the new naked imperialism.<br />
<br />
Out alternative is to not do the aff--capitalist relations should be withdrawn from and rejected, we must stop participating in rescue operations for capital<br />

Demon Engine<br />
<br />
The modern agricultural system is bankrupt—mechanized production and slavery to the notion of “progress” have lead to all sorts of ills, from the destruction of the biosphere to the emptying out of meaning from our lives—liberation is impossible without the dissolution of agriculture itself!<br />
<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
“Food has been one of our most direct contacts with the natural<br />
environment … is impossible without its dissolution.”<br />
<br />
<br />
The modern American agricultural system is particularly indefensible—this is the same industry that the affirmative attempts to “correct”—this is in fact impossible, because the harms of the status quo are rooted in something much deeper than subsidies, but the technological imperative of civilization itself<br />
<br />
Zerzan 1998 (John, “Agriculture: Demon Engine of Civilization” <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt" rel="nofollow">http://imperium.lenin.ru/~kaledin/tmp/agricltr.txt</a>)<br />
“Today the organic, what is left of it, is fully mechanized … accelerating the crime against nature.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Civilization only exists because we have come to believe in its inevitability—this is tragic because civilization was a mistake. It is bound to collapse, and our critique is necessary to begin readapting to the way that humans lived for 99% of their existence, otherwise we can just be ignorant of the coming universal biological holocaust<br />
<br />
Heinberg 1995 (Richard, “The Primitivist Critique of Civilization, presented at the 24th annual meeting of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm" rel="nofollow">http://insurgentdesire.org.uk/civilization.htm</a>)<br />
“Isn't civilization simply the inevitable expression of the evolutionary urge … think of this process as &quot;getting back on track.&quot;”<br />
<br />
There is no universal social model for primitivism—we can only hope to build momentum towards the end of civilization, because every manifestation of civilization is a usurpation of freedom!<br />
<br />

To put it another way, what all civilized societies have in common … journey into the unknown that is freedom.”<br />
