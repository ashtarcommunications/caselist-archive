Round d 4: UT-Dallas Affirmative Cites<br />
<strong>1AC: Plan:</strong> The United States federal government should offer the government of Afghanistan an increase in judicial reform assistance if the government of Afghanistan reverses the conviction of Sayed Parwez Kambakhsh. We’ll clarify.<br />
<strong>Contention 1: Guilty</strong><br />
1) Afghan journalist Sayed PAwez Kambakshs was sentenced to death for distributing an article deemed insulting to Islam. However, the conviction was fabricated and Kambakhsh was denied rights.<br />
Blair, 2008. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/23/wafghan223.xml" rel="nofollow">Telegraph.co.uk/news/main .jhtml?xml=/news/2008/01/23 /wafghan223.xml</a><br />
“The Taliban-style intimidation…to stifle press criticism.”<br />
2) The refusal resolve Kambakhsh’s kills the war on terro in Afghanistan<br />
West ’08. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://townhall.com/columnists/DianaWest/2008/02/01/little_stated_in_final_union_address" rel="nofollow">Townhall.com/columnists /DianaWest/2008/02/01/little _stated_in_final_union_address</a><br />
“Among the principles Bush…than with our own.”<br />
3) the impact is nuclear war<br />
Kavanagh 2007. “We need to win hearts and minds at home too” via lexis<br />
“If we allow them…virulent spread of terror.”<br />
4) We don’t have to win that the Taliban actually comes back to power—failure to reverse this precedent will cause the current regime to revert to equally repressive tactics<br />
MacKenzie 2008. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=16776" rel="nofollow">Nationalinterest.org/Article .aspx?id=16776</a><br />
“What is at stake here…is the point?”<br />
5) Upholding Kambakhsh’s conviction will hinder democratic development in Afghanistan<br />
Constable 2008.<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/14/AR2008021403583.html" rel="nofollow">Washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn /content/article/2008/02/14 /AR2008021403583.html</a><br />
“As many younger, educated…still have power,’ he said.”<br />
6) Afghanistan democracy is to Central Asian stability and global democracy promotion.<br />
Rhinefeld 2006.<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTFDoc?AD=ADA445561&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf" rel="nofollow">Stinet.dtic.mil/cgi-bin /GetTFDoc?AD=ADA445561&amp;Location =U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf</a><br />
“The success or failure…individual state actor.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7) Central Asian instability spurs nuclear war.<br />
Starr ’01 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://caciananalyst.org/Publications/Starr_Testimony.htm" rel="nofollow">caciananalyst.org/Publications /Starr_Testimony.htm</a><br />
“however, this does not…U.S. cannot ignore.”<br />
8) Democracy solves Extinction<br />
Diamond 95 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc/pubs/di/fr.html" rel="nofollow">wwics.si.edu/subsites/ccpdc /pubs/di/fr.html</a><br />
“This hardly exhausts…prosperity can be built”<br />
9) Democratic consolidation is on the brink—a new wave of democracy is key<br />
Diamond 2008. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/democracy_in_retreat.html" rel="nofollow">realclearpolitics.com/articles /2008/03/democracy_in_retreat .html</a><br />
“The international donor…that it really is.”<br />
10) upholding the conviction will negatively implicate free speech throughout Afghanistan<br />
Gardesh 2008.<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://iwpr.net/?p=%3Cp%3ENo%20item%20found%3C/p%3E&amp;s=f&amp;o=342144&amp;apc_state=henh" rel="nofollow">Iwpr.net/?p=%3Cp%3ENo%20item %20found%3C/p%3E&amp;s=f&amp;o=342144 &amp;apc_state=henh</a><br />
“Haroon Najafizada…who defended Kambakhsh.”<br />
11) Even seemingly trivial violations of speech embark down a slipper-slope towards genocide and escalating conflict—the root cause of war is seemingly innocuous suppression of speech<br />
D’Souza 96. Europal.europa.eu/hearings/19960425/droi /freedom_en.htm<br />
“In the absence of freedom…at every turn.”<br />
12) no hippie crap—terrorism is legitimized if we do nothing about non-democratic law.<br />
West ’08. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://townhall.com/columnists/DianaWest/2008/01/19/frank_talk_about_islamic_law_blashphemy" rel="nofollow">townhall.com/columnists /DianaWest/2008/01/19/frank _talk_about_islamic_law _blashphemy</a>!<br />
“Ring a bell?...become the new blasphemy.”<br />
<strong>Contention 2: Solvency</strong><br />
1) The trial is a key signal in the future of a democratic Afghanistan—the US must do whatever it can reverse the decision.<br />
Press-Enterprise ’08. February 2, “Extreme injustice,” Lexis.<br />
“the strain of justice…this young journalist.”<br />
2) The US is providing judicial reform aid now, but the government needs more assistance<br />
Gollust 2007. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://voanews.com/English/2007-12-14-voa4.cfm" rel="nofollow">voanews.com/English/2007-12-14 -voa4.cfm</a><br />
“Though UN agencies…Afghan judical reform”<br />
3) And, only Karzai can bypass the courts<br />
Starkey 2008.<br />
<a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/karzai-vows-justice-will-be-done-in-the-right-way-for-pervez-779793.html" rel="nofollow">Independent.co.uk/news/world /asia/karzai-vows-justice-will -be-done-in-the-right-way-for -pervez-779793.html</a><br />
“Mr Karzai insisted…can be carried out.”<br />
4) The US should condition aid on reversing Kambakhsh’s conviction—solves all our impacts<br />
Brown 2008. <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://frontpagemagazine.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=49ED6CC4-AC67-4989-B816-4A0EA66F6801" rel="nofollow">Frontpagemagazine.com/Articles /Read.aspx?GUID=49ED6CC4-AC67 -4989-B816-4A0EA66F6801</a><br />
“Afghanistan is reputed to be an ally… promote this end.”<br />
5) Karzai is wavering now—the plan persuades causes him to say yes<br />
Brossell ’08 <a class="wiki_link_ext" href="http://fm4.orf.at/chris/221569" rel="nofollow">fm4.orf.at/chris/221569</a><br />
“The sentence has been approved…big taboo in Afghanistan.”<br />

Absent capitalism theres extinction<br />

<br />
Assad disad<br />
Assad cant be taken out of power – its mission impossible<br />

Assad is Teflon<br />
Orweis 2006 “syria’s assad targets opposition”<br />
